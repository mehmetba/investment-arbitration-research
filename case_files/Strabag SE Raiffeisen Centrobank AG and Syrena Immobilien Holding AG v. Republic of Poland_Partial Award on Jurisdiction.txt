vvveeder@londonarbitrators.net.

The Tribunal was properly constituted on 23 December 2014. (The Parties’
agreement to such effect was made without prejudice to the Respondent’s objections

to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.)

The Administering Institution

By emails of 18 and 20 March 2015, the Parties confirmed their agreement to designate
the Secretariat of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes
(“ICSID”) as the administering authority. ICSID renders full administrative services in
relation to this ad hoc arbitration, in accordance with the terms set forth in the Secretary-

General’s letters of 17 and 23 March 2015.

The Secretary of the Tribunal

Further to the designation of ICSID as administering authority in this matter, Ms

Legal Place or Seat of the Arbitration

The place and the seat of this arbitration is Paris, France (as agreed by the Parties).

Language

The language of the proceeding is English (as agreed by the Parties).

The Arbitration Agreement (as supplemented)

Article 8 (“Settlement of Investment disputes”) of the Agreement between the Republic
of Austria and the Polish People’s Republic concerning the Encouragement and
Protection of Investments of 24 November 1988 (the “Treaty’”) provides in material

part as follows (translated into English):

(1) If disputes should arise between one Contracting State and
an investor from the other Contracting Party with regard to an
investment, such disputes shall be resolved amicably between the
parties themselves if possible. If such amicable resolution is not
possible, then the investor shall exhaust all relevant domestic
administrative and judicial remedies.

(2) If such a dispute cannot be settled in a manner provided for
in paragraph I within 12 months from written notification of
adequately specified claims, it shall at the request of the
Contracting Party or of the investor from the other Contracting
Party, be submitted for composition or arbitration: ...

(b) to an international arbitral tribunal, if either of the
Contracting Parties is not a signatory to the Convention on the
Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and nationals
of other States. The international arbitral tribunal shall be
constituted on an ad hoc basis in the following manner: each
side shall appoint an arbitrator, and these arbitrators shall
agree on a chairman, who shall be a national of a third State.
The arbitrators shall be appointed within two months from the
date on which the investors ha[ve] notified the other Contracting
Party of his desire to submit the dispute to an arbitral tribunal
and the chairman within a further two months. ...

The Claimants invoked Article 8 in their Request for Arbitration. The Claimants
contend that through submitting such Request for Arbitration, they consented in writing
to arbitration on the terms offered by the Respondent in Article 8 of the Treaty. The

Claimants also contend that written notification of adequately specified claims was

Part I - Page 5

1.19.

1.20.

1.21.

1.22.

1.23.

provided to Poland on 19 December 2012 (the “Notice”) and that, consequently, more
than one year had passed in which the Parties’ dispute could not be settled in a manner

provided by Article 8(1) of the Treaty.

This arbitration is also to be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the
Tribunal’s Procedural Order No 1 dated 9 July 2015, whereby Article 8 of the Treaty
was materially supplemented by agreement of the Parties (as described later in this
Award). Further, if any question of procedure arose which was not covered by
Procedural Order No 1, the Tribunal was to decide the question. The Tribunal could
seek guidance from (but was not bound by) the 1965 Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States (the “ICSID
Convention”) and the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules, in force as of April
2006 (the “ICSID Additional Facility Rules”).

The Arbitral Procedure

To commence this arbitration, as already indicated, the Claimants served upon the
Respondent a Request for Arbitration dated 9 September 2014, accompanied by a copy
of the Treaty.

In the Request for Arbitration, the Claimants referenced the Treaty’s provision
governing the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment. Article

8(2)(b) of the Treaty provides in relevant part:

The international arbitral tribunal shall be constituted on an ad
hoc basis in the following manner: each side shall appoint an
arbitrator, and these arbitrators shall agree on a chairman, who
shall be a national of a third State. The arbitrators shall be
appointed within two months from the date on which the
investors ha[ve] notified the other Contracting Party of his
desire to submit the dispute to an arbitral tribunal and the
chairman within further two months.

In accordance with this procedure, the Claimants jointly appointed Professor Karl-

Heinz Béckstiegel to serve as arbitrator.

On 10 November 2014, the Respondent served upon the Claimants its Answer to the
Request for Arbitration (the “Answer”). In the Answer, the Respondent appointed

Professor Albert Jan van den Berg to serve as arbitrator.

1.29.

As contemplated in Article 8(2)(b) of the Treaty, Professors Béckstiegel and van den
Berg consulted with the Parties regarding the appointment of the President of the
Tribunal. They subsequently agreed to appoint Mr. V.V. Veeder to serve as the
President. With all members appointed, the Tribunal was constituted on 23 December

2014.

By correspondence of 29 December 2014 and 4 January 2015, the Tribunal invited the
Parties’ proposals regarding the initial procedural steps, including the format of the first

procedural conference and the content of the first procedural order.

By joint letter of 9 February 2015, the Parties responded to the Tribunal’s invitation,
and provided the Tribunal with a draft procedural order containing proposed procedural
tules to govern the arbitration. The Parties agreed on most issues, but identified a

limited number of disputed matters for resolution by the Tribunal.

After further consultation with the Parties, the Tribunal scheduled the first procedural
meeting by telephone conference on 13 March 2015. It provided the Parties with an
agenda for the meeting. The Tribunal invited each Party’s observations on three agenda
items: the legal place of arbitration, the potential for revision of the Award under the
ICSID Convention, and the Tribunal’s financial terms. On 6 March 2015, each Party
submitted comments on these items. On 10 March 2015, the Tribunal circulated an

updated agenda for the procedural meeting.

The Tribunal held this first procedural meeting by telephone conference with the Parties
as scheduled on 13 March 2015. During the meeting, the Tribunal and the Parties
discussed the agenda items, including the Parties’ proposed procedural order, the order
and scope of written submissions, and the overall procedural timetable. They also

agreed that ICSID would serve as the administering authority for the arbitration.

Following the first procedural meeting, by correspondence of the same day, the
Tribunal (a) confirmed the Parties’ agreement that the arbitration would be “bifurcated”
as between a first jurisdictional phase and a second merits phase; (b) reserved the
question of “trifurcation” (i.e. splitting the merits phase into a separate liability phase
followed by a separate quantum phase) to be addressed at a later appropriate date; and
(c) decided that the next memorial would be submitted by the Respondent, pleading its

jurisdictional objections to the Claimants’ claims set out in the Request for Arbitration.

1.33.

1.34.

The Tribunal also invited the Parties’ proposals as to the precise deadlines for the

pleadings to be submitted in the jurisdictional phase.

By letter of 17 March 2015, the Secretary-General of ICSID informed the Parties that
ICSID would be pleased to provide full administrative services, comparable to those
provided in ICSID cases. After receiving both Parties’ written agreement, the Secretary-

General confirmed the arrangement by letter of 23 March 2015.

By joint letter of 27 March 2015, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had reached
an agreement on a timetable for written pleadings to be submitted in the jurisdictional
phase. The Parties also stated that they agreed to Paris, France as the legal place of the

arbitration.

On 18 May 2015, the Tribunal provided the Parties with a draft of Procedural Order
No | and invited the Parties to confer and submit any written comments they had
relating to the draft. Each side submitted comments on 1 June 2015 and then
supplemented its comments on 2 June 2015. After considering those responses, on
4 June 2015, the Tribunal provided the Parties with a final draft order for their review
and approval. The Parties submitted additional comments on 19 June 2015, and the
Tribunal prepared a revised final draft of Procedural Order No 1 for the Parties’
approval. On 3 July 2015, each side confirmed that it had no further substantive

comments on the draft.

On 7 July 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 1, governing the arbitral
procedure. Given the ad hoc nature of the proceeding, Procedural Order No | provided
tules on matters such as the powers of the Tribunal and the procedure for challenging a
member; settlement and discontinuance; the content of awards; and the procedure for
requesting supplementary decisions, rectification or interpretation of an award.
Regarding the applicable law, Procedural Order No 1 provided that “the Tribunal shall
apply the law determined by the conflict of laws rules which it considers applicable and

such rules of international law and treaties as the Tribunal considers applicable”.

Procedural Order No | also addressed the financial administration of the arbitration. As
agreed by the members of the Tribunal and the Parties, Procedural Order No | stipulated
that the fees and expenses of each member of the Tribunal would be paid in accordance

with the ICSID Schedule of Fees and the Memorandum on Fees and Expenses of ICSID

Part I - Page 8

Arbitrators (USD 375 per hour). Such fees were to be paid out of advance payments

made by the Parties to ICSID in equal parts (as to the two sides).

Also on 7 July 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 2, instructing the Parties
to make the initial advance payment, which ICSID had requested by letter of 18 May
2015. Both sides subsequently made the requested payment.

On 27 July 2015, the Respondent filed its Jurisdictional Memorial, including a
Chronology, a Dramatis Personae, Exhibits R-0002 to R-0022, and Legal Authorities
RL-0001 to RL-0021 (“Jur. Memorial”).

On 7 December 2015, the Claimants submitted their Jurisdictional Counter-Memorial,
including the Expert Report of Professor Andrzej Kubas (CE-01) (with Exhibits CE-01-
1 to CE-01-34); the Expert Report of Judge Bruno Simma (CE-02); Exhibits C-0001
through C-0043; and Legal Authorities CL-0001 to CL-0012 (“Jur. CM”).

By letter of 29 January 2016, the Claimants informed the Tribunal of recent
developments in a proceeding initiated by Strabag against the City of Warsaw in the
Warsaw Regional Court: the Court had decided to reject Strabag’s claim without
prejudice, and Strabag was appealing that decision. The Claimants stated their
willingness to submit the court documents related to these developments. On
17 February 2016, upon the invitation of the Tribunal, the Respondent filed comments
on the Claimants’ letter. The Respondent reserved its right to provide further
observations in its next written pleading, and to that end, stated that if “the Claimants
intend to submit any documents which they consider relevant in this regard, they are
requested to do this as soon as possible, so that the Respondent can duly take them into

account”.

On 22 February 2016, the Claimants requested the Tribunal’s permission to file the
court documents from these Polish legal proceedings. On 26 February 2016, the
Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 3, in which it granted the Claimants’ request and
instructed the Claimants to submit the documents as soon as practicable, but no later

than 4 March 2016.

In accordance with Procedural Order No 3, on 3 March 2016, the Claimants filed these
court documents as Exhibits CL-0044 to CL-0050.

On 7 March 2016, the Respondent filed its Jurisdictional Reply Memorial, including
Exhibits R-0023 to R-0037 and Legal Authorities RL-0023 to RL-0044 (“Jur. Reply”).
In paragraph 64 of this submission, the Respondent requested that Judge Simma be
precluded from acting in these proceedings and that the Tribunal disregard his expert

report.

On 7 June 2016, the Claimants filed their Jurisdictional Rejoinder Memorial, including
Exhibits C-0051 to C-0059 and Legal Authorities CL-0013 through CL-0020 (“Jur.
Rejoinder”).

By email of 16 June 2016, the Claimants requested an adjournment of the hearing on
jurisdiction scheduled to take place on 15 and 16 December 2016, in light of the
pregnancy of one of the Claimants’ representatives. The Claimants noted that they had
informed the Respondent in advance of this request and that the Respondent did not

object.

The Tribunal responded the same day to inform the Parties that, in light of the
circumstances, it had no objection to rescheduling the hearing. After consulting the
Parties regarding their availability for the rescheduled hearing, on 11 July 2016, the
Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 4, which confirmed that the rescheduled hearing

would be held from 7 to 9 June 2017.

In advance of the rescheduled hearing, on 20 April 2017, the Tribunal wrote to the
Parties to organise a pre-hearing organisational meeting by telephone conference in

early May 2017.

By joint letter of 21 April 2017, the Parties informed the Tribunal of further
developments in the domestic court proceedings: upon Strabag’s appeal, the Warsaw
Court of Appeal had modified the Regional Court’s prior decision. The ruling was
attached as Exhibit R-0038.

On 5 May 2017, the Respondent, through the Office of the General Counsel to the
Republic of Poland, notified the Tribunal that the Respondent intended to raise an
additional jurisdictional objection relating to the law of the European Union (“EU”).
The Respondent referenced Case C-284/16 Slowakische Republik v Achmea BV

(“Achmea”), pending before the European Court of Justice (the “CJEU”). In connection

Part I — Page 10

1.48.

1.49.

1.50.

1.51.

1.52.

with this new objection, the Respondent made two procedural proposals: (a) a further
exchange of written pleadings between the Parties, and (b) an adjournment of the
hearing on jurisdiction scheduled to take place in June. Regarding the timing of its
objection, the Respondent stated that it could not have raised the objection sooner
because its Jurisdictional Reply Memorial was submitted on 7 March 2016, before the

German Federal Court had referred Achmea to the CJEU on 23 May 2016.

On 6 May 2017, the Tribunal invited the Claimants to respond as soon as possible
regarding the Respondent’s two procedural proposals. The Claimants responded on
8 May 2017, arguing that: (a) a further exchange of submissions on jurisdiction “would
at least be premature”, and (b) the Respondent’s proposal to postpone the hearing would
be disruptive and cause substantial delay. The Claimants also stated that the Respondent

could have raised this further jurisdictional objection earlier.

At the same time, the Claimants raised a separate issue, related to the Share Purchase
Agreement submitted as Exhibit R-0002. The Claimants stated that this exhibit was
incomplete, as it did not include certain resolutions and decisions referred to in the
Share Purchase Agreement. The Claimants attached these documents to their letter of

8 May 2017 as Exhibits C-0060 to C-0069.

On 8 May 2017, the Tribunal confirmed that the President would hold a pre-hearing
procedural meeting by telephone conference with the Parties on 10 May 2017. The
Tribunal provided the Parties with a draft agenda for the meeting, which indicated that
the President and the Parties would address several issues relating to the hearing

organization, as well as the Parties’ letters of 6 and 8 May 2017.

The President held the pre-hearing meeting with the Parties on 10 May 2017. During
the meeting, the Parties consented to holding the hearing on jurisdiction on the
scheduled dates. It was further agreed that, during the hearing, the Parties would offer
their respective proposals for the scope and timing of their post-hearing submissions
concerning the Respondent’s new jurisdictional objection, and that they would not

address at the hearing the substance of the objection.

During the pre-hearing meeting, the Respondent indicated that it did not wish to call
either of the Claimants’ expert witnesses for cross-examination. The President and the

Claimants confirmed that this decision would not be deemed an admission or

Part I — Page 11

acceptance of the testimony of either expert, and that the Respondent’s decision was
without prejudice to its objection to the involvement of Judge Bruno Simma as an
expert witness in the arbitration (raised in the Jur. Reply). The Respondent confirmed

its decision in writing on 17 May 2017.

1.53. Also during the pre-hearing meeting, the Claimants were asked to state whether their
submission of Exhibits C-0060 to C-0069 was an indication that they intended to raise
new factual allegations. The Claimants responded to this question in writing on 15 May
2017, confirming that they did not intend to make additional allegations. The Claimants
argued that the documents related to certain of their prior allegations. The Respondent
addressed this matter in its letter of 17 May 2017, arguing that it remained unclear what
facts the Claimants intended to prove with the new documents. In any event, the
Respondent stated that it would leave the question of whether to admit those documents

to the Tribunal’s discretion.

1.54. On 23 May 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 5, instructing the Parties to

make a second advance payment, which both sides subsequently made to ICSID.

1.55. On 25 May 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 6, governing the
organisation of the hearing on jurisdiction on 7 and 8 June 2017. It also contained the

Tribunal’s decision to admit Exhibits C-0060 to C-0069 into the record.

1.56. The oral hearing on jurisdiction took place at the World Bank in Paris on 7 and 8 June
2017 (the “Hearing”). The Hearing was recorded by a verbatim transcript, later

corrected jointly by the Parties.* The following persons were present at the Hearing:

At the close of the Hearing, the Tribunal and the Parties discussed various procedural
matters, including the procedure for correcting the transcript, the preparation of a joint

consolidated timeline, and the scope of any post-hearing submissions.

Following the Hearing, on 13 June 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 7
recording the consensus between the Parties on these matters. With regard to the scope
of post-hearing submissions, Procedural Order No 7 provided that the Parties could
include their rebuttal to the oral arguments raised by the other Party during the Hearing
(including any matters raised by the Tribunal), as well as their arguments on the
Respondent’s new jurisdictional objection relating to Achmea. The Parties were also
instructed to confirm their positions on the document prepared by Judge Simma and

submitted by Claimants with their Jurisdictional Counter-Memorial.

On 30 June 2017, the Parties submitted to the Tribunal their agreed corrections to the
Hearing transcript, which the Tribunal subsequently confirmed. The court reporter
entered the corrections into the transcript and provided the Tribunal and the Parties with

the final Hearing transcript on 10 July 2017.

On 29 August 2017, the Parties submitted their joint consolidated timeline of relevant

events (including their respective comments on those events).

On 19 September 2017, Advocate-General Wathelet delivered his Opinion on the
questions before the CJEU in Achmea (the “Achmea Opinion”).

On 10 October 2017, each Party submitted its first post-hearing brief. The Respondent’s
Post-Hearing Brief (“R-PHB”) was accompanied by Legal Authorities RL-0045 to RL-
0080. The Claimants’ Post-Hearing Brief (“C-PHB”) was not accompanied by
additional Legal Authorities.

In accordance with Procedural Order No 7, each Party commented in its PHB on the
status of the document prepared by Judge Simma. The Parties agreed to consider it as

part of the Claimants’ submission.

On 11 December 2017, the Respondent submitted its Reply Post-Hearing Brief
(“R-RPHB”) and the Claimants submitted their Reply Post-Hearing Brief (““C-RPHB”).

On 6 March 2018, the CJEU issued its judgment in Achmea (the “Achmea Judgment”).
Considering the Parties’ previous submissions on Achmea in the context of the
Respondent’s jurisdictional objections, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit brief
written observations on the Achmea Judgment. The Tribunal noted that it would issue

further instructions after reviewing the Parties’ observations.

On 16 April 2018, the Parties simultaneously filed their Observations on the Achmea

Judgment.

On 23 April 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it had reviewed the Parties’
Observations on the Achmea Judgment and determined that it would be useful to give
each side an opportunity to respond to the other side’s submissions. The Parties were

invited to submit a brief written response of no more than ten pages by 15 May 2018.

Pursuant to the Tribunal’s invitation, the Parties simultaneously filed their Replies on

the Achmea Judgment on 15 May 2018.

On 15 October 2018, the European Commission (the “Commission”) submitted to the
Tribunal an Application to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party. The Commission
proposed to intervene on the subject of the legal consequences of the Achmea Judgment

for the present proceeding.

On the following day, the Secretary of the Tribunal transmitted the Commission’s
Application to the Parties and, on behalf of the Tribunal, invited the Parties to comment

on the Application.

On 30 October 2018, the Parties filed their observations on the Commission’s
Application to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party. The Claimants opposed the
Application, while the Respondent supported it.

On 2 November 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 8, addressing the
Commission’s Application. The Tribunal decided to grant the Commission leave to file
a single written submission limited in scope to the legal consequence of the Achmea
Judgment. Given this limited scope, the Tribunal did not consider it necessary to grant
the Commission access to any documents in the proceeding. The Tribunal instructed
the Commission to file the submission within 30 days. It also set a schedule for the
Parties’ observations, inviting the Respondent to submit its observations on the
Commission’s submission by 1 January 2019 and the Claimants to submit their
observations on the Commission’s submission and the Respondent’s observations by |

February 2019.

The President of the Tribunal informed the Commission of the Tribunal’s orders by

letter of 2 November 2018.
On 30 November 2018, the Commission submitted its Amicus Curiae Brief.

On 1 January 2019, the Respondent submitted its observations on the Commission’s
Amicus Curiae Brief, and on 1 February 2019, the Claimants submitted their

observations the Commission’s Amicus Curiae Brief.

Also on 1 February 2019, the Respondent sought permission from the Tribunal to
submit into the record the Declaration of the Representatives of the Governments of the
Member States of 15 January 2019 on the legal consequences of the judgment of the
Court of Justice in Achmea and on investment protection in the European Union. The
Claimants responded on 5 February 2019, asking the Tribunal to deny the Respondent’s

request.

On 8 February 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 9, in which it (a) granted
the Respondent’s request for permission to submit the declaration into the record; (b)
also admitted into the record the three other related declarations made by France,
Finland (with other States) and Hungary on 16 January 2019; (c) also admitted into the
record Opinion 1/17 of 29 January 2019 by the ECJ’s Advocate General Bot, unless the

Part I— Page 15

Parties were to object within three days; and (d) invited the Parties to present brief
written observations on the filed materials (not to exceed ten pages), with the
Respondent submitting its observations by 22 February 2019 and the Claimants
submitting their observations by 8 March 2019.

On 22 February 2019, the Respondent submitted its observations on the newly admitted

materials, and on 8 March 2019, the Claimants submitted their observations.

On 2 March 2020, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the proceeding had been
declared closed in relation to jurisdiction, in accordance with paragraph 107 of

Procedural Order No. 1.

PART IT: THE UNDERLYING DISPUTE BETWEEN THE PARTIES
Introduction

The Parties’ dispute ranges over many matters, spread over very many years. For
present purposes, the Tribunal takes the following summaries of that dispute largely
from the Claimants’ Request for Arbitration (together with their oral submissions at the
Hearing) and the Respondent’s Jurisdictional Memorial (together with its oral

submissions at the Hearing), respectively.

These summaries consist of the Parties’ allegations and not findings by the Tribunal,
albeit often citing from contemporary documentation. Moreover, these are only brief
summaries made for the purpose of providing context for this Award on Jurisdiction.
The Parties have developed their respective cases at much greater length. It should not
be assumed, because any aspect of a Party’s case is not expressly summarised below

(or elsewhere in this Award), that it has not been considered by the Tribunal.

Where an English text is cited from a document originally in Polish, the Tribunal has
used the English translations prepared by the Parties. Whilst certain of these translations

differ, none of these differences are material for present purposes.

The Claimants’ Case

In summary, the Claimants allege the following facts in support of their case under the

Treaty, as regards both the Tribunal’s jurisdiction and the merits of their claims.

In 1991, after the fall of the communist regime and based on the Polish Act of 13 July
1990 on the Privatisation of State-Owned Enterprises (the “Privatisation Act of
1990”), the City of Warsaw began to privatise the Polish company Syrena Hotels

(formerly Warszawskie Przedsiebiorstwo Turystyczne Syrena) and its assets.”

Syrena Hotels operated a number of hotels that formed an essential part of the
privatisation process. Among these hotels were the Hotel Polonia (built in 1913 and

almost undamaged during the Second World War) and the Hotel Metropol. Both hotels

are located in the centre of Warsaw on the same Plot No 39.* Plot No 39 comprised
four historical plots: Plot Nos. 1582 J, 6688, 6203 and 5988,* which had been
expropriated from their former owners by the Polish Communist regime based on a

decree dated 6 October 1945 (the “Warsaw Decree”).>
Article 20 of the Privatisation Act of 1990 provided:

Prior to transfer to third parties, the Minister of State Treasury

or the Privatization Agency decides to (1) make an analysis to

determine a legal status of a corporation's enterprise property,

in particular any third party claims against such property.®
Pursuant to the Polish Enfranchisement Act of 29 September 1990, Syrena Hotels had
acquired as of 5 December 1990 ownership of the hotel buildings and the right of
perpetual usufruct over the land upon which the hotel buildings are erected (which is
owned by the City of Warsaw).’ This acquisition was confirmed by the Board of the
Union of Districts of Warsaw in a decision of 29 June 1993 (the “Enfranchisement
Decision”).* Plot No 39 was then registered in the public land and mortgage register on

3 November 1993.

On 26 June 1991, in order to facilitate the privatisation process, the Province Governor
of the City of Warsaw issued Decision No 6817, stating that the City of Warsaw had

acquired Syrena Hotels and all its properties.?

In 1995, the City of Warsaw finalised the privatisation by preparing a public invitation
to tender for the acquisition of 80% of the shares in Syrena Hotels (the

“Municipalisation Decision”).!°

In 1996, the City of Warsaw entered into negotiations with potential buyers on the basis
of an Information Memorandum dated 15 May 1996 (the “Information

Memorandum”)!! and a Supplement to the Information Memorandum dated 9 October

1996 (the “Supplement”).!? These documents contained information prepared by the
City of Warsaw for potential buyers.!> The City of Warsaw warranted that the legal
status with regard to the Hotel Polonia and the Hotel Metropol was clear. In particular,
the documents gave an assurance that Syrena Hotels was the perpetual usufructor of the

land and the owner of the buildings located on that land.
2.12 The Information Memorandum provided as follows:'*

- Chapter I:

 

Having ined the legal, ic and fi ial situation of
the Company, the experts recommend the acquisition of a
majority stake in the Company to potential investors. The
investment should have a long-term perspective.

- Article 3.12.2:

Real Properties: The Company is the perpetual usufructuary of
the following plots of land and owns the buildings on the land ...
Real property situated in Warsaw ... Plot No. 39 ... developed
with two hotel buildings: Polonia Hotel and Metropol Hotel ...

- Article 3.12:

The Company holds and uses without a legal title the real
property situated in Warsaw ... developed with a hotel building:
MDM Hotel.

- Chapter IV:

All the buildings owned by the Company (except for the MDM
Hotel...) have a regulated legal status. The owner of the plots of
land indicated in point III ‘Real properties’ is the Capital City
of Warsaw ... The owner of buildings and perpetual usufructuary
of the plots of land is Hotels Warszawskiw Syrena ... In
accordance with the notarial deed of 19 November 1991, as
proven by Enfranchisement Decisions No. ... 489/93...

- Additional Information:

The formal and legal status of the land title is regulated.

The Supplement provided, as regards the Metropol Hotel, as follows:

The legal status of hotel Metropol is regulated. The Company is
perpetual usufructuary of the land plot and the owner of the hotel
building erected on the plot. Land and Mortgage Register has
been established for the property. A reservation is made in the
Register regarding the claims of former successors to the former
owners of the property, whose application for temporary
ownership of the property was declined in 1996 by the Minister
of Spatial Development and Construction. The applicants can
demand that the case be decided by the Supreme Administrative
Court, to which they have already filed a_ complaint.
Simultaneously, the successors have applied to the Self-
government Appeal Council in Warsaw for invalidation of the
administrative decision granting the Company perpetual
usufruct of the land on which Metropol Hotel has been built.'>

These were references to the claims made by previous property owners to the Metropol

Hotel. There was nothing similar in regards to the claims made by the previous property

owners to the Hotel Polonia. '®

According to the Claimants, information provided at that time to potential buyers also
suggested that the investments were extremely promising, secure and without legal

obstacles. !7

Based on the information provided, Strabag (by its predecessor Bau Holding AG)

submitted the successful bid.'®

Because Strabag was a foreign investor, the President of the Office of Competition and
Consumer Protection and the Minister of Internal Affairs had to consent to the sale, and
they both did so. The consent of the Minister of Internal Affairs dated 6 February 1997
states that Strabag acquired, through the takeover of shares of Syrena, “the perpetual
usufruct of the land and the ownership of the buildings on this land”.'? These buildings

were the Hotel Metropol and the Hotel Polonia.

2.18 Inpreparation for the sale, on 17 March 1997, Syrena Hotel’s management board issued

a statement (the “Board Declaration”), which provided as follows:

The Company Hotele Warszawskie ‘Syrena’ is the perpetual
usufructuary of the land and ownership of the buildings on the
land ... real property situated in Warsaw at Ul. Jerozolimskie 45
... Plot No. 39 .... Developed with two hotel buildings: Polonia
Hotel and Metropol Hotel, land and mortgage register No.
143520 ... the above real estates are free from mortgages and
other encumbrances.”

2.19 On 18 March 1997, the Council of the City of Warsaw authorised its Deputy Mayor to

sign a Share Purchase Agreement with Strabag (the “SPA”). The City of Warsaw (as
“Seller”) and Strabag (as “Buyer”) signed the SPA on the same day, 18 March 1997.7!

The SPA included the Information Memorandum and the Supplement.

of the MDM Hotel is located; and

(viii) accept the employment and social guarantee package agreed upon by contract
of 4 September 1996 between the employees of Syrena Hotels and the City of

Since 1997, Strabag has paid an annual fee for the right of perpetual usufruct to an

Polonia and Hotel Metropol are erected, Strabag has already paid “the outrageously

high sum” | (approximately YY for this right.??

land and ownership of the hotels. These events are briefly summarised in the following

paragraphs.

2.25 Annulment Decision: On 10 December 2003, the Local Government Appeal Court
annulled the Enfranchisement Decision of 29 June 1993, which had confirmed Syrena
Hotel’s rights (the “Annulment Decision”).?° According to Strabag, this was done

without legal basis and without properly giving notice to Strabag and Syrena Hotels.?”

2.26 On appeal, the Provincial Administrative Court upheld the annulment of the
Enfranchisement Decision on 10 November 2009.78 Syrena Hotels then filed a

cassation appeal, which was rejected on 19 October 2010.7?

2.27 According to the Claimants, although the Annulment Decision “was only declaratory”
and “does not change the ex /ege acquisition of the rights” of Syrena Hotels, it “clearly
shows the lack of good faith on the part of Poland in its conduct towards the

Investors”.*°

2.28 Demands of former_owners: According to the Claimants, Poland concealed the

demands of former property owners during the privatisation process.*! Specifically, | |

Ee: asserted claims as regards Hotel Polonia, and |

HE (succeeded by his family) had asserted claims as regards the plot on which

Hotel Metropol was erected.

2.29 Claimants allege that “the Capital City of Warsaw had been fully aware of the demands
of the former owners and their successors at the time of privatization”, and yet did not
inform Strabag.*” With regard to the Hotel Polonia, the City of Warsaw did not reveal
any knowledge of demands, even though successors of had dispatched

numerous letters to Polish authorities requesting restitution of Hotel Polonia. Indeed,

one such letter was sent to officials of Warsaw just eight days before the privatisation

was complete.*® With respect to Hotel Metropol, the Claimants state that:

The Capital City of Warsaw expressly confirmed that the legal
status of the right of perpetual usufruct and the ownership right
are regulated. The Capital City of Warsaw only mentioned
demands of former owners concerning a part of the land
underneath Hotel Metropol as theoretical and insignificant as
they had, inter alia, already been officially rejected.*

 

The Christmas Decision: On 24 December 2012, the City of Warsaw issued a decision

with regard to the Plots Nos 1582 J and 6688,>> stating that PY
HE vs the legal owner of Hotel Polonia, with the right of perpetual usufruct over
the land for 99 years (the “Christmas Decision”). The Decision further states that it does
not violate any third party’s rights, despite the fact that the lawfully registered rights of
Strabag and Syrena Hotels were obviously harmed by this decision. The Claimants
assert that the “absurdity of this Decision is obvious: it was issued by the same organ,
institution and entity of Poland, which had previously assured the existence of these
rights”.*° Syrena Hotels and its mortgage creditors filed an appeal against this decision,

which was dismissed on 9 September 2013.°”

Certificates in fu The City of Warsaw also issued three
certificates confirming the alleged ownership of i +:

regard to Hotel Polonia in 2009, 2012 and 2013.** The Claimants allege that these
certificates unlawfully provided that Hotel Polonia was owned by P|
PF and that this building should have never been owned by either the

City of Warsaw or the Polish State Treasury. The Claimants’ rights were not addressed,

 

and Syrena Hotels was not even permitted to participate in these proceedings.*°

Division Proceedings: In 2012, the City of Warsaw initiated an ex officio proceeding

concerning the division of the land on which both Hotel Polonia and Hotel Metropol

J and a part of No 6688 in order to fulfil the claims of the former owners. Although
Syrena Hotels substantially disputed the legal basis of this proceeding, the Mayor of
the City of Warsaw approved the division on 25 April 2012.*° Domestic proceedings

relating to the decision are ongoing.*!

Deletion of Syrena Hotels as Perpetual Lessee: In 2011, the City of Warsaw decided
to delete Syrena Hotels from the building register as perpetual lessee of Plot No 39,
without being notified in advance. This action has led to a number of administrative
and court proceedings, which are partially ongoing. According to the Claimants, despite
decisions in favour of Syrena Hotels, the City of Warsaw continues its efforts to delete

Syrena Hotels from the building register.*”

Bank Guarantee: As set out above, Strabag was obliged to invest PY
hi! by 31 December 2003, and had to provide the City of Warsaw
with a bank guarantee in the amount of PY as a security for the

fulfilment of its investment obligations (the “Bank Guarantee”).**

The Claimants argue that Strabag fulfilled all these obligations by investing
HE which is a: excess of the required amount)
during the relevant period to refurnish and refurbish the hotel buildings, to operate the
hotels, and to engage hotel activities. Yet the City of Warsaw drew upon the Bank
Guarantee in its entirety in 2004 on the basis of what the Claimants consider “unlawful
documents”.** Strabag initiated proceedings against the City of Warsaw for repayment
of the Bank Guarantee, which are pending.** The Claimants allege that in these

proceedings, certain judgments have been “unobjective”.*°

On the basis of the events described above and related actions of Polish authorities, the

Claimants contend that the Respondent has committed numerous violations of the

Treaty. Specifically, the Claimants claim that the Respondent has breached the

following provisions:

- Article 2: “Encouragement and Protection of Investments”;
- Article 3: “Treatment of Investments”;

- Article 4: “Compensation” for expropriation;

- Article 5: “Transfers”;

- Article 7: “Other Obligations”; and

- Article 8: Settlement of Investment Disputes.*’

2.37 These claims are described in further detail in Part V of this Award, which addresses
the Respondent’s argument that the Claimants have failed to demonstrate that, prima

facie, their claims fall under the relevant provisions of the Treaty.
2.38 The Claimants request an award granting the following relief:

(a) Declaring that Respondent has violated the Austria~-Poland
Bilateral Investment Treaty with respect to the Investors’
investments,

(b) Declaring that the actions and omissions of Respondent and
those of its organs, institutions and entities for which it is
internationally responsible, inter alia and by way of example and
without limitation, are unlawful, arbitrary, discriminatory,
unfair and inequitable, constitute an expropriation or measures
tantamount to expropriation without compensation and a denial
of justice and that Respondent and those of its organs,
institutions and entities for which it is internationally
responsible, inter alia and by way of example and without
limitation, failed to provide fair and equitable treatment, failed
to provide full protection and security and failed to provide most
favoured nation treatment and treatment in accordance with
international law and the Share Purchase Agreement;

(c) Dismissing the Intra-EU Jurisdictional objection advanced
by Respondent and decides that it has jurisdiction of the dispute;

(d) Directing Respondent to re-establish the situation which
existed before the breaches occurred;

as set forth herein and which may be further developed and

on all sums awarded;

(h) Directing Respondent to pay the Investors’ costs associated
with these proceedings, as far as Article 8 of the BIT provides
therefore;

(i) Any other relief the Arbitral Tribunal may deem just, proper
and appropriate.*

The Claimants’ responses to each of the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections are

summarised in the later Parts of this Award addressing those objections.

The Respondent’s Case

In summary, the Respondent contends that this Tribunal has no jurisdiction to decide
the Claimants’ several claims on three principal grounds: (i) the Claimants have not
demonstrated that, prima facie, their claims fall under the relevant provisions of the
Treaty; (ii) the Claimants’ use of the Treaty is an abuse of process; (iii) the Claimants
do not have jus standi in these proceedings; and (iv) Article 8 of the Treaty is invalid
or inapplicable because it conflicts with mandatory rules of EU law, as confirmed by

the CJEU in the Achmea Judgment.

The Respondent also denies any liability on the merits to any of the Claimants. Here,
the Tribunal will provide only a brief overview of the Respondent’s main assertions for

context, as this Award does not address the merits of the Parties’ dispute.

48 C-PHB, 4125; see Jur. CM, 9254.

Part II — Page 11

2.42 Regarding the Claimants’ complaints relating to Syrena Hotel’s lack of title to the
property on which Hotel Polonia and Hotel Metropol are situated, the Respondent does
not deny the occurrence of the main events alleged by the Claimants.*? However, the

Respondent argues that these events cannot give rise to liability under the Treaty.

2.43 The Respondent asserts that prior to the signing of the SPA on 18 March 1997, all
potential buyers of Syrena Hotels’ shares were, or at least should have been, aware of
the risk associated with possible reprivatisation claims.*’ With regard to Plot No 39,
relevant proceedings were in fact pending before the Polish Courts. The Respondent
highlights that the Supplement attached to the SPA expressly noted the proceedings
directed against the Enfranchisement Decision, which concerned the entire property on
which Hotel Metropol and Hotel Polonia were built.*! These were the proceedings
pursued by the amity. The SPA nevertheless relied on the Enfranchisement
Decision because, at the time, it was valid, binding and effective under Polish law.
Therefore, according to the Respondent, the SPA correctly described the legal situation

at the time.*?

2.44 The Respondent accepts that the SPA was silent about possible actions by the heirs of

the other former property owner, YF relating to the Hotel Polonia.

However, according to the Respondent, this is because no formal actions by his heirs

were initiated before the SPA was signed on 18 March 1997.>? In fact, it was not until

ten years later that HE ally initiated proceedings in

relation to her reprivatisation claims.**

2.45 At the same time, the Respondent argues that the possibility of heirs
also initiating proceedings similar to those brought by the | family must have

been obvious to any reasonable potential buyer, especially Strabag, one of the largest

and most experienced players on the Warsaw real estate market at the time.*°

In these circumstances, the Respondent considers it inconceivable that Strabag, having
been informed about the actions of the IY amily, would not conduct its own
investigation and would not verify independently the legal situation of the property. In
the Respondent’s view, Strabag should have been aware of the risks associated with the
existing and potential reprivatisation claims and discounted these risks in the price.*°
In any event, the Respondent argues that Strabag should have met “the standard of

prudence and diligence normally required from investors in such situations”.*”

Regarding the Division Proceedings, the Respondent states that, in accordance with the
administrative and judicial decisions issues in favour of the former property owners,
the City of Warsaw had to prepare to grant them perpetual usufruct over the plots of
land they previously owned, parts of which were joined into Plot No 39. Therefore, it
had no choice but to initiate the proceedings for the formal division of Plot No 39 along

the pre-War boundaries.**

In relation to the Claimants’ complaints relating to the Bank Guarantee, the Respondent
considers that these complaints constitute no more than a claim for contractual damages
under the SPA.*? The Respondent recalls that this contractual claim is the result of a
disagreement between Strabag and the City of Warsaw regarding how the investment
obligation should be calculated under the SPA, and it has been (and it still being) heard

in domestic proceedings.

Indeed, the Respondent contends that all the claims submitted by the Claimants are of

a purely contractual nature and are, in any event, without merit.

Each of the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections are summarised in more detail below

in the Parts of this Award addressing those specific objections.

Claimants’ claims in their entirety.

II. In any event, the Respondent respectfully requests the
Tribunal to order the Claimants to pay the costs of this
arbitration, as well as the fees and expenses relating to the
Respondent's legal representation, in-house costs, fees and
expenses of any expert appointed by the Respondent or the
Tribunal, and all other reasonable costs, as far as Article 8 of

PART IIT: THE PRINCIPAL ISSUES

The principal issues addressed in this Award all arise from the Respondent’s challenges
to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal under Article 8 of the Treaty. These issues are all
contested by the Claimants, who assert the Tribunal’s full jurisdiction over the Parties’
dispute. For present purposes, the Tribunal is content to take these issues largely as
formulated by the Respondent in its Jurisdictional Memorial, as supplemented by its
oral submissions at the Hearing, and its post-hearing written submissions on the

Achmea Judgment.!

I- Prima Facie Case: Have the Claimants demonstrated that, prima facie, their claims

fall under the relevant provisions of the Treaty? In particular:

(1) Are the rights upon which the Claimants rely for their claims covered by

the Treaty?

(2) Are the facts alleged by the Claimants capable of coming within all or at least

some of the Treaty’s provisions invoked by the Claimants?
(3) Are the Claimants’ allegations “incoherent and conclusory”?

II — Abuse of Process: Is the Claimants’ use of the Treaty for their claims in this

arbitration an abuse of process?
II — Jus Standi and Ratione Personae:
(1) Are the Claimants “investors” under the Treaty?

(2) Do the Claimants have jus standi in this arbitration despite having transferred
their “investments” to a national of a third state (namely SHIOL, a Cypriot legal

person)?
IV — EU Law and the Achmea Judgment:

(1) Does EU law apply to the determination of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction?

PART IV: PRINCIPAL LEGAL TEXTS
Introduction

For ease of reference later, the Tribunal reproduces here the relevant parts of the
principal legal texts considered later below, including: the Treaty, the Polish Code of
Administrative Procedure (“PCAP”), the SPA, the Information Memorandum, the
Supplement and the VCLT.

Because these legal texts are in the German and/or Polish languages, the Tribunal has
used the Parties’ English language translations (save where otherwise indicated). As
noted above, any differences between the Parties’ translations are not considered

material for present purposes.

The Treaty!
Article 1(1) of the Treaty, which defines the term “investment”, provides:

(1) The term “investment” shall include all assets, in particular
but not exclusively:

a) Ownership of movable and immovable property and other
rights in rem, such as mortgages, rights of retention, pledges,

enterprises;

c) Claims to money provided in order to create an economic
value or claims to performances having an economic value; and

with the legislation of one of the Contracting Parties, having its
seat in the territory of that Contracting Party and undertaking

' The following excerpts are taken from the Claimants’ English translation, C-ST.

Part IV — Page 1

an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party.

4.5 Article 1(3) of the Treaty defines “returns” as “those sums which are produced by an
investment, in particular but not exclusively profits, interest, increases in capital,

dividends, royalties, licence fees and other compensation”.
4.6 Article 2(1) (“Encouragement and Protection of Investments”) provides:

Each Contracting Party shall as far as possible promote in its

4.7 Article 3 of the Treaty (“Treatment of Investments”) provides (in relevant part):

investors or by investors from third countries.

(2) Within its own territory, each Contracting Party shall treat
any activity by investors from the other Contracting Party, in
relation to an investment, and in particular to its administration,
application, use and enjoyment, no less favourably than the
activity of its own investors or of investors from third countries.

4.8 Article 4 of the Treaty (“Compensation”) provides (in relevant part):

(1) Investments of investors from one Contracting Party may be
expropriated on the territory of the other Contracting Party only
in the public interest, on the basis of a lawful procedure and
against compensation. Such compensation must represent the
value of the investment immediately before the time at which the
actual or imminent expropriation becomes publicly known. The
compensation must be provided without unreasonable delay and
until paid out must carry the normal banking interest rate of the
State in whose territory the investment had been made; it must
be actually realizable and freely transferable. No later than the
time of expropriation suitable provision shall exist for the
determination and payment of compensation.

(2) If one of the Contracting Parties expropriates the assets of a
company which under article 1, paragraph 2 of this Agreement
should be regarded as belonging to that Contracting Party, and
in which an investor from the other Contracting Party has a

Part IV — Page 2

holding, than the Contracting Party shall apply the stipulations
of paragraph 1 of this article in such a manner that appropriate
compensation is guaranteed to that investors.

(3) The investor shall be entitled to have examined the legality
of such expropriation by appropriate organs of the Contracting
Party which has ordered the expropriation.

(4) The investor shall be entitled to have examined the amount
of such compensation by either the appropriate organs of the
Contracting Party which has ordered expropriation, or an
international arbitral tribunal as provided for in article 8.

(5) With regard to the matters governed by paragraph 1,
paragraph 2, paragraph 3 and paragraph 4 of this article,
investors from one Contracting Party shall not be treated any
less favourably than investors from the other Contracting Party

investment;

b) Sums intended to cover expenditures relating to the
administration of the investment;

c) Returns;
d) Loan repayments;

e) The yield in the event of the complete or partial liquidation or
sale of the investment;

f) Compensation pursuant to article 4, paragraph 1.

4.10 Article 7 of the Treaty (“Other Obligations”) provides:

(1) If the legislation of either Contracting Party or international
obligations of the two Contracting Parties, which presently
apply in additional to this Agreement or which are established
in the future, should give rise to a general or specific agreement
which accords to the investments of investors from the other
Contracting Party more favourable treatment than is provided

Part IV — Page 3

for by this Agreement, such arrangement shall have precedence
over this Agreement, in so far as it is more favourable.

(2) Each Contracting Party shall comply with any contractual
obligation it may have entered into with respect to investors from
the other Contracting Party concerning investments which it has
authorized in its territory.

4.11 Article 8 of the Treaty, which concerns the “Settlement of Investment Disputes”,

provides (in relevant part):

(1) If disputes should arise between one Contracting Party and
an investor from the other Contracting Party with regard to an
investment, such disputes shall be resolved amicably between the
parties themselves if possible. If such amicable resolution is not
possible, then the investor shall exhaust all relevant domestic
administrative and judicial remedies.

(2) If such a dispute cannot be settled in a manner provided for
in paragraph I within 12 months from written notification of
adequately specified claims, it shall at the request of the
Contracting Party or of the investor from the other Contracting
Party, be submitted for conciliation or arbitration:

a) to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes, if both Contracting Parties are signatories to the
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes
between States and nationals of other States, opened for
signature at Washington on 18 March 1965. In the event of
arbitration, each of the Contracting Parties, by becoming a
signatory to this Agreement, undertakes irrevocably and in
advance, even if there should be no individual arbitration
agreement between a Contracting Party and an investor, to
submit such disputes to the Centre and to recognize the
arbitration award as binding.

b) to an international arbitral tribunal, if either of the
Contracting Parties is not a signatory to the Convention on
the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and
nationals of other States. The international arbitral tribunal
shall be constituted on an ad hoc basis in the following
manner: each side shall appoint an arbitrator, and these
arbitrators shall agree on a chairman, who shall be a
national of a third State. The arbitrators shall be appointed
within two months from the date on which the investors has
notified the other Contracting Party of his desire to submit
the dispute to an arbitral tribunal and the chairman within
further two months.

If the time-limits given in the paragraph above are not observed

Part IV — Page 4

and if no other agreements reached, either side may request the
President of the International Court of Justice to make the
necessary appointments. If the President of the International
Court of Justice is a national of either Contracting Party or if he
is unable to act for any other reason, the Vice-President or, if he
is unable to act, the longest-serving member of the International
Court of Justice, may under the same conditions be asked to
make the necessary appointments. The arbitral tribunal shall
determine its rules of procedure by applying as appropriate the
procedural rules of the Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes between States and nationals of other States
of 18 March 1965; the decision shall include a statement of the
basis on which it has been made, and supporting reasons shall
be given if either side so requests.

(3) The decision of the tribunal shall be final and binding. It
shall be enforced by domestic law, and each Contracting Party
shall ensure the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards
in accordance with its relevant legislation.

(4) Each side shall bear the costs of its own arbitrator and the
costs of its representation in the proceedings before the arbitral
tribunal; the costs of the chairman and the other costs shall be
borne in equal shares by both sides.

(5) A Contracting Party which is a party to a dispute shall not,
at any stage of the conciliation or arbitration proceedings or
enforcement of an arbitral award, raise an objection on the
grounds that the investor who is the other party to the dispute
has received compensation for all or some of its losses through
an insurance policy.

4.12 Article 9 of the Treaty,? which concerns “Disputes between the Contracting Parties”,

provides:

(1) Differences of opinion between the Contracting Parties
concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement
shall as far as possible be settled by amicable negotiations.

(2) If a difference of opinion cannot be resolved within six
months, it shall be submitted to an arbitral tribunal at the request
of either Contracting Party.

(3) The arbitral tribunal shall be formed on a case-by-case basis
by each Contracting Party appointing one member and both of
members [=co-arbitrators] agree on a national of a third State
as chairman who is to be appointed by the Governments of the

2 The English translations of Articles 9 and (below) I| of the Treaty were translated from its German original
text by ICSID and confirmed by the Tribunal (being German-speakers).

Part IV — Page 5

two Contracting Parties. The members [=co-arbitrators] are to
be appointed within 2 months after one Contracting Party
notified the other Contracting Party that it intends to submit the
difference of opinion to an arbitral tribunal; the chairman is to
be appointed within a further two months.

(4) If the deadlines referred to in paragraph 3 are not complied
with, any Contracting Party may, in the absence of any other
agreement, request the President of the International Court of
Justice to make the necessary appointments. If the President of
the International Court of Justice is a national of either
Contracting Party or is otherwise unable [to make the
appointment], the Vice-President or, in the event of his
hindrance, the senior member of the International Court of
Justice may be invited to make the appointments under the same
conditions.

(5) The Arbitral Tribunal determines the arbitration procedure.

(6) The arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of this
Agreement as well as on the generally recognized rules of
international law. It decides by majority of votes; the decision is
final and binding.

(7) Each Contracting Party shall bear the costs of its member
and its representative in the arbitral proceedings; the costs of
the chairman and other costs shall be borne equally by the two
contracting parties. The arbitral tribunal may, however, decide
on a different cost allocation in its ruling.

4.13. Article 10 of the Treaty, which concerns the “Applicability of this Agreement,”

provides:

Once entered into force, this Agreement shall apply to all
existing and future investments undertaken by investors of one
Contracting Party in accordance with the legislation of the other
Contracting Party on the territory of the Contracting Party.

4.14 Article 11 of the Treaty, which concerns “Entry into Force and Duration”, provides:

(1) This Agreement requires ratification and will enter into force
on the first day of the third month following the month in which
the instruments of ratification have been exchanged.

(2) The Agreement will remain in force for ten years; after the
expiration [of the 10-year period], it will be extended
indefinitely, unless one of the two contracting parties terminates
the agreement in writing with a notice period of twelve months.
After ten years, the agreement can be terminated at any time, but

Part IV — Page 6

remains in effect for a further year after the termination notice.
(3) For investments made up to the date of termination of this

Agreement, Articles 1 to 10 shall continue to apply for a further
10 years from the date of the termination of the Agreement.

Cc. The Polish Code of Administrative Procedure (“PCAP” )*
4.15 Certain provisions of the PCAP were cited by the Parties, as follows:

Article 156

§ 1. A public administration body shall invalidate any decision
which:

1) was issued in breach of the regulations on jurisdiction,

2) was issued without legal basis or in blatant breach of the
law,

3) concerns a case that has already been dealt with by a
separate final decision,

4) has been addressed to a person who is not a party to the
proceedings,

5) was unenforceable at the date of issue and such
unenforceability is of a permanent nature,

6) its enforcement would result in commitment of a criminal
act,

7) contains a defect which renders it invalid by law.

§ 2. A decision may not be invalidated for the reasons given in §
1, (1), (3), (4) and (7), if 10 years have lapsed from the date of
its service or publication, and also if the decision would have
irreversible legal consequences.

Article 157

§ 1. In the cases referred to in Article 156 the jurisdiction to
invalidate a decision belongs to a higher body, and if the
decision was issued by a minister or a self-government appeal
council — those bodies shall have jurisdiction.

the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in
their context and in the light of its object and purpose.

2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty
shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and
annexes:

(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between
all the parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty;

(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in
connexion with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the
other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.

3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:

(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the
interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;

(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which
establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its
interpretation,

(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the
relations between the parties.

4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established
that the parties so intended.

PART V: PRIMA FACIE CASE
A. Introduction

5.1 The Tribunal briefly sets out the contrasting positions of the Parties on this issue before
recording its analysis and decision. In considering the Respondent’s prima facie
objection, the Tribunal is required to consider various alleged facts as they relate to the
claims asserted by the Claimants. However, the Tribunal’s analysis and decision on this
objection are without prejudice to any later decision the Tribunal may take in relation
to the merits of the Claimants’ claims, and nothing in this Part should be read as an
indication of the Tribunal’s views on the merits, which will be formed only after the

Parties have had a full opportunity to make submissions on the relevant issues.

B. The Respondent’s Case

5.2. The Respondent contends that the Claimants’ case must meet a “prima facie test” to

establish the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to decide their claims.!

5.3. According to the Respondent, under the “prima facie test”, the Claimants must
demonstrate that, prima facie, their claims fall under the relevant provisions of the
Treaty. The rights relied on by the Claimants must be covered by the Treaty, and the

facts alleged by the Claimants must be capable of coming within those provisions.”

5.4 The Respondent considers that, in discharging its task, the Tribunal may have to decide
definitively the interpretation of the relevant provision of the Treaty in order to establish

whether the facts alleged by the Claimants fall within the Treaty.*

5.5 Further, according to the Respondent, it is not enough for the Claimants to merely state

facts and “label” them as violations of the Treaty. The Claimants’ characterisation of

Decision on Jurisdiction and Recommendation on Provisional Measures, 21 March 2007, {91 (“To summarize,
the Tribunal’s task is to determine the meaning and scope of the provisions upon which Saipem relies to assert
jurisdiction and to assess whether the facts alleged by Saipem fall within those provisions or would be capable,
if proven, of constituting breaches of the treaty obligations involved. In performing this task, the Tribunal will
apply a prima facie standard, both to the determination of the meaning and scope of the relevant BIT provisions
and to the assessment whether the facts alleged may constitute breaches of these provisions. In doing so, the
Tribunal will ss whether Saipem’s case is reasonably arguable on its face. If the result is affirmative,
jurisdiction will be established, but the existence of breaches will remain to be litigated on the merits”).

facts must be coherent and must explain how the facts alleged by them come logically
within each of the invoked provisions of the Treaty.* For the Respondent, this means
that if the Claimants’ statement of the facts is unreasonably vague, incoherent or
vexatious, their case may be rejected at this jurisdictional stage under the prima facie

test.

5.6 During the Hearing, the Respondent accepted that the Claimants “do have an arguable
case”.° However, according to the Respondent, Claimants’ case, “is essentially
contractual in nature” and not a case under the Treaty.° Indeed, the Respondent

contends that the Claimants’ claims under the Treaty “are anything but ‘reasonably

arguable on [their] face””.”

5.7. In the Respondent’s view, the Claimants’ entire case consists of two components:

(i) the alleged breach by the Municipality of the representations
and warranties contained in the SPA;

(ii) the alleged unauthorised use by the Municipality of the bank
guarantee.*

5.8 The Respondent argues that the Claimants offer a broad, meticulous account of many
court and administrative proceedings relating to the restitution claims against the
Warsaw properties to “blur the picture”.? However, according to the Respondent, the
Claimants “have expressly admitted ... that, in principle, they do not question either

the endeavours of the former owners to have their ownership restored or Poland’s legal

framework allowing for such restitution”. !°

5.9 Therefore, in the Respondent’s view, the essence of the Claimants’ complaint is only

the fact that their rights acquired under the SPA are affected by the restitution claims.

5.13

The Respondent states that “it all boils down to the question of accuracy of the
representations and warranties allegedly contained in the SPA and related

documentation”, as acknowledged by the Claimants. !!

The Respondent further contends that the SPA is a purely commercial contract, which
did not require the exercise of any “governmental powers” by the Minister of State
Treasury or any other instrumentality of Poland.'? According to the Respondent, all the
actions of the City of Warsaw in relation to the conclusion of the SPA were undertaken

in its capacity as the commercial owner of Syrena Hotels. !?

Regarding the Bank Guarantee, the Respondent similarly argues that the Claimants’
allegations all relate to a purely commercial dispute. According to the Respondent, this
dispute about the Bank Guarantee “rests exclusively on the proper interpretation of the
contractual clause dealing with the calculation of investment outlays, which the buyer

was obliged to make under the SPA”. '*
Therefore, the Respondent concludes that:

any and all controversies relating to the SPA should be dealt
with between the parties to this agreement, i.e. between the
Municipality (as the seller) and Strabag (as the legal successor
of the buyer). The respective forum for deciding any and all
disputes relating to the alleged breaches of the SPA are the
Polish common courts. Such disputes should be decided under
Polish law, which governs the SPA. The Respondent notes that
such a dispute was initiated by Strabag in September 2015 and
is currently pending before the Regional Court in Warsaw.'°

The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ reliance on the umbrella clause in Article 7(2)
of the Treaty to “elevate” their contractual claims to the level of a treaty breach.'° In

any event, the Respondent asserts that, even if the umbrella clause could be invoked,

the Claimants have failed to allege any valid claims under the SPA or Polish law. The

Respondent has made extensive submissions on this point, both orally and in writing.”

In addition to the characterization of the Claimants’ claims as contractual in nature, the
Respondent further submits that the Claimants have “failed to demonstrate any breach
of protective standards enshrined in the Treaty”.'* The Respondent’s main contentions

in this context are the following:

- The Claimants’ expectation that no further restitution claims would be pursued in

relation to Hotel Polonia was neither reasonable nor legitimate. !°

- The Claimants failed to establish that they suffered any discriminatory treatment.”°

- Neither the Claimants’ investment nor the Bank Guarantee has been expropriated.7!

For the above reasons, the Respondent concludes that in the interest of procedural

economy, it is not appropriate to reach the merits of the Claimants’ claims.”

The Claimants’ Case

In summary, the Claimants’ primary position is that Article 8 of the Treaty does not
require the Claimants to meet any prima facie test to establish the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction.” It is sufficient for a claimant to simply to characterise its claims as
violations of the Treaty and to meet the formal requirements of the Treaty, which the

Claimants have done in this case.”

Alternatively, if the Tribunal considers it appropriate to apply a prima facie test, the

legal standard is as follows:

The prima facie test requires a tribunal to accept the facts as
pleaded by a claimant pro tem and then to determine whether
those facts, on condition they can be proven in the subsequent
stage, are sufficiently plausibly based on the Treaty or might, at

least in theory, establish a Treaty breach. Issues as to whether a
claim may be successful as a matter of law or whether a claimant
only pretends to exercise a right (i.e. is abusing a “right”)
properly belong to the merits phase.*>

The Claimants further argue that the prima facie test must be limited to a summary

examination in order to avoid prejudging the merits.”°

The Claimants deny that their claims are “purely contractual” as argued by the

1.27

Respondent.*’ They contend that all their claims are made under the Treaty and that

they are advancing no contractual claims under the SPA itself.

In particular, the Claimants contend that their claims are “based on the conduct of a
privatisation of public property by Respondent (i.e. its State-organs) followed by
actions of Respondent committed to set-aside the effects of the privatisation”.* The
Claimants argue that acts of the State organs relating to the privatisation of Syrena
Hotels were governmental, not commercial, acts.”? Further, the Claimants allege that
the City of Warsaw exercised puissance publique to interfere with Syrena Hotel’s title
to property. In the Claimants’ view, that conduct is attributable to the Respondent and

therefore must adhere to the standards of the Treaty.*”

Regarding the Bank Guarantee, the Claimants assert that they are “investors” with
“investments” under Article 1(1) of the Treaty, and such “investments” include the

Bank Guarantee as part of one inseparable package.*!

Relying upon the decision in Jmpregilo v Pakistan, the Claimants assert that treaty and

contract claims remain analytically distinct even if they perfectly coincide. *

Finally, the Claimants submit that they have pleaded a perfectly coherent case with

respect to the alleged breaches of the Treaty, and therefore, the prima facie test is met.*?

The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal begins with its decision on the prima facie test under international law

applicable to the Treaty.

The Respondent relies on the decisions rendered in Pac Rim Cayman v. El Salvador*#
and Trans-Global v. Jordan?’ to argue for the application of a “broadly interpreted”
prima facie test to the Treaty. The Respondent contends that in these cases, the arbitral
tribunals did not, for the purposes of determining their jurisdiction, merely rely on the
correctness of the facts asserted by the claimants in those cases. The Claimants dispute
the relevance of the Pac Rim case and the Trans-Global case to the present case,
contending that, unlike the present case, those cases were based on Article 10.20.4
CAFTA and ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) respectively, which concern expedited

procedures to address preliminary objections to jurisdiction.

This is not an arbitration taking place under the ICSID Convention or CAFTA. The
terms of the Parties’ arbitration agreement do not provide for preliminary objections
such as the ones found in ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) or Article 10.20.4 CAFTA.
Thus, that “jurisprudence constante” is inapplicable here.** It is therefore necessary to
apply customary international law, so as to interpret the arbitration agreement in its
context and in the light of the Treaty’s object and purpose under Article 31 of the
VCLT.

In the Tribunal’s view, this jurisdictional test requires a claimant to establish
jurisdiction definitively (i.e. not prima facie jurisdiction), but only a prima facie case

on the merits of the claimant’s claim.

of the ICID Arbitration Rules”, JCSID Convention after 50 Years (2017), pp. 249 et seq.

Part V — Page 6

5.28 This jurisdictional test is manifest from the classic statement of principle by Judge
Higgins in Oil Platforms describing the test for preliminary jurisdictional objections

under a treaty before the International Court of Justice:

31. Where the Court has to decide, on the basis of a treaty whose
application and interpretation is contested, whether it has
jurisdiction, that decision must be definitive ... It does not
suffice, in the making of this definitive decision, for the Court to
decide that it has heard claims relating to the various articles
that are “arguable questions” or that are “bona fide questions
of interpretation” (each being suggestions advanced in this
case). This is so notwithstanding that the Interhandel case (with
its passing reference to a ‘provisional conclusion’) and the
Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua
case do not fit easily into this approach. The treatment of the
issue in the latter case contained so many remarkable elements
and so many diverse views that it cannot be seen as a clear
decision by the Court to move away from the approach so
powerfully established in the Mavrommatis case. Nor, in my
view, is the answer to be found in the establishment of a
“reasonable connection” between the claims and the Treaty —
that is a necessary but not sufficient condition.

32. There has been some suggestion that “plausibility” provides
another test for determination of whether the Court has
jurisdiction. It was said in the Ambatielos case that the Court
must determine whether the arguments of the applicant State “in
respect of the treaty provisions on which the Ambatielos claim is
said to be based, are of a sufficiently plausible character to
warrant a conclusion that the claim is based on a Treaty” (I.C.J.
Reports 1953, p. 18. “Plausibility” was not the test to warrant a
conclusion that the claim might be based on the Treaty. The only
way in which, in the present case, it can be determined whether
the claims of Iran are sufficiently plausibly based upon the 1955
Treaty is to accept pro tem the facts as alleged by Iran to be true
and in that light to interpret Articles 1, IV and X for
jurisdictional purposes - that is to say, to see if on the basis of
Iran’s claims of fact there could occur a violation of one or more
of them.*”

5.29 Thus, the test requires a “definitive” decision on jurisdiction, but it does not require any
definitive decision on disputed facts where these meet the prima facie test. The

Tribunal’s task is to determine whether the facts pleaded by the Claimants, if taken to

57 Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v United States of America), 1CJ, Judgment of 12 December 1996,
Separate Opinion of Judge R. Higgins, 4 31-32.

be true, could possibly result in a breach of the provisions of the Treaty invoked by the

Claimants.

It would be possible to add many more citations, including those cited by the Parties in
this arbitration.** In the Tribunal’s view, it is unnecessary to do. The above principle is
well established and forms a well recognised “jurisprudence constante” for investment
treaty arbitration. Any difficulties here arise from its application to the Claimants’

pleaded factual case.

In the following sections, the Tribunal considers, first, the Respondent’s submission
that the Claimants’ claims are merely contractual in nature. Then the Tribunal proceeds
to consider each of the several claims advanced by the Claimants in light of the
Claimants’ factual allegations to determine whether, on the basis of those allegations,

there could occur a violation of one or more of the provisions of the Treaty.
() The Nature of the Claims

As noted above, the Respondent’s primary argument relating to the lack of a prima
facie case is that, although the Claimants label their claims as treaty claims, they are in
essence claims for breach of contract. Specifically, the Respondent considers that the
Claimants’ entire case boils down to an allegation that the City of Warsaw (i) breached
the representations and warranties contained in the SPA and (ii) improperly drew on
the Bank Guarantee in breach of the SPA.*? In response, the Claimants insist that they
are not advancing any claims under the SPA; rather, their claims are based on
governmental actions taken in violation of the Respondent’s obligations under the

Bir.

In the Tribunal’s view, the Respondent’s argument is founded upon a
mischaracterisation of the Claimants’ claims. Although the SPA is clearly a central
element of the relevant factual matrix in this case, it is not the /egal basis of the
Claimants’ claims (with the exception of the claims under Article 7(2), which are

addressed in subsection 8 below). For instance, the Claimants’ claims relate to certain

38 These include, e.g., RL-5, Impregilo S.p.A. v Islamic Republic of Pakistan, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3,
Decision on Jurisdiction, 22 April 2005, {| 266 (“Jurisdiction exists if one assumes pro tem that the investor can
establish facts it relies upon, it is possible, at least in theory, that the investor might establish treaty breaches”).

property rights allegedly acquired under the SPA, and the Claimants allege that the
information provided with the SPA established legitimate expectations in relation to
those property rights. However, the Claimants are not asserting contractual rights in
this arbitration, and they are not seeking recovery in relation to any breach of the SPA.*!
Instead, the Claimants claim that the actions of Polish State organs, in particular the
City of Warsaw, after the SPA was concluded interfered with the property rights of
Syrena Hotels and thereby violated the Claimants’ rights as investors in Syrena Hotels
under the Treaty.*? In this way, the Claimants have framed their case as treaty claims,

not as contract claims.

The possibility that the alleged actions of the City of Warsaw may also give rise to
contractual claims under the SPA does not serve to alter the nature of the claims asserted
by the Claimants in this arbitration. The Tribunal agrees with the observation of the

tribunal in Impregilo v Pakistan that:

the fact that a breach may give rise to a contract claim does not
mean that it cannot also — and separately — give rise to a treaty
claim. Even if the two perfectly coincide, they remain
analytically distinct, and necessarily require different
enquiries.*

The Respondent too appeared to accept this reasoning during the Hearing.**

Against this background, the Tribunal is persuaded that the claims presented by the
Claimants in this proceeding do not constitute contract claims but instead concern the
substantive obligations of the Respondent set forth in the Treaty and therefore constitute

treaty claims.

In the following sections, the Tribunal will turn to the question of whether the factual
matrix presented by the Claimants could prima facie result in a violation of the

substantive obligations under the Treaty.

4! The Tribunal understands that the reference to the SPA in the Claimants’ request for relief relates to the
Claimants’ “umbrella clause” claim under Article 7(2) of the Treaty and not a direct claim under the SPA. The
Claimants have repeatedly confirmed that they “raise no contract claims”. See, e.g., Claimants’ Hearing
Presentation, slide 83.

(2) Article 2(1) (FET)

The Claimants contend that the Respondent breached Article 2(1) of the Treaty,** which

provides:

Each Contracting Party shall as far as possible promote
investments made in its territory by investors from the other
Contracting Party, shall authorize such investments in
accordance with its own legislation and shall treat them at any
rate in a just and equitable manner.

The Claimants assert that Article 2(1) of the Treaty obligates the Respondent to provide
fair and equitable treatment in respect of the Claimants’ investments. More specifically,
the Claimants consider that this provision protects investors, inter alia, “from the
fundamental alteration of the investment framework which defeats the investor’s
legitimate expectations and, furthermore, provides for the duty of the host State to act

in a consistent and transparent manner”.*°

The Claimants allege that in the present case, the Respondent breached this obligation
by, first, making numerous assurances to the Claimants regarding Syrena Hotel’s
ownership of the hotels and its rights in the property on which the hotels are erected.
According to the Claimants, these assurances were critical to the Claimants’ decision
to invest in Poland. However, the Respondent then took actions subsequent to the
privatisation of Syrena Hotels, which “lead to fundamental alterations of the investment
framework and thereby frustrate the legitimate expectations of Claimants as the

Investors”.4”

The Claimants have alleged a number of assurances forming part of their claim under

Article 2(1) of the Treaty. These include the following:**

- By issuing the Enfranchisement Decision and the Municipalisation Decision and by

conducting the privatisation of Syrena Hotels, the Respondent’s authorities assured

Strabag of the undisputable existence of the right of perpetual usufruct and the

ownership of the hotels.”

- The Capital City of Warsaw specifically assured and warranted to Strabag that
Syrena Hotels had the right of perpetual usufruct and the ownership of the buildings
in Article 3.6. of the SPA and related documents, including the Declaration of the
Management Board of Syrena, Article 3.12 and Chapter IV of the Information

Memorandum and the Supplement.*°

- The Board Declaration expressly stated that the real estate held by Syrena Hotels at

the time of the SPA was “free from mortgages and other encumbrances”.*!

- The Information Memorandum represented that “[n]o circumstances exist that
could materially affect the legal, proprietorial or financial situation of [Syrena

Hotels]”.*?

- The City of Warsaw specifically assured and warranted to Strabag in the
Information Memorandum that the “legal status of the hotels and land is

regulated”.*?

- The Board Declaration assured Strabag that there were no pending proceedings with

regard to Plot 39 and the buildings on it.*

5.42 Regarding their reliance on these alleged assurances, the Claimants’ position, in sum,

is the following:

Given the fact that the Investors would have to commit massive
amounts of capital in the beginning and in the subsequent years
of the hotel business and would only be repaid with an adequate
return over a period of many years or even decades from the

business revenues, the undisputed right of perpetual usufruct of
the land and the ownership of the hotel buildings were key
factors for the Investors. The assets of the Company, i.e. the right
of perpetual usufruct with regard to the respective plots of land
as well as the ownership in the hotels built thereupon, were and
are of crucial importance for the Claimants’ decision to enter
into the investment and to continuously contribute the economy
of Poland.

The Claimants allege that on the basis of the assurances of the Respondent’s authorities,
they had legitimate expectations in Syrena Hotel’s rights, which were then frustrated

by “numerous actions and measures” of the same authorities.*° These include:

- The invalidation of the Enfranchisement Decision.

- The City of Warsaw’s issuance of certificates in favour [iii

allegedly confirming her ownership of Hotel Polonia.*”

- The City of Warsaw’s 24 December 2012 Christmas Decision, which held that Hi

ee i: the legal owner of Hotel Polonia and that she is granted the

right of perpetual usufruct for the land underneath Hotel Polonia.**
- The deletion of Syrena Hotels from the Land and Buildings Register.

- Actions of the Respondent’s authorities during the proceedings initiated by Hl

a:
- The improper drawing on the Bank Guarantee.

The Claimants allege that, through these actions, the Respondent frustrated the
Claimants’ legitimate expectations and also “placed a disproportionate and
discriminatory burden on the Investors by shifting to the Investors its obligation to
compensate the former owners for administrative decisions issued by the relevant
Polish authorities”.* The Claimants accept that Poland should redress the damage

suffered by the former owners as a result of the Government’s past blatant illegal acts,

but the Claimants argue that this cannot be done at the Claimants’ expense in violation

of the rights they were granted under the Treaty.°!

5.45 The Respondent refutes the Claimants’ assertions regarding a breach of Article 2(1) of
the Treaty, contending that the Claimants have not been able to demonstrate that their
legitimate expectations were breached by a fraudulent misrepresentation given by the
Respondent. Moreover, according to the Respondent, the Claimants should have known

of the restitution claims by previous owners as an investment risk.

5.46 At the outset, the Tribunal agrees that the wording in Article 2(1) of the Treaty “shall
treat them in a just and equitable manner” provide the same protection as the “fair and
equitable treatment” (FET) required in many other BITs. Considering the Parties’
submissions set out above, in the Tribunal’s view, the Claimants have alleged each
component of a FET claim in a coherent fashion that is objectively understandable.
Indeed, the Respondent appeared to accept at the Hearing that the Claimants’ FET claim
is “coherently pleaded”. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants have met the

prima facie test with respect to their claim under Article 2(1) of the Treaty.
(3) Article 2(2) (Full Protection)

5.47 The Claimants additionally claim that the Respondent breached Article 2(2) of the

Treaty, which provides:

Investments ... and [the] returns thereon shall enjoy the full
protection of this Agreement.

5.48 According to the Claimants, this provision guarantees “full protection and security of
the investor and its investment” beyond physical protection; it requires legal protection

and a secure investment environment.® The Claimants further assert that:

A well-established aspect of this standard is that host States must
use “due diligence” to prevent wrongful injuries to the person
or property of aliens caused by third parties or at least to remedy
those that could not have been prevented. Claimants do not
advocate that the standard may prevent the Investors from each
and every injury. However, it does require States, and in the
present case Respondent, to take reasonable actions within its

5.49

5.51

5.52

power to avoid or remedy such injuries.“

Applying this standard in the present case, the Claimants argue that the Respondent
violated its obligation under Article 2(2) by the course of acts and omissions described
elsewhere in this Award.® In sum, the Claimants allege that the Respondent repeatedly
denied the claims of former owners of Syrena Hotel’s property and then abruptly
changed course in 2003 by accepting and supporting those claims, at the Claimants’
expense. The Respondent thereby shifted the burden of remedying its own past illegal
acts on the Claimants. According to the Claimants, the Respondent could easily remedy
the injury caused to the Claimants by the City of Warsaw and the restitution seekers,

but has failed to do so.

For the purpose of the Respondent’s prima facie objection, the Tribunal need not
definitively decide whether the Claimants’ interpretation of Article 2(2) is correct, as
this could impinge on the Parties’ opportunity to make a full presentation of their
arguments on the issue. The relevant question is whether the Claimants’ claim rests on
a plausible interpretation of the provision, and the Tribunal considers that it does. In a
later phase of this proceeding, the Claimants’ interpretation will have to be assessed in
light of the specific wording of the Treaty and the competing lines of prior arbitral
jurisprudence in relation to the “full protection and security” standard. But that is an

exercise for the merits.

Applying the Claimants’ interpretation of Article 2(2) for the sole purpose of the prima
facie objection, the Tribunal considers that the facts as alleged by the Claimants, if true,
could potentially establish a violation of that provision. Therefore, the Tribunal finds
that the Claimants have met the prima facie test with respect to their claim under Article

2(2) of the Treaty.
(4) Article 3 (“Treatment of Investments”)

The Claimants contend that the Respondent breached Article 3 (“Treatment of

Investments”) of the Treaty. Article 3 provides:

(1) Each Contracting Party shall treat investment of investors

from the other Contracting Party undertaken on its territory in
accordance with all legislation relevant to their establishment
and utilization no less favourably than investments of its own
investors or by investors from third countries.

(2) Within its own territory, each Contracting Party shall treat
any activity by investors from the other Contracting Party, in
relation to an investment, and in particular to its administration,
application, use and enjoyment, no less favourably than the
activity of its own investors or of investors from third countries.

The Claimants here allege that in certain instances, the Respondent’s treatment of other
investors, in particular that of the French company Orbis SA for its Hotel Novotel was

®7 The Claimants

materially different from the treatment received by the Claimants.
contend that both Syrena Hotels and Orbis SA were initially State-owned companies
that were privatised in 1997 based on the Privatisation Act of 1990 through the sale of
shares to foreign investors. As with Syrena Hotels, former owners asserted claims
against the property of Orbis SA. However, in the case of Orbis SA, the courts
repeatedly acknowledged the fact that the right to the property has been “disposed to
third parties” and that the real estate was “covered by the right of perpetual usufruct
[of] third parties”, which led to a “irreversible legal consequence” that the property

could not be subject to restitution.°*

The Claimants refer to several other cases, such as the company Hotel Atrium, which
was established in 1998 by the City of Warsaw together with the Swedish company
Skanska Holding to build the Hotel Westin. The City of Warsaw contributed a plot of
land on which Hotel Westin was built, which had been expropriated from former
owners under the Warsaw Decree in 1945. Initially, the claims of previous owners

impeded the construction of Hotel Westin, but in 2002, in order to continue the project,

the City of Warsaw paid approximately FP (approximately i |
i) to compensate the former owners.?

According to the Claimants, the cases of these other investors “prove a certain pattern”

in which the Respondent is able to help investors preserve their investments and at the

same time compensate the former owners of the properties in a fair manner; yet “there
is an evident failure to apply this same treatment” to the Claimants.”? The Claimants
submit that this runs afoul of the Respondent’s obligation in Article 3 of the Treaty, and
in particular its obligation to treat the activity of the Claimants “no less favourably than
the activity of its own investors or of investors from third countries”.”!

The Respondent refutes the allegation of differential treatment. With respect to Orbis,
the Respondent asserts that the City of Warsaw did not establish a perpetual usufruct
for the previous owners of Novotel Hotel because the relevant enfranchisement decision
for Orbis SA was still in force at the time that the previous owners sought restitution.”
The Respondent contends that this is different from the situation in the case of the
Claimants.” In addition, the Respondent asserts that any differential treatment was not
based on the Claimants’ nationality and therefore cannot fall within Article 3 of the

Treaty.

It is worth recalling that in assessing the Claimants’ claims for the purpose of the prima
facie test, the Tribunal must not question the Claimants’ factual allegations on the basis
of competing allegations by the Respondent. This is an exercise reserved for the merits
of the proceeding. At this stage, it is sufficient that the Claimants have alleged a set of
facts that could constitute a violation of Article 3 of the Treaty, as interpreted by the
Claimants. Specifically, as noted above, they allege that domestic investors and
investors of third countries were treated more favourably than the Claimants in similar
circumstances. Neither the Claimants’ characterisation of the facts nor their
interpretation of Article 3 is so doubtful or unfounded that the Tribunal should prevent

the Claimants’ claim from proceeding to the merits.

For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants have met the prima facie test

with respect to their claim under Article 3 of the Treaty.

() Article 4 (Expropriation)

5.59 The Claimants contend that the Respondent breached Article 4 (“Compensation”) of
the Treaty by unlawfully expropriating their assets without compensation.” Article 4

provides:

(1) Investments by investors from one Contracting Party may be
expropriated on the territory of the other Contracting Party only
in the public interest, on the basis of a lawful procedure and
against compensation. Such compensation must represent the
value of the investment immediately before the time at which the
actual or imminent expropriation becomes publicly known. Such
compensation must be provided without unreasonable delay and
until paid out must carry the normal banking interest rate of the
State in whose territory the investment had been made; it must
be actually realizable and freely transferable. No later than the
time of expropriation suitable provision shall exist for the
determination and payment of compensation.

(2) If one of the Contracting Parties expropriates the assets of a
company which under article 1, paragraph 2 of this Agreement
should be regarded as belonging to that Contracting Party, and
in which an investor from the other Contracting Party has a
holding, [then] the first Contracting Party shall apply the
stipulations of paragraph 1 of this article in such a manner that
appropriate compensation is guaranteed to that investor{].

(3) The investor shall be entitled to have examined the legality
of such expropriation by appropriate organs of the Contracting
Party which has ordered the expropriation.

(4) The investor shall be entitled to have examined the amount
of such compensation by either the appropriate organs of the
Contracting Party which has ordered expropriation, or an
international arbitral tribunal as provided for in article 8.

(5) With regard to the matters governed by paragraph 1,
paragraph 2, paragraph 3 and paragraph 4 of this article,
investors from one Contracting Party shall not be treated any
less favourably than investors from the other Contracting Party
or from third countries.

In addition, the Claimants rely on Article 1(4) of the Treaty, which specifies that the
“term ‘expropriation’ shall also include nationalization or any other measure with the
same effect”.”>

Both Parties have offered extensive argumentation in connection with Article 4 of the
Treaty, both in writing and at the Hearing. In the Tribunal’s view, these competing
submissions have ventured beyond the prima facie test into the merits of the Parties’
dispute. For present purposes, the Tribunal will focus on the Claimants’ basic
allegations and determine whether, if true, they could be understood, in a prima facie

plausible manner, to give rise to an expropriation within the meaning of Article 4.

In sum, the Claimants’ position is that after they acquired Syrena Hotels, the
Respondent’s authorities took a number of actions ex officio and supported the actions
of third parties “with the aim to transfer ownership in the hotels and land usage rights

(i.e. Claimants’ investment) to the third parties without any compensation to be

expected by Claimants”.”°

According to the Claimants, these actions include:””

-  Invalidating the Enfranchisement Decision.

- Issuing certificates in favour of HR 2! !ezcdly confirming her

ownership of Hotel Polonia.”*

- Supporting PY in the Polish Court proceedings.”

- Issuing the 24 December 2012 Christmas Decision.*?

- Deleting Syrena Hotels from the Land and Buildings Register.

- Improperly drawing on the Bank Guarantee.

The Claimants allege that as a result of these actions, they have “already incurred actual

The Respondent contends, inter alia, that the Claimants still indirectly own and control
the Hotel Polonia and are not in any way prevented from operating it. Even if the
Claimants’ allegations of “material damage” to the value of their investment were
accepted as true, they could not result in a finding of an expropriation because “the
Claimants do not even argue that [Syrena Hotel’s] ownership title to the Hotel Polonia
was completely ‘neutralized’ or ‘annihilated’”.*? The Respondent also considers that
the Claimants’ claim of expropriation in relation to the Bank Guarantee is without legal

basis.*

Accepting the facts as stated by the Claimants pro tem, the Tribunal considers that the
Claimants have sufficiently pleaded their claim under Article 4 of the Treaty for the
purpose of the prima facie test. The central point to be understood from the Claimants’
claim is that without security in Syrena Hotel’s property rights, their investment in
Poland’s hospitality sector has suffered a “massive” loss in value and ultimately may

be destroyed.

Without prejudging the test to be applied on the merits, the Tribunal notes that certain
factors, some of which have been raised in the Respondent’s submissions, would appear
to be relevant to the ultimate determination of whether there has been a breach of Article
4 of the Treaty. For example, it may be necessary to consider the extent to which the
alleged measures have substantially and permanently deprived the Claimants of the
economic benefits attached to their shareholding in Syrena Hotels. One issue in this

context would appear to be that Hotel Polonia has remained operative and in the

Claimants’ hands over the course of the Parties’ dispute. Another question may be the
extent to which certain specific assets or rights can be viewed separately from the
Claimants’ overall investment. The Tribunal will consider such questions as needed in
the merits phase of the proceeding based on a definitive interpretation of Article 4 of

the Treaty (in conjunction with Article 1(4)) and a full assessment of the pertinent facts.
() Article 5 (“Transfer”)

5.68 In their Request for Arbitration, the Claimants contend that the Respondent breached
Article 5 (“Transfer”) of the Treaty, which provides:
(1) Each Contracting Party shall guarantee to investors from the
other Contracting Party that they may transfer freely, without
unreasonable delay, in a freely convertible currency the

payments which relate to an investment, in particular but not
exclusively:

(a) Capital and additional sums to support or expand the
investment;

(b) Sums intended to cover expenditures related to the
management of the investment;

(c) Returns;
(d) Loan repayments;

(e) The yield in the event of the complete or partial
liquidation or sale of the investment;

() Compensation pursuant to article 4, paragraph 1.
[J

(4) The treatment accorded under paragraph I and paragraph 2
of this article shall not be any less favourable than that accorded
to investors from third countries.

5.69 The Claimants’ claim under this provision is pleaded in a single sentence in the

Claimants’ Request for Arbitration: “Poland breached Article 5 (‘Transfers’) of the

Investment Treaty”.**

Respondent contends that due to the lack of factual clarity in this allegation, it can be

considered incoherent, and the Tribunal should not exercise jurisdiction over it.*°

The claim is, as pleaded, devoid of any factual allegation or even explanation. Indeed,
it is not clear from the Claimants’ later submissions whether they maintain this claim.*°
Therefore, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants, to the extent they assert a claim under

Article 5 of the Treaty, have failed to meet the prima facie test.
(7) Article 7(1) (“Other Obligations”)

The Claimants contend that, by operation of Article 7(1) of the Treaty, they are entitled
to rely on Article 6 (“Right to a fair trial”) of the European Convention on Human
Rights (the “ECHR”) and Article 1 (“Protection of property”) of the First Protocol to
the ECHR, and that the Respondent has breached those provisions.*’ Article 7(1)

provides:

If the legislation of either Contracting Party or present or future
mutual international obligations of the two Contracting Parties
additional to this Agreement should give rise to a general or
specific agreement which accords to the investments of investors
from the other Contracting Party more favourable treatment
than is provided for by this Agreement, such arrangement shall
have precedence over this Agreement, in so far as it is more
favourable.

The Claimants assert that Article 6 of the ECHR and Article 1 of the First Protocol to
the ECHR grant more favourable treatment to the Claimants’ investment than that
already provided by the Treaty.*® They then contend that the Respondent breached these
protections by not permitting the Claimants or Syrena Hotels to participate in
proceedings concerning their property rights, and by failing to make a determination on

the Claimants’ property rights over the last decades.*°

Until the Hearing, the Respondent did not appear to specifically challenge the
Claimants’ reliance on the ECHR through the operation of Article 7(1). Instead, it

contended that the Claimants’ arguments in relation to Article 6 of the ECHR and

Article 1 of the First Protocol to the ECHR were “unintelligible”.°? Then, at the

Hearing, the Respondent added the following:

it is unviable to say that the [EHCR] envisages a higher standard
of protection than the BIT, which is specifically meant to protect
the investments. So the Claimants would also have to explain
what specifically is the standard that they alleged was breached,
why is it different from the BIT standard.

In any case, we submit that the Tribunal should not be exercising
jurisdiction over alleged violations of the [ECHR] on this rather
invented interpretation of Article 7(1) of the BIT. This would
lead to an unreasonable extension of the Tribunal's jurisdiction.
The Tribunal should of course take the European Convention
into account in interpreting the BIT standards, because
investment law at the end of the day is also protection of human
rights, right to property. But the Tribunal does not have
jurisdiction to hold Poland responsible for alleged breaches of
the European Convention on Human Rights even under the
widest possible interpretation of Article 7(1) of the BIT.°!

Whilst the Tribunal considers that human rights violations may be relevant to an
investment dispute, and a tribunal constituted under a BIT is competent to decide them,
the Tribunal finds that the Claimants did not make any further submissions on this
claim during the Hearing, in their Post-Hearing Brief or in their Reply Post-Hearing
Brief. Thus, it would appear that the Claimants are no longer pursuing this claim. If
they did wish to maintain a claim under the ECHR, they would have needed to address
the operation of Article 7(1) of the Treaty and the Tribunal’s mandate to apply
international obligations set forth in other treaties. They also would have had to state in
an understandable way how the ECHR’s “protection of property” and “the right to fair
trial” constitute an “agreement which accords to the Claimants’ investments more
favourable treatment than is provided for by” the Treaty. Moreover, the Claimants
would need to provide a basic statement about how the alleged facts satisfy the elements

ofa breach under Article 6 of the ECHR and Article 1 of the First Protocol to the ECHR.

°° Jur. Reply, §/ 58 (“The Respondent accepts that cases dealing with restitution of property ... can raise other
issues, such as e.g. delay of justice or denial of access to court. Some of the Claimants’ arguments seem to be
referring to these issues. They are, however, unintelligible. When invoking the ECHR under the principle of
most favorable treatment, the Claimants argue that ‘Poland should have determined Claimants’, respectively the
Company’s, property rights within a reasonable time, which it obviously has not done over decades” and that
“neither Claimants nor the Company were admitted as a party and offered the opportunity to present its case in
several proceedings ...’ The Respondent cannot be expected to meet a case formulated in this way”.)

Without these submissions from the Claimants, the Tribunal cannot conclude that it has
jurisdiction to rule on the Respondent’s obligations under the ECHR. Nor can the
Tribunal conclude that the facts as pleaded by the Claimants, if true, would be capable
of establishing a violation of Article 7(1) of the Treaty. Therefore, the Tribunal must
find that, to the extent the Claimants maintain their claim under Article 7(1), they have

failed to meet the prima facie test.
(8) Article 7(2) (Umbrella Clause)

The Claimants contend that the Respondent breached the “umbrella clause” in

Article 7(2) of the Treaty,°” which provides:

Each Contracting Party shall comply with any contractual
obligation it may have entered into with respect to investors from
the other Contracting Party concerning investments which it has
authorized in its territory.”>

According to the Claimants, the Respondent violated this provision of the Treaty by
failing to comply with certain provisions of the SPA. The Claimants’ position is

summarised as follows:

Respondent breached contractual obligations within the
meaning of Article 7 (2) of the BIT at least by:

* Transferring the hotel businesses including the hotels Polonia,
Metropol and the related land plots encumbered with third-party
claims (Art. 2.3.1 of the SPA);

+ Forcing the investors to invest into hotel buildings in a long-
term perspective, despite the existence of encumbrances (Art 4.2
of the SPA);

* Granting pre-emptive ownership rights in relation to land
plots that are encumbered with third-party claims (Art. 3.6 of the
SPA).°*

°3 This is the English translation provided on slide 115 of the Claimants’ Hearing Presentation. During the
Hearing, the Parties disagreed on the translation of Article 7.2. The Claimants read Article 7.2 to state “shall
comply with” whereas the Respondent reads it as “shall respect” or “shall keep”. Hearing Transcript D1.189 and
D2.21. This linguistic distinction does not affect the Tribunal’s decision in this Award.

The Claimants argue that the obligations undertaken by the City of Warsaw in the SPA
are attributable to the Respondent, because the City of Warsaw was acting as “an
administrative State organ in exercise of its governmental authority with the purpose to

give effect to Respondent’s privatisation policy in regard to State-owned enterprises”.

The Respondent has raised a series of objections in connection with this claim. First,
the Respondent argues that it cannot bear responsibility for contractual obligations
undertaken by the City of Warsaw, which is a fully independent unit with a separate
legal personality. The Respondent states that under Polish law, which governs both the
SPA and the status and legal capacity of the City of Warsaw, the City is a legal entity
distinct from the Republic of Poland.” Therefore, according to the Respondent, Article
7(2) of the Treaty cannot apply “due to lack of any contractual arrangement concluded
between the Respondent and any of the Claimants”.°” The Respondent accepts that
under international law, an action of the City of Warsaw that amounts to a breach of
the protective standards of the Treaty might be attributable to Poland.** However, the
Respondent submits that there is a “clear distinction exists between the responsibility
of a State for the conduct of an entity that violates international law (e.g. a breach of
Treaty), and the responsibility of a State for the conduct of an entity that breaches a
domestic law contract (e.g. the SPA)’.°? The Respondent considers that the
international law on State responsibility does not apply to the latter. According to the

Respondent, its position is confirmed “by plentiful arbitral precedent”. !°°

In any event, even if the acts of the City of Warsaw could be attributed to Poland, the
Respondent’s position is that Article 7(2) of the Treaty does not protect the Claimants

against those acts.!°! This is because, according to the Respondent, umbrella clauses in

The Respondent denies that any of the alleged
actions of the City of Warsaw, which was acting as the “Seller” under the SPA, could

qualify as acts of puissance publique.

5.81 Separately, the Respondent asserts that Raiffeisen and SIHAG “lack legal standing to
pursue the claims relating to the SPA”.!°> According to the Respondent, only Strabag,
as the legal successor to Bau Holdings (the signatory of the SPA), has rights in relation
to the SPA and the Bank Guarantee provided thereunder, and indeed, only Strabag is
involved in the domestic court proceedings concerning the SPA and the use of the Bank
Guarantee. Therefore, in the Respondent’s view, Strabag alone is entitled to advance
any claims in relation to the SPA and the Bank Guarantee. The Respondent notes that
the Claimants have made various statements about the transfer of shares from Strabag
to SIHAG, but for the Respondent, these statements are incoherent. '* In any event, the
Respondent asserts that there has never been a “formal assumption of obligations
arising out of the SPA by SIHAG and/or [Raiffeisen] nor any assignment of the
SPA”.!°5 Thus, the Respondent concludes that the Claimants have failed to meet their

burden of proof in relation to the standing of Raiffeisen and SIHAG.!°°

5.82 In response, the Claimants contend that although some tribunals have focused on the
requirement of privity under the umbrella clause, “there is also a strong notion that it
may not be required”.!°7 In the Claimants’ view, based on the specific facts of this case,

a strict privity requirement should not be applied.

5.83 As noted above, the Claimants argue that the actions (and omissions) of the City of

Warsaw are attributable to the Respondent under international law because the City is

a State organ that was exercising governmental authority when entering into the SPA.
The sale of Syrena Hotels was carried out pursuant to the Privatisation Act adopted by
the Polish Parliament in 1990, and the purpose of the SPA was to accomplish the State
policy of privatising State-owned enterprises. In the Claimants’ view, these facts
distinguish the present case from Jmpregilo v Pakistan, which concerned an ordinary

private law contract for construction works. !°

Regarding the standing of Raiffeisen and SIHAG, the Claimants admit that neither
company has signed the SPA. However, the Claimants’ position is that Raiffeisen and

SIHAG can assert claims in relation to the SPA and the Bank Guarantee because:

(i) the obligations of the Buyer under the SPA have been fulfilled
on equal parts by all three [Claimants]; (ii) this was known to
Respondent and Respondent even approved it and most
importantly (iii) Respondent was at all times aware that any
violation of its obligations under the SPA would not only cause
damage to STRABAG but to SIHAG and [Raiffeisen] as well.'°

In this context, the Claimants allege that on 20 December 1999, the City of Warsaw
and SIHAG entered into a separate share purchase agreement for the sale and purchase
of additional 5% in Syrena Hotels, demonstrating that the City of Warsaw knew that
SIHAG had relied on the promises contained in the SPA when making this investment,
and that SIHAG would be responsible for fulfilling the “Buyer’s” contractual
obligations under the SPA.!!°

Specifically with regard to the Bank Guarantee, the Claimants contend that although
Strabag provided the Guarantee, “it represents a subordinate and instrumental aspect
with respect to Claimants’ overall investment” as defined in the Treaty.!!! According
to the Claimants, it is part and parcel of the investment, and the drawing of the Bank
Guarantee is part of the Respondent’s conduct toward the Claimants’ investment.

Moreover, all three Claimants have had to bear the costs and outlays connected with

the Guarantee. Thus, the Claimants consider that they are all entitled to rely on the Bank

Guarantee to establish their case.'!”

The Tribunal has considered these opposing submissions of the Parties and concludes
that the Respondent’s objections relating to the Claimants’ claim under Article 7(2) and
the standing of Raiffeisen and SIHAG should be joined to the merits of the Parties’
dispute. This will ensure that both Parties have a full opportunity to make their
respective cases on the proper interpretation of the legal framework and its application
to the facts, taking into account the competing legal theories and lines of jurisprudence

that the Parties have touched upon in this phase of the proceeding.
Q) Article 8 (Arbitration Agreement)

The Claimants contend that Poland breached Article 8(1) (“Settlement of Investment

Disputes”) of the Treaty, which provides in material part:

If disputes should arise between one Contracting Party and an
investor from the other Contracting Party with regard to an
investment, such dispute shall be resolved amicably between the
parties themselves if possible...

According to the Claimants, they notified the Respondent of a dispute under the Treaty
on 19 December 2012 and subsequently sent at least four additional letters to remind
the Respondent of the issues in dispute. The Claimants state that in each of these letters,
they “declared their willingness to resolve the dispute”.!!? Yet the Respondent took
more than six months to inform the Claimants of the official who had been designated
to look into the matter, and that Minister then “unlawfully denied the [Claimants’]

rights”. !!4

The Claimants do not mention the claim under Article 8(1) of the Treaty in their
submissions following the Request for Arbitration. It thus appears that they do not

maintain it.

In any event, the Tribunal considers that the claim does not meet the prima facie test.

The Claimants’ complaint appears to be based on the fact that the Respondent failed to

engage in negotiations or make other efforts to reach an amicable settlement. However,
Article 8(1) contains no mandatory obligation to resolve a dispute amicably. It only
provides that the Parties shall resolve a dispute shall be resolved amicably “if possible”.

Therefore, no violation of Article 8(1) is possible on the basis of the alleged facts.

As a final point, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent also objected to the Claimants’
request for relief in relation to the Respondent’s alleged violation of rights under
international law in general, Polish law, and “other international obligations”.!! In their
most recent request for relief,!!® the Claimants have omitted these references.

Therefore, the Tribunal considers this aspect of the Respondent’s objection moot.
(10) The Tribunal’s Decision

For the reasons stated above, the Tribunal has decided that the Claimants have met the
threshold of presenting prima facie claims for breach of the following provisions of the
Treaty: Article 2(1) (fair and equitable treatment), Article 2(2) (full protection),
Article 3 (“Treatment of Investments”) and Article 4 (expropriation). The Tribunal
therefore rejects the Respondent’s objections relating to a lack of prima facie claim

under these provisions of the Treaty.

By contrast, the Tribunal has decided that the Claimants have not presented a prima
facie claim for breach of Article 5 (“Transfer”), Article 7(1) (“Other Obligations”) or
Article 8 (arbitration agreement) of the Treaty. The Tribunal therefore upholds the

Respondent’s objections relating to a lack of prima facie claim under these provisions.

The Tribunal does not, in this Award, render any decision on the Respondent’s
objections to the Claimants’ claim under Article 7(2) (umbrella clause) and the standing
of Raiffeisen and SIHAG to assert claims in relation to the SPA and the Bank
Guarantee. These objections shall be joined to the merits of the Parties’ dispute and

decided by the Tribunal in the next phase of the proceeding.

PART VI: ABUSE OF PROCESS
Introduction

The Tribunal briefly sets out the contrasting positions of the Parties on this objection

before recording its analysis and decision.!

The Respondent’s Case

In summary, the Respondent contends that the Claimants’ case fails to meet the
jurisdictional requirements imposed by the Treaty by reason of the Claimants’ abuse

of process.”

According to the Respondent, the Treaty’s jurisdictional requirements require that the
Claimants’ claims must not be “abusive”, meaning that the Treaty process must not be
used by the Claimants for a purpose, or in a way, significantly different from its proper

use.* The Respondent submits that the Treaty process is being abused if:

the claimant uses it to achieve an undue “collateral advantage”,
e.g. by pursuing claims of a purely contractual nature under a
BIT disguise, to avoid engaging in a good-faith contractual
controversy with the respondent and to harass the respondent
with demands which are clearly not available under the contract.
The BIT process is also abused if it is treated as a “fourth
instance”, merely to unreasonably multiply proceedings and to
retry the very matter which has already been resolved or is
pending before the domestic court, while there are no specific
allegations of any BIT provisions having been breached in the
domestic proceedings.*

' In addition to the arguments discussed in this Part, the Respondent has accused the Claimants of improper
“corporate manoeuvring”. Jur. Memorial, §j 127. This issue is addressed in Part VII below.

6.6

The Respondent relies, in particular, upon the article by Professor Hervé, “Abuse of

5

Process in International Investment Arbitration”,? and the decision in Azinian v

Mexico.°

According to the Respondent, the Claimants in the present case have committed an

abuse of process by, inter alia:

- pursuing their essentially contractual claims in international arbitration to gain
undue collateral advantage, by seeking to pressure the Respondent to deprive third
parties of their rights arising from laws and policies that were in place at the time

that the Claimants made their investment;”

- pursuing the claims relating to the Bank Guarantee before Polish and Austrian

courts and then bringing the same claims in this arbitration.*

The Claimants’ Case

In summary, the Claimants contend that the Respondent’s abuse of process theory has
no merit and is unsupported by any authority.? According to the Claimants, it is
perfectly legitimate for the same set of facts to give rise to both contractual claims and
treaty claims. The Claimants state that, contrary to the Respondent’s submission, they
have not invoked the provisions of the Treaty in any proceedings before the Polish
Courts.'° Rather, “the domestic court proceedings in Poland are based on breaches of
Polish domestic law only, whereas this arbitration case concerns the international
responsibility of Respondent under international law for breaches of the BIT”.'! The
Claimants further deny that their arguments relating to the Bank Guarantee constitute a

collateral attack. !?

Therefore, in the Claimants’ view, there has been no multiplication of the same legal

proceedings and no collateral advantage.

The Claimants affirm that they “do not seek double-recovery and herewith declare

bindingly and irrevocably to ensure that any compensation awarded in this arbitration

will be respected in the proceedings under domestic law”. !

The Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision

As a preliminary matter, it is recognized, and the Tribunal agrees, that the threshold for
finding an abusive initiation of an investment claim is high. It is equally accepted that

the notion of abuse does not imply a showing of bad faith.'*

Regarding the relationship between the contractual claims resulting from the SPA and
the international law claims resulting from the BIT, the Tribunal recalls from the

Hearing the following exchange:

THE PRESIDENT: Maybe I can put it another way. You know
from cases like Vivendi, going up to a case like Bayindir v
Pakistan, where Professor Béckstiegel was one of the
arbitrators, the claim could be made in contract or in treaty, and
yet both tribunals allowed the claim to go forward as a treaty
breach, even though to -- and I will say "to a layman", because
I was counsel in one of those cases -- it might seem to be an
obvious contract claim, with an arbitration clause, a contract
with applicable law, and so on and so forth. These tribunals
draw a very clear distinction between a treaty breach and a
contract breach. You can have a treaty breach without a contract
breach, you can have a treaty breach with a contract breach, but
of itself that doesn't make it an abuse of process to bring a treaty
claim before an investment treaty tribunal. So the cases seem to
be more against you than with you. But if you can think of a case
in addition to the case you cited, Azinian, we'd like to hear it.

MR DROZD: Well, I have to clarify something, not to mislead
the Tribunal. I did not quote the Azinian case as an authority
supporting my submission, because it doesn't. It's not an
authority to support this principle. It speaks of something
completely different: it speaks of what I described as a collateral
attack on a decision of a municipal court. To be frank, I think I
might not be able to indicate the authorities which you enquire

about, Mr President. But I would like to explain one thing. I do
appreciate, and I completely agree, that conceptually there is a
distinction between a contract claim and a treaty claim, and the
same facts can lead to a contract claim or a BIT claim
completely legitimately. It is just like the same facts could lead
to a contract claim or a tort claim; the same facts could give the
Claimants grounds for those two separate claims.

Thus, there seems to be agreement that, substantially, contract claims and treaty claims
do not exclude each other. The same is true procedurally: claims allegedly resulting
from the SPA based on Polish domestic law can be pursued in domestic court
proceedings in Poland, and claims allegedly resulting from the Treaty concerning
the international responsibility of the Respondent under international law and can

only be pursued in the present arbitration.

On one hand, the Claimants have not submitted any claims alleging breaches of the
Treaty in their proceedings before the Polish courts. On the other hand, the relief
requested by the Claimants in the present arbitration is only based on alleged breaches
of the Treaty, as confirmed in their request for relief, which opens with this introductory
sentence: “Based on the foregoing, Respondent assumed liability under the BIT and is
liable for the breaches and other violations of the BIT’s provisions caused by its

authorities. Claimants request an award granting the following relief...”.'°

The Tribunal sees no reason why raising the claims under Polish domestic law before
the Polish courts would make it an abuse to raise the alleged breaches of the Treaty as
claims according to the dispute settlement provisions in Article 8 of the Treaty. These
latter claims could not be raised to any other forum. Whether they are valid claims is a

separate issue, which will have to be examined in the merits phase of this arbitration.

Therefore, the Tribunal holds that the Respondent has not established any basis for

finding an abuse of process. The Respondent’s objection is dismissed.

PART VII: JUS STANDI
Introduction

The Tribunal briefly sets out the contrasting positions of the Parties on this objection

before recording its analysis and decision.

The Respondent’s Case

In summary, the Respondent contends that the Claimants do not qualify as investors
covered by the Treaty as they have transferred their investment in Syrena Hotels to
SIHOL, a national of a third State, Cyprus, which is not a signatory to the Treaty.! The
Respondent asserts that by virtue of this transfer, the Cyprus-Poland BIT is potentially
applicable to the dispute and that the Treaty governing the present claim should no

longer apply.”

The Respondent submits that the case law developed by investment tribunals on the
issue of “corporate manoeuvring” states that as long as the transfer of investment is not
abusive, investors may transfer their investments to nationals of third States, and render
the new investment treaty applicable.* However, the Respondent argues that

consequently, such a transfer should also render the original treaty inapplicable.*

The Respondent has clarified that it does not question, as a matter of principle, that an
indirect investor can claim treaty protection.> Rather, it asserts that if two treaties are
potentially applicable, this potential conflict of treaties should be resolved.° The
Respondent submits that the conflict should be resolved by considering the purpose and
underlying values of both the treaties in order to determine which treaty should

adequately apply to the investment.”

7.8

In support of its argument, the Respondent cites the decisions in Lauder v Czech
Republic’ and CME v Czech Republic,? where the investors used both the United States-
Czech Republic BIT and the Netherlands-Czech Republic BIT to initiate two parallel
arbitration proceedings which led to conflicting decisions being rendered by the
respective tribunals.'° The Respondent submits that multiplication of BIT proceedings
is a “category of abuse of process”.!'! The Respondent further submits that rules on
jurisdiction should prevent such situations, and that the transfer of an investment should

either be effective from the viewpoint of applicability of a given treaty, or not.'?

In sum, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal (i) decline jurisdiction on the ground
that the Claimants no longer qualify as investors under the Treaty;'* or (ii) at the least,
in the decision on jurisdiction, make the Claimants’ choice of treaty final such that any
attempt by the Claimants to initiate proceedings under another treaty, in effectively the

same case as the present, is considered abusive. '*

As regards the final choice of treaty, the Respondent acknowledges the Claimants’
explanations from the Jurisdictional Counter-Memorial as a declaration that the
Claimants will not bring a related claim under the Cyprus-Poland BIT if the Tribunal
dismisses the Respondent’s objection on jus standi.!° However, at the Hearing, the
Respondent has raised doubts as to the Claimants’ declaration and has sought that the
Tribunal “arrive at some sort of a conflict of treaty rule which would establish which

of the potentially applicable bilateral investment treaties should govern this case”.!®

The Claimants’ Case

In summary, the Claimants contend that they have standing as investors under the

Treaty. They argue that that even after the formation of SIHOL, the Claimants still have

submit that the third Claimant (Austrian holding company SIHAG) is controlled

The Claimants further submit that there has been no “transfer” of investment to SIHOL
as SIHOL is only an “intermediary” and a “shell corporation” without having any active
business operation or decision-making authority itself.?°

According to the Claimants, the purpose behind setting up SIHOL was to set up a fully
controlled investment vehicle for tax optimization purposes.”! The Claimants also state
that at all relevant times, they were and still are the true beneficial owners of the

investment.”?

The Claimants contend that they “qualify as both direct and indirect Austrian

23

investors”** which are “entitled to assert claims for breaches of the BIT concerning all

investments including those which they indirectly own”.*

The Claimants rely on the provisions of the Treaty to justify their standing as indirect
investors. They submit that the definitions of “investment” and “investor” under
Articles 1(1) and 1(2) respectively of the Treaty are broad and do not require the
investor to be the direct owner of the investment.”> They further assert that Article 4(1)
of the Treaty “speaks of ‘Investments of investors’, and there is no sign that an
investment of an investor under Article 4(1) is any different from an investment under

Article 1(1)”.7°

The Claimants further submit that in order to be an investor under Article 1(2) of the

Treaty, the requirement is that the investment should be “of” nationals of a Contracting

Party and it should be situated “in” the territory of a Contracting party.’’ The Claimants
submit that they fulfil these requirements by being Austrian nationals that have an
“investment” in a company which is located in Poland.** The Claimants also state that
their participation in Syrena Hotels, cash inflows into the hotels, the investment

guarantees etc., all amount to investments pursuant to Article 1(1) of the Treaty.7°

It is also the Claimants’ case that the “alleged transfer” of investment to SIHOL has not
been abusive and consequently the Cyprus-Poland BIT would be rendered applicable.*°
The Claimants distinguish their case from that of “corporate manoeuvring” or “treaty-
shopping” on the basis that they have chosen not to base their claim on the “new”

Cyprus-Poland BIT but instead, have brought their claims under the original Treaty.*!

In the Jurisdictional Reply Memorial, the Claimants “reassure” the Respondent that the
Claimants will not initiate another arbitration proceeding under the Cyprus-Poland
BIT.*? At the Hearing, the Claimants further stated that “SIHOL has no intention to

commence treaty arbitration of its own”.**

The Claimants contend that despite the applicability of the Cyprus-Poland BIT to the
case at hand, the Tribunal is not deprived of its jurisdiction under the Treaty.*# In this
regard, the Claimants rely on the decision in CME where the tribunal concluded that
the fact that another claim may exist under a different treaty, whether deriving from the
same facts or otherwise, did not deprive either CME or Mr. Lauder of jurisdiction under

the respective treaties.*°

The Claimants disagree with the Respondent’s submission that rules on jurisdiction
should prevent situations of conflicting decisions as in the CME and Lauder cases.*°

look into the necessity and purpose of both treaties to determine which would apply

more adequately to the Claimants’ situation at hand.>”

The Claimants assert that both treaties are part of the laws of Poland and there is no
such principle that one treaty should supersede the other.** They rely on the decision of
the Svea Court of Appeal in Czech Republic v CME, which, according to the Claimants,
“found that the fact itself that CME and Lauder were able to commence two arbitration
proceedings under two different treaties ‘militates against these legal principles being
applicable at all””.*°

The Claimants argue that it is not for this Tribunal to finally decide on the applicability
of the Cyprus-Poland BIT.*° Further, according to the Claimants, any overlap between
arbitrations under two different treaties should be a question of merits and not that of

jurisdiction.!

The Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision

In light of the Parties’ positions set out above, the Tribunal has to decide whether or not
the Claimants have standing as investors under the Treaty. In order to reach a
conclusion on this issue, the Tribunal shall consider whether (1) the Claimants’
corporate restructuring amounts to “corporate manoeuvring” such as to deprive them
of standing in these proceedings; and (2) following the corporate restructuring, the

Claimants remain “investors” with an “investment” under the Treaty.

() Whether the Claimants’ corporate restructuring constitutes “corporate

manoeuvring”

The Respondent submits that as long as the transfer of investment is not abusive,
investors may transfer their investments to nationals of third states, and gain protection
under a new investment treaty.4? While the Respondent does not contend that the

Claimants’ restructuring is abusive in itself, it alleges that the potential applicability of

the Cyprus-Poland BIT along with the Treaty could lead to abuse if the Claimants file
multiple proceedings under the both treaties.** As an example, the Respondent cites the

parallel arbitrations and conflicting decisions in CME and Lauder.**

The Claimants agree with the Respondent that the transfer of their investment to SIHOL
renders the Cyprus-Poland BIT potentially applicable.4* However, they distinguish
their case from that of a “corporate manoeuvring” or “treaty-shopping” exercise
because the Claimants have chosen not to base their claim under the Cyprus-Poland
BIT but instead, have brought their claims under the original Treaty.*° The Claimants
have reiterated this stance in several declarations that they do not intend to bring a claim

through SIHOL under the Cyprus-Poland BIT.*”

The question before the Tribunal is whether the Claimants’ transfer of investment to
SIHOL amounts to “corporate manoeuvring” or is abusive insofar as it may give SIHOL
the opportunity to make a claim akin to the present claim under the Cyprus-Poland BIT,

and if so, whether the Tribunal should decline its jurisdiction for this reason.

It is undisputed between the Parties that an investment may be legitimately restructured
and accordingly render a new investment treaty applicable, as long as the restructuring

is not abusive.**

Abuse of process may arise, for example, where a corporate claimant makes or
restructures its investment in order to gain access to treaty protection when the dispute
has already arisen or is foreseeable. These are not the circumstances in the present case.
Moreover, it is undisputed that the Claimants have, up to now, not sought to claim under

the Cyprus-Poland BIT, but have only claimed under the original Treaty.

However, the Respondent still argues that abuse may occur due to the
possible application of two different treaties, with the potential for multiple

proceedings thereunder.*”

The Tribunal does not agree with the Respondent’s contention. The Claimants are
correct to state that this Tribunal does not have to decide on the applicability of the
Cyprus-Poland BIT in the present case.*° Even if the Cyprus-Poland BIT is potentially
applicable, the mere possibility of SIHOL bringing a related claim under the Cyprus-
Poland BIT does not provide a basis for this Tribunal to abdicate its jurisdiction.*! Any
question of abuse could only arise and be addressed if and when the Claimants actually
sought the protection of both the Treaty and the Cyprus-Poland BIT. In that sense, any

objection by the Respondent in this respect is premature.

The Respondent’s example of conflicting decisions in CME and Lauder does not further
its cause. Unlike in CME and Lauder, the Claimants in the present case have not filed
a parallel claim under the Cyprus-Poland BIT. Moreover, the Claimants have indicated

that “SIHOL has no intention to commence treaty arbitration of its own.”*?

In the circumstances, and taking into account the Claimants’ repeated assurances that
they only seek to avail themselves of the Treaty and not the Cyprus-Poland BIT, the
Tribunal considers that the Claimants have made their “choice of treaty” clear, as
sought by the Respondent.» The Tribunal does not consider further directions with

respect to the Claimants’ choice of treaty to be necessary.

The Tribunal further disagrees with the Respondent’s submission that the potential
application of two treaties has led to a “conflict of treaties”, and that a conflict of treaty
tule should be applied in this case to resolve the conflict and determine which BIT is

the more “adequate” for the present case.**

In this case, no conflict between the two treaties has arisen that requires resolution by
the Tribunal for the purpose of establishing its jurisdiction. The Tribunal wishes to
emphasise that unlike the case in CME and Lauder, no second claim has been made by
the Claimants under the Cyprus-Poland BIT, such that a question arises as to which one

is a more “adequate” BIT.

Accordingly, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to look into the purpose and
underlying values of both the treaties in order to determine which treaty most

adequately applies to the investment.

Given these factors, the Tribunal concludes that Claimants have not indulged in
“corporate manoeuvring” so as to abuse the Treaty mechanism; nor do they lose their
standing as investors under the Treaty only because a claim through SIHOL could

possibly lie, but has not been made, under the Cyprus-Poland BIT.
(2) Whether the Claimants remain investors with an investment under the Treaty

In the Jurisdictional Reply Memorial, the Respondent acknowledges that the Claimants
can legitimately transfer their investment to nationals of third States, and render the
Cyprus-Poland BIT applicable.*> However, the Respondent submits that, as a corollary,

this transfer should render the present Treaty inapplicable.*°

The Claimants submit that they have been and remain the true beneficial owners of the
investment.*’ They argue that there has been no “transfer” of investment to SIHOL as
it is only an “intermediary” and a “shell corporation” created for tax optimization
purposes, without any active business operation or decision-making authority.** The
Tribunal does not read the Claimants’ submission in the literal sense such that there
was no actual transfer of shares to SIHOL, but understands it to mean that there has
been no effective transfer of the investment away from the Claimants in favour of
SIHOL. The Claimants also submit that they incur all profits, losses or financial

consequences in connection with the operation of the investment.*?

The Respondent has not seriously challenged the Claimants’ explanation that SIHOL
was created for tax optimisation purposes and operates as a shell corporation. The
Tribunal is satisfied that SIHOL is the Claimants’ shell corporation, which has only

been interposed between the Claimants and the investment.

With regard to their corporate structure, the Claimants further submit that Austrian
entities Strabag and Raiffeisen jointly and wholly own and control the Austrian entity
SIHAG. SIHAG wholly owns and controls the Cypriot company SIHOL, which in turn
holds 99.615% of Syrena Hotels.°! At the Hearing, the Claimants presented the
following chart to illustrate their current corporate structure (already reproduced in Part

I above):

As illustrated in the corporate chart above, SIHOL is a wholly owned subsidiary of the
third Claimant (SIHAG). According to the Claimants, which has not been disputed by
the Respondent, SIHAG is owned 51% percent by the first Claimant (Strabag) and 49%

by the second Claimant (Raiffeisen).

This corporate structure is not in dispute between the Parties. By virtue of this corporate
structure, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Claimants directly (the third Claimant) and
indirectly (the first and second Claimants) own SIHOL, and through SIHOL indirectly

own the Company.

The relevant question is whether the Claimants, with this corporate structure, have

standing as indirect investors under the Treaty.

7.41 The Respondent submits that it does not question, as a matter of principle, “the indirect
investor’s ability to avail itself of its national investment treaty.“ Rather, the
Respondent asserts that if two treaties are potentially applicable, it is an issue of
“potential conflict” of treaties.° Even at the Hearing, the Respondent’s focus as regards
the issue of the Claimants’ jus standi was that the Tribunal should arrive at a conflict

of treaties rule.® This assertion has already been rejected by the Tribunal.*”

7.42 For the sake of completeness, the Tribunal shall nevertheless analyse whether the
Claimants, as indirect holders of SIHOL, still hold an “investment” within the meaning
of Article 1(1) of the Treaty, and can bring a claim as “investors” under Article 1(2) of

the Treaty.
7.43 Article 1(1) of the Treaty defines “investment” as follows:

For the purpose of this Agreement:

(1) The term “investment” shall include all assets, in particular
but not exclusively:

a) Ownership of movable and immovable property and other
rights in rem, such as mortgages, rights of retention, pledges,
rights of usufruct, and similar rights;

b) Participation rights and other types of participations in
enterprises;

c) Claims to money provided in order to create an economic
value or claims to performances having an economic value;
and

d) Copyrights, industrial property rights such as inventor’s
patents, trademarks and industrial designs and models,
registered designs, technical procedures, know-how, trade
names and good will.

7.44 Article 1(2) of the Treaty defines an “investor” as follows:

(2) The term “investor” shall mean:

a) Any individual possessing the nationality of one of the
Contracting Parties and undertaking an investment in the

territory of the other Contracting Party;

b) Any juridical person, organization or association, with or
without legal personality, lawfully established in accordance
with the legislation of one of the Contracting Parties, having
its seat in the territory of that Contracting Party and
undertaking an investment in the territory of the other
Contracting Party.

With regard to the definition of the terms “investment” and “investor”, the Tribunal is
guided by Article 31 of the VCLT, which provides that a treaty “shall be interpreted in
good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty

in their context and in the light of its object and purpose”.

Under Article 1(1) of the Treaty, the term “investment” covers all assets, including
“ownership” of movable and immovable property and other rights in rem, such as

mortgages, rights of retention, pledges, rights of usufruct, and similar rights.

With respect to the ordinary meaning of the term “ownership”, the question is whether
ownership means direct ownership only, or also covers indirect ownership of an
investment. This question is not resolved by the express language of the Treaty. In order
to determine whether the Treaty contemplates direct ownership only, to the exclusion
of indirect ownership, the Tribunal shall consider the context of the term and the object

and purpose of the BIT.

“Ownership” of property is only one of the forms of investment listed in Article 1(1) of
the Treaty. Article 1(1) also mentions a broad array of investments by way of

participation rights, claims to money, etc.

Further, the object and purpose of the Treaty, as set out in its Preamble, is the

creation of:

favourable conditions for enhanced economic cooperation
between the Contracting Parties, Recognizing that the
encouragement and protection of reciprocal investments may
lead to greater willingness to undertake such investments and
thus make an important contribution to the development of
economic relationships.

Considering the broad categories of potential investments under Article 1(1), together

with the stated object and purpose of the Treaty to create favourable conditions for

Part VII — Page 15

7.51

7.52

7.53

7.54

7.55

7.56

investment, the Tribunal finds no basis for a narrow reading of the term “ownership”,

or for an implied requirement of “direct” ownership alone.

With respect to the definition of “investor” under Article 1(2) of the Treaty, the term
includes any individual possessing the nationality of one of the Contracting Parties and

undertaking an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party.

Like Article 1(1), Article 1(2) is framed broadly, with no express or implied basis to
require that only “direct” investors may claim protection under the Treaty, to the

exclusion of indirect investors.

The Tribunal therefore finds that the Claimants fulfil the requirements of Articles 1(1)
and 1(2) of the Treaty, in that they are Austrian entities that “own” the investment in
the Company which is situated in Poland, albeit, indirectly through their Cypriot
subsidiary SIHOL.

Accordingly, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that they remain “investors” with
in “investment” within the meaning of the Treaty even after the Cypriot company

SIHOL is interposed between the Claimants and the investment.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Claimants have submitted that the essential elements of
the current dispute had already arisen in May 2008, prior to the establishment of SIHOL
in October 2008.°* The Tribunal is of the view that the fact that the Claimants owned
the investment at the time of these alleged breaches should be sufficient for the

Claimants to have a standing in the present arbitration under the Treaty.

There is no requirement in the Treaty that an investor must prove continuous direct
ownership of its investment beyond the date of the alleged breach by the host State.
As the case may be, an alleged breach by the host State may actually deprive the
investor of the ownership of the investment and the affected investor may no longer

own the investment at the time of filing the claim. However, this does not and should

68 Jur, Rejoinder, § 154.

© In this respect, the Tribunal refers to the “continuous ownership” of an investment by an investor, and not to
the issue of “continuous nationality” which was at stake in Loewen v United States of America, ICSID Case No.

not prevent the affected investor from claiming protection as an investor under

the treaty.

In the same way, the formation of SIHOL as an intermediary company does not prevent
the Claimants from claiming protection on the basis of alleged breaches of the Treaty

pre-dating that restructuring.

Given these factors, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants retain standing as

investors under the Treaty.

For these reasons, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s jurisdictional objection

concerning the Claimants’ standing, or jus standi, as investors under the Treaty.

PART VIII: EU LAW AND THE ACHMEA JUDGMENT
Introduction

In this Part VIII, the Tribunal begins by summarising the Parties’ respective positions
on the Respondent’s jurisdictional objection under the laws of the EU, and in particular
the consequences of the Achmea Judgment. Thereafter, the observations of the
Commission on this matter are summarised. This is followed by the Tribunal’s analysis

and decision on the Respondent’s jurisdictional objection.

As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal considers it useful to reproduce Article 8 of the
Treaty, which is the investor-State dispute settlement (“ISDS”) clause therein, in its

relevant part:
Article 8
SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES
(1) — If disputes should arise between one Contracting Party and an investor

from the other Contracting Party with regard to an investment, such
disputes shall be resolved amicably between the parties themselves if

 

 

possible. If such amicable resolution is not ible, then the investor
shall exhaust all relevant domestic administrative and judicial
remedies.

(2) If such a dispute cannot be settled in a manner provided for in
paragraph I within 12 months from written notification of adequately
specified claims, it shall at the request of the Contracting Party or of
the investor from the other Contracting Party, be submitted for
conciliation or arbitration:

a to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes,
if both Contracting Parties are signatories to the Convention on
the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and
nationals of other States, opened for signature at Washington on
18 March 1965. In the event of arbitration, each of the
Contracting Parties, by becoming a signatory to this Agreement,
undertakes irrevocably and in advance, even if there should be no
individual arbitration agreement between a Contracting Party
and an investor, to submit such disputes to the Centre and to
recognize the arbitration award as binding.

b) to an international arbitral tribunal, if either of the Contracting
Parties is not a signatory to the Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes between States and nationals of other States.
The international arbitral tribunal shall be constituted on an ad

Part VIII — Page |

hoc basis in the following manner: each side shall appoint an
arbitrator, and these arbitrators shall agree on a chairman, who
shall be a national of a third State. The arbitrators shall be
appointed within two months from the date on which the investors
has notified the other Contracting Party of his desire to submit
the dispute to an arbitral tribunal and the chairman within further
two months.

If the time-limits given in the paragraph above are not observed
and if no other agreement is reached, either side may request the
President of the International Court of Justice to make the
necessary appointments. If the President of the International
Court of Justice is a national of either Contracting Party or if he
is unable to act for any other reason, the Vice-President or, if he
is unable to act, the longest-serving member of the International
Court of Justice, may under the same conditions be asked to make
the necessary appointments.

The arbitral tribunal shall determine its rules of procedure by
applying as appropriate the procedural rules of the Convention
on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and
nationals of other States of 18 March 1965; the decision shall
include a statement of the basis on which it has been made, and
supporting reasons shall be given if either side so requests.

(3) The decision of the tribunal shall be final and binding. It shall be
enforced by domestic law, and each Contracting Party shall ensure the
recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards in accordance with its
relevant legislation.

(4) Each side shall bear the costs of its own arbitrator and the costs of its
representation in the proceedings before the arbitral tribunal; the costs
of the chairman and the other costs shall be borne in equal shares by
both sides.

(5) A Contracting Party which is a party to a dispute shall not, at any stage
of the conciliation or arbitration proceedings or enforcement of an
arbitral award, raise an objection on the grounds that the investor who
is the other party to the dispute has received compensation for all or
some of its losses through an insurance policy.

B. The Respondent’s Position

8.3 In summary, the Respondent submits that Article 8 of the Treaty “should be deemed

invalid and/or inapplicable” because it conflicts with mandatory rules of EU law, as

Part VIII — Page 2

confirmed by the CJEU in the Achmea Judgment.! The Tribunal, therefore, lacks any

jurisdiction under the Treaty to decide the Parties’ dispute.

8.4 According to the Respondent, the Achmea Judgment is broad in scope and
unquestionably applies to Article 8 of the Treaty. The CJEU provided an “abstract and
general interpretation of EU law”. It was not based on the wording of the arbitration
clause there at issue (namely, Article 8 of the Agreement on encouragement and
reciprocal protection of investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the
Czech and Slovak Federal Republic 1991 (“Netherlands-Slovak Republic BIT”)) or the
specific circumstances of that case.7 Commentators, the Commission and EU Member

States have recognised the far reaching effects of the Achmea Judgment.?

8.5 In the Respondent’s submission, the Achmea Judgment applies to ISDS provisions in
all intra-EU BITs, regardless of whether the treaty at issue refers to EU law or whether
the case explicitly involves EU law.* The Respondent interprets the Achmea Judgment
as holding that, “even the mere possibility for the arbitral tribunal to adjudicate on the

basis of EU law suffices to recognise the ISDS mechanism as incompatible with EU

law”.

8.6 Thus, in the Respondent’s view, it is irrelevant that the Treaty does not contain an
applicable law clause.° The Respondent cites the applicable law provisions in Article

54(1) of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules (Arbitration) and paragraph 116 of

Procedural Order No 1, neither of which provides a carve-out for EU law,’ to contend
that “there is nothing that would prevent the Tribunal from applying EU law in case the
Tribunal considers it applicable”.* In this connection, the Respondent points to the
Claimants’ own statement that the Tribunal may need to refer to EU law in the merits

phase of this arbitration.”

The Respondent does not challenge the Claimants’ submission that the Parties’ dispute
will be governed by the Treaty and generally recognised principles of international law.
However, the Respondent asserts that “the principles of international law inevitably

include also the principles of EU law”.!°

The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ attempt to distinguish the present case from
Achmea on the basis of the place of the arbitration (there Frankfurt, Germany and here
Paris, France), contending that the CJEU answered general, abstract questions in the
Achmea Judgment, which are unrelated to the domestic law applicable to set aside
proceedings for an award.'! The Respondent contends that, in any event, contrary to
the Claimants’ assertion, Article 1520 of the French Code of Civil Procedure (“French
CPC”), like Article 1059(2) of the German Code of Civil Procedure, permits the setting

aside of an arbitral award that is not based on a valid arbitration agreement. !*

For the Respondent, it is irrelevant that the Claimants’ investment was made prior to
Poland’s accession to the EU. It contends that there is no temporal restriction in the
Achmea Judgment, moreover, the Parties’ dispute arose after Poland’s accession to the

Eu."

The Respondent contends that Article 8 of the Treaty is a clause “such as” the
arbitration clause considered by the CJEU in Achmea and thus expressly falls within

the scope of the Achmea Judgment. Thus, the Respondent concludes that, contrary to

the Claimants’ case, there is no basis on which to distinguish the present case from

Achmea.'*

Regarding the temporal application of the Achmea Judgment, the Respondent submits
that the Judgment has ex tunc effect, like all preliminary rulings of the CJEU. Therefore,
the CJEU’s interpretation of EU treaties must be applied from the time that the treaties

came into force.'°

The Respondent accepts that the Achmea Judgment does not expressly decide upon the
invalidity of ISDS provisions in all intra-EU BITs.'® Instead, the CJEU left the
assessment of the practical consequences of its Judgment to arbitral tribunals and courts
of the EU Member States adjudicating individual cases. However, in the Respondent’s
submission, the consequence for the present case is obvious in light of the CJEU’s clear,
general pronouncement that ISDS provisions in intra-EU BITs are incompatible with

EU law.

The Respondent’s primary case is that the Treaty was terminated on 1 May 2004 in
accordance with Article 59(1) VCLT."” It provides:

A treaty shall be considered as terminated if all the parties to it
conclude a later treaty relating to the same subject-matter and:

a) It appears from the later treaty or is otherwise established that
the parties intended that the matter should be governed by that
treaty; or

b) The provisions of the later treaty are so far incompatible with
those of the earlier one that the two treaties are not capable of
being applied at the same time.

Austria and Poland entered into the Treaty in 1988. Subsequently, Poland acceded to
the EU with effect from 1 May 2004 pursuant to the Accession Treaty of 2003 (the

“Accession Treaty”). Austria and Poland became parties to the TEC (which was

superseded on 1 December 2009 by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European

'4 With regard to the Claimants’ argument that the present case is different from Achmea because the Tribunal is
part of the Polish judicial system, the Respondent contends that the Claimants are wrong as a matter of fact, and

Union (“TFEU”)), creating the conflict between the Treaty and EU law that was

identified in the Achmea Judgment.

According to the Respondent, that conflict must be resolved by applying the /ex
posterior rule set forth in Article 59(1) VCLT, “resulting in the tacit termination of the
Treaty.”'® Contrary to the Claimants’ case, the Respondent considers it irrelevant that

the termination procedure in Article 11 of the Treaty has not been followed.'?

Alternatively, the Respondent contends that even if the Treaty were not terminated, the
arbitration clause in Article 8 of the Treaty is nonetheless inapplicable under Article

30(3) VCLT.”° It provides:

When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the
later treaty but the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended
in operation under Article 59, the earlier treaty applies only to
the extent that its provisions are compatible with those of the
later treaty.

The Respondent submits that in the Achmea Judgment, the CJEU confirmed that ISDS
provisions in intra-EU BITs are incompatible with Articles 267 and 344 TFEU. It
follows that Article 8 of the Treaty was rendered inapplicable when Poland acceded to

the EU in 2004.7!

The Respondent also relies on the Declaration of the Representatives of the
Governments of the Member States of 15 January 2019 on the legal consequences of
the Judgment of the Court of Justice in Achmea and on investment protection in the
European Union (the “Achmea Declaration”), signed by 22 EU Member States
(including the Treaty parties, Poland and Austria, and France, the place of this
arbitration), as confirmation that the principles established in the Achmea Judgment
were not specifically linked to the Netherlands-Slovak Republic BIT.”? The Respondent

contends that the Achmea Declaration constitutes a confirmation by the signatories that

“ISDS clauses contained in intra-EU BITs (including Article 8 of the Treaty) remain

8.19 For the Respondent, the interpretation and commitments undertaken under the Achmea
Declaration are /egally binding and fully applicable to the Treaty.*> The Respondent
submits that the Achmea Declaration constitutes an authentic interpretation of the
Treaty for the purposes of Article 31(3)(a) VCLT.° The Respondent contends that the
two other interpretative Declarations dated 16 January 2019, one signed by five other
EU Member States,?” and the other by one EU Member State** (together with the

Achmea Declaration, the “Declarations”) are irrelevant to this arbitration.

8.20 The Respondent considers the opinion of Advocate General Bot dated 29 January 2019
in CJEU Case 1/17 (“CETA Opinion”) to be irrelevant for the present case, as it was
rendered in connection with the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement
(“CETA”) and not in relation to intra-EU BITs. In any event, the Respondent points

out, the opinion is of a non-binding nature.”?

8.21 The Respondent concludes that, as a result of either the termination of the Treaty or the
inapplicability of Article 8, there is no valid agreement to arbitrate between the Parties.

The Tribunal therefore lacks jurisdiction to decide the Parties’ dispute.*°

any award on the merits rendered by the Tribunal would likely be set aside by the
French courts and would not be enforced in any EU Member State, as being contrary

to the EU ordre public.

Finally, the Respondent denies that its EU law jurisdictional objection is precluded as
being untimely. The Achmea Judgment constituted a critical new development that
could not have been raised in the Respondent’s initial pleadings on jurisdiction.*? In
any event, “the Tribunal is both entitled and obliged to consider the issue of its
jurisdiction ex officio”. In support of this proposition, Respondent relies on paragraph
28 of Procedural Order No 1 and Article 45(3) of ICSID Additional Facility Rules, as
well as general international law.*? There is no applicable principle or procedural rule
that could serve as a basis to preclude the EU law objection at any stage of these

arbitration proceedings. **

The Claimants’ Position

In summary, the Claimants contend that the Achmea Judgment has no effect upon the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction over the Parties’ dispute and that the Respondent’s EU law

objection should be dismissed by the Tribunal.

First, according to the Claimants, the Achmea Judgment is not binding on international
tribunals. Rather, the Tribunal is to determine its jurisdiction on the basis of Article 8(2)
of the Treaty and the Parties’ arbitration agreement. In doing so, “the Arbitral Tribunal
may consider the Achmea Judgement, if at all, merely as a fact”.*°

Second, the Claimants reject the Respondent’s arguments regarding the broad scope of
the Achmea Judgment.** In their submission, the Judgment must be understood in light

of the German Court’s reference to the CJEU and the CJEU’s reasoning, both of which

were made specifically in relation to Article 8 of the Netherlands-Slovak Republic

BIT.*”

According to the Claimants, there are several factors that distinguish the present case
from Achmea.** First, the Netherlands-Slovak Republic BIT at issue in Achmea
contained an applicable law clause which required an arbitral tribunal to “take into
account in particular the law in force in the contracting party concerned”.*? In contrast,
the Treaty does not contain an applicable law clause or any reference to domestic law
(including EU law).*°

In the Claimants’ submission, the Tribunal is under no obligation to interpret or apply
Polish law. Article 9(6) of the Treaty provides that disputes between the Contracting
Parties as to the interpretation or application of the Treaty are to be decided in
accordance with the Treaty and international law. The same approach should apply to

investor-State disputes under the Treaty.*!

For the Claimants, paragraph 116 of Procedural Order No 1 “does not change anything”
because it “does not have the legal quality of a treaty (like Art 8(6) of the Netherlands-
Slovak Republic BIT)”.*? In any event, if the Tribunal were to consider Polish law as
somehow relevant to the merits, “it would not have to apply or to interpret it but to treat

it merely as a fact”.*

According to the Claimants, this is a highly relevant distinction because the wording of
the applicable law clause in the Netherlands-Slovak Republic BIT was decisive to the
CJEU’s finding that an arbitral tribunal might be called on to interpret EU law. For
this reason, it is impossible to find that Article 8 of the Treaty is a clause “such as” the

arbitration clause at issue in Achmea.**

The other related distinction identified by the Claimants is that “in Achmea the

application of core principles of EU law made the interpretation of the European

Treaties necessary”, whereas no EU laws would have to be interpreted or applied in this

arbitration.“

At the same time, the Claimants appear to accept that “the Arbitral Tribunal might at

the merits stage of the present arbitration have to consider or apply EU law”.*”

However, the Claimants reject the Respondent’s submission that such a hypothetical
possibility of the application of EU law could deprive an arbitral tribunal of jurisdiction
pursuant to the Achmea Judgment. According to the Claimants, the logical consequence
of the Respondent’s argument would be that a// investment treaties involving an EU

Member State would be invalid.**

Third, the Claimants emphasise that the place of arbitration and the corresponding /ex
fori in the present case differ from that in Achmea. The Claimants’ position is

summarised as follows:

... according to the [Achmea] Judgement, an award can be set
aside pursuant to Art 1059(2) German Civil Procedure Code.
The grounds for setting aside an award under that provision
include the arbitration agreement being invalid under the law to
which the parties have subjected it, and the recognition or
enforcement of the award would be contrary to public policy. By
contrast, in the present case, an application for setting aside will
have to be brought before a French court which will have to
apply Art 1520 of the French Civil Procedure Code. Under that
provision, an award can be set aside if; amongst others, the
arbitral tribunal wrongly upheld or declined jurisdiction. These
are two entirely different sets of rules (already from a linguistic
point of view).”

The Claimants contend that under French arbitration law, arbitration agreements derive
their existence and validity from international law principles and are not rooted in any

domestic law.*° Thus, the Parties’ consent to investor-State arbitration is to be

examined under the applicable investment treaty, interpreted in accordance with the

VCLT.*!

Fourth, the Claimants submit that, unlike in the Achmea case, the Tribunal forms part
of the Polish judicial system. The Claimants base this argument on a submission made
by the City of Warsaw in the Polish courts that pursuant to Article 241(1) in conjunction
with Articles 89(1), 87(1) and 91 of the Polish Constitution, “the laws (substantive and
procedural) which are allocated to investors in the BIT are included in the category of
matters governed by the [Polish] Constitution”.* According to the Claimants, it must

follow that the operative part of the Achmea Judgment does not apply in this case.

Fifth, according to the Claimants, the Parties’ relationship in the present case is more
akin to the type of commercial arbitration agreement condoned by the CJEU in the
Achmea Judgement, because the “Claimants and Poland have concluded another or
individual arbitration agreement, which is entirely independent from the ISDS
provision in the BIT”.** The Respondent gave its voluntary consent by participating in

the formation of the Tribunal and agreeing to Procedural Order No 1.°4

Lastly, the Claimants distinguish the present case on the basis that the Claimants made
their investment prior to Poland’s accession to the EU in 2004. In their view, even if
the Achmea Judgment could be considered to apply to Article 8 of the Treaty, it could
not apply to investments made prior to such accession; “otherwise the Investors would
be deprived of their properly acquired rights pursuant to the BIT and this would further
be discriminatory”.*>

In these circumstances, the Claimants conclude that the Achmea Judgment does not

apply to the present case.

In addition, the Claimants reject the Respondent’s submission on the practical effects
of the Achmea Judgment. They point out that the CJEU in the Achmea Judgment did

not rule that arbitration clauses “such as” Article 8 of the Netherlands-Slovak Republic

BIT are invalid.*° Nor did the CJEU provide guidance on the effect of its decision or
engage in any analysis of the VCLT. Because the CJEU’s competence is limited to EU
law, it is unable to resolve any potential conflict between the TFEU and intra-EU BITs

under international law.*”

In the Claimants’ submission, the practical consequence of the Achmea Judgment may
be that EU Member States need to take action to seek to terminate or amend certain
investment agreements to eliminate any incompatibility with EU law.** However, the
Judgment cannot compromise the jurisdiction of a tribunal in a pending investment
arbitration. This is confirmed by the language of the Achmea Judgment, which states
that certain agreements on investment arbitration are “precluded”, but does not say that

their application is precluded.*?

For the Claimants, the decision of the CJEU in the Achmea Judgment might, at most,
raise a dispute “with regard to the interpretation or application” of the Treaty under
Article 9 of the Treaty. However, such inter-State disputes are to be resolved between

Austria and Poland, not between the Parties to this arbitration.”

Thus, the Claimants conclude that “Poland’s accession to the EU had not resulted in an
amendment, modification or detraction from the application of the Austria/Poland BIT

[the Treaty]”.°!

The Claimants further submit that, contrary to the Respondent’s position, the Treaty is
not terminated pursuant to Article 59 VCLT because the Treaty and the TFEU do not

regulate “the same subject matter” or share the same object.

The Claimants contend that “Article 59 requires the clear intentions of the parties that

a later treaty relating to the same subject matter should govern that same matter”,®? and

neither Austria nor Poland displayed any such intention upon Poland’s accession to the

EU in 2004.4

8.45 The Claimants argue that, in any event, as stated by the Respondent’s own legal
authority, Article 59 “does not entail the automatic termination of the treaty but triggers
the termination procedure of Article 65 VCLT”. That procedure has not been completed

by Austria and Poland.

8.46 In this regard, the Claimants note that the prescribed procedure for terminating the
Treaty set forth in Article 11 was not followed by Poland.® According to the Claimants,
the provisions of the Treaty cannot “simply vanish by the effect of the mere existence
of the TFEU or any decision by the CJEU, without any of the treaty law safeguards and

mechanisms being triggered”.”

8.47 Moreover, the Respondent’s arguments do not account for the ‘survival clause’ in
Article 11(3) of the Treaty. Even if one were to accept that the Treaty was denounced
in 2004, Poland’s consent to arbitration would have remained valid when the arbitration

was initiated on 19 December 2012.°°

8.48 The Claimants further contend that Article 8 of the Treaty could not have been rendered
inapplicable by virtue of Article 30(3) VCLT. In the first place, the Claimants do not
accept that Article 8 of the Treaty is incompatible with Articles 344 and 267 TFEU.
The Claimants submit that, even if there were a conflict, Article 7(1) of the Treaty

provides a conflict rule which, as the /ex specialis, overrides the /ex posterior rule in

Article 30(3) VCLT.”° Under Article 7(1) of the Treaty, Article 8 of the Treaty would

prevail because it is more favourable.”!

The Claimants reject the Respondent’s position regarding the value and authority of the
Achmea Declaration.’ For the Claimants, the Declarations of 15-16 January 2019 are
mere political statements and legally non-binding.”? In the Claimants’ view, the
Declarations of 15-16 January 2019 not only demonstrate the lack of unanimity in the
views of the EU Member States regarding the Achmea Judgment, but also display a
complete contradiction by the EU Member States in relation to their pre-Achmea

intention to remain bound by the intra-EU BITs.”

The Claimants further contend that the Achmea Declaration is not applicable in the
present case as it (i) addresses “investor-State arbitration clauses contained in bilateral
investment treaties concluded between Member States”, whereas the Treaty had been
executed when Austria and Poland were both not EU Member States; and (ii) is
intended to govern cases of claims by intra-EU investors under EU law, whereas the

5

Claimants are not pursuing a claim under EU law.”

Moreover, for the Claimants, the intention of EU Member States as recorded in the
Achmea Declaration, to terminate all intra-EU BITs by way of a plurilateral treaty, is

evidence of the fact that until that is done, the Treaty remains in force.”°

The Claimants support the observations in the CETA Opinion as being applicable to
the Treaty as, similar to the position under the CETA, (i) the Tribunal under the Treaty

is not required to apply internal EU law but only the provisions of the Treaty; and (ii)

7 Claimants’ Observations on the Commission’s Written Observations, 259. Article 7(1) of the Treaty states:
“Tf the legislation of either Contracting Party or international obligations of the two Contracting Parties, which
presently apply in additional to this Agreement or which are established in the future, should give rise to a general
or specific agreement which accords to the investments of investors from the other Contracting Party more
favourable treatment than is provided for by this Agreement, such arrangement shall have precedence over this
Agreement, in so far as it is more favourable”.

the Treaty offers additional protection to investors under international law and an

effective dispute resolution mechanism.””

Thus, according to the Claimants, the Respondent’s offer to submit disputes to
arbitration under Article 8 of the Treaty was and remains in force, and the Claimants
accepted that offer by initiating this arbitration. The Tribunal is therefore obliged to
decide the Parties’ dispute. Should the Respondent attempt to challenge the Tribunal’s
award, the Claimants state that they are “not afraid of setting-aside proceedings in
France”.78

Finally, and in any event, the Claimants submit that the Respondent’s EU law objection

is precluded as untimely. The Claimants’ argument is summarised as follows:

Respondent's EU law defence has not been submitted in due time
and in a timely manner. Respondent has raised its defence only
after the closing of the written phase of the present arbitration
and (irrespective of this) shall be deemed to have waived its right
to avail itself of such alleged irregularity pursuant to Section
1466 of the French Code of Civil Procedure. Respondent's EU
law defence is, therefore, precluded.”

For all these reasons, the Claimants conclude that the Respondent’s jurisdictional

objection based upon EU law and the Achmea Judgment should be dismissed by the

Tribunal.

The European Commission’s Written Observations

According to the Commission, the legal consequence of the Achmea Judgment for the
present case is that Poland’s offer of consent to arbitration in the Treaty has been invalid

since Poland’s accession to the EU on 1 May 2004.*°

The Commission states that the Achmea Judgment has a broad scope of application: EU
law precludes any treaty provision allowing for intra~-EU investment arbitration. This
broad scope is confirmed by the language of the Judgment’s operative part (“a provision

in an international agreement concluded between Member States”) (emphasis added by

the Commission) and by the public statements of CJEU judges since the Judgment was

issued.*!

8.58 Like all CJEU judgments, the Achmea Judgment is an authoritative interpretation of
EU law that is binding on all EU Member States and all investors of EU Member States.
It also forms part of international law and therefore must be applied by arbitral tribunals
deciding intra-EU disputes.*? Moreover, the CJEU’s interpretation applies ex tunc,
which in this case means from the date on which Poland acceded to the EU, ie., 1

May2004.**

8.59 According to the Commission, there is an evident conflict between Article 8(2) of the
Treaty and EU law. The Tribunal is competent to resolve this conflict as part of its

competence to determine its own jurisdiction.*>

8.60 Regarding the law applicable to the Tribunal’s decision on jurisdiction, the Commission
is of the view that, because the Treaty does not contain an applicable law clause, Article
42(1) of the ICSID Convention applies by analogy, pointing to the law of the host
State.*° As stated by the tribunal in Zhinvali v Georgia, Article 42(1) applies to the
merits and jurisdiction.*’ In addition, applying the law of the host State would be

consistent with the view of the German Federal Supreme Court in Achmea.**

8.61 Thus, the Commission states that the Tribunal must apply Polish law, which includes
EU law and its conflict rules, to the question of jurisdiction. If the Tribunal were to do
so, the resolution of the conflict between Article 8(2) of the Treaty and EU law would
be straightforward: “the general principle of primacy of Union law is part of the

domestic legal order of Poland, and hence, EU law takes precedence over Article

8(2)”.*° The Commission contends that if the Tribunal were to apply the /ex fori to

decide upon its jurisdiction, the result would be the same.”

If, however, the Tribunal were to apply international law to its decision on jurisdiction,
the Commission’s alternative case is that the Treaty (or at the very least Article 8(2) of

the Treaty) was terminated in 2004 pursuant to Article 59 VCLT.*!

The Commission’s position is that the condition under Article 59(1)(a) VCLT is met
because, when Poland acceded to the EU in 2004, Poland and Austria intended that
investment protection be governed by EU law going forward. Both States were well
aware of the principle of the primacy of EU law and intended for that conflict rule to

govern their reciprocal relationships.”

The Commission states that the condition under Article 59(1)(b) VCLT is also met
because the Treaty (including its substantive provisions) is entirely incompatible with
EU law.” In case the Tribunal were to disagree with Commission on this point, the

Commission notes that “Article 59 VCLT can also lead to partial termination of an

international agreement”.**

Regarding the phrase “relating to the same subject matter” in Article 59 VCLT, the

Commission states that:

... the test for deciding whether two treaties relate to the same
subject matter is whether they govern the same legal situation.
That is clearly the case: any investment made by an investor
from one Member State in another Member State falls under the
scope of application of the fundamental freedoms of EU law.
Hence, both the intra-EU BIT and EU law have vocation to
govern the treatment of that investment by the host State.

8.66 The Commission recognizes that previous tribunals have interpreted that phrase
differently. Yet, it considers that those tribunals have offered “extremely superficial”

reasoning and failed to engage with the relevant travaux préparatoires.*°

8.67 The Commission also disagrees with previous tribunals that have found that termination
under Article 59 VCLT requires following the formal steps laid out in Article 65 VCLT.
Those requirements do not apply because Article 59 VCLT addresses the implied

termination of a treaty.*”

8.68 |The Commission points out that, even if the Tribunal were not to accept that the Treaty
was terminated under Article 59 VCLT, the Tribunal would still have to resolve the

conflict between the Treaty and EU law. According to the Commission, “under all

possibly applicable conflict rules, that conflict has to be solved in favour of EU law”.°®

8.69 The Commission’s position is that the applicable conflict rule is the primacy of EU law,
whether the Tribunal applies the host State law, the /ex fori, or international law to

resolve the conflict.”

8.70 Under international law, the residual conflict rule in Article 30 VCLT does not apply
because international law encompasses EU law, which “provides for a special conflict
tule, namely primacy of EU law vis-a-vis other international agreements concluded
between Member States”.!°° The consequence for the present case is that the offer of
arbitration in Article 8 of the Treaty is precluded by EU law. This was confirmed by

the CJEU in the Achmea Judgment and by the German Federal Supreme Court, which

found it necessary to annul the arbitral award rendered in Achmea.'°!

8.71 Inthe alternative, the Commission contends that even if the Tribunal were to decide not
to apply the primacy principle as a conflict rule, the application of Article 30(3) VCLT

leads to the same result: EU law prevails over the Treaty. !°?

8.72. The conflict between the Treaty and EU law is clear, as the Treaty contains both
substantive and procedural rules that are prohibited by Article 19 of the Treaty of the
European Union (“TEU”), Articles 267 and 344 TFEU, and the principle of non-
discrimination. '® It follows that “under Article 30(3) VCLT, the arbitration clause and
the sunset clause under the Austria-Poland BIT of 1989 are incompatible with the
Accession Treaty of Poland to the EU, as the later treaty”.!°! According to the
Commission, the Claimants cannot avoid this result by invoking “legitimate

expectations” or Article 70 VCLT.!°

8.73 Nor can the Claimants rely on the sunset clause in Article 11 of the Treaty. That is
triggered only in the case of unilateral termination of the BIT.'°° In the present case,
termination was the result of the common will of both State parties (Poland and
Austria), as reflected in the Accession Treaty. In any event, the sunset clause, which
prolongs the life of the host State’s offer of consent to arbitration, “falls foul of EU law
for the same reason as the offer of arbitration and hence is precluded for the same

reason”. !°7

8.74 Finally, the Commission states that any award in favor of the Claimants would be
annulled and could not be enforced.'®* In this regard, the Commission points to its
Communication “Protection of intra-EU investment,” which states that national courts
are obligated to annul any arbitral award rendered on the basis of an investor-State

arbitration clause in an intra-EU BIT.!©

The Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision

In this Section, the Tribunal shall examine the Parties’ submissions with respect to the
Respondent’s jurisdictional objection pertaining to EU law, and in the process, shall

also analyse the Commission’s written observations.

At the outset, the Tribunal shall determine the Claimants’ allegations of untimeliness
with respect to the Respondent’s jurisdictional objection (1). Thereafter, the Tribunal
shall delineate the scope of the law applicable to this Tribunal’s jurisdiction, in
particular to examine the applicability of EU law (2). Based on its findings on whether
or not EU law forms part of the legal framework applicable to questions of the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction, the Tribunal shall determine, if and to the extent necessary, the
Parties’ other submissions on whether EU law limits or precludes this Tribunal’s
jurisdiction under Article 8 of the Treaty (3). This shall be followed by the Tribunal’s
considerations on the Parties’ submissions concerning the future enforceability of this

Tribunal’s award (4), and the Tribunal’s conclusion on this jurisdictional issue (5).

 

() Timeli of Respondent’s Jurisdictional Obj

A preliminary matter for the Tribunal to resolve pertains to the timeliness of the

Respondent’s jurisdictional objection relating to EU law and the Achmea Judgment.

In this connection, the Tribunal notes that the first time the Respondent notified the
Tribunal of its intention to supplement its arguments by raising an additional argument
on EU law was by way of its letter dated 5 May 2017.''? Prior to that date, the
Respondent’s written submissions before this Tribunal did not mention any objection
to this Tribunal’s jurisdiction based on EU law. In its letter dated 5 May 2017, the
Respondent foresaw that the then impending judgment of the CJEU in Achmea could

have a “fundamental significance” on the present case, and accordingly requested the
Tribunal to adjourn the Hearing on jurisdiction, such that the Parties could elaborate on

this aspect of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction in their written submissions.

While the Hearing on jurisdiction was not adjourned, the Tribunal, during that Hearing,
invited the Parties to elaborate on their respective positions on the jurisdictional
objection relating to EU law, both as regards its timeliness and its substance, in their
post-hearing submissions.!!? The Parties did accordingly in their respective post-

hearing briefs dated 10 October 2017.

Thereafter, the Tribunal informed the Parties, by way of its correspondence dated
24 October 2017 that it was minded to invite the Parties to address the EU law related
jurisdictional objection after the CJEU rendered its decision in Achmea in early 2018,
pending which the Parties need not address this issue in their reply post-hearing
submissions due in the interim. Accordingly, after the CJEU rendered the Achmea
Judgment on 6 March 2018, the Tribunal invited the Parties to provide brief written
observations on the Achmea Judgment, if they wished to do so. The Parties made their
written observations on 16 April 2018, which were followed by rebuttal/reply written

observations dated 15 May 2018.

Subsequently, on 15 October 2018, the Commission submitted its Application for
Leave to Intervene in these proceedings as a non-disputing party. After consulting the
Parties on this matter, the Tribunal, by way of Procedural Order No 8 dated 2 November
2018, granted the Commission’s Application, while limiting the scope of the
forthcoming submission by the Commission to “the legal consequences of the
judgement of the Court of Justice in Achmea”.''* This was followed by the Parties
submitting written observations on the Commission’s written submission in January
and February 2019 respectively, and subsequently by further written observations on
the EU Member States’ Declarations and the CETA Opinion in February and March
2019 respectively.

Throughout the above described procedural history of the Parties’ submissions relating

to EU law, the Claimants have maintained their objection concerning the timeliness of

Respondent’s jurisdictional objection. In this connection, the Tribunal is not persuaded
by the Respondent’s attempt to read the following statement in the Claimants’ post-
hearing submission as a relinquishment of their allegations of untimeliness: “Claimants
do not suggest that the Tribunal should disregard Respondent’s invocation of [all
contra-BIT and, more specifically, all contra-ISDS arguments] for being out of
time”.''> As clarified by the Claimants subsequently, this statement was included in
their submission prior to the release of the Achmea Judgment, and was only intended to
address the issue of whether the Tribunal, at that point in time, should have awaited the
outcome of the CJEU’s judgment or should have disregarded it.''© The Tribunal accepts
the Claimants’ clarification, and treats their untimeliness allegation as a properly

advanced defence that warrants the Tribunal’s consideration.

8.84. The Claimants have invoked Section 1466 of the French CPC to argue that if a
jurisdictional irregularity is not raised in a timely manner, it shall be deemed to have
been waived by the objecting party.!!’ Per the Claimants, the Respondent had ample
opportunities to raise the EU law related jurisdictional objection prior to 5 May 2017,
since this objection has been known to EU Member States for “‘at least a decade”, and
in any event, “the Achmea award and its path through the German courts [we]re well

documented” prior to May 2017.!!8

8.85 The Respondent has justified the timeliness of its jurisdictional objection based on its
fundamental importance and the Tribunal’s power and duty to determine its jurisdiction
ex officio, and has further pointed out that the deemed waiver under Section 1466 of the
French CPC only applies vis-a-vis annulment proceedings before French state courts. !!°

Court in May 2016, and/or the subsequent Achmea Judgment of 6 March 2018

constitute “new developments” that triggered the jurisdictional objection. !”°

Having considered the Parties’ positions on this procedural aspect, the Tribunal finds
the Respondent’s jurisdictional objection relating to EU law to have been made in a

timely manner. This is for the following two reasons.

First, the Tribunal is convinced by the Respondent’s characterization of the CJEU’s
Achmea Judgment as a “new development”.'?! In this regard, the Tribunal notes Article
45(2) of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, which guide the Tribunal’s dealing of
procedural matters pursuant to paragraph 38 of Procedural Order No 1. Article 45(2) of
the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, akin to Rule 41 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules,

provides:

Any objection that the dispute is not within the competence of
the Tribunal shall be filed with the Secretary-General as soon as
possible after the constitution of the Tribunal and in any event
no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing
of the countermemorial or, if the objection relates to an ancillary
claim, for the filing of the rejoinder — unless the facts on which
the objection is based are unknown _to the party at that time.
(emphasis added)

 

Thus, Article 45(2) of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, while requiring that a
jurisdictional objection be raised as soon as possible, also permits such objections to be
raised later in the course of the proceedings if “the facts on which the objection is based
[we]re unknown to the party” previously. In other words, a new factual development
can prompt a jurisdictional objection to be raised subsequent to the submission of the

counter-memorial and rejoinder.

The Respondent has emphasised two new factual developments that prompted its
jurisdictional objection on EU law: (i) the referral of Achmea by the German Supreme
Court to the CJEU in May 2016; and (ii) the subsequent Achmea Judgment of 6 March
2018. The Claimants dispute that these events qualify as new developments, since the

Respondent was aware of the Achmea court proceedings long before it launched its

20 Hearing Transcript D1.89:23-91:25; Respondent’s Reply on Achmea, 45.

jurisdictional objection in the present arbitration proceedings, and should certainly have

also been aware of the EU law related issues generally.

As mentioned above, the first time the Respondent advanced its jurisdictional objection
in this connection was by way of its letter dated 5 May 2017. The Tribunal considers
that this was not “as soon as possible” after it had become aware of the alleged new
factual development, i.e., the referral of Achmea by the German Supreme Court to the

CJEU, which occurred in May 2016.

However, the Tribunal considers the subsequent Achmea Judgment rendered by the
CJEU on 6 March 2018 to be a new factual development that could potentially serve to
trigger a jurisdictional objection. While it is true that the Respondent had alluded to its
jurisdictional objection earlier on 5 May 2017, it had also requested at that time to
adjourn the jurisdictional Hearing until after the Achmea Judgment was rendered by the
CJEU. The Tribunal decided not to suspend the jurisdictional Hearing, but also
subsequently granted both Parties the opportunity to provide written comments on the
EU law issue after the Achmea Judgment was rendered by the CJEU in March 2018.
Accordingly, the Respondent’s letter dated 5 May 2017, while it could not prompt a
timely jurisdictional objection in and of itself, could and did prompt the procedural
development of the present arbitration proceedings such that the Parties’ subsequent
submissions on the EU law related jurisdictional objection would account for the

Achmea Judgment.

Thereafter, when the CJEU rendered the Achmea Judgment on 6 March 2018, the
Parties were given an opportunity to provide written comments on its implications. In
its written comments, the Respondent argued, inter alia, that the Achmea Judgment
itself was a new factual development that could prompt a timely jurisdictional

objection.

The Tribunal notes that, as quoted in § 8.87 above, Article 45(2) of the ICSID
Additional Facility Rules, like Rule 41 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, provides the

exceptional admissibility of the objection if “the facts on which the objection is based

 

are unknown to the party at that time” (emphasis added). The Achmea Judgement is not
only a “legal” development such that it would not be covered by the term “facts” in

Article 45(2) of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules. It is not the development of the

Part VIII — Page 24

8.94

8.95

8.96

8.97

122

law that is relevant, but the factual existence of the Achmea Judgment itself that came
into being only at that time. Therefore, the Tribunal is persuaded by the Respondent’s
characterization of the Achmea Judgment as a new development, since the factual
existence of CJEU’s judgment only became known on 6 March 2018, i-e., when it was
rendered, and could not have been known earlier than that date. Further, this factual
development was sufficient to appropriately resurrect a jurisdictional objection that the

Respondent had alluded to for the first time on 5 May 2017.

In this regard, the Tribunal is not persuaded by the Claimants’ argument that after
having consented to arbitrate under the Treaty, the Respondent cannot unilaterally
argue that it was not bound by the arbitration clause in the Treaty since its accession to
the EU in 2004, i.e., on an ex ante basis. Whether the Respondent is bound by its consent
to arbitrate under the Treaty is a matter that pertains to the legal implications of the

Achmea Judgment and not its factual existence.

Similarly, the Tribunal does not consider the Respondent’s general awareness about EU
law issues prior to May 2017 to have any impact on the timeliness of the Respondent’s
jurisdictional objection. The fact that the Respondent could presumably have been
aware of EU law issues in general does not obstruct the novelty of the Achmea

Judgment as a triggering factual development.

In light of the above, the Tribunal considers the Achmea Judgment of 6 March 2018 to
be a new development that could prompt a jurisdictional objection on issues of EU law,
which would be rendered a timely jurisdictional objection under Article 45(2) of the
ICSID Additional Facility Rules. Accordingly, the Respondent’s jurisdictional
objection relating to EU law and the Achmea Judgment is not precluded for being

untimely.

Second, and on a related note, the Tribunal is also persuaded by the Respondent’s
characterization of the Achmea Judgment as a factual development, which is so
important that it “cannot be ignored in the present case”,'?? and that “the relevance of

this argument fully justifies” its consideration by this Tribunal.!7>

8.101

In this regard, the Tribunal also notes Article 45(3) of the ICSID Additional Facility
Rules, to which the Respondent has pointed the Tribunal’s attention. Article 45(3) of
the ICSID Additional Facility, emanates from the principle of compétence-compétence,
and provides that “[t]he Tribunal may on its own initiative consider, at any stage of the
proceeding, whether the dispute before it is within its competence”. Accordingly, even
in the absence of a specific or timely jurisdictional objection, the Tribunal would still
have the authority, pursuant to this provision, to examine any jurisdiction matter on an

ex officio basis.

That said, given that the Tribunal has already determined the Respondent’s
jurisdictional objection to have been made in a timely manner, it need not invoke its ex

officio power while determining the said jurisdictional objection.
(2) Applicable Law

The Parties and the Commission have advanced various propositions concerning the
law applicable to this Tribunal’s jurisdiction, specifically directed towards whether EU
law falls within this sphere of applicable law in these proceedings. In order to determine
this issue, the Tribunal shall (a) first, determine what constitutes this Tribunal’s
applicable law framework for questions of jurisdiction, in the absence of an applicable
law provision in the Treaty; and (b) second, based on the determinations of the first

issue, determine the applicability of EU law for questions of jurisdiction.

(a) The Applicable Legal Framework

It is undisputed that the Treaty does not contain an applicable law provision. While both
Parties accept this uncontroversial proposition, the precise implications of the absence
of an applicable law provision is disputed between them, in particular in relation to
whether this absence, in and of itself, serves to distinguish the Achmea Judgment from
the present case. The Tribunal shall examine this particular disputed matter
subsequently, if necessary, subject to its determination of the more general issue of the
applicable legal framework, and how that impacts the applicability of EU law. Thus,
for the purposes of the current sub-Section, the only relevant question for the Tribunal
to answer is what constitutes the applicable legal framework for questions of

jurisdiction, in the absence of any indications thereof in the BIT.

Part VIII — Page 26

8.102

The Respondent has pointed this Tribunal in two directions to fill this absence:
paragraph 116 of Procedural Order No | and Article 54 of the ICSID Additional Facility
Rules. According to the Respondent and the Commission, provisions such as Article
54(1) of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules and Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention
apply equally to the merits of a dispute and to questions of a tribunal’s jurisdiction.
Further, pursuant to the application of “conflict of laws rules” under paragraph 116 of
Procedural Order No 1, the Respondent and the Commission have advocated for the

application of Polish law to questions of jurisdiction as well.

The Claimants are of the view that any questions relating to interpretation or application
of the BIT, including the dispute resolution clause therein, should be resolved in
accordance with international law principles (see J 8.28-8.29 above). To this end, the
Claimants are in disagreement with the Respondent’s position in two respects. Firstly,
according to the Claimants, Article 54(1) of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, like
Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, does not apply to questions of jurisdiction, but
only applies to questions of merits, and is thus, not relevant for this Tribunal’s
analysis. '*4 Secondly, the Claimants submit that paragraph 116 of Procedural Order No
1 cannot result in the applicability of Polish law, since the current arbitration
proceedings have their place in Paris, France, and French arbitration law does not
subject arbitration agreements to any national law but only to principles of international

justice.

The Tribunal shall resolve both these disputed issues in turn. In this regard, as a
preliminary matter, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to reproduce paragraph 116 of
Procedural Order No 1 and Article 54 of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules for
appropriate context. Paragraph 116 of Procedural Order No | provides:

The Arbitral Tribunal shall apply the law determined by the

conflict of laws rules which it considers applicable and such

rules of international law and treaties as the Arbitral Tribunal
considers applicable.

Article 54 of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, in its relevant part, provides:

(1) The Tribunal shail apply the rules of law designated by the
parties as applicable to the substance of the dispute. Failing

such designation by the parties, the Tribunal shall apply (a) the
law determined by the conflict of laws rules which it considers
applicable and (b) such rules of international law as the
Tribunal considers applicable.

The first disputed issue between the Parties pertains to whether Article 54(1) of the
ICSID Additional Facility Rules applies only to the merits of a dispute between an
investor and a host State, or whether it also extends to questions of jurisdiction. With

respect to this disputed issue, the Tribunal makes the following observations.

The Tribunal is persuaded by the Claimants’ submission that provisions such as Article
54(1) of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules and Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention
are applicable only to the merits of an investor-State dispute, and do not apply to
questions of a tribunal’s jurisdiction. The text of Article 54(1) of the ICSID Additional
Facility Rules makes this clear. The first sentence of Article 54(1) of the ICSID
Additional Facility Rules defines its scope when it states that a tribunal “shall apply the
tules of law . . . as applicable to the substance of the dispute” (emphasis added). Thus,
the text itself denotes that it only addresses applicable law so far as the substance or
merits of an investor-State dispute are concerned, and not the law applicable to

questions of jurisdiction.

At this juncture, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to clarify that when the Tribunal
refers to the law or the legal framework applicable to “questions of jurisdiction”,
jurisdiction includes in particular the law that governs the arbitration agreement
between the Parties. Within that perspective, the Tribunal uses the terms law applicable
to “questions of jurisdiction” and law applicable to the “arbitration agreement”

interchangeably.

The second disputed matter between the Parties pertains to the implications of
paragraph 116 of Procedural Order No 1, and whether any conflict of laws rules that
the Tribunal may consider applicable result in the application of Polish law to the

Parties’ arbitration agreement.

In this regard, it must be noted that in the present case the place of the arbitration is

Paris, France.'?° According to the French courts whose judgments are in the record of

"25 Procedural Order No. 1, § 24.

Part VIII — Page 28

the present case, the rules that govern the question of existence and validity of the
arbitration agreement are transnational principles. As the arbitral tribunal in Dallah v
Pakistan (which had also its place of arbitration in Paris) found, rules of law applicable

to the arbitration agreement:

need not be linked to a particular national law (French Cour de
Cassation, ler-civ., Dec. 20, 1993, Dalico), but may consist of
those transnational general principles which the Arbitrators
would consider to meet the fundamental requirements of justice

in international trade. '*° (emphasis added)

8.110 This position is also confirmed by the French Cour de Cassation in Renault v V 2000,
which held that “la clause compromissoire devait recevoir application en vertu de
l'indépendance d'une telle clause en droit international sous la seule réserve des régles
d'ordre public international”.!?” This translates to “the arbitration clause must be
applied by virtue of the independence of such a clause in international law, subject only
to the rules of international public order” (emphasis added).

8.111 Therefore, the Tribunal determines that the law applicable to the arbitration agreement
or to questions of jurisdiction in the present case includes (i) Article 8 of the Treaty;
and (ii) international public order or international law principles which meet the

fundamental requirements of justice in international trade.

(b) The Applicability of EU Law

8.112 With the applicable legal framework for questions of jurisdiction established, the

Tribunal shall now determine whether and where EU law falls within this framework.

8.113 At the outset, the Tribunal notes that EU law is constituted by a number of legal
instruments, which include, but are not limited to, the TEU and the TFEU (together

referred to as the “EU Treaties”). Given that the Achmea Judgment contains an

interpretation of the EU Treaties, it also forms a constituent part of EU law. In the
present case, both the Claimants and the Respondent contend that EU law has a “dual”
or “hybrid” nature.'8 This nature of EU law is also alluded to by the EC.'?? Moreover,
the CJEU!? and several investment arbitration tribunals have also endorsed the dual or
multiple nature of EU law.'*! Pursuant to this sui generis nature, EU law, to the extent
that it is sourced from the EU Treaties, forms a part of international law, and to the
extent that it is incorporated within the domestic legal order of the EU Member States,

also forms part of their national laws.

The Commission and the Respondent have endorsed the applicability of EU law in the
present case through the French domestic legal order on the ground that EU law, due
its dual or dichotomous nature, forms part of the Member States’ domestic legal order
as well.!>? However, the Tribunal has already determined above that there is no place
for a domestic legal order in the legal framework applicable to questions of this
Tribunal’s jurisdiction, since French courts do not subject arbitration agreements to any
such domestic legal order. Accordingly, the domestic nature of EU law cannot result in

its applicability to the Parties’ arbitration agreement in the present case.

As stated above, the only constituents of the applicable law framework for questions of
jurisdiction in the present case are (i) the dispute resolution clause of the Treaty; and
(ii) international public order or international law principles which meet the
fundamental requirements of justice in international trade. Thus, the only route through
which EU law can theoretically enter the legal framework applicable to questions of the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction is the case where it is established that EU law constitutes a part
of international public order or such international law principles which meet the

fundamental requirements of justice in international trade.

In this connection, it has been discussed above that, to the extent of the EU Treaties,
EU law does constitute international law. However, this alone does not ensure the

applicability of EU law in the present case. In order for EU law to be applicable to

questions of this Tribunal’s jurisdiction and in turn to impose any conditions relating to
the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement, EU law should constitute a part
of such international law principles that meet the fundamental requirements of justice

in international trade.

The Respondent and the Commission, while advocating the applicability of EU law to
questions of jurisdiction, have not established that EU law constitutes a part of
international public order or international principles that meet the threshold of
fundamental requirements of justice in international trade. This threshold is set very
high by the case law of the French Cour de Cassation. For instance, as mentioned
above, the French Cour de Cassation in Renault v V 2000 has stressed on the exclusive
status of the consent to arbitrate in the realm of the transnational or international legal
order, finding that an arbitration agreement “must be applied . . . subject only to the
rules of international public order” (emphasis added).'** Similarly, the arbitral tribunal
in Dallah v Pakistan, relying on the judgment of the Cour de Cassation in Municipalité
de Khoms El Mergeb v Société Dalico, found that the threshold of “fundamental
requirements of justice in international trade” is satisfied by “transnational general
principles and usages”, such as “the concept of good faith in business”. '** Accordingly,
it is only principles of general and transnational application that can enter the applicable
legal framework as part of the international public order or principles relating to consent
that meet the threshold of fundamental requirements of justice in international trade.
The Parties have not demonstrated that EU law, be it the EU Treaties or the Achmea
Judgment or any other element of EU law which could be relevant in the present case,

constitutes such principles of general and transnational application.

In light of the above, the Tribunal finds that EU law cannot form part of the law
applicable to questions of this Tribunal’s jurisdiction. Therefore, no rules or principles
of EU law, be it the EU Treaties or the Achmea Judgment, may govern the Parties’

arbitration agreement in the present case.

(3) The Parties’ Other Submissions

The Tribunal’s determination that EU law does not constitute a part of the law
applicable to the arbitration agreement is dispositive of a number of incidental issues
that have arisen in the context of the Respondent’s jurisdictional objection relating to
EU law. If EU law cannot be applied by this Tribunal at all for questions of jurisdiction,
it is neither appropriate nor necessary for this Tribunal to examine the precise contours

of the EU Treaties or the Achmea Judgment’s interpretation of the EU Treaties.

Accordingly, the Tribunal need not address the issues relating to the scope and
implications of the Achmea Judgment on the present case or on Article 8 of the Austria-
Poland BIT in general. The Tribunal notes that, to this end, the Parties have made
extensive submissions in relation to (i) whether Article 8 of the Austria-Poland BIT is
a provision “such as” Article 8 of the Netherlands-Slovak Republic BIT, in light of the
absence of an applicable law provision in the former; (ii) whether the date on which the
Claimants made their investments in Poland is a relevant factor that distinguishes the
present case from the Achmea Judgment; (iii) whether the Respondent’s consent to
arbitrate in the present case is comparable to consent given in commercial arbitrations;
and (iv) whether this Tribunal is part of the Polish judicial system, as distinct from the
tribunal established under the Netherlands-Slovak Republic BIT, which was not part of
the Slovak judicial system. None of these disputed issues relating to the scope and
implications of the Achmea Judgment requires this Tribunal’s consideration, because
EU law, including the Achmea Judgment, is not applicable to questions of this

Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

The only residual matters that this Tribunal shall make brief comments on pertain to
the VCLT, specifically in respect of the Parties’ submissions on (a) Article 31 VCLT;
and (b) Articles 30 and 59 VCLT.

(a) Article 31 VCLT

With respect to Article 31 VCLT, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent and the
Commission have advocated for the applicability of the EU Treaties to this Tribunal’s

interpretation of the Treaty as “relevant rules of international law applicable in the

Part VIII — Page 32

8.123

8.124

8.125

relations between the parties” under Article 31(3)(c) VCLT.'*° Further, the Respondent
has also argued that the Achmea Declaration that was signed by the governments of 22
EU Member States, including Austria, Poland and France, constitutes an authentic

interpretation of the Treaty under Article 31(3)(a) VCLT.

On the contrary, the Claimants are of the view that according to Article 31 VCLT, “the
treaty text must be given its ‘ordinary meaning’, implying that it is only when that
meaning is ambiguous or manifestly absurd or unreasonable ..., that contextual ...
criteria may prevail over the text”.!°° Similarly, the Claimants do not consider the
Achmea Declaration to be a binding or authentic interpretative tool under Article

31(3)(a) VCLT that can influence the interpretation of the Treaty.

The Tribunal is convinced by the Claimants’ position. The Tribunal considers that the
“general rule of interpretation” of international treaties, codified in Article 31 VCLT,
requires that the starting point of the interpretation be the ordinary meaning of the text
of the treaty under interpretation. In this regard, Article 31(1) VCLT provides that “[a]
treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be
given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose”.
The International Law Commission’s “Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties with
commentaries”, which is extensively relied upon by the Respondent for its argument,
endorses the view that the starting point of the interpretation process under Article 31

VCLT is always the text of the treaty under interpretation:

The article as already indicated is based on the view that the text
must be presumed to be the authentic expression of the intentions
of the parties; and that, in consequence, the starting point of
interpretation is the elucidation of the meaning of the text, not
an investigation ab initio into the intentions of the parties.'°"

Further, the International Law Commission’s commentaries also recognize that the
tenets of interpretation under Article 31(3) VCLT are “extrinsic both to the text and to
the ‘context’ as defined in paragraph 2” of Article 31 VCLT.'*8 In particular, Article

31(3) VCLT requires “extrinsic” elements such as (i) “any subsequent agreement
between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its
provisions” and (ii) “relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations
between the parties” to be “taken into account, together with the context” (emphasis
added). From the text of Article 31(3) VCLT, it is evident that such “extrinsic”
elements, while informative to the context of a treaty, cannot be used to rewrite the

ordinary meaning of the text of the treaty under interpretation.

Accordingly, the Tribunal is not persuaded by the Respondent’s argument that the EU
Treaties, the Achmea Judgment or the Achmea Declaration can “trump over other
methods of interpretation” in Article 31(1) VCLT or even “amend the text of the
treaty”.!°° On the contrary, the Tribunal considers that since EU law is not applicable
to questions of this Tribunal’s jurisdiction, no facets of EU law can enter the
interpretative process to “trump” or “amend” the text of Article 8 of the Treaty. Since
Article 31 VCLT states that the treaty text must be given its “ordinary meaning”,
extrinsic factors that may be taken “together with” the context of a treaty cannot prevail

over the ordinary meaning of the text of that treaty.'4°

The Tribunal further notes that neither the Respondent nor the EC has disputed that the
ordinary meaning of Article 8 of the Treaty, i.e., the dispute resolution clause, is clear
in its import. The Claimants have also submitted that the ordinary meaning of the text
of Article 8 of the Austria-Poland BIT is “clear, unambiguous, and undisputed”, and

does not need any further interpretation than its ordinary meaning. '*!

The Tribunal agrees that the ordinary meaning of the text of Article 8 of the Treaty BIT,
in light of its context and object and purpose, leaves no interpretative doubt. It is clear
that this provision constitutes the Respondent’s consent to arbitrate either under the
ICSID Convention “if both Contracting Parties are signatories to the [ICSID
Convention]” or in an ad hoc set up “if either of the Contracting Parties is not a

signatory to the [ICSID Convention]’”. There is no contrary indication in the preamble

of the Austria-Poland BIT or in any other provision of the Treaty, which puts in doubt

the clear import of the plain text of Article 8 thereof.
(b) Articles 30 and 59 VCLT.

Concerning the resolution of any conflicts between the EU Treaties and the Treaty, the
Parties have advanced different solutions. In this connection, the Respondent has
invoked (i) Article 59(1) VCLT to argue that the Treaty should be “considered as
terminated” based on Poland’s subsequent accession to the EC and the EU Treaties’
consequential entry into force on 1 May 2004, since the Treaty and the EU Treaties
pertain to the “same subject-matter”; and (ii) alternatively, Article 30(3) VCLT to argue
that the Treaty applies “only to the extent that its provisions are compatible” with the
EU Treaties, and the ISDS provision therein is not applicable since it is incompatible

with EU law.

The Commission has also advanced the above propositions, with the additional
proposal to apply the conflict rule derived from an a contrario reading of Article 351(1)

TFEU, i.e., the principle of primacy of EU law.

The Claimants argue, inter alia, that the termination procedure mentioned in Article 59
VCLT does not apply because the Treaty and the EU Treaties do not pertain to the
“same subject-matter”. Further, in the event of a conflict, the Claimants prefer to use
the /ex specialis conflict rule in Article 7(1) of the Treaty, but alternatively argue that
Article 30(3) VCLT does not render the Treaty inapplicable since there is no
incompatibility between the Treaty and EU law.

The Tribunal makes the following observations with respect to the Parties’ submissions

on the resolution of any conflicts between the EU Treaties and the Treaty.

In light of the Tribunal’s finding that EU law does not constitute a part of the legal
framework applicable to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction under the Treaty, the Tribunal does
not consider the conflict rule derived by the Commission from an a contrario reading
of Article 351(1) TFEU, i.e., the principle of primacy of EU law, to be applicable in the
present case. The Tribunal also does not consider it appropriate or necessary to examine

whether and to what extent Article 7(1) of the Treaty, invoked by the Claimants,

Part VIII — Page 35

8.134

8.135

8.136

12 See Commi

constitutes a rule that could be used to resolve any conflicts between the Treaty and EU

law.

With respect to the Respondent’s invocation of Articles 30(3) and 59(1) VCLT, the
Tribunal observes that the precondition for both provisions to be applicable as
techniques to resolve any conflicts between two international treaties is that the treaties
in question should deal with the “same subject matter”.'*? Article 59 VCLT provides
conditions for a treaty to “be considered as terminated if all the parties to it conclude a
later treaty relating to the same subject matter”. Article 30(3) VCLT deals with the
scope of application of individual provisions of a prior treaty that is not considered
terminated under Article 59 VCLT, and in this regard provides that the prior treaty
“applies only to the extent that its provisions are compatible with those of the later

treaty”.

The Tribunal is persuaded by the Claimants’ argument that the TFEU and the Treaty
do not pertain to the same subject matter. In this regard, the Tribunal understands the
precondition of “same subject matter” as requiring the subject matters of the two treaties
in question to be “identical”. '*? In this connection, the ILC’s Report on Fragmentation
of International Law provides that the “same subject matter” precondition requires the

two treaties at issue to be “institutionally linked” or “part of the same regime”. '44

Investment arbitration case law has consistently found that the EU Treaties, specifically

the TFEU, do not deal with the same subject matter as intra-EU BITs. For instance, the
tribunal in JSW v Czech Republic found that:

Article 59 of the VCLT will only come into play if the Treaty and
the TFEU relate to the same subject matter. This is obviously not
the case. To take but one example, Article 10 of the Treaty allows
an investor to sue a host state. No parallel provision exists in the
TFEU.'*

8.139

Other tribunals have made similar findings in the context of other ISDS clauses, after
examining the provisions of the TFEU. All found that the TFEU had a different sphere
of application than the intra-EU BITs, specifically because Articles 267 and 344 TFEU
or any other provisions of EU law did “not provide investors with a right to initiate an
arbitration against the host state”.'4° Along the same lines, with respect to the
“compatibility” criterion in Article 30(3) VCLT (also found in Article 59(1)(b) VCLT),
tribunals have consistently found that there is no “incompatibility” between intra~-EU
BITs and EU law.'” In the words of the tribunal in Electrabel v Hungary, there was
“no legal rule or principle of EU law that would prevent [it] from exercising its

functions in this arbitration”. '“*

Accordingly, the Tribunal is persuaded by the Claimants’ argument that the provisions
of the EU Treaties, specifically the TFEU, do not contain any explicit or implicit
prohibition on ISDS, as they do not “even mention arbitration, arbitration clauses or
intra-EU BITs”.'*? Accordingly, there is no conflict between Article 8 of the Treaty and
the TFEU to be resolved because they do not pertain to the same subject matter.
Therefore, the Tribunal does not consider the precondition for the applicability of

Articles 30 and 59 VCLT to have been satisfied.

The CJEU’s Achmea Judgment does not alter the above conclusions. In this regard, the
Tribunal is convinced by the Claimants’ submission that the Achmea Judgment did not
make any findings “on the public international law relationship between intra-EU BITs
and the TFEU”.'*° The only findings that the CJEU made in the Achmea Judgment
pertained to the interpretation of Articles 267 and 344 TFEU in light of principles of
EU law. These findings do not change the public international law relationship between
the TFEU and intra-EU BITs for the purposes of Articles 30 and 59 VCLT. The
understanding of this public international law relationship has reached a jurisprudential

consistency in investment arbitration case law, as mentioned above. The Achmea

Judgment does not interfere with this consistent understanding, or with the conclusion
that the TFEU and the Treaty between Austria and Poland do not deal with the “same

subject matter”.
(4) Enforceability of the Tribunal’s Award

The Claimants, the Respondent and the Commission have all discussed the future
implications of any award that this Tribunal may render, and they all recognize the role
of French courts as the reviewing courts before which annulment proceedings may

possibly be instituted after the arbitration proceedings.

However, they differ with respect to the substantive fate of any such annulment
proceedings, and the Tribunal’s duty to render an enforceable award. Whereas the
Respondents and the Commission are of the opinion that any award rendered without
adherence to the Achmea Judgment would likely be annulled by French courts. The
Claimants dispute this proposition and attempt to distinguish Achmea from the present
proceedings on the premise that the grounds for annulment under Article 1520 of the

French CPC are different from those under the German Civil Procedure Code.

At this juncture, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate or necessary to examine
the Parties’ disagreements about how French courts may review the Tribunal’s award
in future, and, in turn, whether the Tribunal’s award will be considered valid or
enforceable. The Tribunal is mindful of its duty to render an enforceable award.
However, the Tribunal is not able to predict the future validity or enforceability of its

award before French courts or other enforcing courts.
(5) Conclusion on EU Law and the CJEU’s Achmea Judgment

The Tribunal has found in the above Sections that (i) the Respondent’s jurisdictional
objection relating to EU law and the Achmea Judgment was made in a timely manner;
(ii) EU law, including the EU Treaties and their interpretation by the Achmea Judgment,
do not form part of the law applicable to questions of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction; and
(iii) no extrinsic elements of interpretation under Article 31(3) VCLT can trump the
clear expression of the Parties’ common intention to arbitrate. For these reasons, the
Respondent’s jurisdictional objection relating to EU law and the Achmea Judgment is

rejected.

PART IX: COSTS
Introduction

For this jurisdictional phase of these arbitration proceedings, the costs of the arbitration,
including the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal and ICSID’s

administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to the following:

Description of Costs ount

 

 

 

The Tribunal’s Fees and Expenses
Mr V. V. Veeder QC USD 203,406.57
Professor Albert Jan van den Berg USD 157,957.86
Professor Dr. Karl Heinz-Béckstiegel USD 151,850.98
ICSID’s Administrative Fees USD 180,000.00
Direct Expenses USD 23,011.69
TOTAL USD 716,227.10

 

 

 

 

In accordance with paragraph 18 of Procedural Order No 1, these costs have been paid
out of advance payments made by the Parties in equal parts (50% by the Claimants and
50% by the Respondent). Each Party has advanced USD 350,000.00 to the case fund
held by ICSID. The remaining balance in the case fund will be reimbursed to the Parties

in equal parts at the conclusion of this arbitration.

The Parties have not submitted statements of their respective legal costs incurred in this

phase of the proceeding.
Article 8(4) of the Treaty addresses the allocation of costs as follows:

Each side shall bear the costs of its own arbitrator and the costs
of its representation in the proceedings before the arbitral
tribunal; the costs of the chairman and the other costs shall be
borne in equal shares by both sides.

Paragraphs 129-130 of the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No 1 provide:

129. The costs shall be borne by the Parties in accordance with

Part IX — Page 1

Article 8.4 of the Treaty.

130. The Arbitral Tribunal shall decide the allocation of costs
between the Parties in accordance with that provision. In the
final award or, if it deems appropriate, in any other award, the
Arbitral Tribunal shall determine any amount that a Party may
have to pay to another Party as a result of its decision on
allocation of costs.

B. The Claimants’ Case

9.6 In their Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal order the
Respondent to “pay the Investors’ costs associated with these proceedings, as far as

Article 8 of the BIT provides therefore”. !

9.7 However, the Claimants’ request for relief in their submissions on the Achmea
Judgment did not include a request for costs,? and the Claimants opposed the
Respondent’s claim for costs on the basis of Article 8(4) of the Treaty and paragraph
18 of Procedural Order No 1. They asserted that:

Respondent's request to order Claimants to pay the costs of this
arbitration, as well as the fees and expenses relating to
Respondent's legal repr ion, etc. is, ... inadmissible and
Claimant hereby requests the Arbitral Tribunal to dismiss
Respondent’s application.*

Cc. The Respondent’s Case
9.8 The Respondent requests that the Tribunal:

order the Claimants to pay the costs of this arbitration, as well
as the fees and expenses relating to the Respondent’s legal
representation, in-house costs, fees and expenses of any expert
appointed by the Respondent or the Tribunal, and all other
