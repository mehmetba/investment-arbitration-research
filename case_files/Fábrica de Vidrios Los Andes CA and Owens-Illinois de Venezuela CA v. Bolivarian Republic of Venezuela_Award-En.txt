INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on the basis of the Agreement on
Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of the
Netherlands and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela dated October 22, 1991, which
entered into force on November 1, 1993 (the “Agreement” or the “BIT”), and the Convention
on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States dated

March 18, 1965, which entered into force on October 14, 1966 (the “ICSID Convention’).

The Claimants are Fabrica de Vidrios Los Andes, C.A. (“Favianca”) and Owens-Illinois de
Venezuela, C.A. (“OIdV”). Favianca and OIdV are hereinafter collectively referred to as the

“Claimants.”

The Claimants are companies incorporated under the laws of the Bolivarian Republic of
Venezuela but controlled directly or indirectly by OI European Group B.V. (“OIEG”), a
legal person constituted under the laws of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. OIEG owns,
through its combined direct and indirect shareholdings, 71.996% of the shares in Favianca.

OIEG also directly owns 73.97% of the shares in OIdV.

The Respondent is the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and is hereinafter referred to as

“Venezuela”, the “Republic” or the “Respondent.”

The organs of the Respondent principally involved in the circumstances of this arbitration
are the President of Venezuela (at the time, President Hugo Chavez Frias), the National
Guard, the Ministry of Popular Power for Science, Technology, and Intermediate Goods
Industries (“MINCIT”), the National Institute for Labour Prevention, Health and Safety
(“INPSASEL”), the Institute for the Defence of People in the Access to Goods and Services
(“INDEPABIS”) and the judiciary of Venezuela.

The Claimants and the Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Parties.”
The Parties’ current respective representatives and their addresses are listed above on page

(i).

II. OVERVIEW OF THE CASE AND THE PARTIES’ REQUESTS FOR RELIEF

~

Overview of the Case

The dispute arises from the expropriation of the two largest glass container production plants
in Venezuela. The Claimants allege that this expropriation was carried out illegally and with
no compensation, and that the Respondent’s behaviour with regard to the Claimants’
investments breached numerous obligations under the Netherlands-Venezuela BIT. The
Claimants request substantial compensation. The Respondent challenges the Tribunal’s

jurisdiction and also contends that there was no breach of the BIT.

The Claimants’ majority shareholder, OIEG, launched a parallel arbitration, namely OJ
European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25),
under the same BIT (“the Parallel Arbitration”). The tribunal in the parallel arbitration
rendered its award on March 10, 2015 (“the OIEG award”) unanimously awarding damages

to OIEG. Venezuela has launched annulment proceedings which are currently pending.

The Parallel Arbitration addresses mostly the same substantive matters at issue in the present

proceedings.

The Parties’ Requests for Relief

In their Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, and as confirmed in their

Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimants ask the Tribunal to render an award:

(i) declaring that the Respondent has breached the BIT, including Articles 3(1), 3(2),
3(4) and 6;

(ii) ordering the Respondent to pay damages to the Claimants in the amount of not less

than US$ 1,033,052,912.00;

(iii) ordering the Respondent to pay compound interest on such amount that the Tribunal
awards to the Claimants as damages (less any amount awarded by the Tribunal by
way of moral damages) at the interest rate of LIBOR + 4 percent, such compound
interest to run from the date of expropriation until the date upon which payment is

made;

(iv) ordering the Respondent to pay all of the Claimants’ costs, including costs in the
arbitration (extending but not limited to all the fees and expenses of ICSID and the
Tribunal and all the legal costs and expenses incurred by the Claimants, including
but not limited to the fees and expenses of counsel), and including the Claimants’
legal costs and expenses incurred consequent upon the expropriation, all with interest

calculated in accordance with paragraph (iii) above;

(v) in the event that the Tribunal does not order the Respondent to pay all of the
Claimants’ costs in the arbitration, ordering the Respondent to pay all of the
Claimants’ costs in connection with the Respondent’s preliminary objections and
request for bifurcation, including but not limited to all the fees and expenses of ICSID
and the Tribunal and all the legal costs and expenses incurred by the Claimants
(including but not limited to the fees and expenses of counsel), with interest

calculated in accordance with paragraph (iii) above; and
(vi) ordering such other and further relief as the Tribunal deems appropriate. !
11. In its Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondent invites the Tribunal to:
(i) exclude from the case record any expert report, witness statement produced at the

hearing and any other material relating to the submissions made by Mr. José Ignacio

Hernandez, in compliance with rule 9.2. (b) of the IBA rules;

(ii) declare that the present dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre or the
competence of the arbitral tribunal;

(iii) declare that the Respondent has not violated the BIT, including Articles 3(1), 3(2),
3(4) and 6 thereof;

(iv) declare that the Claimants are not entitled to any compensation;

(v) order the Claimants to pay all costs relating to this arbitration, including the Arbitral
Tribunal’s and ICSID’s fees and expenses, and all legal fees and expenses incurred

by the Respondent in connection with its defence;

' Claimants’ Reply, | 681; Claimants’ Post-Hearing Brief, | 104.

(vi) order any such further relief in favour of Venezuela as it may deem appropriate. 7

III.PROCEDURAL HISTORY

12.

On July 23, 2012, ICSID received a request for arbitration dated July 20, 2012, with
supporting documentation, from the Claimants against Venezuela (the “Request” or “RFA”).

The Request was supplemented by letter dated August 3, 2012.

On August 10, 2012, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance
with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In
the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to constitute an Arbitral
Tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(c) of the Centre’s Rules of Procedure

for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.

On October 24, 2012, in the absence of an agreement between the Parties, the Claimants
requested that the Tribunal be constituted pursuant to Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID
Convention. Pursuant to Rule 3 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings
(“ICSID Arbitration Rules”), the Claimants appointed The Honorable L. Yves Fortier Q.C.,

anational of Canada, as arbitrator.

On October 31, 2012, the Respondent proposed to the Claimants the appointment of the same
tribunal in this case as appointed in the Parallel Arbitration on the basis of the similarities
between the two cases. On November 9, 2012, the Claimants rejected the Respondent’s

proposal.

On November 21, 2012, the Respondent appointed Mr. Alexis Mourre, a national of France,

as arbitrator.

On December 3, 2012, the Claimants expressed reservations to the appointment of Mr.
Mourre and requested the Chairman of the Administrative Council to appoint the presiding

arbitrator pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention.

On December 27, 2012, the Respondent notified the Centre the appointment of the law firm

of Shearman & Sterling LLP as its counsel of record in the case.

On December 28, 2012, the Centre, having consulted with the Parties, confirmed that the
appointment of the presiding arbitrator would be made in accordance with Articles 38 and

40(1) of the ICSID Convention.

On January 16, 2013, in accordance with Articles 38 and 40(1) of the ICSID Convention,
the Centre notified the Parties that it intended to propose to the Chairman of the
Administrative Council the appointment of Professor Hi-Taek Shin, a national of the
Republic of Korea, as the presiding arbitrator in this case, and invited the Parties to submit
observations to this proposal. On January 23 and 24, 2013, the Respondent and the
Claimants, respectively, submitted their observations on the proposal. On January 28, 2013,
Professor Shin submitted comments. On January 30 and February 1, 2013, the Claimants

and the Respondent, respectively, submitted further observations.

On February 6, 2013, the Centre informed the Parties that, after considering the Parties’
observations, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council had decided to proceed

with the appointment of Professor Shin as the President of the Tribunal in this case.

On February 14, 2013, Professor Shin accepted his appointment. On that same date, the
Secretary-General of ICSID, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules,
notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the
Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Ann Catherine

Kettlewell, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

The Tribunal held the first session with the Parties in Paris (France) on April 11, 2013.

Present at the session were:

The Parties confirmed that the Tribunal was properly constituted and that the Parties had no
objection to the appointment of any Member of the Tribunal. It was agreed, inter alia, that
the applicable ICSID Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from April 10, 2006, that
the procedural languages of the proceedings would be English and Spanish, and that the
place of proceeding would be the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. The agreements of

the Parties were embodied in Procedural Order No. 1, dated May 15, 2013.

On July 15, 2013, the Claimants filed a Memorial on the Merits (the “Claimants’ Memorial’)

accompanied by witness statements, expert reports, and factual exhibits.

On August 16, 2013, the Respondent filed its Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction,
requesting the bifurcation of the proceeding into jurisdiction and merits phases (the

“Respondent’s Preliminary Objections”). Alternatively, the Respondent requested the

suspension of the proceeding pending an award in the Parallel Arbitration or during such

other time as the Tribunal saw fit.

On August 30, 2013, the Claimants submitted their Response to the Respondent’s Request
for Bifurcation (““Claimants’ Response”), requesting the dismissal of the request and an order
from the Tribunal that all confidential information from the Parallel Arbitration disclosed by

the Respondent in its Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction be struck from the record.

By Procedural Order No. 2 of September 23, 2013, the Tribunal rejected the Respondent’s
Request for bifurcation or for a suspension of the proceeding and the Claimants’ request to
strike out from the record the confidential information from the Parallel Arbitration. On
October 18, 2013, the Respondent renewed its request for the suspension of the proceeding.

On November 25, 2013, the Tribunal rejected Venezuela’s request.

On December 20, 2013, Venezuela filed its Counter-Memorial on the Merits (“Venezuela’s
Counter-Memorial”) along with the accompanying exhibits, witness statements, expert

reports, and legal authorities.

On March 21, 2014, the Claimants submitted their Reply on the Merits and Counter-
Memorial on Jurisdiction together with the accompanying exhibits, expert reports, witness

statements, and legal authorities (the “Claimants’ Reply”).

On June 20, 2014, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on Jurisdiction,
together with the accompanying exhibits, expert reports, witness statements, and legal

authorities (the “Respondent’s Rejoinder’).

On June 21, 2014, the law firm of Shearman & Sterling LLP informed the Centre of its

withdrawal as counsel of record for the Respondent in this case.

On August 20, 2014, the Respondent notified the Centre the appointment of the law firm of

Guglielmino & Asociados S.A. as its new counsel of record in the case.

On August 21, 2014, the Claimants filed their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (the “Claimants”

Rejoinder on Jurisdiction”), together with the accompanying exhibits and legal authorities.

On August 26, 2014, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that Mr. Matthew DeDad, one of

their witness

 

's in this arbitration, had been terminated from his employment by Owens

Tllinois Inc., and indicated that his dismissal was unrelated to this arbitration.

On September 4, 2014, Venezuela, on the basis of the change in its legal representation in
this case, requested a 45-day postponement of the hearing in this case, which was originally
scheduled to take place from October 13 to 18, 2014. On September 9, 2014, the Claimants
opposed the Republic’s request.

On September 12, 2014, Venezuela reiterated its request for a 45-day postponement of the
hearing dates. On September 15, 2014, the Tribunal granted Venezuela’s request and

proposed new dates for the hearing.

On September 22 and 25, 2014, the Claimants and the Respondent respectively commented
on the Tribunal’s decision of September 15, 2014. On September 27, 2014, the Tribunal
reaffirmed its decision of September 15, 2015 and invited the Parties to confer and find new

dates for the hearing in this case.

On October 7, 2014, the Parties informed of their availability to hold a hearing during the
week of March 30, 2015 in Paris, France.

On December 14, 2014, the Respondent informed that Mr. Patricio Grané Labat, one of the
members of the Claimants’ legal team in this case, had taken part in Venezuela’s defense as
a member of his previous law firm and had had access to confidential information relating
to Venezuela’s interests and its defense strategy in other ICSID cases. On this basis, the

Respondent requested the Tribunal to exclude him as a member of the Claimants’ legal team.

On December 19, 2014, the Claimants rejected Venezuela’s allegations regarding Mr. Grané

Labat’s acquisition of confidential information regarding Venezuela’s strategy.

On December 29, 2014, Venezuela requested the Tribunal (i) to exclude from this case Mr.
Grané Labat, and the lawyers with access to the information he acquired, from any

subsequent procedural instance in representation of interests adverse to Venezuela, (ii) to

43.

44.

45.

46.

47.

48.

annul each procedural act that had taken place after Mr. Grané Labat’s incorporation to the

Claimants’ legal team, and (iii) to make itself available for a hearing on the matter.

On January 14, 2015, the Claimants requested the Tribunal to reject the Respondent’s request
of December 29, 2014.

On January 30, 2014, the Parties were informed that Ms. Marisa Planells-Valero, ICSID

Legal Counsel, would replace Ms. Kettlewell as Secretary of the Tribunal.

The Tribunal held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Parties by telephone
conference on February 9, 2015. On February 13, 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural

Order No. 7 concerning the organization of the hearing.

On March 4, 2015, the Secretary of the Tribunal conveyed a message from Mr. Mourre to
the Parties informing that, as from May 2015, he would be leaving his law firm of Castaldi
Mourre & Partners to establish his own individual arbitrator practice and that he would also
have a consultancy agreement with the law firm of Dechert LLP with the title of Special
Counsel. He also informed the Parties that Dechert LLP had within the past year been
adverse to Venezuela and/or Petréleos de Venezuela in six unrelated litigation matters, and
confirmed that he would not participate in any work of Dechert LLP with respect to

Venezuela, Petroleos de Venezuela or any other entity related to Venezuela.

On March 9, 2015, Venezuela indicated that Mr. Mourre’s communication of March 4, 2015
cast serious doubts about his suitability as an arbitrator in any of the cases to which
Venezuela was a party, and requested additional information concerning Mr. Mourre’s
relationship with Dechert LLP. On March 11, 2015, the Secretary of the Tribunal conveyed
a further message from Mr. Mourre to the Parties on the scope of his arrangement with

Dechert LLP, and invited the Parties’ comments by March 16, 2015.

On March 13, 2015, Venezuela proposed the disqualification of Mr. Mourre and Mr. Fortier
on the basis that each of them lacked the requisite impartiality and independence under

Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID Convention (the “Proposal’”).

On March 16, 2015, the Centre transmitted the Proposal to the Parties and the Tribunal
informing them that the proceeding had been suspended until the Proposal for
Disqualification was decided, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6). The Centre also
established a procedural schedule for written submissions on the Proposal for

Disqualification.

On March 19, 2015, Professor Shin informed that, in view of the pending challenge, the
dates for the upcoming hearing were vacated, and that new hearing dates would be fixed as

soon as possible after the resumption of the proceeding.

In accordance with the schedule, the Claimants submitted a Reply to the Proposal on March
24, 2015 and Mr. Fortier’s furnished explanations pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3)
on March 30, 2015.

Both Parties filed simultaneously additional comments on April 14, 2015.

On April 22, 2015, Mr. Fortier provided further explanations, and both Parties were invited

to submit their final comments on the Proposal on April 27, 2015.

On June 11, 2015, Venezuela submitted a further letter in connection to the Proposal for

Disqualification. On June 15, 2015, the Claimants provided comments on this letter.

On June 16, 2015, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council (i) rejected as

IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

123. The Tribunal summarizes below, insofar as relevant to make its determinations, the factual

background of these proceedings.

A. Context Prior to the Expropriation

(1) The Origins of the Investment

124. The origins of OldV’s and Favianca’s investments in Venezuela date back half a century? to
when they were incorporated (OldV‘ on April 13, 1956, and Favianca’ on August 8, 1968).
On December 31, 2005, OIEG acquired the majority shareholdings in OldV and Favianca.°
However, subsidiaries of Owens Illinois Inc. have held, directly or indirectly, a majority
shareholding in OIdV and Favianca for more than forty years. According to the Claimants,
Owens Illinois Inc. and its global subsidiaries are together global leaders in the development
of the machinery, technical processes and know-how used in the industrial production of

glass, and held a strong market position in Venezuela.”

The Claimants’ investments in Venezuela consisted of the operation of the two largest glass
container production and distribution businesses in Venezuela (together, the “Businesses” or
the “Plants”). OldV’s plant was located in the town of Los Guayos and Favianca’s plant in
Valera. According to the Claimants, these Plants were among the most advanced and state-

of-the-art glass production and distribution facilities in the world.*

The Claimants were glass suppliers in the Venezuelan market for major brands such as
Heinz, Kraft, Nestle and Gerber, among others. Its largest customer was Polar, the largest

company in Venezuela selling the consumer staples of beer, soft drinks and food products.”

(2) Governmental Reforms prior to the Expropriation

. Following the election of President Hugo Chavez in December 1998, Venezuela undertook

a series of measures in strategic sectors of the economy which included, among others, an

expropriation law and the establishment of a new exchange control system.

In 2001, the Republic issued a seven-year development plan (“Plan for Economic and Social
Development of the Nation 2001-2007”) that prioritized improvement in agricultural

productivity to meet domestic demand for food.!°

On 2002, Venezuela adopted the Law of Expropriation for Reasons of Public Use or Social
Interest (“LECUPS”) which regulates the forcible acquisition of rights and properties

belonging to private persons in Venezuela.!!

On April 2003, Venezuela launched the so-called Misi6n Mercal, which established a State-
run company known as Mercados de Alimentos, C.A. (Mercal), whose objective was to

create warehouses and supermarkets with low-cost staple foods and products. !?

. In late 2004, Venezuela established the Ministry of Popular Power for Food! to ensure the
population’s adequate access to food by promoting policies and regulations relating to food

production, storage, and transport. !#

. In 2008, Venezuela passed the Organic Law of Agro-Food Security and Sovereignty, in

order to ensure that its policy objectives were backed by a robust legal framework. !>

Finally, in 2010, Venezuela enacted the Law for the Defence of People in the Access to

Goods and Services (creating the INDEPABIS).'°

The Creation of CADIVI

In 2003, Venezuela adopted a currency exchange control regime in which the Venezuelan
Central Bank fixed foreign exchange rates and the newly created Comisién de
Administracién de Divisas (“CADIVI”) '’ would grant approvals for individuals or
companies to complete foreign currency transactions.'* In addition, CADIVI is tasked with
authorizing, inter alia, the repatriation of international investment capital, the remittal of
international investment profits, earnings, and dividends, and the compensation of

international investors for the expropriation of international investment dividends. !°

Consequently, a company that wishes to buy raw materials abroad, pay dividends to its
shareholders or make any other transaction that requires the conversion of Bolivars into US

Dollars must obtain the approval of CADIVI.”°

In 2008 and 2009, the Claimants made a request to CADIVI for authorization to acquire
foreign currency for distribution of the dividends declared in May 2008, November 2008
and June 2009.7! On September 8, 2011, CADIVI denied the three requests, concluding that

the dividends referred to in the request had already been paid to the shareholders.7”

The Expropriation

(1) The Expropriation Decree

On the evening of October 25, 2010, President Hugo Chavez, made a television broadcast

announcing the expropriation of Favianca and OIdV in which he stated:

The expropriation of this glass company is ready, how is it called? Owens-
Illinois! Be it expropriated. [Vice-President] Elias [Jaua] proceed. Owens-
Illinois, a company of North American capital that has been here for years, years
exploiting its workers, destroying the environment there, in... there, in ... in
Trujillo. Go see the hills that they have destroyed. And they have taken the
money of Venezuelans. Carry out an environment study, [Environmental
Minister] Hitcher; all environmental damages. So, proceed, Vice-President. And
there is another list there, right? Leave it there for today, for today leave it there.
Owens-Illinois, be it expropriated. In the meantime, the bourgeois can keep
laughing; keep laughing.”*

On October 26, 2010, Venezuela promulgated Presidential Decree 7.751 (the “Expropriation
Decree’), which was the formal instrument to implement President Chavez’s announcement

of October 25, 2010.74 The Expropriation Decree became effective on that same date.

The Expropriation Decree read, in relevant part, as follows:

140. On October 26, 2010, following President Chavez’s announcement of the expropriation,
Venezuela sent its National Guard to the Plants, where it took control of the main entrance
gate to each of the Plants, secured the premises and seized control over all movements in

and out of the Plants. A few hours later, the workers arrived at the Plants and began

protesting against the expropriation outside the facilities. The National Guard remained at

the Plants for several weeks. 7°

. On October 27, 2010, Minister Menendez of MINCIT, joined by Deputy Minister Yuri

Pimentel, met with OldV’s management in Caracas?’ in order to make a first attempt of

contact following the announcement of the measure:

The Minister also explained how the Ministry wished to proceed from that point
forward. He did not intend for the Ministry to take over the management of the
Plants in an abrupt and immediate manner. Rather, while the Ministry progressed
the legal proceedings necessary to secure the management and, eventually, the
compulsory purchase of the Plant’s assets, OIdV and its personnel would
continue operating the Plants as usual, whereas the Ministry would limit itself to
supervising OIdV’s management activities, without interfering with them but,
insofar as necessary, offering OIdV any support requested by its employees. To
this end, the next day the Ministry would appoint supervisory bodies tasked with
organizing the transition of the management of the Plants.”

. During these exchanges, the Minister stated that “any action taken with the intention of

paralyzing the Plants’ operativity would be considered an act of sabotage.””

Further to this meeting. Minister Menendez, joined by Deputy Minister Yuri Pimentel,

visited the Plants on October 28, 2010.°°

Following this, a transition period began, initially led by Deputy Minister Pimentel, who
assumed responsibility on a de facto basis until January 2011 when responsibility was taken

over by Mr. Alejandro Sarmiento.*!

The first objective was for the Plants to continue operating normally; Venezuela therefore
decided that OIldV and Favianca’s workers should continue to work at the facilities. The
second objective was for all of the knowledge and experience in managing and operating the
Plants to be transmitted to a new management team. To do this, the Respondent implemented
what was termed “Operation Mirror” in the Plants, which consisted of forming a
management team comprised of five members of the work force, distinguishing the areas of
priority and identifying certain essential profiles. Each of these individuals was required to
shadow the corresponding OIdV manager in order to acquire the necessary know-how for

managing the Plants autonomously.*?

(2) Measures taken by Venezuela following the Expropriation Decree
a. The INDEPABIS Audits

On October 27 and 28, 2010, the INDEPABIS conducted an audit of Favianca and OIdV
respectively, for “preventative measure[s] for temporary occupancy” and constituted interim
administrative boards for OIdV and Favianca in order to oversee their “operability,

administration, and benefiting.”*

b. The INPSASEL Review and Fine

. In November 2010, Venezuela deployed INPSASEL, its occupational health and safety

agency, to the Los Guayos plant to conduct a review of historic occupational health and
safety compliance by OIdV.** On August 25, 2011, INPSASEL issued a report proposing
sanctions and on August 30, 2011 initiated a sanctions proceeding against OIdV due to the
alleged commission of five violations of the Organic Law on Prevention, Working

Conditions and the Work Environment (“LOPCYMAT”).*°

* The priority areas selected were: logistics, sales and marketing, human resources, finance, and plant

management. Sarmiento I WS, { 21.

OldV responded on September 16, 2011, denying any accusation and requesting that the

proposed fine be annulled.*°

On February 28, 2012, INPSASEL issued an administrative decision indicating that OldV
had not complied with certain provisions of the LOPCYMAT, and imposing a fine of VEB
10,988,550 for such violation.*”

c. The Provisional Remedy granted by the First Administrative Court

On November 18, 2010, the Office of the Attorney General filed an application with the First
Administrative Court for a provisional remedy consisting of the occupation, possession and
use of the movable and immovable properties and improvements presumably owned by

OldV and Favianca. **

. On 20 December 2010, the First Administrative Court granted the Attorney General’s ex

parte application and ordered the provisional remedy in favour of Venezuela for the

occupation, possession and use of these properties.*?

d. Visits to the Plants by Third Parties

In November 2010, Venezuela invited a delegation from a Uruguayan company called
Envidrio to visit the Plants and inspect the machinery, equipment and processes. A second
visit by this same company was arranged in January 2011. The Claimants objected to both

visits out of their concern to protect the proprietary information at the Plants.*°

. Following this visit, Envidrio produced a preliminary report on the condition of the

machinery and equipment at the Plants.*!

e. The MINCIT Resolution

On March 15, 2011, as a result of the decision of the First Administrative Court and Article
8 of the Expropriation Decree, MINCIT issued a Resolution to authorize the creation of an
ad hoc management board to replace the interim boards and to manage “the companies
OWENS ILLINOIS DE VENEZUELA, C.A., Plant OWENS ILLINOIS DE VENEZUELA,
C.A. and FABRICA DE VIDRIOS LOS ANDES, C.A. (FAVINCA) [sic]” with Mr.

Alexander Sarmiento as Chairman of this board.”

On March 16 and 25, 2011,° respectively, the Enforcement Courts for the Los Guayos and
Valera municipalities enforced the provisional remedy authorised by the First
Administrative Court for the occupation, possession and use of the Claimants’ assets;
installed the ad hoc Management Board; and ordered that the Claimants’ bank accounts
could only be used with the express authorization of the ad hoc Management Board. At the
request of Mr. Sarmiento, the Enforcement Courts granted two consecutive 30-day

extensions for each plant.

f. The Creation of Venvidrio

On April 5, 2011, President Chavez promulgated Presidential Decree 8.134 in which he
established a “State Company [...] by the name of VENEZOLANA DEL VIDRIO, C.A.”
(“Venvidrio”) to take over management from the ad hoc administrative board in order to
produce, manufacture and commercialize glass containers through the Businesses.*° Mr.

Sarmiento was appointed President of Venvidrio.*°

On April 30, 2011, Venvidrio directly took over management of the Plants. At that time, the
formation of the new boards of directors had been completed and the process of employer

substitution from OIdV to Venvidrio had been finalised.“”

Once Venvidrio had been formed and a bank account had been opened in its name, the
Respondent requested that the Claimants transfer all available cash funds into Venvidrio’s
account. After informing the Respondent about the bank accounts that were held in their
name and the balances available at the time in those accounts, the Claimants forwarded the

cash they held in their bank accounts to Venvidrio’s account.“*

(3) The Expropriation Procedure and the Compensation Negotiations
a. The Amicable Settlement Phase

In late 2010, Venezuela’s Attorney General sought to commence the Amicable Settlement
Phase provided for in the LECUPS. On December 9, 2010, the Claimants wrote to Minister
Menendez to express their refusal to participate in any proceeding under the LECUPS,*? and

that fair compensation should be determined based on the provisions of the BIT.*°

On March 16 and 25, 2011, the Claimants stated before the Enforcement Courts of Los
Guayos and Valera, respectively, that they were not going to participate in any court or

administrative proceeding initiated by Venezuela in relation to this matter.*!

. On March 14, 2011, in view of the fact that the Claimants were not going to participate in

the amicable Settlement Phase, the Office of the Attorney General initiated a legal procedure

under the LECUPS, filing an expropriation petition with the First and Second Administrative

Courts.*?

On April 5, 2011, the Trial Court of the Second Court for Administrative-Contentious
Matters issued a decision in which it granted the request for expropriation made by the
Attorney General and ordered that notice be served to the Claimants so that the respective

judicial inspections could be conducted.**

. The expropriation proceeding was subsequently joined with the case involving the

provisional remedy that had been authorised by the First Administrative Court (see {| 150

above).
Currently, the proceedings before the Second Administrative Court are pending.**

b. The Negotiations for Compensation

From January to July 2011, the Claimants and Venezuela held four meetings in order to

negotiate the compensation due for the Plants.

The first two meetings were held, respectively, on January 20 and 24, 2011. In the course

of these meetings, the Parties agreed on a roadmap for the negotiations.*>

. At the third meeting on March 17, 2011, the Claimants presented an appraisal of slightly

over USD 1 billion for 100% of the Claimants’ Businesses.*° On July 11, 2011, at the fourth
and last meeting, Venezuela made a counter-offer of USD 100-120 million.*” The meeting
concluded without any agreement being reached about the amount of compensation

payable.**

C. Impact of the Parallel Arbitration in this case

168. The Respondent notes that OIEG has obtained an award in the Parallel Arbitration that

covered all of its shareholding in the Claimants, and which amount to 72.983% of the
damages sought by the Claimants in this case. Accordingly, the Respondent submits, the
Tribunal should consider the outcome of the OIEG Award to avoid double recovery arising
from the Parallel Arbitration and the present proceeding, as allowing the Claimants to do so

would constitute an abuse of process.*?

169. The Respondent further argues that the remaining 27.017% of the damages sought in this

case would also fall outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction because the ultimate beneficiaries of
those shares were not foreign nationals and thus would not meet the requirements of Article
25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. On September 21, 2015, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration

Rule 41(1), the Tribunal decided to dismiss as untimely this jurisdictional objection.”

170. The Respondent also notes that OIEG has not sought any remedy under the ICSID

171.

Convention against the OIEG Award and is seeking to enforce it before the United States
Courts. Accordingly, the Respondent concludes, OIEG’s consent to the decision made by
the tribunal in the Parallel Arbitration would preclude the Claimants from seeking double

recovery by making the same claims in this arbitration.®!

In its Memorial on the Merits, the Claimants stated “[t]o the extent that OIEG recovers
compensation in that separate arbitration, whether by way of settlement or satisfaction of an

award or otherwise, such recoveries shall be set off against the compensation payable to the

762

Claimants in this proceeding. According to the Claimants, since Venezuela has failed to

pay any compensation to OIEG and has initiated annulment proceedings against the award

rendered in the Parallel Arbitration, at the moment, there is no need to readjust their claim

in this arbitration.

According to the Claimants, there is a risk that the Claimants could be deprived of redress
and denied justice if the OIEG Award was annulled. Moreover, the OIEG Award did not
cover 100% of the Claimants’ businesses expropriated by Venezuela. On this basis, the
Claimants state that the Tribunal should exercise its jurisdiction and address any concern of
potential double-recovery by specifying in its award “that the Respondent shall pay
compensation to the Claimants equal to: (a) 27.017% of the Tribunal’s valuation of the
Claimants’ investment; and (b) 72.983% of the Tribunal’s valuation minus any amounts
collected by OIEG pursuant to the OJEG Award.” The Claimants add that, in its Award, the
Tribunal could also add a provision stating that “if the Claimants collect on an award issued
by this Tribunal before OIEG collects compensation pursuant to the OJEG Award, any
amount to be paid to OIEG pursuant to the OJEG Award must be reduced by any collections

by the Claimants that are above 27.017% of the Tribunal’s valuation in the present case.”

Venezuela’s Denunciation of the BIT and the ICSID Convention

. On April 30, 2008, the Respondent provided to the Netherlands a notice of termination of

the BIT.©

In accordance with the terms of Article 14(2) of the BIT, the termination took effect six
months from the date of the notice. The BIT therefore terminated as of November 1, 2008,

subject to Article 14(3) (see below {| 184).

On January 8, 2012, President Hugo Chavez Frias announced that Venezuela would

denounce the ICSID Convention.°°

177.

On January 24, 2012, and pursuant to Art. 71 of the Convention, the Republic formally and
irrevocably denounced the Convention through a written notice addressed to the depositary,
the World Bank.® In this notice, Venezuela stated that it was denouncing the ICSID
Convention because its provisions were contrary to Article 151 of the 1999 Constitution of

the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
In its letter of denunciation, Venezuela stated:

Beyond this legal consideration, modern Venezuelan society does not conceive
constraints on its ability to make decisions about the great strategic guidelines
along which its economic and social life should develop.

Accordingly, the government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has
implemented policies to reaffirm national sovereignty, especially concerning
property of strategic assets, always offering just compensation to the affected
individuals and companies.”

V. JURISDICTION

178.

The Respondent objects to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal ratione voluntatis alleging that
there was no mutual consent by the Parties to submit the dispute to ICSID before Venezuela’s
denunciation of the ICSID Convention on January 24, 2012, and that Article 9 of the BIT
was rendered ineffective by Venezuela’s denunciation of the ICSID Convention and
therefore does not provide an alternative basis for the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. In
addition, the Respondent objects to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal ratione temporis over the

investments made by the Claimants after the termination of the BIT.

179. The Claimants, in turn, contend that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute because,
pursuant to Article 71 of the ICSID Convention, Venezuela’s denunciation of the ICSID
Convention only took effect six months after receipt of the notice of denunciation. The
Claimants further state that the denunciation of the ICSID Convention cannot limit or qualify
the “unconditional” consent to arbitrate contained in a BIT and that, accordingly,
Venezuela’s consent to ICSID Arbitration in the BIT subsisted at the time of Venezuela’s
denunciation of the ICSID Convention. Furthermore, as to the jurisdictional objection
ratione temporis, the Claimants investments pre-date the BIT’s termination date and, by

operation of Article 14(3) of the BIT, are covered by the protections afforded by the BIT.

A. The Relevant Provisions of the ICSID Convention and the BIT

180. Article 71 of the ICSID Convention provides:

Any Contracting State may denounce this Convention by written notice to the
depositary of this Convention. The denunciation shall take effect six months
after receipt of such notice.

181. Article 72 of the ICSID Convention states:

Notice by a Contracting State pursuant to Articles 70 or 71 shall not affect the
rights or obligations under this Convention of that State or of any of its
constituent subdivisions or agencies or of any national of that State arising out
of consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre given by one of them before such
notice was received by the depositary.

182. Paragraphs (1) and (4) of Article 9 of the BIT provide:

1. Disputes between one Contracting Party and a national of the other
Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the former under this Agreement
in relation to an investment of the latter, shall at the request of the national
concerned be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes, for settlement by arbitration or conciliation under the Convention on
the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other
States opened for signature at Washington on 18 March 1965.

4. Each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the
submission of disputes as referred to in Paragraph 1 of this Article to
international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Article.

Article 14(2) of the BIT reads:

Unless notice of termination has been given by either Contracting Party at least
six months before the date of the expiry of its validity, the present Agreement
shall be extended tacitly for periods of ten years, each Contracting Party
reserving the right to terminate the Agreement upon notice of at least six months
before the date of expiry of the current period of validity.

Article 14(3) of the BIT further provides:

In respect of investments made before the date of the termination of the present
Agreement [the provisions of the BIT] shall continue to be effective for a further
period of fifteen years from that date.

The Parties’ Positions

(1) The Respondent’s Position
a. The Tribunal’s Jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention

According to the Respondent, it is clear from Article 25 (1) of the ICSID Convention that
the jurisdiction of ICSID depends upon the existence of mutual consent by the Host State
and the investor.”” By operation of Article 72 of the ICSID Convention, for the rights and
obligations of the parties arising out of consent to the ICSID jurisdiction to survive, this
mutual consent is to be established prior to the denunciation of the ICSID Convention by the

Host state. 7!

In this case, the Respondent had already withdrawn from the ICSID Convention when the
Claimants consented to the jurisdiction of ICSID on July 20, 2012.” Accordingly, the

Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the present dispute because the Parties failed to give mutual

consent to ICSID jurisdiction prior to Venezuela’s denunciation of the ICSID Convention

on January 24, 2012.73

Scope of Application of Article 71 and 72 of the ICSID Convention

The Respondent explains that there exist under the ICSID Convention certain rights and
obligations that arise out of the consent of the parties and other rights and obligations that
do not arise out of the same, but which nevertheless bind the Contracting States to the

Convention.”

According to the Respondent, the rights and obligations arising out of mutual consent to the
parties are: “The right to initiate arbitration (Art. 36); The right to participate in the
constitution of the arbitral tribunal (Art. 37); The right to participate in the arbitral
proceeding (Arts. 41 and 44); The rights to access the post-award mechanisms of Arts. 49(2)
(requiring the Tribunal to rectify errors, or to try a question omitted by the Tribunal); 50 (to
request clarification of the award); 51 (to request revision of the award due to the discovery
of a fact that would decisively influence the award); and 52 (to request the annulment of an
award on certain established grounds); The obligation to abide by and comply with the award
(Art. 53); and The obligation to not pursue other remedies, such as diplomatic protection

(Arts. 26, 27).”75

These would be the rights and obligations which Article 72 safeguards from the effects of
the denunciation of the ICSID Convention. Article 72 does so by providing, in essence, that
the denunciation of the Convention by a Contracting State does not affect the said rights
when both parties have given their consent to the jurisdiction of ICSID before the

denunciation.”

On the contrary, Article 71 of the ICSID Convention regulates the effects of the denunciation

on those other rights and obligations not arising out of consent of the parties.””

Those rights and obligations are: (i) the right of the Contracting States to participate in the
ICSID Administrative Council (Articles 4 to 7); (ii) the right to nominate individuals to the

Panel of Conciliators and Arbitrators (Art. 14); and (iii) the obligation to respect the

immunities and privileges contemplated in the Convention (Articles 18-24).’®

The fact that Articles 71 and 72 have different critical dates further evidences that these
Articles have different scopes of application and that there can be no overlap between the
two provisions. According to the Respondent, “Article 71 produces its effects six months

after the date of receipt of the notice of denunciation whereas Article 72 applies to consent

performed until the date of receipt of the notice of denunciation.””

In support of this interpretation of Articles 71 and 72, the Respondent cites Prof. Schreuer,®°

who describes the relationship between Articles 71 and 72 as follows:

Article 71 of the ICSID Convention provides that the denunciation of the
Convention by a Contracting State takes effect six months after receipt of the
notice of denunciation. Therefore, for the period of six months the rights and

7 Respondent’s Reply, J 14 (emphasis in the original).

80 Respondent’s Reply, {| 15. The Respondent notes that Prof. Schreuer’s view is shared by other scholars, and
cites to this effect the following articles: Barrie Sanders, Venezuela: the consequences of ICSID Denunciation,
in 7 GAR 2, at 4, RLA-104: “[W]hen read in the context of the ICSID Convention as a whole, the more
persuasive view is that the phrase ‘consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre’ in article 72 refers to the reciprocal
consent of the investor and the host state. Several provisions of the ICSID Convention point in this direction.
[I]t would be a strange result for a host state to be permitted to withdraw its unilateral consent under article
25(1) prior to such consent being perfected by an investor, but to be bound by that same unilateral consent
under article 72 upon denouncing the convention. In addition, article 72 only preserves ‘the rights or obligations.
under this Convention [...] arising out of consent’. Whereas several provisions of the ICSID Convention are
triggered by the perfected consent of the investor and the host State...none of [them is] triggered by a mere:
unilateral consent on the part of the host state. With this in mind, construing the phrase ‘consent to the
jurisdiction of the Centre’ as merely referring to the unilateral consent of a host state would render article 72

 

meaningless [...].” Julien Fouret for whom the interpretation whereby Article 72 would require only the
unilateral consent of the host State “is rather a minority view” (Julien Fouret, Denunciation of the Washington
fe ion and Non- Ci 1 Arbitration: “ ing Consent” to ICSID Arbitration?, in

obligations arising from the Convention continue to apply to the denouncing
state, in principle.

Article 72 contains a different rule on the effective date of the denunciation with
respect to consent. If consent was given before the notice of denunciation rights
or obligations arising therefrom shall remain unaffected. Therefore, Article 72
modifies the general rule of Article 71 in two ways:

a) The critical date for the denunciation’s effect on consent is not the general
tule on the taking of effect of the notice of denunciation (6 months after its
receipt) but rather the date of its receipt.

b) Rights or obligations arising from consent to jurisdiction remain unaffected
by the denunciation even beyond the date the denunciation takes effect i.e.
beyond the six-month period.*!

Accordingly, the Respondent continues, since the six-month period established by Article
71 does not extend to the rights or obligations arising out of Venezuela’s consent to the
jurisdiction of the Centre, this Article cannot be relied upon by investors to extend the
denouncing party’s consent to ICSID jurisdiction beyond the denunciation of the

Convention. *

Furthermore, under the Claimants’ interpretation, both Article 71 and 72 would have the
same purpose i.e., to establish the survival of the State’s consent to the jurisdiction of ICSID
during six months after denunciation of the Convention by the State. This interpretation
would be “‘on its face contrary to basic principles of Treaty interpretation as it denies in fine

any effectiveness to Article 72 of the ICSID Convention.”*?

The ordinary meaning and context of Article 72

Venezuela submits that the wording of Article 72 supports its interpretation of this Article,

and that the phrase “given by one of them” in Article 72 can only refer to the parties that can

express their consent to submit to the Centre’s jurisdiction, namely, the Contracting State,

its constituent subdivisions or agencies or any national of that State. **

. Accordingly, Venezuela continues, Article 72 deals with the consequences of denouncing

the Convention only for the denouncing side: the denouncing state as a host State, its entities,

and its own nationals as investors in other Contracting States.*°

On the basis of this provision, a Contracting State is prevented from relying on the
denunciation of another Contracting State “as an excuse to escape its obligation to arbitrate
against a national of that denouncing State who already gave its consent to arbitration,” and,
by the same token, the denouncing State will also “remain bound in the event its offer of
ICSID arbitration is accepted by an investor from another Contracting State before the

denunciation.” °°

The Respondent further notes the Claimants’ argument that Article 72 does not refer to the
parties’ mutual consent because of the absence in the text of this Article of the full expression
“mutual consent’, in comparison with the text of Article 25. On the contrary, the Respondent
asserts, the principle underlying both Articles is the same: that consent may not be
unilaterally withdrawn so long as both parties have already given consent. Article 72 applies

the principle of Article 25(1) to the context of denunciation. *”
The Drafting History of Article 72

According to Venezuela, the drafting history of Article 72 also supports its interpretation of

this provision.

The Respondent cites Aron Broches’ opening comment on the discussion about Article 72,
in which he stated that Article 72 “was intended to deal with the effects of denunciation of

the Convention... on consents to...arbitration...already given.”** The Respondent submits

that the use of the passive voice of the plural “consents” in this sentence could only mean

that Mr. Broches was referring to the mutual consent of the parties to arbitration.*?

The Respondent also recalls that, when explaining the purpose of Article 72, Mr. Broches
stated that “the intention...was to make it clear that if a State had consented to arbitration,
for instance by entering into an arbitration clause with an investor, the subsequent
denunciation of the Convention by that Sate would not relieve it from its obligation to go to
arbitration if a dispute arose.” According to the Respondent, the example given by Mr.
Broches in this sentence shows that the intention behind this provision was one where mutual

consent is required for Article 72 to apply.”

. The Respondent opposes the Claimants’ argument according to which Article 72 should

apply to consent in both an arbitration clause in a contract and to a general offer to arbitrate
inaBIT. According to the Respondent, in his comments, “Mr Broches was referring to the

only situation he had in mind when discussing Article 72: an arbitration clause where there

is already mutual consent to arbitrate — not an investment treaty.”.?!

The Respondent also cites the following passage from Mr. Broches’ comments:

[T]he consent of the State may be embodied...in an investment protection treaty
with another State, which provides that investors meeting certain conditions or
falling within certain categories will have the right to submit investment disputes
with the host State to the Centre. The consent of the investor may be evidenced
by an express statement to that effect made to the host State, or it may be given
at the time when the investor institutes proceedings against the host State. It
must, however, be remembered that each party’s consent becomes irrevocable
only after both parties have given it. Therefore, in the examples last mentioned,
the host State could withdraw its consent as long as the investor had not equally
consented.”

Venezuela contends that this passage shows that “Mr Broches believed that states could
withdraw their consent to arbitration in an investment treaty ‘as long as the investor had not

equally consented,”” and that, therefore, “Article 72 only becomes relevant when the investor

[has] ‘equally consented’.”°?

b. The Tribunal’s Jurisdiction under the BIT

According to the Respondent, as a consequence of the denunciation, Venezuela’s consent to
arbitrate in Article 9 of the BIT, which was expressly limited to ICSID arbitration, was

withdrawn forthwith.”

Principles of Treaty Interpretation

The Respondent explains that, in Article 9 of the BIT, the Contracting States agreed to submit
to arbitration “under the Convention.” Venezuela examines the ordinary meaning of this
word and states that “under” in Article 9(1) of the BIT means “arbitration ‘as provided for
by the rules of’ the ICSID Convention.”®> Accordingly, the consent of the Republic in

Article 9 is expressly subject to and conditioned upon the Convention.*°

Venezuela further argues that the context of the word “under” confirms its interpretation.
The consent to arbitration expressed in Article 9(4) of the BIT is for the submission of
disputes (i) “as referred to in Paragraph 1 of this Article” and (ii) “in accordance with the
provisions of this Article.” According to the Respondent, this means that Venezuela’s
consent to arbitration “is subject to ‘Paragraph 1’ and ‘the provisions of this article [9]’ and

hence to the ICSID Convention.”®”

Moreover, the Respondent notes that “before making a reference to ‘under the [ICSID]

Convention,’ paragraph 1 already specifies that disputes are to be submitted to ICSID.”

Accordingly, Venezuela continues, “if the reference to ‘under the ICSID Convention’ did

not play any limiting role, [...] the wording of paragraph 1 would be redundant.”°*

The Respondent concludes that the Claimants’ interpretation according to which the term
“under” would explain the mode in which the “unconditional” consent to arbitration is to be
acted upon, i.e., pursuant to the ICSID Convention, deprives the term “under the ICSID
Convention” of any real meaning and leads to a result contradictory to the principle of

effectiveness.”

. Furthermore, the Respondent argues, a review of other BITs concluded by Venezuela,

confirms that the use of the word “under” (instead of “established by” or “created by” in
other BITs concluded by Venezuela), shows that “this [was] a “deliberate choice by the
Contracting parties - the Netherlands and Venezuela - to ensure their consent would be

subject to the provisions of the ICSID Convention.” !°°

Venezuela further submits that “when the Republic denounced the ICSID Convention on
January 24, 2012, it automatically withdrew its consent to ICSID arbitration under the BIT,
and rendered Article 9 of the BIT ineffective. The date of the Republic’s denunciation of the
Convention was the last day the Claimants could have accepted the offer to arbitrate in the

BIT.”!0!

. Venezuela concludes that the only effect that the denunciation had on the BIT was that

consent to ICSID Arbitration in Article 9 was rendered ineffective. The denunciation had

no effect on the other provisions of the BIT which, according to Article 14(3) of the BIT,

remain in force until 2023.'

Principle of Effectiveness

Venezuela argues, in application of the rule of effectiveness or effet utile, that the term
“unconditional” in Article 9 means that “for as long as the consent is extant, it is
unconditional: it is subject to no conditions or qualifications.” Accordingly, an unconditional

consent to arbitration may still be withdrawn. !°

On this point, the Respondent recalls that only two of the 28 bilateral investment treaties
entered into by Venezuela provide that consent to arbitration is “irrevocable”, and the BIT
at hand is not one of them.'** Venezuela further submits that “[iJn an ICSID-only BIT as
this one, the spirit of the BIT [...] is to offer recourse to arbitration as long as each

Contracting Party to the BIT is willing to remain part of ICSID.”!°5
Pacta Sunt Servanda

As to the Claimants’ argument that absence of any recourse to ICSID arbitration in this case
would amount to a “denial of justice,” the Respondent defends that “arbitration is not the
only means to have claims formed pursuant to the substantive protections offered by the BIT
heard and tried,” and that “the BIT is part and parcel of the Venezuelan order and the

Venezuelan courts have jurisdiction to apply these provisions.”!°°

. The Respondent further notes that “the consequences of the Compulsory Acquisition of the

Plants which are at the core of the Claimants’ case are already before the Venezuelan courts”
and “the Claimants have deliberately chosen to ignore these proceedings.” Furthermore, the
Respondent adds, the BIT claim arising out of the Compulsory Acquisition of the Plants has

already been heard by an ICSID tribunal in the Parallel Arbitration. '°”

Venezuela denies that, as the Claimants allege, it “does not intend to perform” Article 9 of

the BIT. On the contrary, its position is compatible with the principle of pacta sunt servanda

as Venezuela is “fully committed to meeting all of its obligations under the BIT and the

ICSID Convention, provided they exist.”!°

(2) The Claimants’ Position
a. The Tribunal’s Jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention

According to the Claimants, Articles 71 and 72 of the ICSID Convention establish that, at a
minimum an ICSID Contracting State’s consent to ICSID arbitration will subsist for six
months after a notice of denunciation has been lodged with the World Bank, i.e., until the
denunciation takes effect.!°? The Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the dispute in this case on
the basis that at the time the Claimants consented to ICSID jurisdiction on July 20, 2017, the
Respondent was still an ICSID Contracting State and its consent to arbitration in the BIT

was extant.!!°

Furthermore, in their Post Hearing Brief, the Claimants stated the following: “at the Hearing,
[...] the Respondent’s witnesses accepted that, in 2011, long before the Respondent’s
denunciation of the ICSID Convention, the Claimants had notified the Respondent of their
intention to refer the dispute to arbitration under the BIT.” The Claimants submit that “that
reference can be understood only as consent to the jurisdiction of ICSID and of this Tribunal,
with the result that the Claimants and the Respondent consented to ICSID arbitration prior

vill

to the Respondent’s denunciation, and that “the contemporaneous record bears out the

fact that the Claimants had expressed their consent to ICSID arbitration repeatedly over the

course of late 2010 and early 2011.”!!?

Scope of Application of Article 71 and 72 of the ICSID Convention

According to the Claimants, the ordinary meaning of Article 71 is clear: the article explains
in simple terms, and without any textual limit, that all consequences of denunciation of the

ICSID Convention shall take effect six months after receipt of the notice of denunciation.!!?

. The Claimants submit that their interpretation of Article 71 “respects the object and purpose

of the ICSID Convention by achieving a result that ensures the availability of dispute
settlement by arbitration for at least as long as the ICSID Convention is effective vis-a-vis a
denouncing State.”!'* This is further confirmed by Article 70 of the VCLT, pursuant to

which “explicit language is required in order for a treaty’s denunciation to ‘release’ the

denouncing State from obligations that accrued during the life of the treaty.” '!

Accordingly, the Claimants conclude, the denunciation of the ICSID Convention operates to
release the denouncing party from the ICSID Convention “only from the end of the six-

month waiting period.”!!®

The Claimants qualify Prof. Schreuer’s interpretation of Articles 71 and 72 as the “minority
opinion”, !!’ and submit that the scholarship “leans strongly against the Respondent’s
interpretation, and supports the Claimants’ interpretation [of Article 71].”!'® On this point,
the Claimants differentiate between those authors who state that investors can consent to and

initiate arbitration within the six-month period in Article 71 but not after, |! and those other

authors who go further and conclude that if the relevant consent to ICSID arbitration, e.g. in
the applicable BIT, survives and extends beyond that six-month period, then ICSID
jurisdiction will subsist for the full duration of that extended period.'”° Both groups construe
Article 71 in a manner which permits investors to perfect consent and to start ICSID
arbitration against a Contracting State within the six-month period.'*! The Claimants cite,
among others, the Nicaragua v. United States case before the ICJ, to submit that

international jurisprudence relating to the denunciation of treaties confirms this point. !??

Furthermore, the Claimants continue, Article 72 confirms that this Tribunal has jurisdiction

over the dispute when it establishes that the rights and obligations arising out of a State’s

 

consent to ICSID arbitration given before the filing of a notice of denunciation of the ICSID
Convention by a State are not affected by the filing of a notice of denunciation. According
to the Claimants, “it does so, by permitting the instrument containing the consent to
determine on its own terms how long the consent will last.” In this case, Articles 9 and 14(3)
of the BIT determine that the consent to arbitration runs for a number of years after the
instrument of consent is terminated, pursuant to the termination provisions in that instrument,

irrespective of the status as a party to the ICSID Convention.'”

The Claimants’ interpretation of Article 72 is not, as alleged by the Respondent, that it
merely clarifies Article 71, but gives “independent, albeit related, operation to Articles 71
and 72.” The fact that the proper interpretation of those provisions leads to the same result

in this case does not alter this.!74

The Ordinary Meaning and Context of Article 72

According to the Claimants, Article 72 does not regulate or specify when consent can be
perfected, nor does it require “mutual consent” as a precedent condition. Rather the reference
to “consent” in Article 72 “relates only to a singular consent to ICSID arbitration given by

the denouncing State (or the other listed entities connected to it)”.!?>

. The ordinary meaning of the words indicates that the word “them”, as used in Article 72, is

a reference to one of the denouncing “State or... any of its constituent subdivisions of
agencies or... any national of that State.” Accordingly, the Claimants argue, Article 72
cannot refer to the “consent of current or future investor-claimants that might bring a claim
against the denouncing State.” Consequently, “if potential investor-claimants are excluded
from the concept of ‘consent’ in Article 72, then ‘consent’ cannot be a reference to mutual

consent.””!?6

The French version of Article 72, which refers to the singular “wn consentement’, and
excludes the plural ““consentements” that appeared in an earlier draft of that provision, further
contradicts the Respondent’s thesis that Article 72 refers to mutual reciprocated consents

provided by both of the parties to an ICSID arbitration. '7”

The Claimants add that “authors are overwhelmingly critical of the ‘offer and acceptance’
theory” on which the Respondent relies to substantiate its interpretation of Article 72, which
is “predicated entirely upon the minority opinion of Professor Schreuer.”!?* On this point,

the Claimants cite, among others, Sourgens, !?° who states:

[T]he offer-and-acceptance model is incoherent. Its focus on the relationship
between host state and investor blocks out the existing relationship between the
host state and the home state. It transforms a three dimensional relationship into
a two dimensional playing field. . . . [D]enunciation of the ICSID Convention
cannot have the effect of foreclosing ICSID as a potential forum for dispute

resolution under a bilateral investment treaty. . .. Had the drafters intended what
Professor Schreuer submits, Article 72 would have had to read ‘given by one of
them and a national of another Contracting State or another Contracting State.’
. .. By contextual analysis, the Convention could not be clearer: if a state wishes
to withdraw its consent to arbitration, it must do so according to the terms of the
consent instrument, not through denunciation of the ICSID Convention. !°°

230. The Claimants further state that “Prof. Scheuer explicitly acknowledges that there is a

231.

233.

‘possible alternative interpretation’”'*! of Article 72.

As to the context of Article 72, the Claimants submit that when the ICSID Convention refers
to mutual consent, instead of the consent of only one of the parties to an arbitration, it does
so expressly in the relevant provision, and cites the Preamble of the ICSID Convention and
Chapter II (Articles 25 to 27) which deals with the jurisdiction of ICSID and in which,
according to the Claimants, the Convention distinguishes between instances where mutual
consent is relevant and those others where it is not. The absence of any “mutual consent”

condition in Article 72 is a clear indication that no such condition exists in that provision. !*?

 

. According to the Claimants, the Respondent’s attempt to invoke Article 72’s drafting history

in order to reverse its ordinary meaning, as understood in its proper context, is contrary to

Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT.!*3

The Claimants submit that the drafting history of the ICSID Convention “does not justify
the Respondent’s attempt to narrow the scope of Article 72 by focusing on the drafters’

discussion of an agreement between a State and an investor (e.g. a contract) as the source of

mutual consent.” !*4

The Claimants refer to the paragraph of the drafting history of the ICSID Convention in
which Mr Broches refers to the “consents to . . . arbitration . . . already given” quoted by the
Respondent to show that Mr Broches was referring to “mutual consent”. The Claimants
argue that this paragraph is to be read together with Mr Broches’ next comment, i.e., that
“the intention of Article [72] . . . was to make it clear that if a State had consented to
arbitration . . . the subsequent denunciation of the Convention by that State would not relieve
it from its obligation to go to arbitration if a dispute arose”. These two statements read
together would show that Mr Broches was citing the singular consent of the denouncing

State as the consent relevant to Article 72.!35

b. The Tribunal’s Jurisdiction under the BIT

. According to the Claimants, the Respondent’s “unconditional” consent to ICSID Arbitration

in the BIT subsisted at the time of Venezuela’s denunciation of the ICSID Convention.'*
The Claimants argue that the BIT contains in its Articles 9(1) and (4) the “unconditional”
consent to the jurisdiction of ICSID, and that such consent remains in force until the year
2023. The denunciation of the ICSID Convention cannot limit or qualify the “unconditional”

consent to arbitrate contained in the BIT.!°7

 

reaty Interpretation

According to the Claimants, the interpretation of Article 9 of the BIT proposed by Venezuela

runs contrary to the object and purpose of the BIT and is not conducted in good faith. '**

The Claimants start by noting that, “the Respondent entirely ignores the meaning and effect
of the phrase ‘shall at the request of the national concerned.”!*° According to the Claimants,

the ordinary meaning of this phrase is that, “once Venezuela became a Contracting State to

54, CLA-12. The Claimants add that the Respondent has been unable to cite to the drafting history (or to the
text of Article 72) to argue that Article 72 refers to “mutual consent” of the kind inherent to a contract between
a State and an investor.

the ICSID Convention on June 1, 1995, the only step needed to commence an ICSID

arbitration was for an aggrieved investor to request it.”'4°

The Claimants further state that this is not altered by the word “under” in Article 9(1) of the
BIT which, in this context, means “in accordance with’, and not the “dominance or control”
of the ICSID Convention under the BIT as defended by the Respondent. This term prescribes
how Venezuela’s unconditional consent to ICSID arbitration is to be acted upon by a

claimant under the BIT, i.e., pursuant to the ICSID Convention. '*!

As to the other relevant provisions of the BIT, the Claimants state that Article 9(2) and
Article 10 of the BIT establish the only temporal condition to the Respondent’s consent to
ICSID arbitration. This temporal condition operates so that the ICSID Convention does not
apply until the Respondent becomes a party to it, but then continues to apply after it has
become a party for as long as the consent to ICSID arbitration given in Article 9(1) is

extant. !4?

As to the Respondent’s reliance in other BITs concluded by Venezuela, the Claimants submit
that other treaties cannot provide interpretative guidance in the construction of the BIT. On
this point, the Claimants add that only five of the 29 BITs signed by Venezuela “use the
English word ‘under’ at the equivalent point of their consent to arbitrate,” and that, “in four
of those five BITs, the word English ‘under’ is mirrored in the authentic Spanish version by

the words ‘de conformidad con’, which means literally, ‘in accordance with. 77143

The Claimants also examine the meaning of the phrase “unconditional consent.” On this
point, the Claimants submit that “the ordinary meaning of this phrase is that the Contracting
Parties to the BIT agreed that there be no conditions limiting their consent to ICSID

arbitration,” and that “both the scope of the consent to ICSID arbitration, and the giving of

the consent, are complete upon the entry into force of the BIT and upon Venezuela becoming

an ICSID Contracting State.” '#+

Furthermore, the Claimants continue, the Respondent’s construction of the word “under” in
Article 9(1) of the BIT would impose a “condition subsequent” on Venezuela’s consent to
ICSID arbitration, i.e., Venezuela only consents to ICSID arbitration on the condition that it
has not submitted a notice of denunciation of the ICSID Convention to the World Bank.
This is not a condition expressly or implicitly contemplated by the BIT and would deprive

the word “unconditional” of any meaning whatsoever. '*>

The Principle of Effectiveness

The Claimants argue that the Respondent’s interpretation of Article 9(1) runs contrary to the
principle of effectiveness and deprives multiple BIT provisions of any effect.'4 In
particular, it denudes the fundamental right it confers on foreign investors to submit disputes
to ICSID arbitration of any effect, and renders Article 14(3) a “dead letter” as “there would

be nothing of consequence left for Article 14(3) to preserve.”!4”

The Claimants submit that the principle of “definite limits” to the rule of effectiveness
ensures that a single word in Article 9(1) of the BIT cannot overwhelm either the full text of
Articles 9(1), 9(4) and 14(3) or their context. On the contrary, this principle further confirms
that the Respondent’s consent to ICSID arbitration given in the BIT survived the

Respondent’s notice of denunciation of the ICSID Convention. '*8

Pacta Sunt Servanda

The Claimants submit that the Respondent’s interpretation of Article 9 of the BIT would
result in a denial of justice in this case, as these arguments would deprive the Claimants of

ICSID arbitration. '°

According to the Claimants, the Tribunal in Murphy v. Ecuador '°° confirmed that the
denunciation of the ICSID Convention by a Contracting State cannot have the effect of
revoking the consent to ICSID arbitration given by that Contracting State in a BIT, as this
would be contrary to the principle of pacta sunt servanda.'>' The operation of this principle
precludes Venezuela from disregarding the unconditional consent to ICSID arbitration

embodied in Article 9 of the BIT.

. On the contrary, the Respondent’s interpretation of this principle would insulate it from

claims under the BIT and thus would deprive the substantive protections contained in the

BIT of any meaningful effect. '**

Finally, the Claimants submit, the Respondent’s obligation to respect its unconditional
consent to ICSID arbitration is independent of the ICSID Convention. On this point, the
Claimants cite Article 43 of the VCLT, which states in relevant part: “denunciation of a
treaty. . . as a result of the application . . . of the provisions of the treaty, shall not in any way
impair the duty of any State to fulfil any obligation embodied in the treaty to which it would

be subject under international law independently of the treaty.”'!**

According to the Claimants, “this article is an outgrowth of the principle that the
denunciation of a treaty does not impair obligations which a denouncing State has assumed

independently of that Treaty.” Its application to this case means that “denunciation of the

(3) The Tribunal’s Analysis

a. Introduction
The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela gave notice of its denunciation of the ICSID
Convention on January 24, 2012. In accordance with Article 71 of the ICSID Convention,
that denunciation took effect six months later on July 25, 2012 and hence the Respondent
ceased to have rights or obligations as a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention as of

that date.

The Claimants consented to the jurisdiction of ICSID on July 20, 2012.!9°

. The Claimants submit that either the Republic’s denunciation of the ICSID Convention had

no effect on its consent to arbitration in Article 9 of the BIT or that, pursuant to Article 71
of the ICSID Convention, it did not have effect until July 25, 2012, which was after the
Claimants consented to the jurisdiction of ICSID. The Respondent submits that the
Republic’s denunciation had an immediate impact upon its consent to arbitration in Article
9 of the BIT in so far as, pursuant to Article 72 of the ICSID Convention, only existing
agreements to submit a dispute to ICSID arbitration survive after a notice of denunciation is

received by the depository.

The core provisions of the two international instruments relevant to the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction in these proceedings are Article 9 of the BIT and Articles 71 and 72 of the ICSID
Convention. To the extent that the parties have referred to other provisions of the two

international instruments to support their interpretations of the aforementioned core

'55 The Claimants have, in their Post-Hearing Brief, 3, raised a new argument to the effect that their earlier
correspondence with the Respondent manifested their consent to ICSID arbitration (see supra J 220). Not only
was this point raised very late, it contradicts the Claimants’ earlier position that they consented on July 20,
2012 Claimants’ Memorial, {{{] 154, 180. Moreover, the correspondence referred to by the Claimants makes
no reference to the ICSID Convention (see C-55 and C-58). The Tribunal dismisses this new argument and
finds that the Claimants purported to consent to ICSID arbitration on July 20, 2012.

 

53

provisions, the Tribunal will of course make reference to them as part of the context in its

analysis.

b. Article 9 of the BIT

. Article 9 of the BIT is alleged to be the primary source of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction in this

case. It is reproduced below in full:

1. Disputes between one Contracting Party and a national of the other
Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the former under this Agreement
in relation to an investment of the latter, shall at the request of the national
concerned be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes, for settlement by arbitration or conciliation under the Convention on
the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other
States opened for signature at Washington on 18 March 1965.

2. As long as the Republic of Venezuela has not become a Contracting State of
the Convention as mentioned in Paragraph 1 of this Article, disputes as referred
to in that paragraph shall be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement
of Investment Disputes under the Rules Governing the Additional Facility for
the Administration of Proceedings by the Secretariat of the Centre (Additional
Facility Rules).

3. The arbitral award shall be limited to determining whether there is a breach
by the Contracting Party concerned of its obligations under this Agreement,
whether such breach of obligations has caused damages to the national
concerned, and, if such is the case, the amount of compensation.

4. Each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the
submission of disputes as referred to in Paragraph 1 of this Article to
international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Article.

5. The arbitral award shall be based on:
- the law of the Contracting Party concerned;

- the provisions of this Agreement and other relevant Agreements between the
Contracting Parties;

- the provisions of special agreements relating to the investments;
- the general principles of international law; and

- such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties to the dispute.

54

255.

258.

It is the Claimants’ position that the Respondent’s consent to arbitrate in Article 9 of the BIT
is expressed to be mandatory (“shall be submitted”) and “unconditional”, such that it cannot
be in any way qualified by actions taken by the Respondent in relation to another
international instrument (the ICSID Convention). It thus follows that, according to the
Claimants, the Respondent’s consent to arbitration in Article 9 of the BIT remains binding
upon the Respondent until it expires by the terms of the BIT itself, which, in accordance with

Article 14 of the BIT, would occur no earlier than November 1, 2023.

The Respondent disagrees. According to the Respondent, the consent of the Respondent in
Article 9 of the BIT is affected by actions taken by the Respondent with respect to the ICSID
Convention. It is the Respondent’s position that this is evident from the text of Article 9
itself, which in subsection 1 refers to the submission of disputes “under the” ICSID

Convention.

. The Tribunal considers that this first issue concerns the legal relationship between two

international treaties rather than a question of treaty interpretation in respect of the terms
used in Article 9 of the BIT. It is manifest from the express terms of Article 9 that the
Respondent’s consent to ICSID arbitration is “unconditional” and there is no ambiguity
attaching to that consent. The question is, rather, what effect in law does Venezuela’s
denunciation of the ICSID Convention have on Venezuela’s consent to ICSID arbitration in

the BIT?

The Tribunal notes at the outset that consent to ICSID arbitration has a different juridical
character than consent to other forms of arbitration for a simple reason: ICSID arbitration is
directly regulated by a multilateral treaty. The multilateral treaty in question—the ICSID
Convention—has a legal existence entirely separate from the BIT. The ICSID Convention
has its own provisions for determining how and when it is to come into force, how and when
amendments are to be made to it and are to become effective, and how and when a
Contracting State may withdraw from the treaty and no longer be bound by the obligations
thereunder. The state parties to a bilateral investment treaty cannot, in that treaty, purport to
amend their rights and obligations under the ICSID Convention, a multilateral treaty. The

state parties to a bilateral investment treaty could not, by way of example, purport to contract

55

259.

out of the annulment procedure for ICSID awards set out in Article 52 of the ICSID
Convention by stipulating that any ICSID award rendered by a ICSID tribunal constituted
on the basis of the consent to arbitration contained in the investment treaty cannot be the

subject of an annulment procedure.

The situation is very different in relation to other types of arbitration, such as arbitration
under the UNCITRAL Rules, which is obviously another common form of arbitration
selected by states as a possible mechanism for the resolution of investor/state disputes in
their investment treaties. Arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules is not directly regulated
by a multilateral treaty and does not depend upon the existence of a multilateral treaty.!%°
Consent to the UNCITRAL Rules has the effect of incorporating those rules into the parties’
arbitration agreement and that incorporation would be impervious to any subsequent changes
that might be made to the UNCITRAL Rules. The legal operation known as incorporation
by reference cannot, however, apply to a multilateral treaty. The ICSID Convention cannot
be incorporated by reference into the parties’ arbitration agreement because, as an instrument
of international law recording a set of interrelated obligations binding upon all the
contracting state parties to it, it has a life of its own. Another way of making the same point:
the UNCITRAL Rules do not impose obligations upon anyone unless they are adopted by
parties to an arbitration agreement, whereas the ICSID Convention imposes obligations on
the Contracting States regardless of whether they are simultaneously parties to arbitration
agreements referring to ICSID arbitration. The obligation in Article 54 upon each of the
Contracting States of the ICSID Convention to “recognize an award rendered pursuant to
[the] Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award
within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State” is but one of several
examples. Furthermore, in contradistinction with an agreement to arbitrate under the ICSID
Convention, there is nothing preventing the parties to an agreement to arbitrate under the
UNCITRAL Rules from amending those rules or from otherwise contracting out of them in

part. In the bilateral investment treaty context, this means that the state parties could consent

'56 This is not to say that the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral
Awards (1958) does not play a critical role in supporting arbitrations and arbitral awards under the UNCITRAL
Rules. But obviously, the relationship between the New York Convention to arbitrations under the
UNCITRAL Rules is altogether different to the relationship between arbitrations under the ICSID Arbitration
Rules and the ICSID Convention.

 

 

  

56

261.

to investor/state arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules but modify those rules in the
provision recording their consent in the investment treaty. Investors would then accept that
offer to arbitrate on those terms by commencing arbitration proceedings against the state

parties in the usual way.

These fundamental distinctions between consent to ICSID arbitration and to other forms of
arbitration such as arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules are reflected in the text of Article
9 itself. Subsection 1 of Article 9 records the Contracting Parties’ consent to ICSID
arbitration (i.e. arbitration under the ICSID Arbitration Rules and the ICSID Convention),
whereas subsection 2 recognizes that such consent cannot be operational until Venezuela
takes the necessary steps to become a Contracting State under the ICSID Convention. The
basic point is that consent to ICSID arbitration in the BIT is obviously conditional upon
actions taken by the Contracting Parties to the BIT in their capacities as Contracting States
to the ICSID Convention. And given that reality, the Contracting Parties to the BIT included
an alternative route to investor/state arbitration in subsection 2 in Article 9, which is
arbitration under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules. That form of arbitration is entirely
independent of actions taken by Contracting States under the ICSID Convention; indeed, the
ICSID Additional Facility Rules have the same juridical status as the UNCITRAL Rules in

the context of this discussion.

The Tribunal thus rejects the Claimants’ contention that Venezuela’s consent to ICSID
arbitration in Article 9(1) of the BIT is impervious to Venezuela’s actions taken in respect
of its obligations under the ICSID Convention. ICSID arbitration is only available if the
conditions for access to ICSID arbitration in the investment treaty and the ICSID Convention
have been satisfied. That is a proposition that is universally accepted in the jurisprudence

and is accepted by the parties in the present case. !°7

It is a proposition that follows
inexorably from the fact that the BIT and the ICSID Convention are two separate legal
instruments in international law. The fact that each Contracting Party to the BIT gave its
“unconditional consent” to ICSID arbitration in Article 9(4) is not the end of the inquiry

because the Contracting Parties to the BIT cannot in that instrument alter the status or scope

of their rights and obligations as Contracting States to the ICSID Convention as a multilateral

instrument.

In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal does not place emphasis, as the Respondent has
urged it to do, on the use of the word “under” in Article 9(1) of the Treaty. The stipulation
that resort to ICSID arbitration will be made “under” the ICSID Convention does not create
a relationship of subordination as between the BIT and the ICSID Convention that would
not otherwise exist in the absence of this linguistic formulation. It is, moreover, unhelpful
to characterize the relationship as one of subordination or supremacy. The basic point is that
the conditions for resorting to ICSID arbitration are set out in two separate and wholly
independent international legal instruments and both must be satisfied for the Tribunal to

have jurisdiction in this case.

. For the purposes of deciding the Respondent's first jurisdictional objection the Tribunal has

assumed that all the requirements in the BIT for recourse to ICSID arbitration have been
satisfied. It remains to consider the conditions under the ICSID Convention and, in
particular, the significance of Venezuela’s denunciation of the ICSID Convention upon its
obligations under that treaty both to the other Contracting States and to nationals of
Contracting States involved in ICSID arbitration proceedings against Venezuela. These
matters are regulated by Articles 71 and 72 of the ICSID Convention, to which the Tribunal

now turns.

c. Articles 71 and 72 of the ICSID Convention
Articles 71 and 72 of the ICSID Convention are set out in Chapter X of the treaty entitled
“Final Provisions”. As Article 72 also refers to Article 70, the text of all three provisions is
set out below:
Article 70
This Convention shall apply to all territories for whose international relations a
Contracting State is responsible, except those which are excluded by such State

by written notice to the depositary of this Convention either at the time of
ratification, acceptance or approval or subsequently.

58

265.

266.

267.

Article 71

Any Contracting State may denounce this Convention by written notice to the
depositary of this Convention. The denunciation shall take effect six months
after receipt of such notice.

Article 72

Notice by a Contracting State pursuant to Articles 70 or 71 shall not affect the
rights or obligations under this Convention of that State or of any of its
constituent subdivisions or agencies or of any national of that State arising out
of consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre given by one of them before such
notice was received by the depositary.

The Tribunal starts with what is common ground between the parties. As a result of
Venezuela’s notice of denunciation of the ICSID Convention, which was received by the
World Bank on January 24, 2012, Venezuela ceased to be a Contracting State under the

ICSID Convention six months later on July 25, 2012 by virtue of Article 71.

The first difference between the parties is that the Claimants submit that, in accordance with
the same provision (Article 71), Venezuela’s denunciation could not have any effect on any
ICSID arbitration proceedings commenced before July 25, 2012 and hence could not have
any effect on the present arbitration, which was commenced on July 23, 2012 (following the
Claimants’ consent to the jurisdiction of ICSID on July 20, 2012). The Respondent counters
this by submitting that it is Article 72 that regulates the effect of any denunciation on ICSID

arbitration proceedings and not Article 71.

Article 71 clearly establishes the right of any Contracting State to denounce the ICSID
Convention and thus to terminate its obligations towards the remaining Contracting States
under the ICSID Convention. In accordance with Article 71, a Contracting State’s
withdrawal from the ICSID Convention takes effect six months after the Bank’s receipt of
the notice of denunciation. From that date onwards, the State in question will no longer
have the right to participate in the Administrative Council (Articles 4-7) or to nominate
individuals to the panel of conciliators and arbitrators (Article 13), or to propose amendments
to the ICSID Convention (Article 65). That State will also no longer be under a duty to
contribute to the financing of the Centre (Article 17), or to accord immunities and privileges

to the Centre within its territory (Article 19), or to refrain from exercising diplomatic

59

268.

269.

270.

271.

protection in respect of its nationals (Article 27), or to recognize and enforce ICSID awards
within its territory (Article 54), or to submit to the jurisdiction of the International Court of
Justice in respect of any dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the ICSID

Convention (Article 64).

Article 72 addresses the consequences of a Contracting State’s denunciation of the ICSID
Convention pursuant to Article 71 on that Contacting State’s acceptance of the jurisdiction
of the Centre, as well as the acceptance by any constituent subdivisions or agencies or of any

national of that State.

This division of labour between Article 71 and Article 72 is important. Article 71 establishes
the right of denunciation of the ICSID Convention and regulates the consequences that flow
from the exercise of that right in respect of the Contracting State’s position as a state party
to the ICSID Convention. This is clear from the ordinary meaning of the terms “[a]ny
Contracting State may denounce this Convention” in Article 71. Article 72 regulates the
consequences that flow from the exercise of the right of denunciation in Article 71 on the
Contracting State’s position as a party (or potential party) in an ICSID arbitration. In other
words, and for the purposes of this case, Article 71 is addressed to Venezuela as a
Contracting State to the ICSID Convention, whereas Article 72 is addressed to Venezuela as
a party (or potential party) in ICSID arbitrations. This division of labour is not unique to
Articles 71 and 72: the contrast between provisions that are addressed to the Contracting
States as parties to an international treaty, and provisions that are addressed to parties in

ICSID arbitration proceedings, permeates the entire ICSID Convention.

To adjudge whether Venezuela’s denunciation of the ICSID Convention has any effect on
its position as a party (or as a potential party) to ICSID arbitrations, the Tribunal must,

therefore, interpret and apply Article 72 of the ICSID Convention.

Starting with the ordinary meaning of the words used in that provision, it is clear that it is
addressed to all entities that have the possibility to consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre
by virtue of their link to the Contracting State that has denounced the ICSID Convention
pursuant to Article 71. Article 72 thus preserves the consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre

that has been given by the denouncing Contracting State itself, its constituent subdivisions

60

272.

273.

or agencies or of any national of that State. It is also clear from the express terms of Article
72 that the consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre is preserved up until the point in time at
which the depository receives the notice of the Contracting State’s denunciation of the ICSID
Convention pursuant to Article 71. This means that consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre
is preserved if it was given prior to the notice of denunciation being received by the
depository in accordance with Article 72, but the Contracting State’s rights and obligations

as a party to the ICSID Convention terminate six months later in accordance with Article 71.

The principal interpretative disagreement between the parties in respect of Article 72 relates
to the phrase “‘arising out of consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre given by one of them”.
The Respondent submits that the reference to “consent to the jurisdiction” means an
agreement to submit to the jurisdiction of the Centre (in other words to a perfected arbitration
agreement), whereas the Claimants argue that the same reference is to a party’s own consent
to the jurisdiction of the Centre, whether or not that consent has resulted in the formation of
an arbitration agreement. If the Respondent is correct, then “consent” to the jurisdiction of
the Centre in the present case only came into existence when the Claimants consented to
ICSID arbitration on July 20, 2012. This would mean that the Tribunal would not have
jurisdiction in accordance with Article 72 because Venezuela’s notice of denunciation was
received by the depository on January 24, 2012. If the Claimants are correct, then it is
Venezuela’s “consent” to the jurisdiction of the Centre that counts and that was given in the
BIT long before Venezuela sent its notice of denunciation and hence, on that analysis, the

Tribunal would have jurisdiction over this dispute.

The starting point is that the ordinary meaning of “consent to the jurisdiction” could
encompass either interpretation proffered by the parties because it is perfectly possible to
use those words to mean the unilateral act of consenting (i.e. one party’s engagement to
submit to the jurisdiction of the Centre which needs to be met by another party’s engagement
to result in an arbitration agreement) or the multilateral result of consenting (i.e. the one
party’s engagement to submit to the jurisdiction of the Centre which has been matched by
another party’s engagement and as thus resulted in an arbitration agreement). The distinction
between “unilateral consent” and “perfected consent” encapsulates these different possible

interpretations. Once the Tribunal moves to the text of Article 72 as a whole and in the

61

274.

275.

context of the other provisions of the ICSID Convention, however, the meaning of “consent

to the jurisdiction” becomes quite obvious.

First, if “consent to the jurisdiction” means unilateral consent rather than perfected consent,
then there would have been no utility in including the words “any nationals of [the
Contracting] State” (and probably the word “‘agencies”) in Article 72. That is because, unlike
for the Contracting State itself, it does not make sense to talk about unilateral consent given
by nationals of that State that could generate “rights and obligations under [the ICSID]
Convention”. A Contracting State can give its unilateral consent in a legal instrument such
as an investment treaty or in domestic legislation but there is no equivalent possibility for a
national of that State to do so. In other words, where a national of the Contracting State
gives its “consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre” that will always be as perfected consent,
either in the form of an arbitration agreement in an investment contract or in the form of an
arbitration agreement that comes into existence when a national of one Contracting State
accepts another Contracting State’s offer to arbitrate as recorded in an investment treaty or
domestic legislation. The principle of effet utile requires that the Tribunal interpret Article
72 in such a way so as to give effect to all its terms. The interpretation suggested by the
Claimants would deprive the words “‘agencies or of any national of that State” in Article 72
of any utility. (On the Claimants’ interpretation, the reference to “constituent subdivisions”
might still have meaning because constituent subdivisions could conceivably record their

unilateral consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre in their own legislation.)

Second, it is also doubtful whether unilateral consent even given by the Contracting State in
an investment treaty or legislation could generate “rights and obligations under [the ICSID]
Convention” for the purposes of Article 72. Rights and obligations under the ICSID
Convention as a party or potential party to ICSID arbitration only arise at the point of
perfected consent, i.e. when there is an arbitration agreement in existence. This point can be
tested with the following hypothetical: if a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention
repealed its own domestic legislation that contained its unilateral consent to ICSID
arbitration in circumstances where no national of another Contracting State had ever invoked
that unilateral consent, then has that domestic legislation during the period in which it was

in force given rise to “rights and obligations under [the ICSID] Convention”? The answer

62

276.

must be “no” and, if that is the case, the Contracting State’s unilateral consent in an
investment treaty cannot fall within the scope of Article 72 because Article 72 only concerns
“consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre” that has given rise to “rights and obligations under
[the ICSID] Convention”. It follows that the unilateral consent of even the denouncing

Contracting State cannot be the object of Article 72.

Third, the relevant context for interpreting Article 72 includes other provisions of the ICSID
Convention and in particular the core provision dealing with the “jurisdiction of the Centre”,

which is Article 25. Subsection (1) of Article 25 reads:

The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly
out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent
subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that
State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the
dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given
their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.

. The “jurisdiction of the Centre” is thus founded upon perfected consent and that is hardly

surprising as the consent of all parties to ICSID arbitration is the sine qua non of arbitration
under the ICSID Convention. At first blush it might be thought that this provision uses the
term “consent” in both senses (i.e. to mean perfected consent and unilateral consent). The
phrase “consent in writing to submit to the Centre” is equivalent in meaning to an arbitration
agreement and thus perfected consent. Is the phrase “no party may withdraw its consent
unilaterally” consistent with the idea of unilateral consent? The answer is not in the sense
that it has been advanced by the Claimants and that has formed the basis of the Tribunal’s
discussion thus far. Whilst the phrase “no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally”
relates to the possible conduct of one party only, the preceding phrase “[wJhen the parties
have given their consent” makes it clear that “consent” in the final phrase is not directed to
the idea of unilateral consent that arises where a Contracting State has given its consent to
ICSID arbitration in an investment treaty or domestic legislation. In other words, it is not
being used to describe the legal situation created by a unilateral engagement of a Contracting
State to submit to ICSID arbitration (but before that engagement is relied upon by a national
of another Contracting State). The last sentence of Article 25(1) simply means that where

there is perfected consent, it cannot be undone by the conduct of one of the parties.

63

278.

279.

280.

The important point to be drawn from this is that nowhere in Article 25, as the core provision
governing the “jurisdiction of the Centre”, or indeed in the rest of the ICSID Convention, is
the word “consent” used in the sense advocated by the Claimants in their interpretation of
Article 72 (i.e. in the sense of unilateral consent). This is further support for reading

“consent” in Article 72 to mean perfected consent.

The Claimants have placed certain emphasis on the words “given by one of them” in Article
72 as supporting their interpretation that “consent” means a unilateral act of one of the named
entities or individuals covered by Article 72. The Tribunal is not persuaded that this
inference can be drawn as it would be inconsistent with the Tribunal’s foregoing conclusions
on the meaning of “consent” in Article 72. Article 72 does not seek to address the rights and
obligations of any party that is not the Contracting State which has denounced the ICSID
Convention (or one of that Contracting State’s own nationals). Put in another way, Article
72 is not addressed to the counterparties (i.e. another Contracting State or the nationals
thereof) to the arbitration agreements entered into with the entities and individuals listed in
Article 72. It is logical, then, for Article 72 to refer to the consent to the Centre’s jurisdiction
“given by one of them” (in the sense of any one of either the denouncing Contracting State,
its constituent subdivisions or agencies or a national of that State). In other words, “given
by one of them” simply confirms that the rights and obligations under the ICSID Convention
of the denouncing Contracting State, its constituent subdivisions or agencies or a national of
that State that arise out of arbitration agreements to which any of those named entities or
individuals has consented are unaffected by that Contacting State’s denunciation of the

ICSID Convention.

It is illuminating to compare Article 72 of the ICSID Convention with Article 66(2), which
regulates the effects of amendments to the ICSID Convention to the rights and obligations

of all the parties to existing arbitration agreements to submit to ICSID arbitration:

No amendment shall affect the rights and obligations under this Convention of
any Contracting State or of any of its constituent subdivisions or agencies, or of
any national of such State arising out of consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre
given before the date of entry into force of the amendment.

64

281.

284.

Unlike Article 72, Article 66(2) is directed to the rights and obligations of both sides to an
arbitration agreement to submit to ICSID arbitration and that makes sense because an
amendment to the ICSID Convention affects each and every Contracting State. For that
reason, the language in Article 66(2) is identical to that of Article 72 save that the words “by
one of them” is omitted. By contrast, those words make sense in Article 72 because that
provision is directed to only one Contracting State and its nationals and it is basically
affirming that, despite a Contracting State’s denunciation of the ICSID Convention, that
Contracting State and its nationals will continue to be bound by arbitration agreements they

have entered into prior to the denunciation.

. The Tribunal concludes based upon the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article 72 in their

context that it is only where consent to arbitration to the jurisdiction of the Centre is
perfected, such that it generates rights and obligations under the ICSID Convention, that
those rights and obligations persist following the receipt of a notice of denunciation by a

Contracting State pursuant to Article 71.

. The Claimants have devoted a considerable part of their written submissions to

demonstrating that such an interpretation would be inconsistent with the object and purpose
of the ICSID Convention, which they broadly assert is to promote foreign investment by
creating a mechanism for the binding third party adjudication of investment disputes. In the
Claimants’ submission, this object and purpose favours an interpretation that will serve to
protect and preserve the jurisdiction of ICSID tribunals as far as possible in the face of the
denunciation of the ICSID Convention by a Contracting State. Whilst the Tribunal does not
necessarily disagree with the Claimants’ formulation of the object and purpose of the ICSID
Convention, the Tribunal cannot accept that it provides support for the Claimants’

interpretation of Article 72.

First, it would be very unusual for an appeal to the object and purpose of a treaty to lead to
an interpretation that is fundamentally at odds with the ordinary meaning of terms in the
context. In the present case, it would compel the Tribunal to accept an interpretation that
would render meaningless several words in Article 72 as well as attributing a special

meaning to the term “consent” that would be inconsistent with the meaning of that term in

65

285.

286.

the core provision on the jurisdiction of the Centre and in the remaining provisions of the
ICSID Convention. It would also potentially leave Article 72 without any purpose at all
because it is doubtful whether unilateral consent by a Contacting State to ICSID arbitration
in an investment treaty or in domestic legislation could give rise to “rights and obligations”

under the ICSID Convention.

Second, the Contracting States to the ICSID Convention have specifically agreed that a
Contracting State should have the right to denounce the treaty and they have sought to
regulate that right. It is not for the Tribunal to second guess the wisdom of Venezuela’s
policy that caused it to exercise that right under Article 71. The object of Articles 71 and 72
is to regulate the situation where a Contracting State has elected to exercise its undisputed
right to denounce the ICSID Convention and their purpose must be taken to be to ensure that
the resulting “divorce” is as orderly as possible while protecting vested rights under any
existing arbitration agreement with the denouncing Contracting State. No doubt the object
and purpose of the ICSID Convention as a whole would be better served if Venezuela did
not exercise its right under Article 71 at all, but that is not a factor that is relevant to the

Tribunal’s interpretation of Articles 71 and 72.

The Claimants have also submitted that their interpretation of Article 72 should be preferred
because it would ensure that investors could not be “caught by surprise” by a Contracting
State’s denunciation, which may have effect before the investor could react by commencing
ICSID arbitration proceedings by accepting the Contracting State’s offer to submit to ICSID
arbitration in an investment treaty. If a Contracting State’s denunciation were to intervene
between a dispute arising with the investor and the investor’s filing of a request for
arbitration, then it is true that the investor would be deprived of an opportunity to commence
ICSID arbitration in those circumstances. This is indeed the situation in which the Claimants

find themselves in this case.

. Once again, however, it is not this Tribunal’s function to seek to eliminate any negative

consequences that might flow from a Contracting State’s denunciation of the ICSID
Convention. Any system of adjudication founded upon consent is vulnerable to the

possibility that consent may be withdrawn. The “optional clause” vesting the International

66

288.

289.

Court of Justice with jurisdiction in Article 36(2) of the ICJ Statute is a pertinent example.
Most States that have signed up to the “optional clause” have reserved the right to denunciate

it at any time. As one commentator remarked:

To be sure, clauses of that type are regrettable in that they enable States to
terminate their acceptance of the Court’s jurisdiction as soon as they sense that
an undesirable application might be forthcoming. However, this seems to be the
price to be paid for adherence by States to the optional clause. And it
corresponds to the logic of a jurisdictional system which is still largely based on
unfettered sovereignty. !**

Of course, a denunciation of the “optional clause”, just like the denunciation of the ICSID
Convention, will not have an impact once proceedings have commenced.!°? In the ICSID

context, it will not have an impact on existing ICSID arbitration agreements either.

Articles 71 and 72 of the ICSID Convention have to reconcile two different objectives. The
first is to facilitate a Contracting State’s orderly exit from the ICSID Convention in case of
adenunciation. The second is to protect the legitimate expectations of those who have relied
upon that Contracting State’s consent to ICSID arbitration. If Article 72 were to be
interpreted to extend to potential agreements to arbitrate in addition to existing agreements
to arbitrate, it would follow that the Contracting State that has denunciated the ICSID
Convention could potentially be the respondent party in an unlimited and unforeseeable
number of future ICSID arbitrations for decades after its denunciation comes into effect (i.e.,
as long as its unilateral consent remained binding in investment treaties). This would be
antithetical to an orderly exit from the ICSID Convention. Indeed, it would also impact
detrimentally on the other Contracting States to the ICSID Convention. To take but one
example, as the denouncing Contracting State would no longer be obliged to contribute to
the financing of the ICSID Centre (in accordance with Article 17), it would be the other
Contracting States that would in effect subsidize the activities of the ICSID Centre in so far
as it relates to a potentially very large pool of future cases against the denouncing Contracting

State. On the other hand, if Article 72 extends only to existing arbitration agreements (and

pending arbitration proceedings) at the date of the denunciation, as the Tribunal has
concluded, there will be a finite and identifiable number of residual cases that will need to
run to their conclusion. That is far more consistent with the objective of providing an orderly
exit from the ICSID Convention. And the objective of protecting legitimate expectations is
also served because any extant ICSID arbitration agreements, whether in investment

contracts or concluded on the basis of investment treaties, will also be fully respected.

The Tribunal also notes that a denunciation of the ICSID Convention will rarely come as a
complete surprise. The denunciation of an important multilateral convention is a major step
for any State to take. The decision is unlikely to be made without debate in the relevant
political organs of the State in question. In many States there is a formal constitutional
procedure that must be followed. The possibility of investors being caught completely by

surprise by a Contracting State’s denunciation is therefore remote.

The Tribunal has reached a firm conclusion on the proper interpretation of Articles 71 and
72 of the ICSID Convention by resorting to the general rule of interpretation in Article 31 of
the VCLT. The Tribunal does not consider that resort to the supplementary means of
interpretation in Article 32 is either justified or necessary. Nonetheless, in so far as the
parties have made extensive reference to the travaux préparatoires for the ICSID
Convention, the Tribunal proposes to make brief observations on the significance of these

materials for the interpretation of Articles 71 and 72.

. The critical passages of the discussion in the Legal Committee responsible for drafting the

ICSID Convention are set out below:

52. Mr. Broches referred to draft Article 73 [what became Article 72] which had
been presented to the meeting and explained that it was intended to deal with the
effects of denunciation of the Convention or the exclusion of a territory from the
scope of the application of the Convention on consents to conciliation or
arbitration under the Convention already given. Mr. Malaplate had proposed a
simplification of the language of that article and he would like to consider that
drafting point further and to report to the Board at the next session.

53. Mr. Malaplate stated that the proposal he had made could somehow affect
the substance of the provision because the article as it stood now did not seem
to protect a consent given before denunciation or exclusions if proceedings
under that consent had not yet started.

68

54. Mr. Broches replied that the intention of Article 73 in the text submitted to
the Directors was to make it clear that if a State had consented to arbitration, for
instance by entering into an arbitration clause with an investor, the subsequent
denunciation of the Convention by that State would not relieve it from its
obligation to go to arbitration if a dispute arose. He could not see any difference
of substance between the text as it stood and Mr. Malaplate’s proposal but in
any case, he would review the language of that article to make sure that the
provision was clear.

[... (irrelevant discussion of translation issue)]

57. Mr. Mejia-Palacio asked what would happen if a State which was a party to
the Convention signed an agreement with a company and later withdrew from
the Centre while no disputes were pending. If, say ten years later a dispute arose
— would that dispute still be under the jurisdiction of the Centre?

58. Mr. Broches replied that if the agreement with the company included an
arbitration clause and that agreement lasted for say 20 years, that State would
still be bound to submit its disputes with that company under that agreement to
the Centre.

59. Mr. Mejia-Palacio stated that in certain cases agreement [sic] had no definite
duration but provided that they could be terminated by denunciation.

60. Mr. Broches remarked that in the case of an arbitration clause which could
be terminated by one of the parties, the jurisdiction of the Centre would come to
an end on termination of the clause.

61. Mr. Gutiérrez Cano said that Article 73 in the new text was lacking a time
limit beyond which the Convention would cease to apply. Unless such time limit
was introduced States would be bound indefinitely. He had in mind the case in
which where was no agreement between the State and the foreign investor but
only a general declaration on the part of the State in favor of submission of
claims to the Centre and a subsequent withdrawal from the Convention by that
State before any claim had been in fact submitted to the Centre. Would the
Convention still compel the State to accept the jurisdiction of the Centre?

62. Mr. Broches replied that a general statement of the kind mentioned by Mr.
Gutierrez Cano would not be binding on the State which had made it until it had
been accepted by an investor. If the State withdraws its unilateral statement by
denouncing the Convention before it has been accepted by any investor, no
investor could later bring a claim before the Centre. If, however, the unilateral
offer of the State has been accepted before the denunciation of the Convention,
then disputes arising between the State and the investor after the date of
denunciation will still be within the jurisdiction of the Centre.

69

293.

294.

295.

296.

These questions and answers during the Legal Committee’s meeting to discuss what became

Article 72 of the ICSID Convention confirm the following points:

If the denouncing Contracting State enters into an agreement with an investor to submit
disputes to ICSID arbitration before the notice of denunciation, then the Centre will have
jurisdiction over such a dispute after the notice of denunciation (see paragraphs 54, 57 & 58

of the transcript).

If the denouncing Contracting State had given its unilateral consent to submit disputes to
ICSID arbitration before the notice of denunciation and the investor had not accepted it prior
to the notice of denunciation, then the Centre will not have jurisdiction over a dispute
submitted by the investor after the notice of denunciation (see paragraphs 61 and 62 of the

transcript).

The Tribunal thus concludes that, whilst resort to the travaux préparatoires is not justified
in accordance with the threshold established by Article 32 of the VCLT, the insights that can
nevertheless be drawn from an examination of the travaux provide direct support for the

Tribunal’s interpretation of Articles 71 and 72 of the ICSID Convention.

d. Other Decisions

. The Tribunal has approached the questions of treaty interpretation from first principles and

thus far without reference to the decisions of other ICSID tribunals. The Parties have brought
to the attention of the Tribunal three relevant decisions: Venoklim v Venezuela’ , Tenaris v
Venezuela,'*! and Blue Bank v Venezuela’. The tribunal in Tenaris appears to have decided
that consent in that case was perfected prior to Venezuela’s notice of denunciation, whereas
the tribunals in Venoklim and Blue Bank came to the opposite conclusion to that of the

present Tribunal in relation to the issue under consideration.

This Tribunal is less concerned about recording instances where other tribunals have come
to the same or different results and more interested in confronting the reasons that have led
tribunals to a different conclusion. The only sustained judicial engagement with the
interpretation of Articles 71 and 72 to date is to be found in the Separate Opinion of Mr
Séderlund in Blue Bank. Mr Séderlund’s agreed with the majority of the tribunal’s
conclusion that Venezuela was bound by its consent to arbitrate when the claimant filed a
request for arbitration after Venezuela had denounced the ICSID Convention, but disagreed
with the majority’s reasoning. It is fair to surmise that the majority’s reasoning was sparse
on this point: the tribunal concluded in a single sentence that Article 72 is irrelevant to the
question “inasmuch as Article 72 deals only with the post-termination survival of certain of
a State’s rights or obligations”. There is no analysis of the text of Article 72 and no
explanation of how the majority arrived at this conclusion, which is a rather surprising one
given the text of Article 72 makes express reference to the Contracting State’s rights and
obligations relating to its “consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre”. Hence the Tribunal

shares Mr Séderlund’s starting point, which is that “the Respondent’s invocation of Article

 

> 164

 

72 of the ICSID Convention requires analysis

Mr Séderlund’s basic thesis is that the “offer-acceptance” model is not an accurate reflection
of how consent to ICSID arbitration is manifested through an investment treaty.'© Whilst
he acknowledges that the wording of Article 25(1) is consistent with that model, he considers
that this is explicable by reason of the fact that the drafters would have had investment
contracts or ad hoc submission agreements in mind rather than investments treaties and
hence a literal interpretation of this wording is not appropriate.'® (Although he does
concede that the Report of the Executive Directors refers to “an example of unilateral offer

of consent—investment promotion legislation”'®’.) He states:

[The “offer-acceptance” model] may elicit, erroneously, a perception of the
existence of an offer-acceptance relationship between the contracting State and

investors of the other contracting State, to the exclusion of the basic State-to-
State relationship grounded in the treaty. This, in its turn, may lead to a
misapplication in the specific instance of Article 72, as it assumes that there is a
unilateral consent given, which will not be perfected until such time as when a
particular “investor” declares its consent, i.e. accepts the offer.!
In the alternative, Mr Sdderlund postulates that, in any case, the “dispute resolution chapter
of a BIT constitutes mutual consent for the purposes of Article 25(1) of the ICSID
Convention” in-and-of-itself.!©°
The Tribunal, with all due respect to Mr Séderlund’s sustained treatment of this problem,

cannot agree with his analysis.

First, it is not permissible, consistently with Article 31 of the VCLT, to dismiss the relevance
of the express terms of a treaty on the basis of a supposition that the drafters did not have a
particular situation in mind when the ordinary meaning of those terms is clearly capable of
extending to that situation. Articles 25 and 72 of the ICSID Convention cannot be emptied
of content in relation to investment treaty arbitration, which depends upon the existence of
an arbitration agreement between the parties to the dispute no less than any other form of
international arbitration. Whilst the manner in which that arbitration agreement comes into
existence in investment treaty arbitration may differ from the paradigm of an investment
contract (although it is not so different from a situation where the host State’s consent is
recorded in investment legislation), the end result is the same and the ICSID Convention is
only concerned with that end result. In other words, the ICSID Convention does not purport
to regulate the manner in which an arbitration agreement can come into existence; the rights
and obligations set out in the ICSID Convention simply do not come into play unless and

until it is in existence.

Second, the consent of each contracting State party to ICSID arbitration in the BIT itself
cannot possibly constitute “mutual consent” for the purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention. What Mr Séderlund refers to as the “‘State-to-State relationship grounded in the

treaty” is no substitute for the necessary existence of an arbitration agreement between the

305.

306.

investor and the host State. Mr Séderlund’s theory is flatly contradicted by investment treaty

practice. For example, Article 1122 of NAFTA, entitled “Consent to Arbitration”, reads:

1. Each Party consents to the submission of a claim to arbitration in accordance
with the procedures set out in this Agreement.

2. The consent given by paragraph | and the submission by a disputing investor
of a claim to arbitration shall satisfy the requirement of:

(a) Chapter II of the ICSID Convention (Jurisdiction of the Centre) and the
Additional Facility Rules for written consent of the parties;

(b) Article II of the New York Convention for an agreement in writing; and

(c) Article I of the InterAmerican Convention for an agreement.
This provision differentiates between the unilateral consent of the State Parties of NAFTA
to arbitration and the manifestation of the investor’s consent by the submission of a claim to
arbitration. It confirms that the conjunction of these two different manifestations of consent
(i.e. “offer-and-acceptance’’) satisfies the requirement “written consent of the parties” (i.e.
an arbitration agreement) in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and for the existence of an
arbitration agreement under the New York Convention and the InterAmerican Convention.
This provision also confirms, if confirmation were really necessary, that investment treaty
arbitration is just as dependent on the existence of an arbitration agreement as every other

form of international arbitration.

e. Conclusions

The Tribunal finds, on the basis of the foregoing reasons, that it does not have jurisdiction
over the dispute that has been submitted to it. In view of this conclusion, the Tribunal will

dispense with reviewing the Respondent’s objection to jurisdiction ratione temporis.

Furthermore, the Tribunal decides that, in light of the Tribunal’s conclusion on jurisdiction,
the Respondent’s pending requests of September 28, October 12, November 2, 2016 and

August 4, 2017 have been rejected as moot.

a. The Parties’ Claims for Costs and Expenses

The Parties filed simultaneous submissions on costs on July 8, 2016 and simultaneous reply

submissions on September 28, 2016 and May 15, 2017.

The Claimants’ Fees and Expenses

In their submission of July 8, 2016, the Claimants contend that they should be awarded the
totality of legal fees and expenses, including its own legal fees, experts’ fees, and other
disbursements associated with this arbitration, as well as the entirety of the arbitration costs

(i.e., costs of the Tribunal and the Centre), in the amount of USD 11,434,636.09.

Furthermore, on September 28, 2016, the Claimants stated that their legal fees and expenses

in connection with the Third Proposal for Disqualification amount to USD 26,048.07.

On May 15, 2017, the Claimants stated that their legal fees and expenses in connection with

the Fourth Proposal for Disqualification amount to USD 119,725.64.

The Respondent’s Fees and Expenses

. In its submission of July 8, 2016, the Respondent argues that regardless of the outcome of

this case, the Claimants shall bear all costs incurred in these proceedings i.e., its own costs,

the arbitration costs, and the Respondent’s costs for a total amount of USD 3,031,233.51.

Furthermore, on September 28, 2016, the Respondent stated that its legal fees and expenses

in connection with the Third Proposal for Disqualification amount to USD 95,000.

On May 15, 2017, the Respondent stated that its legal fees and expenses in connection with

the Fourth Proposal for Disqualification amount to USD 194,492.

ICSID’s administrative fees 160,000.00

Total 915,096.55

c. The Tribunal’s Decision on Costs

Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties
otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with
the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and
expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the
facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.
This provision gives the Tribunal a discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including

legal fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.

The Tribunal starts with observation that the Respondent has successfully persuaded the
Tribunal that it is without jurisdiction in this case. Given that starting point, the Respondent
would be entitled to expect to be awarded their reasonable costs in normal circumstances.
The Tribunal has come to the conclusion, however, that certain factors militate against the
costs-follow-the-event approach in this case. First, there is among ICSID tribunals and
commentators a large degree of conflicting views about the proper interpretation of Articles
71 and 72 of the ICSID Convention and their relationship to consent to ICSID arbitration
under an investment treaty. The Claimants should not be penalised for this resultant
uncertainty and for the fact that this decision on jurisdiction comes at the conclusion of a full

examination of the merits of the Claimants’ claims.

75

318. Second, the Respondent has challenged Mr Fortier, a co-arbitrator in this case, on no less

319.

320.

321.

than four separate occasions. This generated costs on both sides of several hundred thousand
US Dollars. The two remaining arbitrators concluded in their decisions in respect of the
Third and Fourth Proposals for Disqualification that the Respondent should bear the costs of
each. Hence even if the Tribunal were to award the Respondent a portion of its costs, the
costs incurred in relation to the Third and Forth Proposals for Disqualification would have
to be set off against this amount in any case and the Tribunal would have to take account of

the costs incurred relating to the First and Second Proposals for Disqualification as well.

Third, the Respondent has refused to pay its share of the arbitration costs throughout these
proceedings. This has increased the financial burden upon the Claimants in prosecuting this
arbitration from the outset and results in a corresponding benefit to the Respondent. This
benefit is sufficient recognition of the Respondent’s success in persuading the Tribunal that
it is without jurisdiction over the dispute that has been submitted to it. This benefit also
meets the Respondent’s argument that it was unreasonable for the Claimants to pursue these
proceedings for the full amount of the Claimants’ interest in the Plants when OIEG has
already obtained an award that covered all of its shareholding in the Claimants, and which
amounts to 72.983% of the damages sought by the Claimants in this case. The Tribunal has
some sympathy with the Respondent’s position in this respect, and the question of the res
judicata effect of the OIEG Award would have been a serious issue for the Tribunal’s

consideration had it proceeded to adjudicate the merits of the Claimants’ claims.

In these circumstances, the Tribunal has concluded that each Party should bear its own legal

fees and expenses.

The costs of the arbitration (as reflected in {| 314 above) shall be borne entirely by the

Claimants.

76

VII. AWARD

322. For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:

(1) The Tribunal is without jurisdiction in respect of the dispute that has been submitted

to it;

(3) The Claimants shall bear the costs of the arbitration.
