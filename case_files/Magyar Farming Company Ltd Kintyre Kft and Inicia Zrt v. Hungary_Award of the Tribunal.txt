PRELIMINARY MATTERS

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on the basis of the Agreement between
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Hungarian People’s
Republic for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, dated 9 March 1987
(the “UK-Hungary BIT” or the “BIT” or the “Treaty”)! and the Convention on the
Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which
entered into force on 14 October 1966 and became binding on Hungary on 6 March 1987
and on the United Kingdom on 18 January 1967 (the “ICSID Convention”).

THE PARTIES
The Claimants (together referred to as the “Claimants”) are:

(i) Magyar Farming Company Ltd (“Magyar”), a company incorporated and existing
under the laws of the United Kingdom (the “UK”);?

(ii) | Kintyre Kft (“Kintyre”), a company incorporated and existing under the laws of
Hungary;? and

(iii) Inicia Zrt. (“Inicia”), a company incorporated and existing under the laws of

Hungary.*

The Respondent is Hungary (“Hungary” or the “Respondent”), a sovereign State and a
member of the European Union as well as a contracting State to the ICSID Convention and

the BIT.

4. The Claimants and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the “Parties”. The

Parties’ representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

B. THE DISPUTE

5. The dispute arises out of Hungary’s measures regulating possession and disposal of State-
owned agricultural land, which, according to the Claimants, resulted in the expropriation
of their leasehold rights to 760 hectares of State-owned land located in Hungary’s North-
Western region of Ikrény (the “Land”) and in a diminution of the value of their farming

business in Hungary (the “Farm’).

6. The Claimants contend that, pursuant to the lease agreement between Inicia and Hungary’s
State-owned asset management agency, concluded on 25 July 1994° and amended and
extended in 1999° and 2006’ (the “Lease Agreement” or the “Lease”), Inicia had a
contractual and a statutory pre-lease right to the Land. For the Claimants, this entailed that,
if Hungary intended to lease the Land to a third party upon the expiration of the Lease
Agreement (in July 2014), it should inform Inicia of any offer from a third party that it
intended to accept. The pre-lease right, so say the Claimants, then entitled Inicia to “step
in and assume the offer from the third party” and thereby enter into a renewed lease

agreement upon the terms of that offer.*

7. The Claimants contend that, in 2011, the Parliament passed an amendment to the land law,”
which precluded lessees of State-owned agricultural land plots from exercising their
statutory pre-lease rights in cases where the National Land Agency (the “NLA”) leased the

land out by way of a tender. According to the Claimants, the Respondent then “orchestrated

a rigged tender process whereby, despite the Respondent’s prior assurances and despite the
Claimants’ superior bids, the leases were ‘won’ by third parties in January 2014.”'° As a
result, according to the Claimants, security guards acting under the direction of the
Respondent, evicted them from the Land in blatant disregard of their pre-lease rights and

the interim possessory protection that Inicia had obtained from the local authorities.

The Claimants contend that the Respondent’s measures constitute an unlawful
expropriation of the Claimants’ leasehold rights to the Land contrary to Article 6 of the
BIT and request the Tribunal to award full compensation of damages resulting from the

Respondent’s wrongful conduct.

The Respondent fully rejects these claims. As a preliminary matter, it submits that the
Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to resolve the dispute, since the dispute resolution provision of
the BIT is inapplicable due to Hungary’s accession to the European Union in 2004, and in
any event, because the Claimants’ alleged rights in relation to which the dispute arises
either expired on their own terms or do not constitute an investment for the purposes of the

BIT and the ICSID Convention.

On the merits, the Respondent submits that the Claimants held no rights capable of being
expropriated at the time of the disputed measures, and in any event, the measures did not
constitute a sovereign interference or a taking of the purported pre-lease rights. The
Respondent also rejects having expropriated the Claimants’ investment as a whole, as the

Claimants still continue their farming activity in Hungary at profit.

The Respondent further opposes the Claimants’ quantification of the alleged loss as grossly
overstated. It submits that any award for damages should be limited to the fair market value
of the allegedly expropriated asset and not extend to remote consequential losses as the
Claimants claim. In addition, according to the Respondent, the Claimants failed to mitigate

their loss, which should result in a further reduction of the claimed compensation.

CM, 4235.

Considering these factors, the Respondent offers an alternative valuation of the Claimants’

alleged loss.

C. REQUESTS FOR RELIEF

12. The Claimants formulated their request for relief in the Reply!! as follows:

[T]he Claimants respectfully invite the Tribunal to render a Final
Award:

a. Declaring that the Respondent has breached the BIT by
expropriating the Claimants’ investment without complying
with the requirements of Article 6 of the BIT, including payment
of prompt, adequate and effective compensation;

b. Ordering the Respondent to pay to the Claimants damages
representing full reparation for losses sustained as a result of the
expropriation in the sum of €17.9m, plus the costs and expenses
of these arbitration proceedings (including lawyers’ and experts’
fees and expenses, and the fees and expenses of ICSID and the
Tribunal), and the costs and expenses of the local court
proceedings in Hungary (in the sum of HUF 57,222,236),
together with interest compounded semi-annually at the rate of
7.87% until the date of payment;

c. Alternatively, as regards costs and expenses, ordering the
Respondent to pay to the Claimants, as costs, all the costs and
expenses of these arbitration proceedings (including lawyers’
and experts’ fees and expenses, and the fees and expenses of
ICSID and the Tribunal), as well as the costs and expenses of
the local court proceedings in Hungary (HUF 57,222,236),
together with interest compounded semi-annually at the rate of
7.87% until the date of payment.

13. The Respondent formulated its request for relief in the Rejoinder!? as follows:

Respondent respectfully requests the Tribunal to:

— Declare that it does not have jurisdiction over Claimants’
claims;

4 C-Reply, 4372.
2 R-Rejoinder, | 581.

— To the extent it decides it has jurisdiction over Claimants’
claims, dismiss all of Claimants’ claims under Article 6(1)
of the BIT;

— To the extent it declares Respondent to be responsible for a
violation of Article 6(1) of the BIT,

o declare that Claimants failed to mitigate their losses
and therefore determine that the amount payable by
Respondent as compensation cannot exceed EUR
930,000; or

© if it determines that Claimants did not fail to mitigate
their losses, determine the compensation payable by
Respondent in an amount not exceeding the fair
market value of Claimants’ alleged pre-lease right.

— Order Claimants to pay Respondent’s expenses (including
legal and expert fees and disbursements) and all other costs
of the arbitration.

14. Following the Hearing, in its letter of 21 June 2019, the Respondent presented an amended

request for relief, which reads as follows:

Respondent respectfully requests the Tribunal to:

— Declare that it does not have jurisdiction over Claimants’
claims;

— To the extent it decides it has jurisdiction over Claimants’
claims, dismiss all of Claimants’ claims under Article 6(1)
of the BIT;

— To the extent it declares Respondent to be responsible for a
violation of Article 6(1) of the BIT,

o declare that Claimants failed to mitigate their losses
and therefore determine that the amount payable by
Respondent as compensation cannot exceed
EUR 930,000; or

© if it determines that Claimants did not fail to mitigate
their losses, determine the compensation payable by
Respondent in an amount not exceeding the fair
market value of Claimants’ alleged pre-lease right;
or

o if it determines that the compensation payable by
Respondent should be determined by subtracting the
Actual Value of the Farm from the But For Value of
the Farm:

direct Claimants to keep Respondent
informed of any sale of the Farm; and

subtract from the compensation payable by
Respondent all sums Claimants may receive
above the Farm's Actual Value (as
determined by the Tribunal) in case they sell
the Farm before the Award is paid, or

order that Claimants shall pay to Respondent
all sums Claimants may receive above the
Farm’s Actual Value (as determined by the
Tribunal) in case they sell the Farm after the
Award is paid.

— Order Claimants to pay Respondent’s expenses (including
legal and expert fees and disbursements) and all other costs
of the arbitration.

The Claimants object to the admissibility of the amendment of the Respondent’s request

for relief.!?

the Parties accepted as recorded at paragraph 8.3 of Procedural Order No. 1.

PLACE OF PROCEEDINGS
Pursuant to Article 62 of the ICSID Convention, the place of the proceedings is
Washington, D.C. However, as confirmed in ICSID’s email of 8 May 2019, the Parties

agreed to conduct the Hearing at the World Bank offices in Paris, France.

APPLICABLE LAWS
qd) Procedure

Pursuant to Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, the procedure of this arbitration is

governed by the following instruments and rules in the following order of precedence:

= Section I of Chapter IV of the ICSID Convention;
= Any rules of procedure agreed upon by the Parties; and

= The ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “ICSID

Rules”).
If a question of procedure arises which is not covered by the instruments listed in the
preceding paragraph, the Tribunal shall decide the question. Accordingly, the Tribunal has
issued multiple procedural directions throughout this arbitration, including, but not limited

to, Procedural Orders Nos. 1, 2 and 3.

(2) Merits
Pursuant to Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, when resolving the dispute, the

Tribunal must primarily apply the law agreed upon by the Parties; in the absence of which,

it shall apply the laws of the respondent State and international law as may be applicable:

The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of
law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such
agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State
party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and
such rules of international law as may be applicable.

24.

25.

26.

It is common ground that the Parties have made no explicit choice of law. For the
Claimants, however, the merits of the dispute is subject to international law, since the
claims are based on the BIT, i.e. an international treaty.!° The Respondent in turn points to
the fact that the BIT contains no choice-of-law clause and argues that the choice of
international law cannot be implied from the sole fact that the claims may arise out of the

BIT. '¢

ICSID jurisprudence supports the approach that, when the disputing parties have made no
express choice-of-law, such choice cannot be implied from the mere fact that the claims
arise under an international treaty.'” For instance, according to the tribunal in Perenco v.
Ecuador, where “the Treaty does not contain an express applicable law clause [...] the
Tribunal must apply Article 42(1), second sentence, of the ICSID Convention”.'®
Prominent commentators of the ICSID Convention also affirm that “an agreement under
Art. 42(1) requires an affirmative choice and should be express.”!” In this respect, it is

telling that the Claimants themselves rely on Hungarian law when addressing the issues

such as the nature and the scope of their alleged leasehold rights.

Therefore, in the absence of a choice-of-law provision in the BIT, or elsewhere for that
matter, the default rule of the second sentence of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention
applies. This provision does not allocate specific matters to either international or domestic
law. Instead, it calls for the application of either of these laws “as may be applicable” to a

particular issue in dispute. It is thus for the Tribunal to determine whether a particular

issue is subject to national or international law.”° In doing so, the Tribunal will be guided

primarily by the BIT.

When applying the law, whether municipal or international, the Tribunal is not bound by
the arguments and sources invoked by the Parties. The principle of iura novit arbiter allows
the Tribunal to form its own opinion of the meaning of the law, provided that it does not
surprise the Parties with a legal theory that was not subject to debate and that the Parties

could not anticipate.”!

SCOPE OF THIS AWARD

Pursuant to the Procedural Calendar established with the agreement of the Parties at the
outset of the proceedings, the present award finally resolves the Respondent’s

preliminary objections as well as the issues of liability and quantum.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 14 July 2017, ICSID received a request for arbitration dated 4 July 2017 from the
Claimants against Hungary, together with exhibits C-1 through C-25 and legal authorities
CL-1 and CL-2 (the “Request”).

On | August 2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance
with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In
the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute
an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID’s Rules of

Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.

By emails of 5 September 2017, the Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance
with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention as follows: the Tribunal would consist of
three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party and the third, the presiding arbitrator,

to be appointed by agreement of the Parties.

By letter of 12 September 2017, the Claimants appointed Dr. Stanimir A. Alexandrov, a
national of Bulgaria, as arbitrator in this case, who accepted his appointment on 13

September 2017.

By letter of 9 October 2017, the Respondent appointed Dr. Inka Hanefeld, a national of

Germany, as arbitrator in this case, who accepted her appointment on 10 October 2019.

By emails of 10 November 2017, the Parties informed the Centre that they had agreed to

appoint Professor Dr. Klaus Sachs, a national of Germany, as President of the Tribunal.

By letter of 14 November 2017, the Centre informed the Parties that Professor Dr. Sachs

had declined his appointment.

By emails of 17 November 2017, the Parties informed the Centre that they had agreed to
request the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council to appoint the presiding
arbitrator. Accordingly, on 12 December 2017, ICSID sent the Parties a ballot inviting

them to consider a list of candidates to act as the presiding arbitrator.

By emails of 21 December 2017, the Parties informed the Centre that they had conferred
over the names proposed in the ballot and that they had agreed to appoint Professor

Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a national of Switzerland, as presiding arbitrator.

On 4 January 2018, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID
Rules, notified the Parties that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, Dr. Alexandrov, and
Dr. Hanefeld had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed
to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Laura Bergamini, ICSID Legal Counsel, was

designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

By emails of 8 January 2018, the Parties indicated that, unless the Tribunal had a preference

for an in-person hearing, they agreed to hold the first session by telephone.

circulated a draft Procedural Order No. 1 and a draft agenda for the Parties to comment in
preparation of the first session; and (iii) proposed the Parties to appoint Mr. David

Khachvani, a lawyer from the President’s firm, as Assistant to the Tribunal in this case.

By email of 17 January 2018, the Claimants confirmed the Parties’ availability for a first

session on the proposed date. The Claimants also indicated that:

[T]he Claimants (who are first, and hopefully last, time users of the
ICSID process) are initially uncomfortable with the Tribunal’'s
proposal to delegate many important tasks to an assistant and to add
a not inconsiderable costs line for this assistant in the draft
procedural order. The Claimants reserve their position on this issue.

In the event that the parties agree to the appointment of an assistant,
the parties respectfully propose that the assistant's role in “preparing
initial drafts of...awards” should be amended to read “preparing
initial drafts of the Procedural Background, Factual Background and
Parties' Positions sections of any award”.

By email of the same date, the Respondent confirmed its availability on the proposed date
for the first session. The Respondent further informed the Tribunal that it had no issue with
the proposed appointment of Mr. Khachvani as Assistant to the Tribunal, but indicated that
it “would appreciate if the description of the role of the assistant in drafting procedural
orders and awards was refined in a way to involve drafting ‘appropriate parts’ of such

documents only.”

By letter of 17 January 2018, the Tribunal confirmed that the first session would be held

on 26 January 2018 by telephone conference.

On 24 January 2018, the Parties submitted a draft Procedural Order No. 1 containing their

consolidated comments, along with their respective proposals for the procedural calendar.

In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the

Parties on 26 January 2018 by telephone conference.

On 2 February 2018, the Tribunal circulated a revised draft Procedural Order No. 1 and
informed the Parties that such Procedural Order would become effective on 9 February
2018 unless a party requested the correction of a clerical mistake or raised a substantiated
objection to a matter that had not already been the subject of discussion during the first

session. The Tribunal also circulated the declaration signed by Mr. Khachvani.

On 9 February 2018, the Parties submitted their joint proposal for a revised draft Procedural
Order No. 1.

By letter of 13 February 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it was minded to
accept the Parties’ revised draft Procedural Order No. | subject to certain modifications, to

which the Parties agreed by emails of the same date.

On 14 February 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. | recording the agreement
of the Parties on procedural matters. Procedural Order No. | provides, inter alia, that the
applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, that the
procedural language would be English, and that the place of the proceedings would be

Washington, D.C., USA. It also establishes the procedural calendar for the proceedings.

By letter of 30 March 2018, the Respondent raised a jurisdictional objection due to the
outcome of the case Slovak Republic v. Achmea before the Court of Justice of the European
Union, and requested that the Tribunal issue a decision to bifurcate the proceedings and

hear this jurisdictional objection in a preliminary phase.

By letter of 4 April 2018, the Claimants presented their observations on the Respondent’s

request of 30 March 2018, as per the Tribunal’s instructions.

By email of 5 April 2018, the Tribunal indicated that it understood that the Parties had
presented their positions on the Respondent’s request of 30 March 2018 and that,
consequently, it would proceed with rendering the decision on bifurcation. The Tribunal
also indicated that the procedural calendar set out in Annex A to Procedural Order No. 1

remained in force.

On 10 April 2018, the Tribunal decided on the Respondent’s request of 30 March 2018 as

follows:

For reasons of efficiency, especially because the agreed calendar
which did not provide for bifurcation is already well under way, the
Tribunal is of the view that the proceedings should now continue as
scheduled. The Achmea defense (and any others) can be addressed
in the context of the Counter-Memorial and of the further
submissions.

On 27 April 2018, the Claimants filed their Memorial on the Merits, together with the
witness statement of Mr. Andrew Alexander Hunter, the expert report of Mr. James Gilbey

legal authorities CL-3 through CL-29.

By email of 4 May 2018, the Tribunal invited the Parties to indicate their preference in

respect of the place of the hearing.

By email of the same date, the Claimants indicated their preference for a hearing in Paris,

France.

By email of 8 May 2018, the Respondent indicated that, despite its preference to hold the
hearing in Washington, D.C., it remained amenable to compromise on the hearing to take

place in Paris, France.

On 8 May 2018, the Tribunal confirmed that the hearing would be held at the World Bank

offices in Paris, France.

On 22 August 2018, the European Commission filed an application to intervene as a non-
disputing party pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) (the “Commission’s
Application”).

On 30 August 2018, the Parties filed their observations on the Commission’s Application.

On 5 September 2018, the Tribunal decided that it:

(i) grants the Commission leave to file a written amicus curiae
submission by 20 January 2019, limited to the legal consequences
of the Achmea Judgment for the present case;

(ii) allows the Commission to access the relevant parts of the Parties’
written submissions (excluding evidence) as set out above;

(iii) denies the Commission’s request to attend hearings and to

present oral arguments.
On 7 September 2018, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the Merits and
Memorial on Jurisdiction, together with the witness statement of Dr. Marton Ors Bitay, the

Order No. 1, the Parties exchanged their requests for production of documents.

On 8 October 2018, the Parties voluntarily produced certain documents requested by the

other Party and/or submitted their objections to such document production requests.
On 18 October 2018, the Parties submitted their replies to the opposing Party’s objections.

On 29 October 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 concerning production of

documents.

By email of 23 November 2018, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that the Respondent
had failed to comply with the Tribunal’s Order regarding Request No. 3 of Annex A to
Procedural Order No. 2; and requested, inter alia, that “the Tribunal order Respondent to
produce, within a very short deadline, the documents ordered in Request No. 3 of Annex
A to Procedural Order No. 2 or a written explanation of the alleged legal constraints
preventing disclosure.” The Respondent provided its comments on the Claimants’ email

on the same date.

By email of 24 November 2018, the Tribunal granted the Respondent until 30 November

2019 noon (CET) to make its best efforts to come forward with a solution or otherwise

provide any relevant explanations with respect to its inability to comply with Request No.

3 of Annex A of Procedural Order No. 2.

By email of 30 November 2019, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal take formal note
of the Respondent’s failure “(i) to comply with the Tribunal’s Order regarding Request No.
3 of Annex A to Procedural Order No. 2; (ii) to reveal or explain its non-compliance on 19
November; and (iii) to provide the promised detailed explanation for such non-compliance
by noon CET today.” The Respondent presented its observations on the Claimants’ email

on the same date.

By email of 4 December 2018, the Claimants provided further comments concerning the

Respondent’s obligation to produce certain documents pursuant to Procedural Order No. 2.

On 11 December 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties that “if necessary in light of all
the circumstances, the Tribunal [would] address the issue of the Respondent’s failure to
comply with Procedural Order No. 2 and the possible legal consequences at a later stage,

most likely in the Award.”

On 20 December 2018, the Claimants filed their Reply on the Merits and Counter-
Memorial on Jurisdiction, along with the second expert opinion of Professor Attila
Menyhard, the second expert opinion of Professor Gabor Halmai, the expert opinion of
Professor Dr. Miklés Kiraly, the supplemental independent expert report of Mr. James

a redacted version of their Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction.

On 9 January 2019, the Respondent submitted a redacted version of its Counter-Memorial

on the Merits and Memorial on Jurisdiction.

By letter of 11 January 2019, the Tribunal informed the Commission that the redacted
versions of the Parties’ first exchange of briefs on jurisdiction were available, and invited

the Commission to provide a confidentiality declaration, should it wish to consult them.

By email of 14 January 2019, the Commission indicated that:

76.

77.

78.

79.

As set out in the application for leave to intervene, the Commission
agents are bound to strict confidentiality on the basis of Article 339
Treaty on Functioning of European Union, [...]

The Commission understands that the Arbitral Tribunal considers
additional guarantees necessary, but would be thankful for a
confirmation that that is indeed the case.

Furthermore, if that is the case, in order to assess whether the

Commission can give such an agreement, it would be necessary that

the Arbitral Tribunal provides the Commission with “the

confidentiality obligations applicable to the participants of these

proceedings, including Section 27 of Procedural Order No. 1”.
By email of 14 January 2019, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it was “inclined to
consider that the explanations given in [the Commission’s] email provide sufficient
protection of confidentiality for ICSID to give the EU Commission access to the redacted
versions of the Counter-Memorial and Reply”; and that if the Parties did not share this
view, it would then “seek a formal undertaking and share the content of Section 27.1 of

Procedural Order No. 1 with the EU Commission.”

By emails of 14 and 16 January 2019, the Respondent and the Claimants, respectively,
confirmed that they had no objection to the Tribunal’s approach. Accordingly, the Centre

transmitted redacted briefs to the Commission, on that same day.

On 20 January 2019, the Commission filed its Amicus Curiae Brief, together with Annexes

ECO1 through EC32.

On 29 January 2019, the Tribunal invited the Parties to comment in their second exchange
of written submissions on jurisdiction and, if required, at the oral hearing, on the
Declaration of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States of the
European Union of 16 January 2019 on the Enforcement of the Judgment of the Court of
Justice in Achmea and Hungary’s separate declaration of the same date (the “2019
Declarations”), which were submitted as annexes EC31 and EC32 by the Commission.
The Tribunal also invited the Parties to address the possible effects of the United

Kingdom’s pending withdrawal from the European Union on this Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

The following summary, which does not purport to be exhaustive, aims at providing the
general factual background for the Tribunal’s analysis. The Tribunal will address the facts

relevant to its reasoning in more detail in Sections IV to VI.

OVERVIEW OF THE AGRICULTURAL LAND REGULATION IN HUNGARY

Following the fall of the communist regime in Hungary in 1989, the Hungarian agriculture
industry experienced a profound transformation. From 1990 to 1994, the State privatized a
substantial portion of its farmland, dividing it into small individual parcels.”* At the end of
the privatization process, over 85% of the agricultural land was privately owned, less than
15% remaining in State ownership. That being so, the division of land into small parcels
stood in the way of mechanization and efficient farming. These factors seriously hampered

the productivity of the Hungarian agriculture industry in the years that followed.

To regulate the acquisition and ownership of the newly privatized agricultural land, on
27 June 1994, the Hungarian Parliament enacted the Arable Land Act (the “1994 Arable
Land Act”). Under the new Act, only physical persons of Hungarian nationality were
authorized to acquire agricultural land, while domestic and foreign corporations, as well as
foreign nationals were barred from such acquisition. The latter were, however, allowed to
lease agricultural land from Hungarian nationals or from the State. Leases were limited to

a maximum term of 10 years and a maximum surface area of 300 hectares.”> In addition,

25 The 1994 Arable Land Act, 27 July 1994, R-4, Sections 13, 25.

23

the 1994 Arable Land Act conferred a statutory pre-lease right on lessees of agricultural

land in the following terms:

The ex-lessee shall be entitled to the right of pre-lease for the arable
land taken on usufructuary lease, except if the contract of
usufructuary lease ceased to exist as a consequence of termination
by notice with immediate effect by the lessor.7°
111. In spite of the fragmentation of the agricultural land ownership into small parcels, under
the new Act, certain large-scale farming enterprises managed to amass considerable
portions of arable land by obtaining leases of private and State-owned land. As a result, by
the end of the century, “[s]trong disconnection between land use and land ownership

became a typical feature of the farming structure” in Hungary.?’

B. THE CLAIMANTS’ FARMING BUSINESS IN HUNGARY

112. It was against this background that, in 1997, a group of British farming professionals led
by Mr. Andrew Hunter decided to invest in the agricultural sector in Hungary.”* A tenant
farmer’s son from Yorkshire, Mr. Hunter managed a large agricultural enterprise in the
UK.”? Together with his partners, Mr. Simon Weaver and Mr. Michael Papworth,
Mr. Hunter travelled to Hungary several times in the summer of 1997 to visit several farms

on sale.

113. After going from farm to farm, Mr. Hunter and his partners came across a livestock farm
owned by Inicia in the region of Ikrény, close to the Hungarian border with Austria and
Slovakia. The farm had been privatized in 1994 by the statutory transformation of a State
farming enterprise into a company limited by shares.*° It was composed of two livestock

units and held a lease for approximately 760 hectares of State-owned land surrounding the

livestock units. In addition, it had about 155 hectares of freehold agricultural land and

approximately 300-400 hectares of privately leased land.*!

To facilitate the purchase of the farm, Mr. Hunter and his partners incorporated Magyar
Farming Company Ltd as a holding company in the UK? and Kintyre Agricultural Trade
and Serice Kft as its Hungarian subsidiary. On 13 January 1998, Kintyre acquired 95.13%
shares of Inicia for a purchase price of HUF 106.5 million.** Mr. Hunter moved to Hungary

as the managing director of the farm.

Over the following 16 years, the Claimants transformed what they call “an indebted farm”
into a successful agricultural enterprise.** In 1998-99, the Claimants imported 696 pregnant
heifers from Holland and renovated the existing cow accommodation, building a 304-cow

cubicle shed, workshops and tractor sheds as well as a 3,000-ton grain store and straw shed.

Apart from cow farming, the Claimants started producing potatoes and, in 2009, built a
new 5,000-ton potato storage and packing facility. In 2011, the Claimants also constructed
a 637kW biogas power plant, producing electricity from cow manure and supplying it to
the national grid. The farm employed 45 local people and received various certificates of

acclaim from local authorities.**

THE LEASE AGREEMENT AND THE PRE-LEASE RIGHT

One of the assets that Inicia held when the Claimants acquired it in 1998 was the Lease.*°
This was a ten-year profit lease (“haszonberlet”) covering 760 hectares of State-owned

land. Pursuant to the Civil Code of Hungary, a profit lease entitles the lessee in exchange

of payment “to use and collect the proceeds of a designated parcel of agricultural land or
some other profitable thing for a specific time”.*” The lease was concluded in 1994 and

was therefore due to expire in 2004. However, it provided for a pre-lease right:

At the request of the lessor, the tenant shall agree to the extension of
the contract term, with the same business, payment and contractual
conditions at least. In respect of these plots of land, the lessor grants
a pre-lease right to the current tenant.**

118. The Parties agree on the following general description of the pre-lease right under

Hungarian law:

If a person has a pre-lease right over property, and the property
owner intends to lease this property, then the owner must inform the
holder of the pre-lease right about any offer from a third party that
he or she intends to accept. Thereafter, the holder of the pre-lease
right, by exercising the pre-lease right by unilateral declaration, may
step in and assume the offer from the third party and thereby create
a lease contract between the owner and the holder of the pre-lease
right upon the terms offered by the third party.*°

[.]

A pre-lease right is not an option to lease. The holder of the pre-
lease right cannot oblige the owner to enter into a lease if the
property owner does not want to lease out his or her property [...]
The owner does not have to offer the property first to the pre-lease
right holder. The prelease right applies only if an offer has already
been made for the lease of the property and the owner accepts such
offer.*°

119. It is also common ground that a pre-lease right can be statutory or contractual. The former

agreement. In addition to the pre-lease provision in the Lease, Inicia had a statutory pre-

lease right pursuant to the 1994 Arable Land Acct, in the following terms:

The ex-lessee shall be entitled to the right of pre-lease for the arable

land taken on usufructuary lease, except if the contract of

usufructuary lease ceased to exist as a consequence of termination

by notice with immediate effect by the lessor.*!
In 1999, Inicia and the State Privatization and Property Plc, an agency managing the State
property, concluded an amendment to the Lease (the “1999 Lease Amendment”), which
envisaged the conclusion of the renewed lease over the Land for a period of 10 years
starting from 1 July 1999.” The effect of the 1999 Lease Amendment was that the Lease,
which was previously due to expire in 2004, was extended by five years to 2009. The

language of the provision concerning the pre-lease right remained unaltered.

In 2002, an amendment to the 1994 Arable Land Act modified the maximum permissible
duration of agricultural leases from 10 to 20 years.** Three years later, in April 2005, upon
a reminder from the State Tenant Association, Inicia requested from the State a
modification of the Lease in order to benefit from the new 20-year maximum duration.
The NLA informed Inicia that the 20-year lease term would start running from the date of
the original conclusion of the Lease in 1994, with the result that the renewed Lease would
expire in 2014. Given that the expiry of the Lease was otherwise due in 2009, the proposed
amendment would effectively extend the Lease by five more years. Therefore, Inicia went

ahead with its request.

On 16 November 2006, Inicia and the NLA thus entered into an amendment to the Lease
(the “2006 Lease Amendment”), under which the Lease was extended to 25 July 2014.*°

In addition, the 2006 Lease Amendment carved out a 75-hectare plot from the scope of the

Lease.*® Most importantly, the new agreement modified the previous language of the pre-

lease provision to read as follows:

With regard to the plots of land subject to the lease, the Tenant
enjoys a pre-emption right and a pre-lease right that may be
exercised in accordance with the applicable laws effective at all
times, and which may not be registered in the Land Registry. [...]
Tenant is not entitled to exercise its pre-lease right, if the lease
ceased to exist or was terminated for a cause arising on the side of
the Tenant.*”
123. The Parties dispute the effect of the new language of the provision. In particular, they
diverge on whether the 2006 Lease Amendment extinguished the contractual pre-lease

right, leaving Inicia only with the statutory pre-lease right.

D. BACKGROUND AND ADOPTION OF THE 2011 AMENDMENT

124. As described above, as a result of the privatization process, agricultural land in Hungary
was fragmented into multiple small parcels owned mainly by private citizens and, in a
smaller part, by the State. Large agricultural enterprises, such as Inicia, then leased many
of those parcels for farming, given that enterprises were not themselves allowed to own

agricultural land.

125. In 1998, the Hungarian Civic Alliance (“Fidesz’”), a national-conservative political party,
came to power in Hungary. As it was unsatisfied with the established composition of the
agricultural sector and, in particular, with the erosion of the rural population, the new
government made agricultural land reform one of its main priorities. The reform was
primarily aimed at “citizenisation of the countryside” by supporting “family-based

agricultural businesses” so that “they c[ould] stay in competition with large companies.”**

28

126. Within the ambit of the reform, the government created the NLA, a management body for
the State-owned agricultural land.*? In 2002, the Hungarian Parliament amended the 1994
Arable Land Act by introducing a ranking system for the exercise of pre-lease rights,
granting priority to family farmers and local villagers, while placing former lessees, such
as the Claimants, in an inferior position.*° As described above, this amendment also

extended the maximum permissible duration of a lease from 10 to 20 years.

127. The reform was, however, put on hold due to a change of government in 2002. The new
socialist government re-amended the 1994 Arable Land Act to reinstitute the former

system, placing former lessees first in the order of priority.*!

128. In 2004, Hungary’s accession to the European Union further affected Hungarian small
farmers, placing them at a competitive disadvantage with the significantly more developed
European agriculture industry. This accelerated the ongoing process of erosion of the

country’s rural population.*?

129. Against this backdrop, the Fidesz government returned to power in 2010. It resumed the
agricultural reform that was halted in 2002. On 12 August 2010, the Hungarian Parliament
enacted the Act on the National Land Agency (the “2010 Act”). The 2010 Act mandated
the re-distribution of the State-owned agricultural land with the aim of promoting “viable
family farms”.** The implementation decree of the 2010 Act set out a procedure governing
the tenders for leasing State-owned agricultural land.** The procedure favored local family
farms and individuals with professional agricultural credentials over large farming

enterprises.

133.

At that time, the implementation decree maintained the existing pre-lease rights with the
result that, if the winning bidder of the tender was not the same person as the pre-lease
right holder, the NLA was to communicate to the pre-lease right holder, by way of public
notice, the fact that a winning bid had been filed. If the pre-lease right holder then submitted
an identical offer to the winning bid, the NLA would conclude the lease agreement with

the pre-lease right holder instead of the winner of the tender.*>

According to the Respondent, the government soon realized that maintaining the pre-lease
right for incumbent lessees contradicted the objectives of the land reform. In particular, it
did not allow for the redistribution of the land to the favored categories of farmers, such as
local, young (less than 40 years old) individuals or family entrepreneurs, holding
agricultural qualifications and preferably being at a start-up stage. Even if such individuals
managed to win tenders due to the ranking system that was favorable to them, the
incumbent lessees with pre-lease rights could defeat the tender results by submitting a

matching offer.*°

Therefore, on 9 July 2011, the Parliament amended the 2010 Act (the “2011
Amendment”), precluding the exercise of statutory pre-lease rights in cases where State-
owned land was leased through a tender:

In case of leasehold of rural land or farm, a pre-lease right arising
from legal regulations may not be exercised.*”

It is undisputed that this provision affected only statutory, as opposed to contractual pre-

lease rights.

THE 2014 TENDERS

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

134. Pursuant to the 2010 Act and its implementing directive, the NLA started organizing
tenders for leasing State-owned agricultural land as the existing lease agreements were
expiring. The process was named the “Land for Farmers Programme”.

135. The scoring system for the tenders was set out in the Instruction of the Minister of
Agriculture.** Apart from other criteria, such as the viability of the business plan and
environmental conservation, the system favored local family farmers with agricultural
diplomas and young farmers:

136. As set out above, the Lease was due to expire on 25 July 2014. Thus, starting from March
2013, the NLA announced a series of tenders for granting new leases over the Land. More
precisely, in line with the objectives of promoting small family farms, the NLA divided the
Land into 16 plots and announced a separate tender for each of the plots (the “Tenders”).*°
Pursuant to the 2011 Amendment, the announcement specified that the incumbent lessee
could not exercise the pre-emption or pre-lease rights over the land forming the subject of

the Tenders.©°

137. Concerned with the prospect of losing the Lease, in April 2013, the Claimants wrote to
Hungary’s Ambassador in London, describing the background of their investment in
Hungary and highlighting the importance of stability of the Lease for the continuation of
their business.°! The Embassy responded on 29 May 2013, stating that the problem of the

renewal of lease contracts would be “satisfactorily resolved” by “the new Act”.

138. According to the Claimants, the reference to “the new Act” was to the 2013 amendment to
the 2010 Act (the “2013 Amendment”), which the Parliament had passed on 22 May 2013,
a few days before the Embassy’s letter. The 2013 Amendment granted the NLA a
discretionary power to extend the duration of existing leases for lessees who benefitted
from EU or national subsidies until they discharged their subsidy obligations.°? The
Ministry of Rural Development clarified, however, that this possibility did not apply to

leases that had already reached the statutory maximum duration of 20 years.**

139. The Claimants attempted to take advantage of the 2013 Amendment by submitting a
request to the NLA to renew the Lease for a period of five years, arguing that many national

and EU subsidies they had received were contingent upon pursuing their farming activities

beyond the expiration of the Lease in July 2014. On 9 July 2013, the NLA rejected the
Claimants’ request, stating that the 2013 Amendment conferred on it a discretion to renew

lease agreements and that it was under no obligation to do so.°>

In addition to the exchanges with the Hungarian Embassy, on 30 May 2013, the Claimants
attended a meeting organized by the British Embassy in Hungary. Mr. Hunter made a
PowerPoint presentation of the Claimants’ farming business in Hungary.® The Claimants
assert that, after the meeting, the Minister of Agriculture, Dr. Fazekas assured Mr. Hunter
that “he could not see anyone entering the tender with a stronger claim, so Inicia just needed

to enter the tender and there would be nothing to worry about.”

Inicia thus submitted bids for the Tenders in June 2013.%* In January 2014, the NLA
announced the results of the Tenders. All 16 of Inicia’s bids were unsuccessful. The plots
were awarded to local farmers. The names of the winning bidders were published on the
NLA’s website. In February 2014, the NLA proceeded to conclude 20-year lease

agreements with the winners.””

The Parties disagree on the reasons for Inicia’s loss. The Claimants contend that the NLA
awarded Inicia’s bids artificially low scores in the discretionary component of the
“professional and commercial well-foundedness of the business plan”.’! The Respondent
in turn suggests that Inicia’s bids were unsuccessful as they were not overall in line with
the policy-related criteria for awarding leases of the State-owned land, including the criteria

that favored local and young family farmers. In addition, according to the Respondent, in

five instances Inicia’s bids were simply disqualified on the basis that they failed to attach

all supporting documents that the tender rules required.””

According to the 2015 statistical report of the Ministry of Agriculture, the tenders that the
NLA conducted between 2010 and 2015 significantly altered the demographics of the
State-owned land holding. Specifically, the number of tenants rose drastically by more than
tenfold, from 600 in 2010 to 7500 in 2015. Nearly 85% of the new tenants were natural

persons, and 21% of them were young farmers under the age of 40.73

DOMESTIC PROCEEDINGS

On 31 January and 5 February 2014, after the announcement of the results of the Tenders,
Inicia wrote to the NLA, affirming the entitlement “to the pre-lease right established in
Section 5.1 of the lease agreement concluded with the National Land Agency on
26 November 2006”.”4 Inicia also requested the NLA to disclose the content of the winning

bids. The NLA did not respond.

In May 2014, a Hungarian court ordered the NLA, upon Inicia’s application, to disclose
the winning bids,” but the NLA failed to comply. After Inicia engaged bailiffs to enforce
the court’s order, the NLA disclosed the winning bids in March 2017."

In addition, Inicia commenced court proceedings to obtain disclosure of the scoring sheets

for the Tenders.”’ The first instance court ordered the NLA to disclose the documents on

27 October 2017."* The second instance court confirmed the order on 31 January 2018.”
The Respondent requested an ex parte extraordinary review of the second instance court
decision by the Supreme Court (also referred to as the “Curia”), which is still pending. In
the meantime, however, the Tribunal ordered the Respondent to disclose the scoring sheets
in a document production exercise in this arbitration. The Respondent complied with the

order.*°

Separately, on 29 April 2014, Inicia formally notified the NLA that it exercised the pre-
lease rights and requested the NLA to sign lease agreements with Inicia “with the same
conditions as were granted to the winning tender applicants”.*! Receiving no response, on
6 June 2014, Inicia filed an action against the NLA and the winners of the Tenders before
the first instance court at the Pest district, requesting the judicial recognition of its exercise
of the pre-lease right under Section 5.1 of the Lease and enjoinment of the NLA to conclude

lease agreements with Inicia upon the terms of the winning bids.

The dispute was entertained at all levels of the Hungarian judiciary and involved the

following steps:

= The first instance court of the district of Pest dismissed Inicia’s claims on
21 October 2014.*? The court primarily based its decision on the fact that the
winners of the Tenders were acting in good faith, without the knowledge of
Inicia’s claims in relation to the Land.

= Inicia appealed the first instance court’s judgment before the second instance
court (also referred to as the “Metropolitan Court”). The Metropolitan
Court dismissed the appeal on 12 November 2015, finding that the language
of the Lease and in particular the new language of the pre-lease clause

decision due to a lack of sufficient reasoning and remanded the case back to
the Metropolitan Court for reconsideration.**

claims.*> The court relied on the interpretation of a similar pre-lease
provision that another panel of the Curia, Panel VI, gave in a separate case
(so-called Szelléhat Case).*°

= Inicia filed a request for extraordinary review with the Curia, which is still
pending. *”

G. EVICTION

149. A few days prior to the expiry of the Lease, on 21 July 2014, the NLA wrote to Inicia,

expressing the intention to retake the possession of the Land.**

150. On 24 July 2014, Inicia obtained an order from the local municipality® granting protection
against eviction pending resolution of the proceedings that Inicia had started before the

District Court of Pest.°

151. Nevertheless, on 25 July 2014, two NLA representatives arrived at the farm and invited
Inicia to sign a minute recording the takeover of the Land. Mr. Hunter signed the minute

with a written reservation that Inicia would not hand over the Land since it had properly

exercised the pre-lease right and had obtained the protective order from the local

municipality the day before.”!

Inicia subsequently obtained, on 31 July and 5 August 2014, three further orders from the
local municipality granting protection against eviction pending the resolution of the court

proceedings.”

Nevertheless, the NLA purported to transfer physical possession of the land to the winners
of the Tenders on 16 October 2014. Inicia refused to leave. The winners started arriving at
the Land with their tractors to do seasonal works. This gave rise to a number of unpleasant
incidents. According to the Respondent, on one occasion, Mr. Hunter physically assaulted

a farmer.”?

In turn, the Claimants contend that in an attempt to intimidate Mr. Hunter, the Respondent
arrested him in February 2015. According to Mr. Hunter’s testimony, he was taken to the
local police station without any explanation. His request for access to a lawyer was denied.
He was released the following morning without charge or any explanation for his

detention.**

The winners of the Tenders in turn obtained possessory protection against Inicia from local
notaries. Inicia sought to overturn the notarial order before the first instance court in Gyér.
On 21 May 2015, the court dismissed Inicia’s request, finding that, “[n]Jotwithstanding the
dispute regarding the pre-lease right [...] the claimant [Inicia] has no valid legal title” and

thus the NLA “may request [Inicia] to cease the nuisance.”*>

The confrontations between the new lessees and the Claimants lasted for almost a year.

Bitay, appeared in the fields with a television crew and armed private security guards. He
vowed to “protect the Hungarian agricultural land under all circumstances, not only legally,
but physically as well”.*° The security guards remained on the Land to ensure Inicia’s
eviction and the harvesting of crops by the winners of the Tenders. In the end, Inicia was

forced to abandon the Land.

Since the eviction, Inicia continues its farming activities on the remainder of the land that
it owned or leased from private owners. The Parties dispute the impact that the eviction

from the Land had on the Claimants’ farming business in Hungary.

SETTLEMENT EFFORTS

On 11 February 2014, shortly after the results of the Tenders had been announced, the
British Ambassador, Jonathan Knott, met with Dr. Marton Bitay of the Ministry of
Agriculture (also referred to as the “Ministry of Rural Development”) to discuss the
position of the British farmers in Hungary in the face of the agricultural reform.”” In a
follow up letter, Dr. Bitay wrote to the Ambassador, pointing out that the farmers had
enough time to adjust to the new realities after the 2011 Amendment. Dr. Bitay suggested
that if the farmers wished to offer their farms for sale to the Hungarian State, they should

have contacted Dr. Sandor Fazekas, Minister of Agriculture Hungary.°*

Inicia’s legal representatives from PricewaterhouseCoopers Legal (“PWC”) thus wrote to
Dr. Fazekas on 10 April 2014 offering to sell Inicia’s shares for HUF 4.95 billion (approx.
EUR 16 million).*? On 30 May 2014, Dr. Bitay acknowledged receipt of the Claimants’

offer.! After several months of silence, on 16 September 2014, Inicia re-submitted its

offer. !°!

On 6 November 2014, the British Ambassador met again with Dr. Bitay. According to the
Embassy’s notes, Dr. Bitay saw a contradiction in Inicia’s actions, as it purported to

negotiate with the State, while at the same time litigating before the Hungarian courts. !°

On 24 November 2014, Dr. Gyula Budai, the State Secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture,
wrote to the British Ambassador stating that there was “nothing in the way [of] beginning
the acquisition negotiations, however, the documentation provided by Inicia did not contain

sufficient information for the evaluation of the business case.” !

In January 2016, Prime Minister Cameron and Prime Minister Orban reached a
“gentlemen’s agreement” that the Respondent would buy the Claimants’ farm.' In light
of this agreement, Dr. Budai met with the British Ambassador on 3 February 2016. At the
meeting, Dr. Budai suggested that the Claimants had two courses of action. First, the State
could purchase their farm in exchange of compensation. Second, the Claimants could
secure new leases for other comparable State-owned land plots, for which Mr. Hunter could

participate in auctions announced by the NLA.!°

However, on 13 April 2017, the Claimants received a letter from the Hungarian National
Asset Management Agency (“MNV’”) stating that “the acquisition of ownership in Inicia
[...] for the benefit of the Hungarian state [...] [did] not fit into the government’s current

strategic plans and goals.”!°° On 27 April 2017, the British Ambassador swiftly arranged

farm was still on the table. !°”

In the meantime, the Respondent retained KPMG to value the Claimants’ Hungarian
subsidiaries, Kintyre and Inicia. According to the Respondent, KPMG’s highest valuation
came to HUF 1.7 billion for the two companies (approximately USD 6.2 million at the rates
in effect at the time). According to Mr. Hunter, he was allowed to consult the report on
10 July 2017 upon signing a non-disclosure agreement, and when he asked KPMG why

the valuation was so low, he was told that it was due to the farm’s shortage of land. !°°

After exchanges spanning over a period of almost three years, on 3 July 2017, the MNV
communicated its counter-proposal to purchase the farm for HUF 700 million
(EUR 2.2 million) to the Claimants. '®? Given the stark difference between the proposals,
the Parties failed to reach an agreement. The Claimants thus initiated the present arbitration

on 4 July 2017.

The Parties dispute the impact of the loss of the Land on the Claimants’ farming business.
While the Claimants assert that Hungary’s measures rendered their farm “unsaleable”!!°,
the Respondent points to the fact that the Claimants continue to derive profit from their

Hungarian farm to this day.'!!

IV. JURISDICTION

167. The Respondent raises two jurisdictional objections. First, it contends that its consent to
arbitrate contained in the BIT was rendered inapplicable by Hungary’s accession to the EU
in 2004 and therefore there is no valid arbitration agreement (A). Second, it claims that the
present dispute does not arise out of an investment that would be capable of being
expropriated and thus the dispute is outside the subject-matter scope of the BIT and the
ICSID Convention (B). Beyond those objections, which will be dealt with below, the
Parties do not dispute the jurisdiction of the Centre or the competence of the Tribunal, and

rightly so.

168. It is undisputed that the Tribunal has the authority to resolve the objections to its
competence and the jurisdiction of the Centre pursuant to Article 41 of the ICSID

Convention, which reads as follows:

(1) The Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence.

(2) Any objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not
within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not
within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the
Tribunal which shall determine whether to deal with it as a
preliminary question or to join it to the merits of the dispute.

169. Accordingly, the Tribunal will deal with each of the Respondent’s objections in turn.

A. INTRA-EU OBJECTION

170. It is common ground that Article 8 of the BIT contains Hungary’s consent to arbitration.!!
The Parties dispute, however, whether that consent was rendered inapplicable by
Hungary’s accession to the EU and its consequent ratification of the Treaty on the
European Union (“TEU”) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union
(“TFEU”) (together the “EU Treaties”).

qd) The Respondent’s Position

171. The Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction since the BIT’s offer to
arbitrate, which the Claimants purported to accept by their trigger letter of 12 November
2015 and in the Request for Arbitration,'!? had long been extinguished by virtue of
Hungary’s accession to the EU Treaties in 2004.
a. Article 8 BIT is incompatible with the EU Treaties
172. The Respondent contends that the BIT’s dispute resolution provision is incompatible with
the EU Treaties. It primarily relies on the decision of the Court of Justice of the European
Union (the “CJEU”) in Slovak Republic v. Achmea B.V. (the “Achmea Decision”),!'* in
which the CJEU determined that the dispute resolution provisions in the investment treaties
concluded between the EU Member States were contrary to the EU Treaties:
Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a
provision in an international agreement concluded between Member
States, such as Article 8 of the Agreement on encouragement and
reciprocal protection of investments between the Kingdom of the
Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, under
which an investor from one of those Member States may, in the
event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member
State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an
arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has
undertaken to accept.!!5
173. According to the Respondent, the Achmea Decision is dispositive of the incompatibility
between the BIT’s dispute resolution provision and the EU Treaties, since the CJEU
decisions have erga omnes effect vis-a-vis all EU Member States.!!® This was confirmed
by the 2019 Declarations as issued by 23 EU Member States, including Hungary and the
UK, affirming that “all investor-State arbitration clauses contained in bilateral investment

treaties concluded between Member States are contrary to Union law and thus
inapplicable.”!!” As the PCIJ held in the Jaworzina opinion, the treaty-making parties

“acting in consensus remain the masters of their treaty and can, therefore, determine its

meaning with binding force.”!!®

174. According to Hungary, the Claimants are asking the Tribunal to ignore the authoritative
decision of the CJEU and the binding interpretation given by the BIT’s Contracting States.
This request should be rejected as, contrary to the Claimants’ arguments, there is no reason

for a different conclusion. More specifically, Hungary makes the following submissions:

= While the Claimants rely on the fact that this is an ICSID arbitration, unlike
the one at issue in the Achmea Decision (the “Achmea Arbitration”), this
is all the more reason to follow the analysis of the Achmea Decision. There,
the CJEU reasoned that the courts of the Member States did not retain
sufficient control over the Achmea Arbitration in respect of the application
of EU law, despite the fact that the arbitration was seated in Frankfurt and
that Member State courts had jurisdiction over the ensuing award in set aside
and enforcement proceedings. In turn, the Contracting States of the ICSID
Convention are arguably under an obligation to enforce ICSID awards
without scrutinizing them even for the limited ground of public policy.'!”
The absence of substantive review of the application of EU law by courts
sitting within the EU system is precisely the reason why the Achmea
Decision held that there was an incompatibility between the intra-EU BITs
and the EU Treaties. This incompatibility is amplified in the ICSID context.

= The Claimants’ contention that the existence of the conflict between Article
8 of the BIT and the EU Treaties should be viewed from the public
international law perspective is uncontested but does not change the fact that
there is an incompatibility between these successive treaties. As a result of
the Achmea Decision, the incompatibility is itself a rule of public
international law. In this respect, the Claimants’ reliance on pre-Achmea
investment awards is misguided, as the value of these awards cannot be

compared with that of a CJEU decision. Again, the CJEU determines the
content of the EU Treaties with mandatory and erga omnes effect.

= The Claimants’ argument that the BIT and the EU Treaties do not regulate
the same subject matter and therefore one cannot prevail over the other under
Article 30(3) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (“WCLT”) is
also unavailing. Scholars suggest that the notion of subject matter must be
understood broadly, because a strict interpretation “leads to a reductio ad
absurdum.”'?°
= Similarly, the Claimants’ argument that the Achmea Decision was based on
a different BIT “in which, unlike the UK-Hungary BIT, the law of an EU
Member State was expressly incorporated as part of the governing law”'! is
inapposite. On the basis of Article 42 of the ICSID Convention, in the
absence of a choice of law in the treaty, the law of the host State, including
EU law applies to the merits of the dispute. This difference between the BIT
applicable here and the Slovak-Netherlands BIT at issue in the Achmea
Decision is, therefore, immaterial. !?*
For these reasons, according to Hungary, the Claimants’ reliance on the pre-Achmea
decisions of investment tribunals, such as Electrabel v. Hungary,’ and RREEF
Infrastructure v. Spain'** is unavailing as those decisions were not informed by the CJEU’s

authoritative interpretation of the EU Treaties.

b. The EU Treaties prevail

The Respondent contends that the incompatibility between Article 8 of the BIT and the EU
Treaties should be resolved in favor of the EU Treaties, as the CJEU authoritatively
determined in the Achmea Decision. More specifically, the EU Treaties are later in time

and should prevail pursuant to Article 30(3) of the VCLT, which contains the rule that /ex

posterior derogat priori. Contrary to the Claimants’ assertion, it does not matter that the
EU Treaties may have been in effect in some form since the 1957 Treaty of Rome. What
matters, according to Hungary, is that it acceded to the EU in 2004 and the EU Treaties
then became applicable between Hungary and the UK.!*> Thus, in respect of the BIT, the

EU Treaties constitute a /ex posterior.'7°

177. Another conflict of treaties rule also speaks in favor of EU Treaties, namely the rule found

in Article 30(2) of the VCLT, which reads as follows:

When a treaty specifies that it is subject to, or that it is not to be
considered as incompatible with, an earlier or later treaty, the
provisions of that other treaty prevail.

178. Article 351 of the TFEU is precisely the type of rule envisaged by Article 30(2) of the
VCLT. It provides that the obligations set out in the EU Treaties prevail over those

contained in agreements concluded prior to the accession to the EU.

179. For the Respondent, the Claimants read Article 351 of the TFEU incorrectly when they
argue that it “only applies to agreements between EU Member States and ‘third countries”
and not to agreements between EU Member States. That argument is belied by consistent
case law of the CJEU.'?’ The Claimants’ reliance on Vattenfall v. Germany is unhelpful.
In that case, the ICSID Tribunal found that there was no conflict between the Energy
Charter Treaty’s dispute resolution provision and the EU Treaties. It was therefore

unnecessary to apply Article 351 of the TFEU.

Had the Vattenfall tribunal wished to assess the meaning of Article 351 of the TFEU, the
Respondent submits that it would have relied on the CJEU’s binding interpretation of this
provision. Even if the Vattenfall tribunal had conducted a full analysis under treaty law, it

would have concluded that this provision applies to treaties between EU Member States.

As for the Claimants’ argument that it was incumbent upon Hungary and the UK to
eliminate any incompatibilities between the BIT and the EU Treaties, the Respondent
suggests that there exists no international obligation on States to remedy an incompatibility
between successive treaties. Instead, the incompatibility is dealt with by Article 30(3) of
the VCLT, which is clear in that the later treaty shall prevail. Therefore, no inferences can
be drawn from the fact that the EU Member States have not formally amended or renounced

their intra-EU BITs.!°8

Further, for Hungary, the Claimants erroneously invoke Article 11 of the BIT, which
provides in relevant part that “[i]f the [...] obligations under international law [...] contain
tules, whether general or specific, entitling investments by investors of the other
Contracting Party to a treatment more favourable than is provided for by the present
Agreement, such rules shall to the extent that they are more favourable prevail over the
present Agreement.”'?? The Claimants wrongly suggest that this is a subordination clause
of the type contemplated in Article 30(2) of the VCLT. Apart from the fact that Article 11
of the BIT does not at all address a conflict with other treaties, it only allows the application
of more favorable “treatment” to the “investment”. It does not deal with procedural
mechanisms. Indeed, access to arbitration does not qualify as “treatment” of an investment

but constitutes a procedural right. '°°

In any event, even if Article 11 were deemed a conflict rule, according to the Respondent,
it would be in direct contradiction with Article 351 of the TFEU, which is a later conflict

tule applicable between Hungary and the United Kingdom.

As to the Tribunal’s question on the possible impact of the UK’s announced withdrawal
from the EU (“Brexit’) jurisdiction must be assessed, so says Hungary, by reference to the
date of the institution of the arbitral proceedings. At that time, the UK was an EU Member.
In addition, despite Brexit, the UK subscribed to the 2019 Declarations, vowing to “take
the necessary measures to inform [arbitral tribunals]” that “[Article 8 of the BIT is] contrary

to Union law and thus inapplicable.” !?!

Finally, contrary to the Claimants’ contention, the Respondent argues that the principles of
good faith and estoppel would not justify upholding jurisdiction in the circumstances of
this case. The Claimants’ good faith, which is not disputed, is not a reason for the Tribunal
to rewrite the law and assume jurisdiction without the Respondent’s consent.'*? As for
estoppel, under international law a party must make a clear statement or engage in
consistent conduct on which the other party relies to its own detriment.'3? The Claimants
do not even come close to establishing that Hungary made a statement or engaged in
conduct suggesting the compatibility of the BIT with the EU Treaties, and that the

Claimants acted in reliance on such conduct.

(2) The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants submit that there is a valid arbitration agreement between the Parties, as
they accepted the Respondent’s offer to arbitrate contained in Article 8 of the BIT. Article
8 of the BIT contained a valid offer at the time when it accepted it by a letter of
12 November 2015 and in the Request for Arbitration of 4 July 2017. Indeed, (a) that
provision is compatible with the EU Treaties, and (b) in any event, the EU Treaties do not

prevail over the BIT.

a. Article 8 BIT is compatible with the EU Treaties

The Claimants contend that the Achmea Decision is not binding on this Tribunal, which
should conduct an independent inquiry into its own jurisdiction under Article 41(1) of the
ICSID Convention. As numerous investment treaty tribunals have made clear, this inquiry

must be conducted under public international law and not exclusively under EU law.'*+

It is also well-established in investment treaty jurisprudence that the dispute settlement
provisions in investment treaties are easily reconcilable with the EU Treaties,!*> and in

particular with Articles 344 and 267 of the TFEU. These provisions read as follows:

Article 344

Member States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the
interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of
settlement other than those provided for in the Treaties.

[.]
Article 267

The Court of Justice of the European Union shall have jurisdiction

to give preliminary rulings concerning:

(a) the interpretation of the Treaties;

(b) the validity and interpretation of acts of the institutions, bodies,

offices or agencies of the Union.
In the Claimants’ submission, these provisions relate to actions brought by the Member
States and say nothing about private parties bringing claims regarding the interpretation
and application of a BIT. The test of incompatibility under the VCLT is strict and “the
mere fact that there was a difference between the provisions of a later treaty and those of

an earlier treaty d[oes] not necessarily mean that there exist[s] an incompatibility”. '°°

The Claimants further observe that the finding of incompatibility in the Achmea Decision
was based on the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT which, different from the UK-Hungary BIT,
chose the law of an EU Member State as part of the governing law. Although the Achmea
Decision contains general language applying to other investment treaties “such as” the
Netherlands-Slovakia BIT, the words “such as” should be construed to refer only to ISDS
clauses in investment treaties that contain governing law clauses similar to that of the

Netherlands-Slovakia BIT.

b. The EU Treaties do not prevail

Even if there were a conflict between Article 8 of the BIT and the EU Treaties, the
Claimants submit that the latter would not prevail. The temporal conflicts rule contained
in Article 30(3) of the VCLT only applies to successive treaties with the same subject
matter. It is well established in public international law that this “expression ‘relating to
the same subject-matter’ must be construed strictly” and that it does “not cover cases where
a general treaty impinges indirectly on the content of a particular provision of an earlier
treaty.”'°7 Many tribunals have made the obvious point that the subject matter of
investment treaties is different from that of the TFEU, which concerns the functioning of
the European Union.!** Therefore, the EU Treaties would not prevail over the BIT, even if

they were in conflict.

Even if Article 30(3) is applied, it is unclear to the Claimants how the EU Treaties can be
considered later in time than the BIT. In Vattenfall v. Germany, the ICSID tribunal noted
that “Articles 267 and 344 TFEU have existed in substantively similar form” as part of the
Treaty of Rome of 1957. Hence, for that tribunal “it [was] by no means clear that the EU
Treaties [were] the ‘later treaty’ under Article 30 VCLT.”'*?

In addition, the Claimants submit that the BIT should prevail over the EU Treaties pursuant

to Article 30(2) of the VCLT. In particular, the Claimants suggest that Article 11 of the

57 Sinclair, The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (2" edition, 2018), CL-33, 98.

196.

BIT is a subordination clause envisaged by Article 30(2) of the VCLT. The relevant part

of Article 11 to which the Claimants refer reads as follows:

If [...] obligations under international law [...] established hereafter

between the Contracting Parties in addition to the present

Agreement contain rules, whether general or specific, entitling

investments by investors of the other Contracting Party to a

treatment more favourable than is provided for by the present

Agreement, such rules shall to the extent that they are more

favourable prevail over the present Agreement. !4°
For the Claimants, the obvious a contrario reading of Article 11 is that the parties to the
BIT intended the BIT to prevail to the extent that any later treaty offered less favorable
treatment to the investments of investors. If the rules of the EU Treaties render Article 8 of
the BIT inapplicable, then such rules would clearly result in less favourable treatment for

the Claimants, and therefore the BIT terms would prevail.

In this connection, the Claimants consider the Respondent’s invocation of Article 351 of
the TFEU ill-conceived. As the Vattenfall v. Germany tribunal clarified, this provision,
which obliges the EU Member States to eliminate incompatibilities with other treaties,
applies to the treaties which bind EU Member States to third countries. 4! According to the
Claimants, the Respondent admitted as much in the Rejoinder.'*? In any event, Article 351
TFEU does not render incompatible provisions automatically inapplicable, but instead
makes it incumbent upon the Member States to remedy such incompatibilities. In the
present case, the Respondent has not done so before the Claimants accepted the offer to
arbitrate. Given that an arbitration agreement was concluded, it is no longer open to the

Respondent to renege on the offer.

The Claimants further reject the Respondent’s interpretation of the 2019 Declarations that
the EU Member States issued as a result of the Achmea Decision. As a matter of public

international law, these declarations are a non-binding expression of the States’ intention

to undertake future actions.'4? They do not constitute joint interpretative statements or
notes clarifying the meaning of Article 8 of the BIT and can certainly not remove the
consent to arbitrate given in an international treaty. Even if the 2019 Declarations were
considered to be joint interpretative statements, they would not be binding upon this
Tribunal. Such statements are only one of the interpretative tools available under the
VCLT. They fall under Article 31(3)(a) of the VCLT which provides that in interpreting a
treaty “any subsequent agreement between the parties [...] shall be taken into account.”
However, such interpretative agreements cannot change the plain ordinary meaning of the

treaty text.

In connection with the Tribunal’s question concerning the UK’s withdrawal from the EU,
the Claimants agree with the Respondent that jurisdiction must be assessed on the date of
the commencement of the present proceedings. '“* That said, they point to the Respondent’s
“hypocritical” position, which disregards events postdating the commencement of the
arbitration, such as Brexit, and at the same time relies on other post-commencement events,

such as the Achmea Decision and the 2019 Declarations. '*°

Finally, the Claimants insist that reasons of good faith and justice mandate the Tribunal to
assume jurisdiction under Article 8 of the BIT. In particular, by statements (e.g., “the

””)!46 and conduct (e.g., failing to take any

unexpected outcome in the Achmea decision’
steps to amend, suspend or terminate Article 8 and electing not to file any equivalent
jurisdictional objection in the Accession v. Hungary case filed in 2011 under the same
BIT)'4’, the Respondent tacitly accepted that Article 8 of the BIT was still in force on the

institution of these proceedings.

199. Thus, so argue the Claimants, it would be manifestly unjust under the present facts if they
were deprived of access to arbitral justice due to an alleged incompatibility between EU
Treaties and the Respondent’s unambiguous expression of consent in Article 8 of the
BIT.'48

(3) Analysis

200. Article 25 of the ICSID Convention requires inter alia that the respondent State and the

national of another Contracting State consent in writing to arbitrate their dispute:

The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute
arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State
(or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State
designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another
Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing
to submit to the Centre.'?

201. When the Claimants served their request for arbitration on 4 July 2017, they purported to
accept Hungary’s offer to arbitrate which is embodied in Article 8 of the BIT and reads as

follows:

Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit to the
International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes
(hereinafter referred to as “the Centre”) for the settlement by
conciliation or arbitration under the Convention on the Settlement
of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States
opened for signature at Washington on 18 March 1965 any legal
dispute arising under Article 6 of this Agreement between that
Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party
concerning an investment of the latter in the territory of the
former. !°°

202. Hungary objects that, at the time of the Claimants’ acceptance, the offer was no longer

valid due to Hungary’s accession to the EU Treaties in 2004.

206.

The Parties agree that the question whether the EU Treaties override the dispute resolution
clause of the BIT must be assessed under international law, and rightly so. Indeed, the
BIT’s offer to arbitrate is contained in an international treaty, and its validity and
interpretation is governed by the VCLT of which Hungary and the UK are both contracting
parties. In addition, this arbitration is conducted under the ICSID Convention and, thus, is
not subject to a national legal system. As a result, the validity of the arbitration agreement
or arbitrability of the dispute is not governed by a national /ex arbitri. Therefore, for the
purposes of the present case, the Tribunal does not need to consider the consequences, if
any, of the application of a particular national /ex arbitri to the dispute or the arbitration

agreement.

Before analyzing whether the EU Treaties preclude the application of Article 8 of the BIT
pursuant to the VCLT (c), the Tribunal will address the Respondent’s argument that this
Tribunal is bound by the Achmea Decision (a) and the 2019 Declarations (b).

a. Is the Achmea Decision binding on the Tribunal?

In its judgment in Achmea issued on 6 March 2018, the CJEU held that “Articles 267 and
344 [of the] TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an international
agreement concluded between Member States [...] under which an investor from one of
those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other
Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal

whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept.” '*!

According to Hungary, the Achmea Decision did not change the content of the existing
law. Instead, “[t]he Achmea Decision has only said what the law was all along.”!>? For the

authoritative interpretation”, with the result that “as a matter of law, there is no scope for
a9 153

reinterpreting”.
The Tribunal is not convinced that it is bound by the CJEU’s decision over the conflict
between the BIT and the EU Treaties. Under Article 41 of the ICSID Convention, the UK,
Hungary and the other 155 contracting States, including non-EU States, agreed that an
arbitral tribunal constituted under the ICSID Convention “shall be the judge of its own

competence”, and that:

Any objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not within

the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the

competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal

[i
In other words, the ICSID Convention empowers tribunals acting under its aegis to decide
over their own jurisdiction, that is to say that it grants them Kompetenz-Kompetenz. In the
exercise of such power, the Tribunal must analyze whether there is a valid consent to
arbitrate under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. An ICSID tribunal cannot abandon
this mandate and blindly follow the determination of another adjudicatory body. It must

carry out its own analysis.

In any event, the CJEU’s interpretative authority extends to the interpretation and
application of the EU Treaties. !>° The CJEU has no such (arguably) exclusive or ultimate
mandate in respect of the interpretation of the BIT or the VCLT rules on treaty conflicts.
Yet, in order to determine whether Article 8 of the BIT is precluded by the EU Treaties, it
does not suffice to interpret the EU Treaties. This determination requires the interpretation
of both the EU Treaties and the BIT, in order to answer crucial questions such as (i) whether

the BIT and the EU Treaties govern the same subject matter as provided in Article 30 of

the VCLT and, if so, (ii) whether there is a normative conflict between these treaties as

understood under the VCLT.

Not only does the CJEU have no exclusive authority to answer these questions, but it did
not even purport to address them in the Achmea Decision. Even a cursory review of that
decision reveals that the CJEU did not undertake a conflicts analysis under the VCLT.
Thus, even if the Tribunal were willing to pay deference to the CJEU’s reasoning, the
Achmea Decision would give no guidance on the issues which must be resolved to
determine whether the EU Treaties preclude the application of Article 8 of the BIT as a
matter of international law. The Tribunal finds confirmation for this observation for
instance in United Utilities v. Estonia, according to which the Achmea Decision “assume[s]

that the issue must be considered through, and only through, the lens of EU law.”!*°

For these reasons, the Tribunal is bound to undertake an independent analysis as to whether
the EU Treaties override the consent to ICSID arbitration given in the BIT, which analysis
is subject to the VCLT.

b. What is the value of the Member States Declarations?

In January 2019, 23 EU Member States, including Hungary and the UK, made declarations
affirming that “all investor-State arbitration clauses contained in bilateral investment
treaties concluded between Member States are contrary to Union law and thus

inapplicable.”!*’ The Parties dispute the legal value of the 2019 Declarations.

The Respondent submits that the Contracting States are the masters of the treaty. In general,
the Tribunal agrees with this statement. Indeed, when the Contracting States are in
agreement, they may even go as far as to terminate the treaty.'** That said, the UK and

Hungary have not terminated the BIT pursuant to the rules of Section 3 of the VCLT. Even

if they had done so by virtue of the 2019 Declarations, however, the Claimants accepted
the BIT’s offer to arbitrate prior to its purported termination. Pursuant to Article 25 of the
ICSID Convention, “[w]Jhen the parties [i.e. the investor and the State] have given their
consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.” Indeed, it is common ground
between the Parties that the relevant time for determining jurisdiction is the date of the

initiation of the arbitration.

Thus, the consent to arbitrate, in the sense of a meeting of the minds, which is perfected by
the investor’s acceptance of the State’s offer to arbitrate expressed in the BIT would not be
retroactively invalidated by a subsequent termination of the BIT. In other words, even if
the Tribunal were to regard the 2019 Declarations as an agreement to terminate the BIT,
quod non, that agreement could not have invalidated the consent to arbitrate because it was

entered after the consent was formed.

The 2019 Declarations might also arguably be viewed as a “subsequent agreement between
the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty”, as envisaged by Article 31(3)(a) of
the VCLT. This seems to be the Respondent’s position, which states that the 2019
Declarations are “a clarification of the meaning and the effect that these [treaties] have
always had. It is not a forward-looking policy statement [...]. It is a statement of what they

understand the law to have been since the treaties came into effect.”!°

However, the 2019 Declarations themselves are not clear on whether they purport to offer
a joint interpretation of the intra-EU BITs. In pertinent part, their title reads: “Declaration
[...] on the Legal Consequences of the Judgment of the Court of Justice in Achmea and on
Investment Protection in the European Union.”!® This wording suggests that the Member
States seek to explain the legal consequences of the Achmea Decision, rather than to give

an interpretation of the meaning of intra-EU investment treaties.

This suggestion is corroborated by the fact that, prior to the Achmea Decision, Hungary
participated in an ICSID arbitration under the present BIT without objecting that Article 8
was extinguished due to its accession to the EU.'*! This instance shows that Hungary did
not consider that its offer to arbitrate expressed in the BIT had ceased to be effective as a
result of its accession to the EU. Instead, as the title of the 2019 Declarations demonstrates,
such ineffectiveness or extinguishment is presented as a consequence of the Achmea
Decision. Yet, as discussed above, the Claimants accepted Hungary’s offer to arbitrate
prior to the Achmea Decision. Hence, according to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, it

is no longer open for Hungary to renege on this consent.

Be that as it may, joint interpretative declarations or agreements are not an exclusive and
dispositive method of treaty interpretation. Pursuant to Article 31(3) of the VCLT they are
but one circumstance that “shall be taken into account, together with the context” of the
relevant treaty terms. What is more, context is itself one of the means of interpretation
under Article 31(1) of the VCLT, together with the ordinary meaning and object and
purpose of the treaty. Thus, an interpretative declaration, as its name indicates, can only

interpret the treaty terms; it cannot change their meaning:

Unlike interpretation, the subsequent modification of a treaty can
hardly be left to informal agreements as the amendment must be on
the same legal level as the original treaty as foreseen in the treaty.!°

Here, the provision that is purportedly subject to interpretation is Article 8 of the BIT,

which was already quoted and reads as follows:

Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit to the
International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes
(hereinafter referred to as “the Centre”) for the settlement by
conciliation or arbitration under the Convention on the Settlement
of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States

dispute arising under Article 6 of this Agreement between that

Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party

concerning an investment of the latter in the territory of the

former. '®
The ordinary meaning of the language of this provision leaves no doubt that it contains
binding consent (in the meaning of offer) to ICSID jurisdiction. The Respondent accepts
the binding nature of this offer when it states in so many words that “Hungary never denied

that “‘consents’ means consents” and that “Hungary obviously intended to and did
consent to the submission of disputes to ICSID arbitration when it signed the BIT.”!™ If
Hungary and the UK intended to modify the words of an international treaty ratified by
both of them, issuing an interpretative declaration by representatives of their governments
was not a suitable means for achieving that purpose. If it had been their intent to amend the
express language of the BIT, the States would have chosen a different course. The Member
States obviously acknowledge that they cannot modify existing BITs by mere declarations,

when they state in the 2019 Declarations:

Member States will make best efforts to deposit their instrument of

ratification, approval or acceptance [...] of any bilateral investment

treaty terminating bilateral investment treaties between Member

States no later than 6 December 2019. !5
Had the 2019 Declarations been sufficient to change the BITs, then the termination of such
treaties would be superfluous. In this respect, the Tribunal agrees with the ICSID tribunal
in United Utilities v. Estonia that the language of the 2019 Declarations “necessarily
implies [...] that the BIT remains in force and that its Article 9 [comparable to Article 8

here] can therefore constitute a valid offer to arbitrate, which Claimants accepted.”!°

The Tribunal’s finding that the 2019 Declarations were not the proper procedure to
terminate or amend the BIT is not based on mere formalism. The BIT is an international
treaty that confers rights on private parties. While the Contracting States remain the masters
of their treaty, their control is limited by the general principles of legal certainty and res
inter alios acta, aliis nec nocet nec prodest.'* This is evident for instance from Article
13(3) of the BIT, which grants a guarantee of stability to investors who have made

investments in reliance on the BIT:

In respect of investment made whilst the Agreement is in force, its
provisions shall continue in effect with respect to such investments
for a period of twenty years after the date of termination and without
prejudice to the application thereafter of the rules of general
international law.

This provision shows that, even where the Contracting Parties terminate the treaty on
mutual consent, they acknowledge that long-term interests of investors who have invested
in the host State in reliance on the treaty guarantees must be respected. This is the purpose
served by the 20-year sunset provision. If the protection of existing investments outlives
an unambiguous termination of the Treaty, then the protection must continue a fortiori in
respect of a decision of an adjudicatory body constituted under a different treaty or of

declarations that purport to clarify the legal consequences of that decision.

For these reasons, the 2019 Declarations cannot retroactively invalidate or render
inapplicable the offer to arbitrate that the Claimants accepted through their request for
arbitration. That being said, it remains to be seen whether, by the time of the
commencement of these proceedings, Article 8 of the BIT had been overridden as a
consequence of Hungary’s accession to the EU, pursuant to the conflict provisions of

Article 30 of the VCLT.

‘67 Pursuant to Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT, treaties are to be interpreted in light of other rules of international law
applicable between the parties. Pursuant to Article 38(1) of the ICJ Statute, this includes general principles of law;
See also, Article 69(2) of the VCLT.

c. Do the EU Treaties preclude the application of Article 8 of the BIT?

In reliance on the conflict rules of Article 30 of the VCLT, the Respondent argues that
Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU override Article 8 of the BIT. The Claimants dispute the
applicability of the conflict rules of Article 30 of the VCLT and submit that, even if they

were applicable, the terms of the BIT would prevail.

Article 30 of the VCLT sets forth rules to resolve conflicts between successive treaties that

govern the same subject matter. In relevant part, it reads as follows:

Article 30

Application of successive treaties
relating to the same subject matter

1. Subject to Article 103 of the Charter of the United Nations, the
rights and obligations of States parties to successive treaties relating
to the same subject-matter shall be determined in accordance with
the following paragraphs.

2. When a treaty specifies that it is subject to, or that it is not to be
considered as incompatible with, an earlier or later treaty, the
provisions of that other treaty prevail.

3. When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the later
treaty but the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in
operation under article 59, the earlier treaty applies only to the extent
that its provisions are compatible with those of the later treaty.

4. When the parties to the later treaty do not include all the parties
to the earlier one:

(a) as between States parties to both treaties the same rule applies as
in paragraph 3;

(b) as between a State party to both treaties and a State party to only

one of the treaties, the treaty to which both States are parties governs

their mutual rights and obligations.
In order to determine whether the TFEU prevails over Article 8 of the BIT, the Tribunal
must first answer two threshold questions: (i) do the BIT and the TFEU have the same
subject matter as required by paragraph 1 of Article 30 of the VCLT and, if in the
affirmative, (ii) is Article 8 of the BIT in conflict with Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU?

60

(i) Same subject matter
228. The Parties disagree on the interpretation of the same subject-matter requirement under
Article 30(1) of the VCLT. According to most prominent commentators, the formulation
should be understood widely.'* That being said, it cannot be reduced to a requirement that
the two treaties be potentially applicable to the same set of circumstances. Such a reduction
would render the requirement superfluous. Indeed, if two treaties do not apply to the same

set of circumstances, they are not in conflict and Article 30 does not come into play.

229. Therefore, to satisfy the same subject-matter requirement, it does not suffice that the
successive treaties potentially govern the same facts. This was the conclusion in EURAM

v. Slovak Republic for instance:

Even if two different rules deal with issues arising from the same
facts, it does not necessarily mean that they have the same subject
matter. This can be seen from a simple example: a treaty on
environmental protection and a treaty on trade may both apply to the
same factual situation but the subject matter with which they deal is
quite different.'°

230. Investment treaty tribunals have understood that the subject-matter of a treaty is defined
by the matters with which the treaty’s constituent provisions deal. In the words of the

Oostergetel tribunal:

The requirement [...] that the two treaties relate to the “same subject
matter” has to be construed in line with the dominant view expressed
in scholarly writings to the effect that two treaties can be considered
to relate to the “same subject matter” only if the overall objective of
these treaties is identical and they share a degree of general
comparability. !7°

231. In respect of the EU Treaties, investment jurisprudence is consistent in holding that

investment treaties do not share the subject matter with the EU Treaties. By contrast, the

22 October 2012, RL-8, {| 169. The tribunal also warned that the ILC’s interpretation conflates the same subject-matter
requirement with the separate requirement of incompatibility.

Achmea Decision is silent on whether the intra-EU investment treaties and the TFEU

govern the same subject matter for the purposes of Article 30 of the VCLT.

Among investment awards, the Wirtgen tribunal found it “obvious” that intra-EU

investment treaties and the TFEU did not relate to the same subject matter,'7! and noted:

To take but one example, Article 10 of the Treaty allows an investor

to sue a host state. No parallel provision exists in the TFEU. [...]

Similarly, EU law does not provide a protection similar to the FET

found in the BIT.!7
Earlier, the Eastern Sugar tribunal had observed that “the BIT [...] provides for a special
procedural protection in the form of arbitration between the investor state and the host state
and, especially arbitration of a ‘mixed’ or ‘diagonal’ type between the investor and the host
state”. That tribunal thus emphasized that “[f]rom the point of view of the promotion and
protection of investments, the arbitration clause is in practice the most essential provision
of Bilateral Investment Treaties,” and added that “EU law does not provide such a

guarantee.” !73

In addition, as the most evident distinction, the application of the BIT is contingent upon
an investor of one State making a cross-border investment in the other State. In turn, the
EU Treaties provide guarantees for nationals of the EU Member States irrespective of an
investment. Due to this crucial distinction, the substantive protections afforded to a foreign
investor under the Treaty are unsurprisingly not comparable to, or of the same nature as,
those offered to EU nationals under the BIT. By way of an example, as the Eureko v.
Slovakia tribunal observed, the protections afforded by BITs under the FET standard are
not limited to the existing EU law provisions prohibiting discrimination.! Similarly,

while EU law may condition expropriatory takings upon public interest and fair

compensation, it has not been established that it offers comparable protections to those
available under the Treaty in case of indirect expropriations, or that it applies the

protections to “every kind of asset”.

The BIT and the EU Treaties also differ in their overarching goals. As the Oostergetel
tribunal underscored, the EU Treaties’ objective is to promote economic integration,
including by creating a common market, among the Member States, whereas the objective
of BITs (including the Treaty) is to provide for specific guarantees in order to encourage

the international flows of investment into particular States.'7>

The Tribunal sees no reason to diverge from the consistent line of investment awards
according to which the EU Treaties and investment treaties do not share the same subject
matter. Consequently, the conflict rules embodied in Article 30 of the VCLT do not apply

to possible conflicts between the BIT and the EU Treaties.

The Parties have not pointed to, and the Tribunal is not aware of the existence of, provisions
in the VCLT or of norms of customary international law that would govern the resolution
of possible conflicts between successive treaties that do not share the same subject matter.
Importantly, pursuant to Article 42(1) of the VCLT, “[t]he validity of a treaty or of the
consent of a State to be bound by a treaty may be impeached only through the application

of the present Convention.”

For these reasons, the conclusions that the BIT and the EU Treaties do not have the same
subject matter and thus Article 30 of the VCLT does not apply dispose of the question
whether the BIT’s offer to arbitrate was valid and applicable at the commencement of this
arbitration. The analysis could stop here. Yet, because the Parties have extensively briefed
these issues, the Tribunal will review the existence of a conflict assuming same subject

matter.

(ii) Conflict
Even if it were considered that the BIT and the EU Treaties share the same subject matter,
the BIT’s consent to arbitrate would not be precluded by operation of the EU Treaties,
since there is no conflict between Article 8 of the BIT and Articles 267 and 344 of the
TFEU.

When States subscribe to successive treaties, without thereby terminating or amending any
of them, it should be presumed that they did not intend to create a normative contradiction.
This presumption of non-conflict derives from the principle of harmonious interpretation

of international law:

There is a general principle under international law whereby the
interpreter tries to smooth out or even to avoid conflict by way of
“harmonizing interpretation” (presumption of non-conflict). This
tule is based on the assumption that when States wanted different
tules to be applicable they could not at the same time have wanted
normative contradiction, '”°

As a leading commentary to the VCLT suggests, “[i]f apparently conflicting treaty
provisions can be interpreted in such a way that they are compatible with each other, this
approach is the first to be chosen.”!”’ This harmonious interpretation should not be
understood as a suggestion to ignore outright conflicts. An outright conflict “arises only
where a Party to the two treaties cannot simultaneously comply with its obligations under

vl 78

both treaties, or in different words:

Treaties are incompatible with each other if their obligations cannot
be complied with simultaneously, ie if a State Party to both treaties
cannot comply with one of them without breaching the other.!”

Bearing these explanations in mind, the Tribunal fails to see a conflict between Article 8

of the BIT and Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU. Article 344 reads as follows:

Member States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the

interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of

settlement other than those provided for [in the Treaties].
The language of this provision does not limit or prohibit the submission of disputes with
investors based on an investment treaty to other adjudicatory bodies. Instead, it limits the
power of the Member States to litigate (or arbitrate) disputes concerning the interpretation

or application of the EU Treaties by means other than those provided in the EU Treaties.

In line with this distinction, Article 8 of the BIT provides for international arbitration of
disputes “arising under Article 6 [of the BIT]’, not of “a dispute concerning the
interpretation or application of the [EU] Treaties”. It is true that a dispute arising under
Article 6 of the BIT may involve, as preliminary or incidental issues, matters calling for
the interpretation or application of the EU Treaties. At most, one might argue that Article
344 of the TFEU carves out from the subject-matter scope of Article 8 of the BIT potential
investment disputes that also involve “interpretation or application of the [EU] Treaties”.
The Tribunal can leave this question open as the present dispute does not call for the
interpretation or application of the EU Treaties. Therefore, at the time when the Claimants
commenced these proceedings, the BIT’s offer to arbitrate was valid in respect of the

subject-matter scope of the present dispute.

The next provision that the Respondent considers to be in conflict with Article 8 of the BIT
is Article 267 of the TFEU, which reads as follows:

The Court of Justice of the European Union shall have jurisdiction
to give preliminary rulings concerning:
(a) the interpretation of the Treaties;

(b) the validity and interpretation of acts of the institutions, bodies,

offices or agencies of the Union.
Here the potential for a normative conflict is even more remote. This provision confers the
power to give preliminary rulings on the CJEU. It is unclear how this power conflicts with
the submission of a dispute under a BIT to international arbitration. It is true that an
investment treaty tribunal is not empowered to resort to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling.

This alone does not give rise to a normative conflict with Article 267. Indeed, the language

65

247.

248.

of Article 267 does not create an obligation for the Member States to ensure that each and
every adjudicatory body potentially applying EU law may seek a preliminary ruling from
the CJEU. Even at the level of the domestic courts of the EU Member States, there is no
such obligation. In addition, if that were the meaning of Article 267, the Member States
would violate Article 267 by allowing commercial arbitration as well as arbitration under
extra-EU investment treaties, since arbitral tribunals constituted under these mechanisms

may be called upon to apply EU law and have no standing to request preliminary rulings.

In any event, as with Article 344, resorting to the principle of harmonious interpretation,
Article 267 might at most be understood as a carve out — as opposed to a complete
preclusion —- from the subject-matter scope of Article 8 of the BIT in respect of disputes
that relate to the interpretation of the EU Treaties, or the validity and interpretation of acts
of the EU institutions. Here again, the Tribunal leaves this issue open as the present dispute

does not fall in that category.

For these reasons, subject to the Respondent’s objection to the subject-matter jurisdiction,
which will be addressed next, the Tribunal concludes that at the time of the initiation of
these proceedings the BIT’s offer to arbitrate was standing and that a valid arbitration
agreement was formed when the Claimants accepted this offer, thus creating the consent

to arbitrate required under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.

SUBJECT-MATTER JURISDICTION

It is common ground that the Claimants’ farming business in Hungary constitutes an
investment within the meaning of the BIT and the ICSID Convention. The Parties disagree,
however, on whether the consent to arbitrate “any legal dispute arising under Article 6 [the
expropriation provision]” of the BIT extends to the present dispute and, in particular,
whether Hungary’s measures were capable of constituting an expropriation of the assets

constituting an investment.

qd) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent contends that the present dispute does not fall within the subject-matter
scope of the BIT’s dispute resolution provision, since none of the conduct alleged by the

Claimants is capable of constituting an expropriation.

First, although the Claimants’ farming business in Hungary indisputably constitutes an

180

investment,’*” the farm as a whole is not the subject of the expropriation claim, since the

Claimants continue to derive profit from it.

Second, the Lease cannot be the subject of an expropriation either, because it expired on
25 July 2014 on its own terms.'*! In this respect, the Respondent counters the Claimants’
submission that a new lease was formed by virtue of their exercise of the alleged pre-lease
right on 29 April 2014. At that time, so says the Respondent, the Claimants no longer
possessed a contractual pre-lease right as it was extinguished by the 2006 Lease

Amendment.

In any event, as the Respondent’s legal expert Professor Menyhard explains, the exercise
of a pre-lease right does not automatically result in the conclusion of a new lease. For that
result to ensue two conditions must be met: (i) the lessee who purports to exercise the pre-
lease right must demonstrate that he/she is capable of performing the lease under the terms

offered by the relevant third party and (ii) no lease contract must yet be concluded with a

'80 R-Rejoinder, § 253.
'81 2006 Lease Agreement, C-40, Section 4.

67

bona fide third party.'** The Claimants’ purported exercise of the pre-lease right on

29 April 2014 met none of these conditions. Thus, at most, Inicia only possessed a right to
seek damages from the NLA for breach of contract. !8?

254. Third, the alleged pre-lease right and right to claim damages for the conduct of the Tenders

do not constitute an investment under the BIT and are thus not capable of being

'84 and lacking intrinsic

expropriated. In particular, pre-lease rights, being non-transferable
value, do not constitute “assets” within the meaning of the definition of investment
contained in Article 1 of the BIT. In the proper context and in light of the object and
purpose of the BIT, the term “asset” should be understood to denote proprietary rights.
This understanding is confirmed by the arbitral jurisprudence!** and legal scholars. !*°

255. According to Hungary, the Claimants’ legal expert Professor Halmai errs when he declares
that pre-lease rights are property rights under Hungarian law. The Respondent argues that
under Hungarian constitutional law, “a pre-lease right does not belong to the core of the
content of a lease contract: it does not provide the right to acquire a lease.”'*? Thus, as
Professor Menyhard opines, even if a lease were to enjoy constitutional protection as
property under certain circumstances, it does not automatically follow that such protection

extends to pre-lease rights. '**

184 Section 373(4) of the 1959 Civil Code explicitly renders the transfer of a pre-emption right “null and void”. Under,
Section 373(5), pre-emption rights, and hence pre-lease rights, “do not pass onto successors”. The Parties’ experts are
in agreement that rules concerning pre-emption rights in the 1959 Civil Code apply mutatis mutandis to pre-lease
rights. Halmai Second ER, {| 16; Menyhard Second ER, 4/35.

In addition, continues the Respondent, the notice for the Tenders expressly stated that “no
pre-lease right can be exercised in connection with the tender.”'*? By taking part in the
Tenders, the Claimants accepted these terms. As the Constitutional Court held in a case
involving strikingly similar circumstances, a lease holder’s participation in the tender under

such terms undermines his alleged “entitlement to property” with respect to the land.!°°

The Respondent further submits that the alleged right to damages arising out of the Tenders
does not constitute an asset qualifying as an investment and being susceptible of being
expropriated. An unadjudicated claim, even if founded, has no ascertained monetary value
and is not transferable. Therefore it does not constitute assets. '°! In Emmis v. Hungary, the
ICSID tribunal determined that “[iJt is the asset itself — the property interest or chose in
action — and not its contractual source that is the subject of the expropriation claim.”!%? In
any event, the measures complained of are not an expropriation of a damages claim that
may result from the Claimants’ loss of the Land following the Tenders. Indeed, the
Claimants do not allege that Hungary passed legislation preventing them from pursuing
their claim for damages. These alleged claims are not therefore in dispute and cannot serve

as the basis for the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

Finally, the Respondent argues that the alleged pre-lease rights and the claims arising under
the Tenders do not qualify as investments within the meaning of the ICSID Convention, as
they do not bear the hallmarks of an investment.!*? They do not involve (i) a commitment
of resources, (ii) over a certain duration, (iii) involving a risk and (iv) making a contribution
to the host State’s economic development. The Claimants’ position that the term
“investment” has no independent meaning under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention is

untenable as demonstrated by a wealth of ICSID awards.

For these reasons, the Respondent maintains that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction

over the subject matter of the present dispute.

(2) The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants assert that the investment for present purposes is constituted of the leasehold
rights over the Land, which “comprise a lease (created as a result of the exercise of the
contractual pre-lease right on 29 April 2014), a contractual pre-lease right, a statutory pre-

lease right and a right to damages arising from the manipulated tender scoring”. !**

First, the Claimants counter the Respondent’s argument that the Lease expired on its own
terms. According to the Claimants, a new lease was created in April 2014, when Inicia
exercised the contractual pre-lease right.!°° The NLA’s conclusion of a competing lease
with the winners of the Tenders, who were acting in good faith, does not alter the fact that
under the rules governing the pre-emption and pre-lease rights, Inicia’s exercise of the pre-
lease right resulted in a new lease. In such case, as Professor Menyhard himself explains
in his scholarly writings, “the contracts concluded one after the other represent equal
ranking obligations.”!'*° If the obligor chooses to perform one of the conflicting contracts
to the detriment of the other, it owes damages to the creditor of the latter contract, being
understood that both contracts are valid and enforceable. The Respondent’s position that
Inicia’s exercise of the pre-lease right did not result in the creation of a new lease because
of the NLA’s choice to lease the Land to others is therefore unsupported by the applicable

tules. !97

Second, the Claimants argue that the definition of “investment” agreed between the parties
in the BIT governs as /ex specialis. This definition, according to the Claimants, “is both

the starting and the end point for the Tribunal’s determination of what constitutes an

‘investment’ for the purposes of these proceedings.”!°* The ICSID Convention is
deliberately silent on the definition of investment, so that the BIT parties could give their

own definition.

263. In any event, the Salini criteria to which the Respondent refers should not be regarded as
jurisdictional requirements but merely as typical characteristics of investments under the

ICSID Convention.

264. Third, for the Claimants, their leasehold rights fall within the definition of investment in
the BIT. In particular, the ordinary meaning of the word “asset” used in Article 1 of the
BIT is not limited to rights in rem. ICSID tribunals and scholars widely opine that in
personanm rights can also qualify as investments under categories such as “claims to money

> 199

and other assets or to any performance under contract having a financial value and thus

be expropriated.” Indeed, the Claimants’ right to use and collect the proceeds of the Land

01

pursuant to the Lease, as it arises from the Hungarian Civil Code,”°! is a claim under a

contract having financial value.

265. In any event, as Professor Halmai observes, the Claimants’ leasehold rights are in rem
rights that attract protection against expropriation under the functional approach to property
adopted by Hungarian constitutional law.°? The Constitutional Court has indeed held that
“the lessee’s interest in the certain and durable existence of the lease may qualify as a
property right under constitutional protection of property.””°> According to the Claimants,
it is precisely the constitutional law notion of property, as opposed to the more restrictive

civil law definition, that is relevant in the present case, since the function of constitutional

law in the municipal legal system is identical to that of international investment law.7° For
example, as a matter of civil law, licenses or other public law rights could not qualify as
property, even though they fulfil the traditional requirements of property. This approach is
shared by investment tribunals, which have held that “the notion of property or assets is
not to be narrowly circumscribed” and rights that are not traditionally regarded as in rem

rights should also be “protected from expropriation”.?°°

According to the Claimants, their leasehold rights have the functional characteristics of
property. First and foremost, they incorporate a right to possession, which is a fundamental
component of property opposable to the public as a whole, including the lessor himself.7°°
In addition, a lease is transferable, albeit by consent of the lessor.”°” It does not terminate
upon the death of the lessee and passes to the heirs.?°* Nor is the lease terminated by a
change of lessor.”” In any event, if the Respondent insists on a narrow category of in rem
rights, then the Claimants contend that the right to possess the Land that derives from the

Lease and the leasehold rights, is the subject of the expropriation claim.”!°

t7!! as well as

As for the pre-lease rights, the Civil Law Chamber of the Supreme Court
Hungarian scholars consider that a “pre-emption right based on statute necessarily has an
in rem effect, because, as a result of its very nature, it obliges the owner or right holder of
the asset at issue at all time.”?!* Both the Lease and the pre-lease right contained within the

Lease are thus investments capable of expropriation.

Fourth, the Claimants oppose the Respondent’s reliance on the Constitutional Court ruling
No. 3129/2018. In that case, the applicant leaseholder challenged the results of a tender by
which it had lost the leased land. The Constitutional Court dismissed the application on the
grounds that (i) the previous lease which was for a limited term had expired, (ii) that lease
could not have been transformed into a lease for an indefinite term, and (iii) the applicant
had no pre-lease right.?'? If anything, this reasoning implies that, had there been a pre-lease
right, the applicant would have held a constitutionally protected property right.?'* It is thus

unsurprising that the Respondent’s own expert does not rely on this decision.

Fifth, the Claimants assert that the pre-lease right is a transferable right that has an intrinsic
financial value. In particular, under the Civil Code, a pre-lease right can be transferred by
appointment of a third party to exercise the right. Such appointment differs from an
assignment, which, as the Respondent points out, is null and void.?'5 An appointment does
not require the owner’s consent, and often third parties are prepared to pay for the
appointment allowing them to exercise the pre-emption or pre-lease rights.7!° In addition,

a pre-lease right passes on to the legal successors of its holder together with the lease.

Finally, the Claimants’ loss of the Land as a result of the manipulated tender scores is
actionable under Hungarian law in the form of a damages claim, i.e., a chose-in-action,
which is a form of intangible property.?!’ This claim is a further right that can be

expropriated.

(3) Analysis
The scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is set out in Articles 25 of the ICSID Convention

and 8.1 of the BIT, which read as follows:

Article 25

The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute
arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State
(or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State
designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another
Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing
to submit to the Centre.

Article 8.1

Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit to the
International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes
(hereinafter referred to as "the Centre") for the settlement by
conciliation or arbitration under the Convention on the Settlement
of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States
opened for signature at Washington on 18 March 1965 any legal
dispute arising under Article 6 [expropriation provision] of this
Agreement between that Contracting Party and an investor of the
other Contracting Party concerning an investment of the latter in the
territory of the former.?!®
272. Three jurisdictional requirements related to the subject matter of the dispute derive from

these provisions:

= The dispute must arise directly out of an investment (Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention);

= The dispute must “concern the investment” (Article 8.1 of the BIT);

= The dispute must arise under Article 6, which is the expropriation provision
of the BIT (Article 8.1 of the BIT).

273. The first two requirements appear met. The Parties do not dispute that the Claimants’ farm
is an investment within the meaning of both the ICSID Convention and the BIT. The
present dispute, which concerns the alleged expropriation of the Claimants’ leasehold

rights, does arise out of that overall investment of the Claimants.

277.

It is well established in the investment treaty jurisprudence that, for purposes of subject-
matter jurisdiction, the existence of an investment must be assessed holistically. So, for

instance, in the words of the Holiday Inns v. Morocco tribunal:

[I]nvestment is accomplished by a number of juridical acts of all

sorts. It would not be consonant either with economic reality or with

the intention of the parties to consider each of these acts in complete

isolation from the others.”!°
Similarly, in Jnmaris v. Ukraine, the tribunal held that “[flor purposes of this Tribunal’s
jurisdiction [...] the Tribunal need only determine the existence of a covered investment in
the transaction as a whole.”””° In addition, in CSOB v. Slovak Republic, the tribunal found
that a dispute related to a loan agreement fell within its jurisdiction, since the loan was part
of a broader consolidation transaction, which qualified as an investment.?*! Had the
tribunal singled out the loan agreement, it would likely not have deemed it an investment

and would have declined jurisdiction.

In other words, the Tribunal should look at the investment as a whole and ascertain whether
the dispute has a sufficiently direct link with the overall investment. This is clearly the case

here, where the dispute arises directly out of the activities of the Farm.

As for the third requirement, Article 8 of the BIT requires that there be “a legal dispute
arising under Article 6”. According to the definition given by the PCIJ in Mavrommatis,
under international law “[a] dispute is a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict

of legal views or of interests between two persons.”??? The ICJ also defines a legal dispute

broadly as “a situation in which the two sides hold clearly opposite views concerning the

question of the performance or non-performance of certain treaty obligations.”””>

278. Hence, for the Tribunal to have subject-matter jurisdiction under Article 8 of the BIT, it
must be satisfied that the Parties are in “disagreement on a point of law or fact” concerning
Hungary’s performance or non-performance under Article 6 of the BIT. When assessing
this requirement, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to establish whether the Claimants’
assets have actually been expropriated. It is in the nature of a dispute that it may eventually

be decided against the Claimants.

279. Hungary argues that, by the time of the alleged measures, the Claimants no longer held any
leasehold rights capable of being expropriated. The Claimants object that they had
leasehold rights, which were in fact expropriated by the Respondent’s measures, including
the 2011 Amendment. For the purposes of its jurisdictional inquiry, the Tribunal need not
go further. This disagreement is precisely a “legal dispute arising under Article 6” over
which the Parties conferred jurisdiction to this Tribunal. In other words, the jurisdictional

requirement is fulfilled and the Tribunal must decide this dispute on the merits.

280. The Tribunal recognizes that its jurisdiction pursuant to Article 8 is restricted to reviewing
whether there is a breach of Article 6 of the BIT. The Tribunal will not inquire into breaches
of other rules of the BIT or international law. In other words, the effect of the subject-
matter limitation of Article 8 of the BIT is that the Tribunal will scrutinize the Respondent’s
measures through narrow lenses that limit its vision to alleged violations of Article 6. In
doing so, the Tribunal gives effective meaning to the subject-matter limitation of Article 8

of the BIT.

281. In conclusion, the disagreement on whether the Claimants held rights capable of being
expropriated and whether Hungary’s measures were expropriatory constitutes “a legal
dispute arising under Article 6” of the BIT. It thus falls within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction

pursuant to Article 8 of the BIT.

LIABILITY

The Parties dispute whether the Respondent’s conduct constituted an expropriation of the
Claimants’ investment. It is the Claimants’ position that Hungary acting through the NLA
expropriated Inicia’s leasehold rights. By contrast, the Respondent submits that the actions
of the NLA were not sovereign acts but were contractual in nature, and therefore not treaty
violations. It further opposes the expropriation claim on the ground that Inicia did not hold
rights capable of being expropriated, and that Hungary’s conduct was in any event an

exercise of regulatory police powers that is not compensable under international law.

THE CLAIMANTS’ POSITION

The Claimants submit that Hungary’s measures were sovereign acts attributable to
Hungary (1), which resulted in an expropriation of the Claimants’ leasehold rights,
including the contractual and statutory pre-lease rights as well as the new 20-year lease that
was concluded upon Inicia’s exercise of the pre-lease right in April 2014 (2). They object
to the Respondent’s police powers defense and argue that Hungary’s measures were
arbitrary and discriminatory, as they were motivated by political favoritism and thinly

veiled xenophobia (3).

qd) Hungary exercised sovereign powers

The Claimants first point out that one of the key acts which they challenge and which
resulted in the expropriation of the statutory pre-lease right was the 2011 Amendment,
which is a legislative Act passed by Parliament. As such, it indisputably constitutes

sovereign conduct attributable to Hungary.

Similarly, the Claimants’ physical eviction from the Land was carried out with direct
participation of the State. The contract that the NLA signed with the private security guards
shows that the NLA was contracting as a representative of the State.*4 Dr. Bitay, State

Secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture, confirmed in his witness statement that he

4 Contract with Private Security Guards, C-181.

77

286.

287.

288.

289.

personally arranged the physical eviction of the Claimants as the representative of the
State.5 By this admission, the State has embraced the NLA’s conduct as its own, pursuant

to Article 11 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility (the “ILC Articles”).

In addition, as Section 3 of the NLA Act shows, the NLA is nothing but an instrumentality

of the Hungarian Minister of Agriculture:

The minister in charge of the agricultural sector (hereinafter referred

to as “minister”) shall exercise ownership rights and discharge

obligations in connection with the National Land Fund in the name

and on behalf of the Hungarian State through the [NLA].7°
The NLA is set up as a so-called “central budgetary organ”, as opposed to a corporation,
foundation, association or other civil or corporate law entity.”?” Its officials are public
servants who are under a duty to make public disclosure about their finances, which are

reviewed by the State audit office.?7*

In addition, Hungary exercises close control over the NLA, which includes the right to
issue the Deed of Foundation and the bylaws of the NLA; to approve the bylaws of the
Council of the NLA; to appoint the Chairman and, upon the motion of the latter, the Deputy
Chairmen of the NLA; to appoint the Chairman and the Members of the NLA Council; to
approve the NLA’s yearly plan and to submit to the government for approval the NLA’s
mid-term strategic plan relating to the use and exploitation of the assets of the NLA; and
to decide upon the financial appropriations relating to the budget of the NLA. According
to the Claimants, there is thus no doubt that the NLA’s conduct is attributable to Hungary.

In addition, the Claimants contend that the management of State land is not a commercial
activity and that the Respondent itself admits it when arguing that the NLA’s conduct was

in line with the State’s social policy in the field of agriculture.??? Hungary cannot have it

both ways. If it intends to defend the NLA’s conduct on the basis that it formed part of the
implementation of the Respondent’s social policies, it cannot at the same time, so say the
Claimants, argue that the NLA merely engages in the commercial management of State
land. When the NLA defines the tender rules in order to implement the State landholding

policies, it exercises public authority and fulfils a public function.?°°

Therefore, in the Claimants’ submission, the cancellation of Inicia’s statutory pre-lease
right, the manipulation of the tender scores, the failure to publish or communicate the
winning bids to the Claimants, the purported transfer of possession of the Land in October
2014, and the physical eviction of the Claimants from the Land in July 2015 using private
armed security guards are far from being simple contractual breaches as they involve the

exercise of sovereign powers.”*!

(2) Hungary expropriated the contractual pre-lease right

The Claimants argue that the Respondent’s conduct amounted to expropriation of their
leasehold rights, including the contractual and statutory pre-lease rights and the renewed
20-year lease which they obtained in July 2014, as well as the statutory pre-lease right,

which the 2011 Amendment rendered nugatory.

In respect of the contractual pre-lease right, the Claimants request the Tribunal to discard
the Metropolitan Court’s decision of 7 December 2017, which erroneously held that the

2006 Lease Amendment granted no contractual pre-lease right to Inicia.

According to the Claimants, the Metropolitan Court’s judgment contradicted the practice
of other lower courts holding that the standard language of Section 5.1 of the 2006 Lease
Amendment did grant contractual pre-lease rights. Panel V of the Curia, Hungary’s highest
court, had sustained this interpretation in the so called Gyula case.”*? This is the same panel
that remanded Inicia’s case to the Metropolitan Court for lack of sufficient reasons. The

Metropolitan Court chose to rely on the interpretation given by another panel of the Curia,

Panel VI, and to declare that Section 5.1 of the Lease (as amended by the 2006 Lease
Amendment) did not provide a contractual pre-lease right. In doing so, the Metropolitan

Court failed to address several crucial arguments of Inicia.

In particular, the Metropolitan Court did not apply the rule contra proferentem set out in
Section 207(2) of the Civil Code. The NLA drafted the disputed pre-lease provision of the
2006 Lease Amendment, which it used as a standard term for numerous leases of State-
owned land. Thus, under the principle contra proferentem, any ambiguity in the pre-lease
provision had to be interpreted against the NLA. The very fact that different courts reached
different outcomes when interpreting the pre-lease provision proves the ambiguity. In
addition, the provision meets all the criteria for the application of Section 207(2) of the
Civil Code as (i) it was defined unilaterally by the NLA as a standard term; (ii) the NLA
used the same term for more than one lease agreement with different lessees; and (iii) Inicia

has not participated in an individual negotiation of the pre-lease provision.

In respect of the last element, the Claimants clarify that, although Inicia had an opportunity
to familiarize itself with the terms of the draft 2006 Lease Amendment, this does not mean
that the relevant contractual provisions were not standard terms for the purposes of the
contra proferentem rule. The requirement that the other party have an opportunity to
familiarize itself with the standard term is a condition for the standard term to become part
of the parties’ agreement (Section 205.B.1 of the Civil Code). It says nothing about whether
the term in question is a standard term (Section 205.A.1). A term is standard when it was
drafted by one party and not negotiated. This is the test for the application of the contra

proferentem rule.

In addition, according to the Claimants, if the Respondent is right that the 2006 wording of
the pre-lease provision removed the contractual pre-lease right that existed in the 1999
version of the Lease, then this removal must be regarded as a surprise term. According to
Section 205.B.2 of the Civil Code, surprise terms do not become part of the contract, unless
they have been specifically notified. The Claimants received no such notification.
Therefore, the removal of the contractual pre-lease right, if this indeed was the effect of

Section 5.1 of the 2006 Lease Amendment, meant that the change never became part of the

80

297.

298.

299.

agreement, and that the previous version of the contract that included the contractual pre-

lease right continued to apply.

Therefore, the Claimants validly exercised their contractual pre-lease right by a notice of
29 April 2014, resulting in the conclusion of a new lease agreement. The Respondent
refused to give effect to the valid exercise of the Claimants’ rights and eventually
physically evicted the Claimants from the Land. These actions constitute an expropriation
of the Claimants’ contractual pre-lease right and of the new lease that was entered into as

a result of the valid exercise of that right.

(3) Hungary expropriated the statutory pre-lease right

In any event, the Claimants argue that, even if they had no contractual pre-lease right, the
Respondent expropriated their statutory pre-lease right by passing the 2011 Amendment,
which prohibited its exercise in the context of NLA tenders. According to the Claimants,
the pre-lease right that the legislation conferred on lessees of agricultural land was a vested
right, guaranteeing legal certainty in order to induce investment. According to Professor
Halmai, the 2011 Amendment was unconstitutional as it “deprived lessees of their acquired

right to renew their leases without appropriate transitory rules or compensation”.?*?

The Claimants oppose Professor Menyhard’s interpretation of the Constitutional Court
Decision in Case No. 16/2015, where the court held that the 2011 Amendment did not
violate the principle of freedom of contract under the Constitution. According to the
Claimants, this ruling determined that the 2011 Amendment was not a violation of the right
to property, although this issue was not put to the court.?*+ The only two judges on the court
appointed before Fidesz’s return to power issued a joint dissent. They held that the statutory
pre-lease rights had been acquired “at the time of the execution of the lease contracts” and

that they “had a concrete, quantifiable value”, with the result that “depriving the lessees

from this right, as an already acquired right, without compensation violates the principle

of legal certainty, which is the theoretical basis of the protection of acquired rights”.”*>

(4) Hungary’s measures were not a lawful exercise of police powers

The Claimants dispute the Respondent’s police powers defense. According to them, the
doctrine of police powers applies in a limited set of circumstances and only in the context
of regulatory expropriation, which is a form of indirect expropriation. Here, the Respondent
directly expropriated the Claimants’ rights, both by removing the leasehold rights and by

physically seizing the Land. Thus, the doctrine of police powers is of no avail to Hungary.

In addition, so say the Claimants, Hungary’s measures served none of the grounds
justifying the exercise of police powers, as they were not taken to protect public order and
morality, human health or the environment. Even if they did, it would not absolve Hungary
from the obligation to pay compensation for the expropriation. As the tribunal in Pope &
Talbot v. Canada observed, “a blanket exception for regulatory measures would create a

gaping loophole in international protections against expropriation.”

In any event, for the Claimants, the Respondent cannot validly invoke the police powers
defense since it expropriated the Claimants’ leasehold rights in an arbitrary and
discriminatory manner. In particular, the 2011 Amendment nullified the pre-lease rights
only in respect of tenders of State-owned land and not private land. If the government really
aimed at promoting local and family farms, the policy should have applied to the leases of
private land as well. The reason why the Government rid itself of existing acquired rights
of incumbent lessees of State-owned land was political favoritism, a phenomenon which
the Claimants describe by reference to a book published by Professor Joszef Angyan, who
resigned from the government in protest in 2012. Professor Angyan writes about what he
calls the post-soviet mafia State set up by the Fidesz government. Among other examples,
Professor Angyan mentions that the sister-in-law of the Prime Minister’s daughter won
each of the tenders in which she bid because she was conveniently awarded much higher

“subjective points” than other bidders for her business plan despite her low “objective

points”, or that the Prime Minister’s childhood friend, Mr. Lérinc Mészaros, a former gas
fitter and now Hungary’s second richest man, owned no land in 2010 and now owns or
leases over 36,000 hectares of agricultural land through family members and related

companies.”*°

According to the Claimants, contrary to Hungary’s rhetoric that the land reform aimed at
making the land available to local family farmers, only a minority of leases were in fact
awarded to locals. The Respondent’s reliance on the fact that the average surface area of
the leases was 24.81 hectares is misleading. Behind this average there is an extremely
unequal distribution where the top 1.9% of the winners were awarded 24-25% of the land
and the top 0.4% of winners obtained 11% of the land. In addition, a significant portion of

the State-owned land was leased to favored individuals without a tender.?>7

The Claimants suggest that the Fidesz government deliberately acted with the covert
agenda of political favoritism. When the Parliament passed the 2011 Amendment, the
opposition harshly criticized the almost unfettered discretion that the NLA was accorded
in distributing State-owned land by using the subjective scoring element for the
“professional and commercial well-foundedness of the business plan”.?** Tellingly, the
Claimants lost the Tenders precisely due to their low scores in this entirely subjective

component of the scoring system.

By contrast, the owner of a sister farm similar to that of the Claimants, Mr. Lorant Szasko,
who is a founding member of the Fidesz party, won all 25 tenders that the NLA announced
on his land. Were it not for the high subjective scores he received for his business plan, he

would have lost 22 out of the 25 tenders.

Dismayed with the public scrutiny, on 25 May 2013, Hungary amended the NLA Decree
whereby, after awarding a lease, the NLA returned every bid to the bidders, with the

exception of the winning bid, thereby rendering it impossible to make any comparison of

the scoring of the bids.*? The Respondent also eliminated the requirement to aggregate the
landholdings of family members and related companies when calculating an individual’s
compliance with the legal maximum landholding, paving the way for the favored families

to appropriate large tracts of land.

In this respect, the Claimants allege that they “are aware, from their local knowledge, that
several of the ‘winners’ of their tenders use and/or own large tracts of agricultural land
through their families and related companies.”?*° In the document production phase, the
Tribunal ordered the Respondent to produce extracts from the Land Use Register and the
Land Registry showing the total agricultural land used and/or owned by these winners and
their families and companies. However, the Respondent failed to comply. According to the
Claimants, “[t]he inference to be drawn is obvious”.”4!

Furthermore, it is the Claimants’ submission that the government officials implementing
Hungary’s land policies did not veil their xenophobic motives, making statements such as:

99242

“we will protect Hungarian agricultural lands”**’ and “ensure that farmland, be it leased or

;243 “whoever owns the land owns the country”;

owned, remains with Hungarian people’

and referring to “the battle against foreign penetration”.*+°

Nor were the Claimants afforded due process in the course of the expropriation. Besides
being denied the opportunity to consult crucial tender documentation until ordered by this
Tribunal, the Respondent handled the Claimants’ physical eviction from the Land in

disregard of its own laws, without giving a fair notice and using private security guards

hired by the NLA, all despite the possessory protection orders that the Claimants had

obtained from the local courts.

THE RESPONDENT’S POSITION

The Respondent opposes the expropriation claim. It submits that one category of the
impugned measures — the alleged improper conduct of the Tenders — has no bearing on the
expropriation claim as the Claimants had no vested right that was at stake at the time of the
Tenders (1). For the Respondent, the expropriation claim also fails in respect of the alleged
pre-lease rights, since the contractual pre-lease rights ceased to exist as a result of the 2006
Lease Amendment (2) and the statutory pre-lease rights conferred no vested right subject
to expropriation (3). In any event, the Respondent argues that the 2011 Amendment was a

lawful exercise of police powers that is not compensable under international law (4).

qd) The Tenders are irrelevant to the expropriation claim

The Respondent points out that the manner in which the NLA conducted the Tenders has
no connection with the alleged expropriation, since the Claimants cannot seek damages for
the expropriation of a lease that Inicia did not hold. The Lease expired in July 2014 and
Inicia’s participation in the Tenders could thus not lead to the renewal of the Lease, but
only to the conclusion of a new lease, which admittedly did not happen. At the time of the
alleged “manipulation” of the Tenders, the Claimants neither held a lease; nor could they
claim an unconditional right to win the Tenders. Hence, according to the Respondent, even
assuming that the Tenders were biased to ensure that the Claimants lost, they could not

give rise to an expropriation claim.

In any event, the Respondent rejects the Claimants’ allegation that the Tenders were
manipulated. It argues that the circumstances on which the Claimants rely are either

unsupported by evidence or irrelevant. Specifically, it makes the following submissions:

= The NLA did not communicate the winning bids to Inicia because Inicia had
no legal right to receive full details of such bids. Inicia would only have been
entitled to communication if it had an exercisable pre-lease right, which it
did not. As for other tender documents, such as scoring sheets, Inicia and the
NLA were engaged in domestic litigation on Inicia’s right to access to that

85

313.

246

information. However, as a sign of good faith, the Respondent promptly
complied with the Tribunal’s order to produce the relevant documents in this
arbitration.“

The Claimants’ contention that they lost 15 out of the 16 Tenders on account
of artificially low scores received for its business plan is demonstrably false.
Even absent this component, which is worth 30 points out of a possible 105,
Inicia would have failed in at least eight tenders. The scoring sheets reveal
that in three instances, the winners prevailed against Inicia on all the other
scores too.747 In five further instances, Inicia’s bids were simply disqualified
as they did not attach all the required documentation.”

The Claimants purport to compare their farm with the farm of Mr. Szajko,
who won the tenders in respect of the land which his farm was leasing. They
suggest that Mr. Szajko’s farm was “similar” to theirs in “almost every
respect”.*4? There is, however, no evidence to support this assertion. In any
event, the fact that Mr. Szajko won an unrelated tender says nothing about
whether the Claimants lost the Tenders in an unfair manner.

Similarly, the Claimants do not substantiate their allegation that the winners
of the Tenders and their families hold large tracts of land. Even if
Mr. Hunter’s assertion that the winners lease hundreds or in some cases one
thousand hectares of land were true, this would not exceed the permitted
maximum landholding limit, which is 1,800 hectares.7*°

Therefore, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to dismiss the Claimants’ submission
concerning the conduct of the Tenders, as such conduct cannot constitute an expropriation

and the claim is in any event unsupported by evidence.

(2) Hungary did not expropriate the contractual pre-lease right

The Respondent submits that the Claimants had no contractual pre-lease right under the
2006 Lease Amendment and that, even if they had, the NLA’s denial of the exercise of that

right would constitute a breach of contract, not a violation of international law.

According to Hungary, while the 2006 Lease Amendment allowed Inicia to extend the
Lease for 10 years, it envisaged that Inicia would give up the contractual pre-lease right
that had figured in earlier versions of the Lease. In particular, it removed the language —
“[iJn respect of these plots of land the lessor grants a pre-lease right to the current tenant”

251

— present in Section 3.2 of the 1999 Lease Agreement~” and substituted it with Section 5.1

of the 2006 Lease Amendment, which reads as follows:

With regard to the plots of land subject to the lease, the Tenant

enjoys a pre-emption right and a pre-lease right that may be

exercised in accordance with the applicable laws effective at all

times, and which may not be registered in the Land Registry.?*
In 2017, the Metropolitan Court — a court with exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising
under the 2006 Amendment?® — ruled unequivocally, so says the Respondent, that this
language did not confer a contractual pre-lease right to Inicia.7** As a consequence, only
circumstances akin to denial of justice could empower the Tribunal to reopen this ruling.
The Claimants do not allege such circumstances, but instead re-argue their case before this
Tribunal on the ground that the Metropolitan Court’s judgment is “not persuasive”.?>> A
treaty tribunal cannot assume a mandate of a global court of appeal, purporting to correct

the local courts’ interpretations of municipal law.

317. For the Respondent, the Claimants’ unsupported contention that Inicia had filed a request
for extraordinary review of the judgment of the Metropolitan Court to the Curia does not
alter this analysis. As a matter of Hungarian law, a judgment of the Metropolitan Court is
not subject to appeal.7*° While it can be subject to annulment, the annulment proceedings
do not stay enforcement of the Metropolitan Court’s judgment. As a result, the judgment
must be deemed to carry res judicata effects.?*”

318. In any event, so argues the Respondent, the Metropolitan Court’s interpretation of Section
5.1 of the 2006 Lease Amendment is fully tenable. The Claimants’ contrary arguments
based on the rules contra proferentem and against surprise terms do not withstand scrutiny.
Hungary does not contest that these provisions apply to standard contracts. However, as
the opinion PK 2/2011 of the Curia holds, a contract is not a standard contract “if the
consumer had a real opportunity to modify the contract term, meaning the party
establishing the contract term in advance has actually made it possible for him to consider
its content and to enforce his will in this regard.”?°*

319. According to the Respondent, it is undisputed that Inicia received a draft 2006 Lease
Amendment in advance of the signature. Yet, it did not use this opportunity to seek changes
to the contract, unlike other lessees who concluded their leases contemporaneously. For
instance, the lessee involved in the Gyula litigation succeeded in including the clause

providing for the pre-lease right into the amended lease contract.’ Consequently, the

256 Pursuant to Section 218 of the 1952 Hungarian Code of Civil Procedure (the “1952 CPP”), a decision that cannot
be appealed becomes final upon its publication. Sections 233 and 233A of the 1952 CCP provide an exhaustive list of
decisions subject to appeal. This list does not include the judgments of a court of second instance, such as the judgment
of 7 December 2017 rendered by the Metropolitan Court (See Extracts from the 1952 Hungarian Code of Civil
Procedure, R-33).

257 Pursuant to Section 275 of the 1952 CPP, extraordinary review by the Curia can lead to the annulment of a final
decision. However, Section 273(3) of the 1952 CPP specifies that a petition for review does not have the effect of
staying enforcement of the decision subject to review (See Extracts from the 1952 Hungarian Code of Civil Procedure,
R-33).

258 Opinion PK 2/2011 of the Supreme Court, R-34. This decision was rendered by the Court in the context of consumer
contracts (private individuals). The rational applies mutatis mutandis and, even so more, to contracts concluded with
business entities.

259 RCM, 4 448. The relevant provision in the Gyula litigation granted the pre-lease right as follows “the lessee
acknowledges that the pre-emption and pre-lease right provided under this amendment to the contract, and further by
law”, See Gyula litigation documents: Judgment of First Instance (No. 1.P.20.249/2015/7) dated 16 June 2015, C-

323.

terms of the 2006 Lease Amendments were open to negotiation. The Claimants’ reliance

on the result of the Gyu/a litigation is misplaced.

In any event, the invocation of the rule contra proferentem is inapposite for yet another
reason. According to the Respondent, this rule applies when contractual terms are
ambiguous. Section 5.1 of the 2006 Lease Amendment clearly refers to a pre-lease right
that “may be exercised in accordance with the applicable laws effective at all times”. These
words unambiguously refer to the statutory pre-lease right. The fact that the Parties diverge
on the interpretation of the provision is not sufficient to conclude that a provision is

ambiguous.

Similarly, in respect of the rule on surprise terms embodied in the Civil Code, the
Respondent contends that, even if Section 5.1 were to be regarded as a surprise term, the
only consequence would be that it would be unenforceable. It would not mean that the pre-
lease provision of the 1999 Lease Agreement would be reinstated. And, even if Section 3.2
of the 1999 Lease Agreement were reinstated, that lease and any pre-lease right it
established would in any event have expired in 2009, i.e. well before Inicia purported to

exercise the pre-lease right in 2014.

For these reasons, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to reject the Claimants’ attempt to
re-litigate issues of national law which the Hungarian courts with exclusive jurisdiction

have already resolved.

Finally, Hungary argues that even if the Tribunal were to find that Inicia was entitled to
the contractual pre-lease right, the NLA’s refusal to comply with this right would constitute
no more than a contractual breach. Hungary has not passed any legislative or administrative
measures prohibiting the exercise of a contractual pre-lease right. The Claimants’ argument
that the NLA had the status and function of a State organ is misconceived. Status and
function of a given body can be relied upon to determine whether an entity is an emanation

of a State and whether its acts are attributable to the State. However, they cannot establish

whether the acts complained of in a particular instance were committed in the exercise of
sovereign power. Numerous treaty tribunals have clearly stated that a simple denial of a
contractual right by a State party amounts to a breach of contract, as opposed to an

internationally wrongful act.?©

The NLA’s denial of Inicia’s alleged contractual pre-lease right arose in the course of
ordinary business between a landlord and a tenant. The same observation applies to the

alleged “‘attempt to take back possession of the land on 25 July 2014,’ the purported

‘transfer of possession of the land in October 2014’ and the ‘physical eviction [...] using

without resorting to government prerogatives. Its conduct is therefore not subject to

scrutiny under the BIT.

(3) Hungary did not expropriate the statutory pre-lease right

The Respondent further counters the Claimants’ allegation that it expropriated Inicia’s
statutory pre-lease right. It submits that the statutory pre-lease right is not a vested right
under international or Hungarian law. Instead, it is a right conferred by general legislation
which can change based on policy considerations and bear circumstances. In this context,
it is undisputed that the Claimants never received any assurances that the legislation would

remain unchanged.

The Respondent refers to decisions of investment treaty tribunals, according to which, in
the absence of specific assurances, the State retains the power to change its laws.”°? The
distinction that the Claimants draw arguing that the present case is a direct not an indirect

expropriation is unavailing. The 2011 Amendment did not directly remove the statutory

pre-lease right; it only limited the exercise of that right in connection with the tenders

organized by the NLA. Thus, it was not a measure of direct expropriation.

327. The Constitutional Court of Hungary confirmed that the statutory pre-lease right is not a
vested right. It held that statutory pre-lease right holders must consider “that the law may
change.” The Claimants and their legal expert Professor Halmai purport to rebut this
settled law by reference to the principles of “legal certainty” and “lawful expectations”
arguing that “the 2011 Amendment was unfair and unjustified (and therefore
unconstitutional).”? This does little to show that Hungary’s measures were expropriatory.
The Contracting States to the BIT limited the Tribunal’s mandate to deciding disputes
exclusively in respect of expropriatory conduct, and the Tribunal ought to respect this

undisputed limitation.

(4) Hungary exercised police powers

328. The Respondent contends that the 2011 Amendment was a regulatory measure carried out
within the bounds of its police powers. It opposes the Claimants’ argument that the doctrine
of police powers applies only to indirect expropriations on two grounds. First, numerous
tribunals have referred to the police powers doctrine when assessing the existence of a
direct expropriation.*% Second, the 2011 Amendment was not a direct expropriation as it
did not remove or invalidate Inicia’s statutory pre-lease right. It merely restricted its
exercise in the context of NLA tenders. The defense of police powers is therefore available

to the Respondent.

relevant standard.”

The Respondent strongly denies the Claimants’ allegations that Hungary’s organs,
including the government and the legislature, had ulterior motives of political favoritism
and xenophobia with respect to the land reform. When implementing the land reform,
Hungary states that it acted in pursuit of the common welfare objective of “promoting the
establishment of viable family farms”.°®° As the primary means to implement its newly
defined landholding policies, Hungary introduced a tender procedure in 2010. The system
of statutory pre-lease rights was incompatible with the tender system because it prevented
the redistribution of the State-owned land on the basis of the criteria established for the
tender. This incompatibility was admitted by Professor Angyan, the former politician on
whose politically-biased 2014 report the Claimants rely.°’ The 2011 Amendment, which
proscribed the exercise of statutory pre-lease rights in the context of the NLA tenders,

evidently aimed at implementing Hungary’s general welfare objectives.

In addition, the Parliament passed the 2011 Amendment in accordance with standard
legislative procedures, involving multiple rounds of consultation and the implementation

of many of the opposition’s comments. As a result, the opposition supported the bill.7°°

For the Respondent, the Claimants’ contentions of manipulation of the Tenders are also
unfounded. The report of the Supervisory Committee of the NLA, which the Claimants
invoke, concluded that the tender evaluation system was in line with Hungarian law and

landholding policy.”

Professor Angyan’s bold statement that the tenders did not achieve the stated public policy
objectives does not help the Claimants’ case either. While the land reform may not have
been as successful as the government had hoped, it still achieved important results. In

particular, the number of tenants rose drastically from 600 in 2010 to 7500 in 2015. Nearly

85% of these new tenants were natural persons, and 21% of them were under the age of 40.

The average size of the land awarded by tender was 24.81 hectares.?”°

333. As to the 16 Tenders in which Inicia participated, Inicia’s low scores for the subjective
business plan element did not determine the outcome. In line with the policy objectives of
the land reform, the Land was awarded to 16 farmers all of whom were locals. Six of the
winners were family farmers, six were individual entrepreneurs and four were primary
producers. Moreover, seven winners were young farmers and five were new entrants.?”!

The Claimants supply no evidence that the winners of the Tenders were politically favored

individuals affiliated with the Fidesz party or otherwise related to the government.

334. Similarly unsupported is the Claimants’ contention that Hungary abolished the maximum
landholding limitation applicable to family members in order to benefit families with
connections to politicians. According to the Respondent, this abolishment contributed to
the government’s aim of keeping local farmers, who often belong to the same family, from

migrating to the cities and abandoning the agricultural sector.?”*

335. The Claimants’ allegations of discrimination should also be dismissed, so pleads Hungary.
None of their brandish allegations of xenophobic motives relate to the 2011 Amendment.
As for the Claimants’ assertion that the 2011 Amendment “only applied in the context of
tenders for leases of State-owned, and not privately owned, land”,”” the Respondent points
out that there are objective differences between State-owned land and leases for privately-
owned land, which cannot therefore be compared. In particular, leases of State-owned land
can be attributed only by means of a public tender and benefit from significantly lower

rental fees.?”4

Finally, Hungary challenges the Claimants’ allegation that Inicia’s eviction did not follow
due process. At the time of the eviction, the Claimants no longer had possessory title to the
land. Thus, the NLA acting in its capacity of a landlord secured the eviction after giving
multiple notices to Inicia to vacate the Land. As Professor Menyhard explains, the orders
that the Claimants had obtained from local authorities did not create a legal title to
possession.?”> In any event, even assuming that the eviction of Inicia had breached these
orders, that would at most constitute a violation of a temporary procedural right — not a
taking of the leasehold right. In addition, the intervention of the private security guards did
not occur until after the Pest District Court had rejected Inicia’s claims to the pre-lease
rights in their entirety in October 2014.?”° The claim of a breach of due process is therefore

without merit.

For these reasons, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to declare that the 2011
Amendment was a valid exercise of police powers and therefore did not constitute a

compensable expropriation.

ANALYSIS

The Claimants allege an expropriation of their leasehold rights. According to them, these
rights include the following four categories: (i) the contractual pre-lease right under the
Lease, (ii) the renewed lease agreement created by Inicia’s exercise of the contractual pre-
lease right through its letter of 29 April 2014,” (iii) the right to damages arising out of the
NLA’s manipulation of the Tenders, and (iv) the statutory pre-lease right, the exercise of

which was prevented by the 2011 Amendment.

In its analysis of liability, the Tribunal will first review Hungary’s measures in terms of
expropriation of the statutory pre-lease right (1). Given the conclusion which it will reach,
in respect of such right, it will dispense with the analysis of the alleged expropriation of

the remaining categories of the purported leasehold rights. Thereafter, the Tribunal will

assess whether the 2011 Amendment constituted a non-compensable exercise of Hungary’s
police powers (2). Finally, it will turn to the lawfulness of the expropriation under Article

6 of the BIT (3).

qd) Did the 2011 Amendment expropriate the statutory pre-lease right?

It is common ground between the Parties that the 2011 Amendment prohibited the exercise
of statutory pre-lease rights in relation to the NLA tenders. The Parties also agree that, at
the time when the statute was passed, Inicia had a valid statutory pre-lease right under
Hungarian law. The Respondent argues, however, that such statutory pre-lease right is not

capable of being expropriated.

The Parties made it clear in their answers to the Tribunal’s questions that international law
governs the question whether a particular right can be expropriated.?’* By contrast, the
existence and content of the right is subject to national law. Thus, while the expert evidence
provided by the Parties in respect of rights capable of being expropriated within the
meaning of Hungarian constitutional law may be helpful by analogy, it is not dispositive.
The Tribunal must conduct an analysis under the BIT and international law in order to

determine what types of rights or interests are protected under Article 6 of the BIT.

Article 6 of the BIT prohibits the expropriation of “the investments of investors”, except
for a public purpose, with due process, in a non-discriminatory manner and against
compensation. Article 1 of the BIT in turn defines the term “investment” as “every kind of
asset connected with economic activities which has been acquired since 31 December
1972”.?”? In this context, the Respondent argues that “a right that is not vested or acquired
as a matter of International Law is not susceptible of expropriation.””*° Be this as it may,
at the time of the 2011 Amendment, the Claimants did hold a vested right in the form of

the statutory pre-lease right, as will be further addressed below.

The doctrine of acquired or vested rights is well recognized in international and municipal

laws. In the words of the Aramco tribunal:

The principle of respect of acquired rights is one of the fundamental

principles both of Public International Law and of the municipal law

of most civilized States.**!
The term expropriation used in Article 6 of the BIT should be interpreted in light of this
doctrine as mandated by Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT. The doctrine suggests that, while
the State may change general statutes based on its policy decisions, where the statute
provided for a possibility of acquiring rights with economic value and a private party
availed itself of this possibility, subsequent regulatory changes must respect that vested
right.?*? As an example, a State can well change the rules applicable to pension
entitlements. However, if an individual has acquired a right to pension entitlements under
the existing statute, e.g. because he or she has reached the relevant retirement age, the

detrimental legislative change must comply with this vested right.

EnCana v. Ecuador, to which both Parties referred in the closing submissions, is helpful in
this respect. There, the tribunal recognized that, although a State is free to change its laws,

it may be held liable for expropriation if it retrospectively invalidates vested rights:

In the Tribunal’s opinion, a law which cancels a liability the State
already has to an investor [...] is capable of amounting to
expropriation. The right under the law of the host State to refunds of
VAT in respect of the past acquisition of goods and services is a
material benefit, and it does not matter whether refunds take the
form of tax credits or rights to actual payment of the amount due.
There is an important distinction here between a law which changes
the incidence of taxation in respect of future transactions and one
which seeks to do so retrospectively. If the State wishes to provide
by law that in respect of future transactions there is liability to VAT
and no right to a refund, then prima facie at least that falls within

the scope of its normal prerogative to determine and vary the

incidence of a tax. But once a right to a refund has accrued in respect

of past transactions (so that all that remains is the question of

accounting for receipts and payments) the corresponding right to be

paid is capable of falling within the broad scope of “amounts yielded

by an investment”, and it does not matter that the right arises under

the public law of the State concerned.?*>
The EnCana tribunal made a crucial distinction between rights (to VAT refunds) that had
accrued and rights that had not yet accrued at the time when Ecuador passed the 2004 Act
that suppressed these rights. According to the tribunal, “it is for Ecuador to determine for
the future the regime of its tax law”. However, the “position is different with respect to the
period before 2004,”?* as the rights that accrued prior to the legislative change attracted

protection from uncompensated taking.

Throughout its written and oral submissions, Hungary heavily relied on the fact that the
statutory pre-lease right was a right provided by general legislation, which the State could
modify for policy reasons. The State’s power to change its laws based on its policy
determinations is unquestioned. This power must, however, be exercised in compliance
with the international obligations of the State, including those in the field of the protection
of investments. International law, and in particular the non-expropriation standard
contained in Article 6 of the BIT, provides a certain degree of protection for vested rights.
If a general statute gives private parties a possibility to acquire rights of economic value,
changes to that legislation should not affect rights that had already been acquired under the
statute. In this sense, the doctrine of vested rights is closely intertwined with the principles

of non-retroactivity and legal certainty.

This said, a distinction must be drawn between a statute conferring mere privileges or
powers on private parties and the latter’s subsequent exercise of these powers by acquiring
what can be regarded as a vested right, i.e. an entitlement that is correlated with duties of

a specific counterpart.

349. The 1994 Arable Land Act provided the right (better termed a power) for any eligible
person to enter into a lease agreement and thereby acquire a statutory pre-lease right. This
power is not itself a vested right or an asset, and therefore the State could in principle
change it without compensation.”** In turn, once a private party availed itself of this power

and entered into a lease agreement, that party will hold a vested right.

350. Thus, while the Respondent was at liberty to change its laws and remove or otherwise alter
the provision allowing to enter into a lease agreement and acquire a statutory pre-lease
right, the private parties who had previously availed themselves of this possibility by

entering into specific lease agreements had vested rights that ought to have been respected.

351. It is undisputed that the 2011 Amendment contained no transitory arrangements, nor did it

exempt pre-lease rights of incumbent lessees.

352. The question that remains is whether the statutory pre-lease right was among the vested
rights that a lessee acquired by entering into a lease agreement. In the affirmative, the 2011
Amendment would be deemed expropriatory, because it prevented the Claimants from
exercising their statutory pre-lease right and failed to exempt vested pre-lease rights under

incumbent leases.

353. The Claimants’ legal expert Professor Halmai opined that the statutory pre-lease right was
a vested right as of the conclusion of the relevant lease agreement.**° He explained his
opinion in reference to the legislative intent behind the statutory pre-lease right, which was
to induce long-term investment in the agricultural sector and, for that purpose, to enhance
legal security for the lessees. As for the Respondent’s legal expert Professor Menyhard, he
called the pre-lease right a vested right in his expert report.7*” However, at the Hearing, he

preferred not to elaborate, given his expertise in private law.?**

Professor Halmai’s opinion is substantiated by the dissenting opinion of a judge of the
Constitutional Court, who reasoned that, by passing the 2011 Amendment, “the legislator
deprived the above lessees [i.e. the lessees that had lease agreements at the time of the entry
into force of the 2011 Amendment] of a right with a property value that they acquired
already at the time of the execution of the lease contracts”.°*? Notably, the majority of the
court did not address whether the 2011 Amendment could amount to an expropriation of
vested rights in violation of the right to property, since this question as such was not before

the court.

The opinion of Professor Halmai appears convincing. If one bears in mind that enterprises
and foreign nationals are barred from owning agricultural land in Hungary, land lease
agreements largely fulfil the same functions as property rights. As the Claimants explain,
investments in the agricultural sector take time. In order to encourage long-term
investments, the 1994 Arable Land Act provided for a pre-lease right, but this right could
only induce long-term investments if the lessees could rely on it when entering into lease

agreements.

It is certainly true that the exercise of the pre-lease right is subject to conditions. However,
as Professor Halmai rightly notes, the conditional nature of a right does not negate its
existence or its nature as a vested right. For instance, as the Respondent observed, when
making a long-term investment in reliance on the lease and the pre-lease right, the lessee
should consider the possibility that, upon the expiry of the lease, the owner may decide to
use the land, in which case the pre-lease right could not be exercised. While this is true,
Mr. Hunter correctly remarked that the risk that the State would decide to become a farmer
instead of leasing its land was negligible.” And indeed, it is not the materialization of this
risk that made the exercise of the pre-lease right impossible for Inicia. It was the legislative
act that proscribed the exercise of pre-lease rights, without providing exceptions for lessees

that had already acquired the pre-lease right under the incumbent lease agreements.

The Respondent further points to the pre-lease clause in the 2006 Lease Amendment,
according to which a pre-lease right “may be exercised in accordance with the applicable
laws effective at all times”.?°! This language subjects the exercise of the contractual pre-
lease right to the applicable law. It has no bearing, however, on the statutory pre-lease right,

the exercise of which is restricted by the 2011 Amendment in the following terms:

In case of leasehold of rural land or farm, a pre-lease right arising

from legal regulations may not be exercised.?°”
The nature and scope of the statutory pre-lease right must be assessed by reference to the
relevant statute, i.e. the 1994 Arable Land Act. Pursuant to Section 21 of that Act, a lessee
of a usufructuary lease was entitled to a pre-lease right.2”* As described above, given the
purpose and context of this statutory provision, the entitlement to and the reliance on the
pre-lease right arose upon the conclusion of a usufructuary lease agreement. Thus, Inicia’s
entitlement to the statutory pre-lease right existed by virtue of Section 21 of the 1994
Arable Land Act and of the Lease. The contractual pre-lease clause does not alter the nature
and scope of the statutory pre-lease right. Indeed, even if the 2006 Lease Amendment
contained no pre-lease provision at all, Inicia would still benefit from the statutory pre-
lease right under Section 21 of the 1994 Arable Land Act because it had entered into a

usufructuary lease agreement.

The Parties have also debated whether the pre-lease right is a right in rem or not. That
debate seems largely inapposite for the purposes of this analysis. As the Parties’ legal
experts confirmed, the scope of the rights protected from expropriation is not congruent
with the closed list of in rem rights in civil law.?°+ While the dichotomy between in rem
and in personam rights has its place in determining the rights and obligations of private
parties vis-a-vis one another, the prohibition of uncompensated expropriation is a rule
restricting the State authority towards private parties. Because of the different legal

functions involved, the civil law dichotomy should not be mechanically transposed into

public law. Indeed, it would be excessively formalistic and not consonant with economic
reality, if the BIT protected a usufruct-holder from an uncompensated taking, while at the
same time withholding that protection from a lessee with a pre-lease right for the sole fact

that such right is not in rem.

It does not appear disputed that the function of the statutory pre-lease right was to guarantee
stability and legal certainty for lessees of agricultural land, and thus induce long-term
investments. In a situation where corporations and foreign nationals were barred from
owning agricultural land, the pre-lease right brought stability of the lease that was viewed
as a functional alternative to ownership. For these reasons, the Tribunal shares Professor
Halmai’s opinion that, due to the pre-lease right, the lease fulfilled the same function as
ownership in terms of the investor’s expectations of legal certainty and stability. As a
result, the pre-lease right must be deemed to benefit from the protection against
uncompensated State interference. In other words, a deprivation of already vested pre-lease
rights should have been accompanied by compensation even if the State acted with a

legitimate public purpose, evenhandedly and with procedural propriety.

Finally, the Parties have discussed whether the statutory pre-lease right has a financial
value.?*> It seems evident that a right, albeit a conditional one, to extend a lease agreement
has a financial value as the right-holder is in an economically more advantageous position
than a lessee without a similar right. The financial value of a pre-lease right can also be
seen from the market practice, whereby incumbent lessees sometimes appoint third persons
to exercise the pre-lease right in their stead in exchange for consideration.>”° The fact that
the value of the pre-lease right may be difficult to quantify does not mean that the right
lacks value. The Respondent’s own valuation expert sought to convince the Tribunal that
the value of the pre-lease right could be established independently by using freehold

ownership as a proxy.?°”

and other assets or to any performance under contract having a financial value”, CL-1.

364.

For these reasons, while Hungary was at liberty to remove or otherwise alter the statutory
pre-lease provision contained in the 1994 Arable Land Act in a prospective manner, such
a change should not have applied retrospectively to already vested rights. Or else, the State
should have provided compensation. Specifically with respect to the Claimants’
investment, the 2011 Amendment resulted in the expropriation of the statutory pre-lease
right that Inicia had acquired pursuant to the 1994 Arable Land Act by entering into the

Lease.

Having reached this conclusion, the Tribunal dispenses with analyzing whether the
Respondent also expropriated Inicia’s contractual pre-lease right, or whether such right
was extinguished as a result of the 2006 Lease Agreement. Subject to the police powers
defense addressed in the next section, the finding that Hungary expropriated Inicia’s
statutory pre-lease right suffices to hold Hungary liable for the harm caused to the
Claimants as a result of the loss of the Lease. Had the 2011 Amendment carved out the
pre-lease rights of incumbent lessees, Inicia would in all likelihood have exercised that
right and kept its Lease. Therefore, a finding that the contractual pre-lease right was also
expropriated would have no impact on the assessment of damages. Nor would the claims
concerning the alleged manipulation of tender results have an independent impact on the
quantification of the loss. Therefore, for reasons of judicial economy and procedural

efficiency, the Tribunal will dispense with addressing these additional issues.

(2) Was the 2011 Amendment a non-compensable regulatory measure?

Investment treaty jurisprudence recognizes that, in certain circumstances, a bona fide
exercise of the State’s right to regulate is exempt from the duty to provide compensation.?°*
That being said, creating an unqualified exception from the duty of compensation for all

regulatory measures would hardly be compatible with the language of non-expropriation

provisions of investment treaties, such as Article 6 of the BIT, which require compensation
for direct and indirect expropriation even if the measures at issue are for a public purpose,
non-discriminatory and compatible with due process of law. As the tribunal in Pope &
Talbot v. Canada warned, such blanket exception “would create a gaping loophole in

international protections against expropriation.”??

There is no comprehensive test that may be used to distinguish regulatory expropriation,
for which compensation is required, from an exercise of police or regulatory powers, which
does not give rise to a duty of compensation. In the words of Saluka v. Czech Republic,
“international law has yet to identify in a comprehensive and definitive fashion precisely
what regulations are considered ‘permissible’ and ‘commonly accepted’ as falling within

the police or regulatory power of States and, thus, non-compensable.”>°°

This being so, a review of investment awards shows that measures annulling rights of the
investor — as in the present case — can be exempt from the otherwise applicable duty of
compensation only in a narrow set of circumstances. These circumstances can be

categorized in two broad groups:

= First, the exemption from compensation may apply to generally accepted
measures of police powers that aim at enforcing existing regulations against
the investor’s own wrongdoings, such as criminal, tax and administrative
sanctions, or revocation of licenses and concessions.*”' It is evident that the
2011 Amendment does not pertain to this group.

= The second group consists of regulatory measures aimed at abating threats
that the investor’s activities may pose to public health, environment or public

order.°*** This line of case law relates to measures such as the prohibition of

harmful substances, tobacco plain packaging, or the imposition of

emergency measures in times of political or economic crises. The 2011

Amendment does not fall in this group either.
It rather emerges from the record that the 2011 Amendment was inspired by Hungary’s
decision to change its agricultural land holding policy. While Hungary was fully entitled
to change its policies, in doing so it was required to respect vested rights. In other words,
it is not immediately apparent why this policy change - which purportedly benefited
Hungarian society as a whole - should have been carried out at the expense of the
Claimants’ vested rights. Unlike in the above two groups of situations, there is no rationale
that would justify exempting Hungary from its duty to pay compensation under Article 6

of the BIT.

(3) Was the expropriation lawful?

It is undisputed that Hungary has not compensated the Claimants for the expropriation of
their statutory pre-lease right. Thus, the expropriation is unlawful for lack of compensation.
Whether an expropriatory measure is unlawful for additional reasons may have an impact

on the calculation of damages in certain instances.

Most importantly, a finding that expropriation is unlawful for reasons other than the lack
of compensation may entitle a claimant investor to request compensation for the value of
the expropriated asset on an ex post basis, i.e. on the date of the award.*” Yet, in the present
case, the Claimants seek the value of their leasehold rights ex ante, i.e. as of July 2015,

which is the date of their eviction from the Land.

They do so by subtracting the value of the Farm without the Lease from the value of the
Farm with the Lease. This approach seems to yield the value of the expropriated pre-lease

rights. Indeed, without expropriation of their pre-lease right, the Claimants would in all

likelihood have renewed the lease by matching the offers made by the winners of the
Tenders. The Respondent’s valuation expert concedes that “the lost value of the leasehold
rights could be quantified by comparing the value of the Farm with and without those
rights. In other words, the difference in the value of the Farm with and without the leasehold
rights is equal to the lost value of those rights.”*°* Therefore, the Claimants do not appear
to be claiming more than “the fair market value of the investment expropriated immediately
before the expropriation”, which is the compensation standard for lawful expropriations
under Article 6 of the BIT. Thus, in this respect, it makes no practical difference whether

the expropriation is unlawful for reasons other than lack of compensation.

Another aspect of the valuation for which a finding of lawfulness may theoretically make
a difference is pre- and post-award interest. However, Article 6 of the BIT requires an
award of interest “at a normal commercial rate”. As explained in the relevant section below,
even if the principle of full reparation is applied, the Claimants would not be entitled to

more than a normal commercial rate of interest in the circumstances of the present case.

Therefore, the Tribunal comes to a conclusion that it may dispense with determining

whether the expropriation was unlawful for reasons other than lack of compensation.

QUANTUM

The Parties are in dispute about the calculation of the damages allegedly suffered by the
Claimants as a result of the Respondent’s conduct. Each of them relied on a valuation

expert to support its position.

THE CLAIMANTS’ POSITION

The Claimants seek compensation for the expropriation of the pre-lease right. They rely on
a valuation expert report by Mr. James Gilbey of Mazars LLP, who primarily valued the
expropriated leasehold by comparing the actual value of the Farm (without the leasehold

rights) with the but-for value of the Farm (with the leasehold rights).>°°

More precisely,
Mr. Gilbey valued the leasehold rights by reference to the stream of profits that those rights
could have been expected to produce for the Claimants’ farming business if they had not
been expropriated.*” The but-for scenario thus assumes that the Lease would be renewed

for 20 years starting from 2014.°

As for the valuation date, Mr. Gilbey considered that the expropriation crystalized in July
2015, which is the time of the physical eviction of the Claimants. He thus took July 2015

as the valuation date.

Further, the Claimants seek to rebut the Respondent’s criticism that Mr. Gilbey calculated
the but-for value of the Farm on an ex ante basis, i.e. in July 2015, while he assessed the
actual value ex post. According to the Claimants, for the actual value, Mr. Gilbey used July
2015 as a valuation date, but he used “actual cash-flows for the years up to and including
2017”, instead of projecting hypothetical cash flows from 2015 on.*° For the event that

the Tribunal accepts the Respondent’s criticism, Mr. Gilbey prepared a “secondary”

valuation, which only takes into account ex ante data for both the but-for and the actual

values of the farm.

377. The Claimants also reject the Respondent’s allegation that they have failed to mitigate the
loss. They point out that the burden of proof is on the Respondent to demonstrate that there
were reasonable and economically feasible alternative actions available to them.*° For
them, the Respondent failed to discharge this burden, due to the fact that they have in reality
engaged in multiple efforts to continue their farming business in Hungary. Yet, despite
these efforts, their Farm lost significant value. Specifically, the Claimants stress the

following mitigating actions:

= Mr. Hunter described how the Claimants sought to lease replacement land
from private individuals by publishing an advertisement and an article in a
local newspaper.*!° They only received an offer for 15 hectares of land
50 km away. In any event, the privately-owned land is encumbered by
statutory pre-lease rights, meaning that the Claimants would be pre-empted
by the incumbent lessees.

= Inicia’s employees travelled sometimes hundreds of kilometers to purchase
3il

feed for and dispose of digestate from the cows.
= Mr. Hunter personally made efforts in (i) qualifying as a ‘local farmer’ in
2015 in order to bid at auctions to buy agricultural land for the farm; and (ii)
sitting for the examination to become a Hungarian citizen in order to
persuade the Respondent to sign the contract with him for the 86-hectare
parcel of land that he subsequently won at auction. Despite these efforts,
Mr. Hunter was ultimately deprived of this opportunity to mitigate
Claimants’ losses by Mr. Racz, the son of a local Fidesz mayor, who
exercised his statutory pre-emption right to take over the ownership of this

parcel of land in place of Mr. Hunter.?!”

Furthermore, the Claimants argue that the criticism raised by the Respondent’s expert at
the milk prices, applied in Mr. Gilbey’s valuation as equal to EU prices, is also
unmeritorious. It fails to consider that Inicia actually achieved to sell milk at EU prices in
2018 and that many of its contracts are pegged to German milk prices, which are even

higher than the EU average price.°'*

For the Claimants, the Respondent’s criticism of Mr. Gilbey’s calculation of the price of
calves and in-calf heifers is equally unfounded. While the Respondent is right that the
Claimants have historically sold culled cows at a 70% discount, they have never sold cows
producing milk or in-calf heifers. Therefore, Mr. Gilbey’s assumption that those could be

sold at a market value is reasonable.

The Claimants also refute the comments by Respondent’s expert Mr. Sequeira according
to which Mr. Gilbey assumed that certain costs would remain fixed despite his projection
of a significant increase in the size of the herd and the production of milk. As Mr. Hunter
explains, “[t]he costs of running the facilities (which can cater for up to 2500 animals) are

fixed.”

In connection with interest rates, Mr. Gilbey has applied 7.87% by reference to the rate of
return on capital that the shareholders of Magyar had realized historically and thus could
reasonably have expected to enjoy in the future, but for the expropriation. Contrary to the
Respondent’s criticism, the “normal commercial rate” of interest envisaged in the BIT’s
expropriation provision is not applicable here, since this is an unlawful expropriation.

Similarly, the Respondent’s expert wrongly suggests that Mr. Gilbey’s proposal to

384.

compound interest semi-annually is incompatible with his choice of the annual rate of
return as the interest rate. As Mr. Gilbey explains, when computing the compound interest
he did not simply divide 7.87% in two, which would have given 3.94%, but instead reduced
the semi-annual rate to 3.86% to take into account that the interest is compounded semi-

annually.?!6

Finally, the Claimants also request compensation for the costs of the Hungarian court
proceedings. They point to the jurisprudence of investment tribunals, which confirms that
such costs are recoverable under the principle of full compensation.*!’ Following the
Respondent’s comment that the supporting invoices included unrelated transactions, the
Claimants subtracted three out of five invoices from the claimed amount calculations, as

these dealt with costs related to the Claimants’ Serbian farm.

With respect to the Respondent’s criticism that Mr. Gilbey double-counted the litigation
costs, since these costs were already accounted for in the but-for value of the Farm, the
Claimants point to the passage of Mr. Gilbey’s report, where he explains that, since legal
and professional costs were unusually high in the year 2014, he took the average of the
prior two years (2012 and 2013) to reflect these costs more accurately.*!® Therefore, the

litigation costs are not included in the but-for value of the farm.

For these reasons, the Claimants request the Tribunal to award full compensation for
damages resulting from the Respondent’s unlawful expropriation of their leasehold rights
in the amount of EUR 17,900,000, plus costs and expenses of these proceedings, as well
as costs and expenses and of the litigation in Hungary in an amount of HUF 57,222,236,
together with interest at 7.87% compounded semi-annually until the payment is made in
full.

THE RESPONDENT’S POSITION

The Respondent relies on a valuation report prepared by Mr. Kiran Sequeira of Versant
Partners LLC. Mr. Sequeira has estimated the range of the Claimants’ loss between

EUR 3,400,000 and EUR 5,600,000.

The Respondent first contends that the standard of compensation should be the “fair market
value of the investment expropriated”, as envisaged by Article 6(1) of the BIT, and not that
of consequential loss, as suggested by the Claimants. The BIT standard of compensation
for expropriation is entirely in line with the principle of full reparation, since in modern
economics the value of an asset captures the expected profits that the asset can generate.>!?
Since the value of the expropriated asset already includes all possible future profits, adding
further elements to the valuation, as the Claimants and their expert do, results in double-

counting and overcompensation.

According to Hungary, Mr. Gilbey did not seek to determine the market value of the
expropriated leasehold rights but chose, instead, to value the entire farming business by
comparing the actual with the but-for value of the Farm. While Mr. Gilbey suggests that
by this method he valued the Claimants’ leasehold rights, he does not explain why the
result is much higher than the value of the land owned by Inicia. Indeed, on one hand,
Mr. Gilbey’s documents show that the 105 hectares of land owned by Inicia was worth
EUR 6,900 per hectare. On the other hand, Mr. Gilbey values the leasehold rights to the
Land at EUR 15,650 to EUR 18,867 per hectare.*”° This is a clear overstatement.

Furthermore, Mr. Gilbey determined the but-for value of the Farm as of July 2015 (ex ante
basis), while he assessed the actual value of the Farm as at December 2017 (ex post basis).

Mr. Sequeira explains that this approach is defective as it results in compensating the

Claimants by an additional EUR 4,100,000 for market factors that impacted the value after

the alleged breaches and are wholly unrelated to them.>7!

389. The Respondent further submits that the Claimants have failed to mitigate the loss by not
obtaining a substitute lease for privately owned land. It in particular points to the following

contentious facts and evidence:

= Data obtained from the Hungarian Land Use Registry shows that each year
between 2011 and 2015, a substantial amount of agricultural leases had been
registered in the area surrounding the farm, meaning that agricultural land
often changed lessees. In 2015 alone, new leases were registered for a total
of more than 166,000 hectares in the area, for a total of 5,923 registration
applications.*”?

= The Claimants do not provide evidence that they ever offered a price above
market price to secure alternative land. As Mr. Sequeira calculates, even
assuming that the Claimants had to pay a 50% premium over their existing
rates to secure a substitute rent, the present value of this over-payment for
the entire 20-year period of the lease would be EUR 930,000. This is the
maximum loss amount that the Claimants may recover.

= While the Claimants assert that they have partly mitigated the loss by sub-
leasing the State-owned land from the winners of the Tenders, their expert
Mr. Gilbey confirms that he did not include this mitigation in his calculation
on the purported basis that these quasi sub-lease arrangements “do not offer
security of tenure to Claimants”.*?? As Mr. Sequeira notes, this analysis is
simply incorrect from an economic perspective and results in
overcompensation.*”4

392.

In addition, Mr. Gilbey concludes that the but-for value of the Farm as of July 2015 was
EUR 17,600,000 (a reduction of EUR 1,300,000 compared to his first report, as he took
several criticisms of Mr. Sequeira into account). Yet, Mr. Sequeira shows that Mr. Gilbey’s
updated calculation of the but-for value of the Farm remains overstated because it fails to
rely on available, appropriate and reliable data regarding milk prices, quantity of privately

leased land, livestock prices, overhead costs, fixed and variable costs, and discount rate.*7>

As for Mr. Gilbey’s calculation of the actual value of the Farm, his estimate is between
EUR 5,600,000 and EUR 7,700,000 million depending on which of his three alternative
approaches of the actual value of the farm is adopted: (i) December 2017 going concern;
(ii) July 2015 going concern and (iii) break up basis. Mr. Sequeira disagrees with each of

these three alternative valuations for the following reasons:

= Mr. Gilbey’s projection of the Farm’s future potato production is understated
and inconsistent with the Farm’s actual performance.*°

= Mr. Gilbey’s assumptions of arable farming costs erroneously excludes the
portion of State land that Claimants continue to use to grow crops on a
“quasi-subletting” basis.*2”

= Mr. Gilbey does not adequately support his assumptions regarding which

costs are fixed costs.>78

= Mr. Gilbey erroneously applies an illiquidity discount to the actual value of

the Farm.*??

As for the Claimants’ alleged costs of litigation in Hungary, the Respondent contends that
such costs are “too remote to be compensable in this arbitration.”**° More precisely, the
Respondent points to the fact that the Claimants do not challenge the Hungarian court

proceedings as part of the expropriation claim. In any event, Mr. Gilbey has included the

litigation costs in his valuation twice. He has subtracted these costs from the but-for value
of the Farm (thus increasing the but-for value) but not from the actual value. Hence, the
claimed difference between the but-for and the actual values includes the litigation costs.
If these costs are awarded separately on top of the compensation for the loss of the value

of the Farm, this will clearly result in double recovery.

The Respondent further contends that the Claimants’ proposed interest rate of 7.87%
compounded semi-annually is grossly inflated. This historical rate of return is at odds with
the BIT’s requirement of a “normal commercial rate”. Multiple investment tribunals have
held that applying a reasonable commercial rate results in full compensation.*! By
applying the commercial return rate, Mr. Gilbey assumed that the Claimants would have
invested the compensation amount in a successful venture. He did not account for the risk
that the venture may have failed and that the Claimants may have lost the entire amount of
the compensation. It is for this reason that valuation theory suggests adopting a risk-free
rate for pre-award interest.*? In any event, the historic returns of the Claimants’
shareholders were in Hungarian currency. Applying this HUF-denominated rate to a Euro-
denominated claim is an obvious fallacy, for which Mr. Gilbey has no convincing

explanation.?*°

For these reasons, the Respondent invites the Tribunal to discard Mr. Gilbey’s report and
instead rely on Mr. Sequeira’s valuation of the Claimants’ loss. Mr. Sequeira proposes two

alternatives.

First, he follows Mr. Gilbey’s approach in that he values the Claimants’ loss by subtracting
the actual value of the Claimants’ farm from its but-for value. Doing so, he corrects the

alleged errors and inadequacies in Mr. Gilbey’s methodology and arrives at two alternative

figures: EUR 5,635,621 if the ex ante approach is adopted, with the date of valuation in
July 2015,>4 or EUR 4,487,148 if the ex post approach is adopted, with the date of

valuation in December 2017.°7°

Second, as an alternative approach, Mr. Sequeira calculated the fair market value of the
Claimants’ alleged leasehold rights, without accounting for other consequential losses. To
do so, he (i) took as a proxy the value of 105 hectares of land owned by Inicia, which he
then (ii) adjusted to account for the difference between the value of owned land and the
value of the leasehold rights. Under this approach, Mr. Sequeira determined the value of

leasehold rights and thus the Claimants’ loss at a maximum EUR 3,100,000.°°°

The Respondent contends that the second alternative approach should be preferred, since
Article 6 of the BIT only requires the State to compensate for the expropriated investment

itself and not for remote consequential damages.

ANALYSIS

In the section on liability above, the Tribunal held that Hungary violated Article 6 of the
BIT by expropriating the Claimants’ vested statutory pre-lease right without compensation.
This prevented the Claimants from exercising the pre-lease right in 2014 when the NLA
alienated the Land through the Tenders. Had the Claimants exercised the pre-lease right,
they would, in all likelihood, have matched the offers made by the winner of the tenders
and would thus have obtained a 20-year extension of the Lease. Therefore, the Claimants
lost their leasehold entitlement to the Land as a direct consequence of Hungary’s

expropriatory measure.

The Parties dispute the valuation of that loss. The Tribunal will first select the appropriate
method of valuation (1). It will then analyze the divergences between the valuation experts

(2). Thereafter, it will address mitigation (3) and interest (4).

402.

Before doing so, however, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants request compensation
jointly, without specifying that compensation should go to one or the other among them.
The Respondent has not objected to this formulation of the Claimants’ request for relief.
In principle, the amount of compensation for the expropriation of the pre-lease right would
pertain to the Claimant that held that right, i.e. to Inicia Zrt. However, Article 6.2 of the
BIT gives the shareholder investors a right to be compensated for the expropriation of the

assets of their subsidiaries:

Where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company

which is constituted or incorporated under the law in force in any

part of its own territory, and in which investors of the other

Contracting Party own shares, it shall ensure that the provisions of

paragraph I of this Article [i.e. the provision on expropriation] are

applied to the extent necessary to guarantee prompt, adequate and

effective compensation in respect of their investment to such

investors of the other Contracting Party who are owners of those

shares.*>7
For these reasons, the Tribunal will grant compensation to the Claimants jointly. The award
will reestablish the Claimants in the position in which they would be had Hungary provided

compensation for its expropriatory measure as required by Article 6 of the BIT.

qd) Method of valuation

In order to determine the value of the expropriated leasehold rights on the date of the
expropriation (i.e. the eviction from the Land in July 2015), the Claimants’ valuation expert
Mr. Gilbey subtracts the value of the Farm without the Lease (actual value) from the value
of the Farm with the Lease (but-for value). The Respondent’s valuation expert Mr. Sequeira
agrees in principle that, “the lost value of the leasehold rights could be quantified by
comparing the value of the Farm with and without those rights”, adding that “the difference
in the value of the Farm with and without the leasehold rights is equal to the lost value of

those rights.”*** However, he proposes to value the leasehold right by reference to

337 UK-Hungary BIT, CL-1.

115

404.

405.

ownership, taking into account that a freehold ownership is in general more valuable than

a leasehold.

The Tribunal will start by analyzing Mr. Sequeira’s proposed approach using freehold
ownership as a proxy to value the lost Lease. While valuation by reference to a proxy can
be acceptable in certain circumstances, it is undisputed that enterprises and foreign
nationals cannot own agricultural land in Hungary. Thus, the market for freeholds is far

more limited than for leaseholds, a factor that Mr. Sequeira ignores.

In addition, Mr. Sequeira’s valuation of ownership appears insufficiently substantiated.
Indeed, it relies on a single transaction based on a letter of valuation provided in 2018 by
Terravost to the Claimants, which referred to a sale of 105 hectares of the Claimants’ land.
The letter specifies that Terravost “have not had time to investigate other specific
comparables”.**? The Tribunal is not convinced that this only transaction is a sufficient
comparator to adopt Mr. Sequeira’s valuation. Having discarded Mr. Sequeira’s approach,
the Tribunal must review the Claimants’ valuation method. As mentioned earlier, the
Claimants’ expert Mr. Gilbey presented the Tribunal with three alternative valuations: (i)
a DCF valuation on a going concern basis as of July 2015 but using data of December
2017; (ii) a DCF valuation on a going concern basis as of July 2015 with the data available
at that time; and (iii) a valuation whereby the Farm’s actual value is determined assuming
the breakup of the Farm into constituent assets and is then subtracted from the but-for value

which is in turn assessed on a going concern basis.

For the first approach, Mr. Gilbey calculated the difference between the but-for and the
actual values of the Farm in July 2015. However, instead of projecting the cash flows based
on the data forecasts (e.g. for milk prices) available at that date, he used the market data
that was available in December 2017. At the Hearing, Mr. Gilbey conceded that, while he
used the 2017 data for determining the actual value of the Farm, he did not do so with
respect to the but-for value.*#° Neither Mr. Gilbey nor the Claimants have offered a

plausible explanation for this inconsistency. It is uncontroversial that the fair market value

408.

of an asset is a price at which the asset would change hands between a willing seller and a
willing buyer in an arm’s length transaction. Evidently, the buyer would only have access
to the data available as of the valuation date, i.e. here July 2015. The use of data from
different dates for the but-for and the actual scenarios distorts the computation and risks
reaching results that do not correctly reflect the loss sustained. Consequently, the Tribunal

cannot follow this approach.

Mr. Gilbey’s secondary valuation remedies this inconsistency and uses the data available
on the date of valuation for both scenarios. Mr. Sequeira has confirmed that Mr. Gilbey’s
secondary approach does not contain the contradiction with respect to the choice of the
date of the valuation data.*#! As for Mr. Gilbey’s third approach, he does not sufficiently
explain why the value of the Farm, which is currently operating with profit and has a track

record, should be determined on a break-up basis.

For this reason, the Tribunal will take Mr. Gilbey’s secondary valuation as a starting point

for the assessment of the quantum of the Claimants’ loss.

(2) Contentious points of secondary valuation

The Tribunal will address each of these points in turn. Before doing so, however, it notes
that Mr. Sequeira also criticized Mr. Gilbey’s use of what he called outdated forecasts of
milk and livestock prices. Yet, Mr. Sequeira admitted that, if these forecasts are applied in
both the but-for and actual valuations, then this error would correct itself and have a
negligible impact on the final damages figure.*“* Since the Tribunal adopted Mr. Gilbey’s
secondary valuation in which the expert uses the allegedly “wrong” prices in both scenarios
with the result that this “mistake” has minimal effect if any, the Tribunal can dispense with
determining whether other milk and livestock prices should be used. Instead, it will

concentrate on the four contentious points that impact the damages figure.

Liquidity discount: Mr. Gilbey applied a 25% discount on the actual value of the Farm to
account for an increased exposure of the Farm to risk factors such as the milk price
fluctuations. Mr. Sequeira opines that no such discount is warranted, since the loss of the
Land did not render the Claimants’ business inherently riskier or less liquid. According to

him, the Claimants’ business has always been heavily reliant on milk prices.

4 Transcript, Day 2, 561-562.

414.

Mr. Sequeira does not appear to dispute that the loss of the Lease increased the Claimants’
costs, in particular the cost of the cattle feed.*“° Since the eviction, the Claimants have no
longer been in a position to produce sufficient quantities of feed to support the Farm and
have thus purchased feed on the market. As a result, they have incurred higher costs. Thus,
Mr. Gilbey’s opinion that, compared to the but-for scenario, in the actual scenario it would
take a smaller negative shift in milk or feed prices to put the Claimants out of business
appears plausible. This is consistent with Mr. Hunter’s testimony that the Claimants are
“waiting for the inevitable moment when the market prices for milk and feed will turn
against us”.*4° Thus, in principle, the application of some increased risk factor to the actual

value of the Farm seems justified.

That being so, Mr. Gilbey conceded at the Hearing that his choice of a 25% discount rate
was not substantiated by evidence or relevant valuation authorities,*“” but was based on his
subjective judgment:

I think where Versant are correct, at least, is to say that that 25

percent liquidity discount is a subjective number, and I don’t hide

behind that. It is an area of judgment on my part.**
While the Tribunal respects Mr. Gilbey’s expertise, it observes that Mr. Sequeira, who is
also a seasoned valuation expert, characterized the 25% liquidity discount as unreasonably
high and considered that any liquidity discount would be “marginal”.*“? Based on this
evidence, the Tribunal determines in its discretion that 5% would be an appropriate
measure of discount to reflect the increased liquidity risk that the Farm faces in the actual

scenario.

Discount rate: The disagreement leading the experts to adopt different discount rates

hinges on two elements: base risk rate (i.e. risk free rate) and equity risk premium. For the

first element, Mr. Gilbey used the Hungarian Government bonds rate of 3%. However, in
July 2015 the rate was 3.5%, which is the rate applied by Mr. Sequeira.*° As for the
second element, Mr. Gilbey used the equity risk premium for Hungary of 8.5%. In doing
so, he admitted that he relied on the lower figure of Professor Damodaran’s suggested range
for Eastern Europe, since he mistakenly thought that the higher figure included the estimate
for Russia, which has a higher country risk.*>! Mr. Sequeira in turn took the average of the
upper and lower rates proposed by Professor Damodaran as well as the rate suggested by
Bloomberg.*** For these reasons, the Tribunal will apply Mr. Sequeira’s suggested

discount rate of 9.65%, which it deems better substantiated.

Potato production: Mr. Sequeira criticizes Mr. Gilbey’s omission from the actual value
of the Farm of the value of 3,200 tons of potatoes that the Claimants produced after the

eviction on land they managed to sublease from the new lessees.

It is common ground between the experts that Mr. Gilbey’s secondary valuation assesses
the Claimants’ loss on an ex ante basis, i.e. as of the date when expropriation affected the
Claimants (July 2015) and with the data available at that time. If, in the years subsequent
to the expropriation, the Claimants managed to grow potatoes on substitute land, this would
not affect the value of the expropriated asset at the time of the expropriation. Indeed, a
willing buyer would not have factored these revenues in its assessment of the Farm’s value

in July 2015.

In any event, as Mr. Gilbey rightly points out, the quasi-sublease arrangements do not
provide legal security comparable to that of ownership or a lease. It would thus be
unreasonable to project that the Claimants will benefit from this arrangement for 20 years.
No reasonable buyer would have made such a projection, given the uncertain nature of the

sublease.

421.

For these reasons, the Tribunal does not share Mr. Sequeira’s criticism of Mr. Gilbey’s

secondary valuation in respect of potato production.

Potato energy: Mr. Sequeira further criticized Mr. Gilbey’s calculation of the actual value
of the Farm on the basis that Mr. Gilbey inappropriately assumed that the production costs,
such as the costs of the energy for packing the potatoes, would remain fixed, even though
the production would decrease. Although he did not elaborate further, because this issue
was “less material”,**? Mr. Gilbey acknowledged in his slide presentation that potato
energy costs are variable, albeit not in a precise correlation with production levels.***
Consequently, the Tribunal cannot follow Mr. Gilbey’s assumption that the potato energy
costs would remain fixed in spite of the decrease in production. It will thus adopt

Mr. Sequeira’s valuation in this respect.

In summary, Mr. Gilbey’s secondary valuation figure of EUR 9,937,495 must be reduced
by the amounts resulting from (i) the excess liquidity discount of EUR 2,054,455
(corresponding to 5% instead of the proposed 25% discount), (ii) the discount rate of
EUR 659,091 and (iii) the potato energy costs of EUR 75,125, with the result that the
damages (corresponding to the fair market value of the expropriated investment) amount

to EUR 7,148,824.
(3) Mitigation
The Respondent argues that the Claimants failed to mitigate damages and makes the

following alternative prayer for relief:

Declare that Claimants failed to mitigate their losses and therefore
determine that the amount payable by Respondent as compensation
cannot exceed EUR 930,000.

The Tribunal considers that the Claimants’ mitigation efforts after the date of valuation are
not relevant. As explained above, a valuation cannot take into account facts that occurred
after the valuation date, which a hypothetical buyer could not have considered. The
Respondent’s expert himself criticized Mr. Gilbey’s primary valuation on the basis that it

took into account events taking place after the valuation date.°°

At the Hearing, the Respondent linked the obligation to mitigate the loss with an

amendment of its request for relief, which it made then asking the Tribunal to:

= direct Claimants to keep Respondent informed of any sale of the Farm; and

= subtract from the compensation payable by Respondent all sums Claimants
may receive above the Farm’s Actual Value (as determined by the Tribunal)
in case they sell the Farm before the Award is paid, or

= order that Claimants shall pay to Respondent all sums Claimants may receive
above the Farm’s Actual Value (as determined by the Tribunal) in case they
sell the Farm after the Award is paid.*°°

On this occasion, Counsel for the Respondent explained as follows:

I would just ask you to order them that, if they sell the Farm for more

than the Actual Value in the calculation, then they have mitigated

their loss by selling for more than what they’ve submitted the Actual

Value of the Farm was, and anything they that they obtain above the

Actual Value should be subtracted as further mitigation.*°’
Subject to the admissibility of the amendment by the Respondent of its requests for relief,
which can be left open in light of the considerations that follow, these new requests are in
any event not well-founded. As set out above, events taking place after the date of valuation
are irrelevant. Indeed, a willing buyer of the Farm could not have factored into his/her
valuation on July 2015 changes in value due to the Claimants’ later failure to mitigate

losses.

In addition, granting the Respondent’s new requests would run counter to the Tribunal’s
duty under Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention to decide the dispute, and to do so ina
definitive and efficient manner. Ordering the Claimants to keep the Respondent informed
of any subsequent sale of the Farm and to refund sales proceeds would not put an end to
this dispute. Such an order may give rise to further disagreements over which the Tribunal
would arguably have no jurisdiction, it being fiunctus officio. It could thus not assist the
Parties anymore in resolving these new difficulties. Creating such a situation would be

contrary to the Tribunal’s duty.

Finally and in any event, the Tribunal notes that the record contains ample evidence of the
Claimants’ multiple efforts to mitigate the consequences of the loss of access to the land.***
This is not a surprise as mitigating the loss was primarily in the Claimants’ interest. Absent
compelling evidence to the contrary, the Tribunal is not prepared to speculate whether the
Claimants should have exercised a better business judgment, for instance, by growing
certain crops on specific parcels of land.**?

For these reasons, the Tribunal will not reduce the amount of compensation on the basis of
the alleged lack of mitigation, with the result that the relevant requests for relief of the

Respondent are dismissed.

(4) Interest

The Claimants seek pre- and post-award interest at the rate of 7.87%, suggested by their
expert Mr. Gilbey, while the Respondent’s expert, Mr. Sequeira proposes applying LIBOR

+2%. For the following reasons, the Tribunal will adopt Mr. Sequeira’s rate.

The Tribunal has not heard from the Claimants a convincing response to Mr. Sequeira’s
criticism that the historic returns of the Claimants’ shareholders were in Hungarian
currency, and applying this HUF-denominated rate to a Euro-denominated claim would

not be appropriate.

As for Mr. Sequeira’s proposal of LIBOR +2%, the Tribunal in principle agrees that this
corresponds to the time value of money that would compensate the Claimants for their loss.
It also constitutes a “normal commercial rate” as envisaged by Article 6 of the BIT.
Investment treaty tribunals often use floating interbank offered rates augmented with a
certain premium as an accurate indication of the market value of money in a specific

currency.>°

That said, as Mr. Sequeira acknowledged in response to the Tribunal’s question, LIBOR is
likely to be phased out in 2022,**! with the result that the computation of interest may be
rendered impossible beyond that date. For this reason, the Tribunal will instead opt for a
comparable rate of 6-month EURIBOR +2%, compounded semi-annually. Interest will run
from the date of valuation (July 2015) until the date of the payment. Given that the rate is

for a 6-month maturity period, it should be compounded semi-annually.*

COSTS

Each Party seeks an award of the entirety of the costs related to this arbitration, including
the legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with these proceedings. They do not
dispute that the Tribunal enjoys broad discretion to allocate the costs of the arbitration, as

it deems appropriate pursuant to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention:

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as
the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the
parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and
by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of
the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre
shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.

The Tribunal notes that the Claimants’ claim was for approximately EUR 17.9 million, out
of which the Tribunal awards approximately EUR 7.1 million. Yet, the ratio of 17.9 to 7.1
is only one element to consider. The Respondent also raised preliminary objections, which
the Tribunal denied. In addition, the Tribunal upheld the Claimants’ claim of expropriation
and found the Respondent liable. This outcome shows that the Claimants had no choice but
to initiate this arbitration to vindicate their rights under the BIT, a factor that must also be

taken into consideration when assessing costs.

At the same time, the Tribunal acknowledges that both Parties and their counsel conducted
these proceedings in a professional and efficient manner. The Parties’ procedural conduct

can thus not influence the allocation of costs.

The costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the

Tribunal’s Assistant, ICSID’s administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):

Arbitrators’ fees and expenses

Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler 130,308.53
Dr. Stanimir Alexandrov 77,891.83
Dr. Inka Hanefeld 92,845.83
Mr. David Kachvani’s fees and expenses 74,021.05
ICSID’s administrative fees 126,000
Direct expenses (estimated) 63,381.55
Total 564,448.79

The above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts.°°

As a result, each Party’s share of the costs of arbitration amounts to USD 282,224.40.

Considering the factors mentioned above, in the exercise of its discretion, the Tribunal
determines that the Respondent shall reimburse the Claimants for the expended portion of

the Claimants’ advances to ICSID in the amount of USD 282,224.40, for the ICSID lodging

fee in the amount of USD 25,000 and for 50% of the Claimants’ representation costs in the
amount of GBP 296,456, EUR 19,473 and HUF 26,495,585.5.°™ The Tribunal notes that
the Claimants’ costs appear reasonable as they constitute approximately 5% of the amount

in dispute and are significantly lower than the Respondent’s costs.

This finding does not concern the fees and expenses of the local proceedings in Hungary.
The subject matter of those proceedings were not the Claimants’ rights under the BIT. In
particular, there is no claim of judicial impropriety or denial of justice. Nor did those
proceedings concern the validity or lawfulness of the 2011 Amendment, which the Tribunal
found to be contrary to the BIT. Instead, those proceedings related to the Claimants’
contractual dispute with the NLA. As a result, these costs are not recoverable in this

arbitration.

Finally, the Tribunal will give post-award interest on costs, but no pre-award interest.
Indeed, costs only become due from the issuance of this award and, hence, it would not be

justified to allow for interest to run before that date.
