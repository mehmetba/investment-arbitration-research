I. THE ARBITRATION

1. SUMMARY OF THE DISPUTE

1. The Parties to the underlying arbitration were Occidental Petroleum Corporation
(“OPC”) and Occidental Exploration and Production Company (“OEPC”) two
U.S. companies, acting as Claimants (the “Claimants”), and the Republic of
Ecuador (“Ecuador” or the “Republic”), as Respondent.

2. The dispute concerned the termination through the “Caducidad Decree”, issued by
the Ecuadorian Minister of Energy and Mines (the “Minister”) on May 15, 2006,
of a Participation Contract dated May 21, 1999 between OEPC and PetroEcuador
for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons in Block 15 in the Ecuadorian
Amazon. Claimants alleged breaches by Ecuador of domestic and international
law, especially of the 1993 Treaty between the United States of America and the
Republic of Ecuador Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of
Investments (the “Treaty”, the “BIT” or “US - Ecuador BIT”).

3. Respondent denied Claimants’ allegations of breach and formulated a counterclaim,
asking the Tribunal to declare that it had fulfilled its obligations under the
Participation Contract, Ecuadorian Law and the Treaty, and to dismiss all of
Claimants’ claims.

4. Before summarizing the arbitration procedure and in order to ensure a proper
context for its Decision, the Committee has prepared a brief summary of the facts
that gave rise to the underlying dispute.

2. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

The Participation Contract

5. The Republic of Ecuador, through PetroEcuador, and OEPC entered into a
Participation Contract for Block 15! in Ecuador on May 21, 1999 (the
“Participation Contract”).

6. Under the Participation Contract, which was subject to Ecuadorian Law, OEPC
received a share of the oil produced from Block 15, in return for undertaking the
obligation to explore, develop and exploit Block 15, and assuming responsibility
for all associated expenditures?:

“116. The Participation Contract, which expressly stated that it was to be
“governed exclusively by Ecuadorian law,” transformed the conditions under
which OEPC operated in Ecuador. Pursuant to Clause 4.2 of the Participation
Contract, OEPC would no longer be reimbursed for its expenditures in
exploring and producing Block 15. In return for accepting the obligation to
explore, develop and exploit Block 15, and being responsible for all the
associated expenditures, OEPC received a share of the oil produced from
Block 15, referred to as OEPC’s “participation”. Clause 4.3 provided that

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

“Contractor shall invest capital and use the personnel, equipment, machinery
and technology needed for the faithful performance of such activities in
consideration of which Contractor shall receive, as participation, the
percentage of Fiscalized Production provided for in Clause 8.1.” OEPC also
had various other obligations under the Participation Contract, including
payment of all Ecuadorian taxes and duties; periodic reporting of certain
information to Ecuador; the establishment of good relations with the
community; and the protection of the environment”.

~

Although, OEPC was free to dispose of its share of the Participation Contract, the
transfer of such Contract and the assignment to third parties of rights arising
thereunder required authorization from the Minister. The Participation Contract
also provided that the transfer of rights or obligations without authorization of the
Minister could result in termination of that Contract. The Tribunal explained these
facts as follows*:

“119. The Tribunal notes, since this provision will be referred to later in the
present Award, that OEPC was allowed to dispose freely of its share of the
production from Block 15 as it wished. Under Clause 5.3.2, OEPC had the
right to “[r]eceive and freely dispose of Contractor participation as established
in Clause 8.1 of this Participation Contract”. While OEPC could freely dispose
of its participation, its ability to transfer or assign its rights and obligations
under the Participation Contract was subject to stringent conditions. Chapter
16 of the Participation Contract, entitled “Transfer and Assignment”, sets forth
these conditions in provisions which are at the heart of the parties’ dispute in
this arbitration”.

The Farmout Agreements

8. In 2000 OEPC and City Investing Company Limited (“AEC”), a Bermuda
company, explored the possibility of a “farm-in” transaction over Block 15+:

“127. In order to finance the expansion of its operations in Ecuador, OEPC
sought an arrangement that could provide the necessary funds, as well as
diversify and reduce its exposure. At the same time, Alberta Energy
Corporation Ltd. (“AEC”) [...] was looking to expand its investments in
Ecuador. AEC had originally considered purchasing outright Block 15 from
OEPC in 1999, together with two unrelated companies, City Investing and
City Oriente, which operated blocks to the north of Block 15. However, while
it did purchase the City companies that year, it did not approach OEPC about
a purchase of Block 15 until 2000. On 15 May 2000, AEC made a formal
proposal to OEPC to acquire OEPC’s entire interest in Block 15. OEPC
rejected AEC’s proposal.

128. AEC then proposed to “farmin” to Block 15. OEPC stated to the Tribunal
that a farmout agreement with AEC was an attractive alternative because it
allowed OEPC to continue to invest in Block 15 but with less of its own capital
and to diversify its in-country risk. (...)”.

9. In October 2000, OEPC and AEC executed the Farmout Agreement (the “Farmout
Agreement” or “Farmout’). The parties also signed a joint operating agreement

3 Award at 119.

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

in order to implement the Farmout (the “Joint Operating Agreement”, and
together with the Farmout, the “Farmout Agreements”).

10. The Farmout Agreement, was subject to New York law and provided for two
phases*:

“130. [...] In the first phase of the transaction AEC purchased a 40% so-called
“economic interest” in Block 15. Essentially, through contributions to
OEPC’s Block 15 investments, AEC purchased the right to 40% of OEPC’s
share of Block 15’s production. This stage of the Farmout was described in
Article II, titled “Farmout of Interest in Farmout Property”. [Emphasis added]

td

131. The second stage of the Farmout was described in Article IV of the
Farmout Agreement, titled “Assignment of Legal Title”. Article 4.01 provided
that this phase could not occur until and unless two conditions were met: AEC
had made the required payments, and the Government had given its prior
authorization [...]”. [Emphasis added]

11. AEC paid approximately US$ 180 million to OEPC as consideration for the
acquisition of its 40% economic interest in the production from Block 15, an
amount equivalent to 40% of the expenditure so far. Thereafter, in compliance with
the obligations assumed in the Farmout Agreements, AEC regularly paid to OEPC
40% of the expenditure incurred in the exploitation and development of Block 15
and received 40% of the oil produced®:

“132. In exchange for its economic interest in the production from Block 15,
AEC agreed to pay 40% of all the capital and operating expenses in
developing Block 15. Article 2.02 of the Farmout provided:

As between OEPC and [AEC], [AEC] upon Closing shall be obligated
and agrees to perform all obligations and to bear and pay all costs,
charges, expenses and liabilities attributable to the Farmout Interest in
the Participating Agreements and Block 15 [...]”.

133. AEC also agreed to pay approximately $180 million towards OEPC’s
historical development costs. Under Article 3.02, approximately $70 million
was to be paid upon Closing. Pursuant to Article 3.03, AEC’s payment of the
remaining amount was spread over four years according to the following
schedule: $50 million in 2001, $25 million in 2002, $20 million in 2003 and
$15 million in 2004”.

The Farmout and Ecuador

12. A few days before the execution of the Farmout Agreement, OEPC representatives
held a meeting with Ecuador’s Minister of Mines to inform the Minister about the
Farmout’:

“147. On 24 October 2000, senior executives of both OEPC and AEC flew to
Quito from the United States and Canada in order to meet with the Minister
of Energy and Mines, Pablo Terdn, in the Minister’s office. The purpose of
the meeting was to inform the Minister about the Farmout and discuss the
commitment to the OCP pipeline and new projects in Ecuador. Casey Olson,
then Executive Vice President for Business Development of Occidental, and
Paul MacInnes, then President and General Manager of OEPC, attended this
meeting on behalf of OEPC. Steven Bell, then Vice President International of
AEC, and Stephen Newton, then President and General Manager of AEC
Ecuador, attended on behalf of AEC. Minister Terén was the only
representative of Ecuador present at the meeting.

148. There were two distinct subject matters which were addressed during the
meeting and the meeting itself had two distinct phases. The purpose of the first
session, which lasted about 45 minutes, was to present the Farmout to Minister
Terdn and was attended by both the OEPC and AEC officials. In the second
session, attended only by the OEPC officials and Minister Teran, the parties
discussed new projects in Ecuador that OEPC was interested in pursuing”.

13, Although there is controversy regarding what was said at the meeting, both parties
acknowledged that no copy of the Farmout Agreements was handed to the
Minister®. OEPC at a later date sent a letter to the Minister requesting consent with
respect to the transfer of economic interests in favor of AEC?:

“151. The next day, on 25 October 2000, Mr. MacInnes wrote to Minister
Terdn regarding the previous day’s meeting. Mr. MacInnes wrote that the
Farmout was an ‘imminent transaction pursuant to which [OEPC] intends to
transfer to [AEC] 40% of its economic interest in the Participation Contract.’
Mr. MacInnes also wrote that, following that first stage of the transaction,
‘OEPC will continue being the only ‘Contractor’ entity under the Contract for
Block 15;’ and that ‘once [AEC] has complied with its obligations
contemplated in the transfer agreement, OEPC shall transfer to [AEC] the
legal title corresponding to 40% of its interests [...] subject to the approvals
that the Government of Ecuador may require at that time.’ The letter ended
with a request to the Minister to ‘confirm [...] [the] consent with respect to
the aforementioned transfer of economic interests in favor of [AEC]’”.

14, The issue of whether the Minister had or had not indicated whether approval for the
transfer of economic interest was required became very relevant in the
proceedings '°:

“152. As explained later in this Award, one of the central issues in this
proceeding is whether, during the meeting of 24 October 2000, Minister Teran

Decision on Annulment

in fact indicated that government approval was (or was not) required for the
transfer of the economic interest to AEC under the Farmout. In this regard,
the Tribunal notes that upon closing the Farmout on 31 October 2000, OEPC
and AEC entered into a letter agreement mutually waiving satisfaction of any
required government approvals for the first stage of the Farmout. That letter
also expressly envisaged the requirement of government approval for the
contemplated future transfer of legal title to AEC”.

15. In November 2000 the closing of the Farmout Agreement was made public through
a press release issued by OEPC’s ultimate parent, OPC!'. Between late October
and late November 2000, there were meetings between OEPC’s and PetroEcuador’s
executives in which the Farmout was mentioned!?. In addition, government
agencies — the Ministry of Energy and Mines and the National Hydrocarbons
Directorate (“DNH”) — requested from OEPC information regarding AEC’s
financial and technical capabilities and issued memoranda regarding the
transaction ?.

16. Finally, on January 2001, Ecuador’s Minister of Mines answered OEPC’s letter of
October 25, 2000!*:

“159. [...] noting the company’s “intention to transfer in the future 40% of the
rights and obligations of block 15,” and indicating that such a future transfer
would require prior government approval. Minister Terdn also stated that
OEPC ‘shall be the sole company that will continue participating in the current
contract with the Ecuadorian State since it is the owner of 100% of the rights
and obligations’”.

17. The issue of the transfer of rights by OEPC to AEC resurfaced in 2003 when an
audit firm was retained by the DNH to conduct an audit of OEPC. The auditors
issued a report in July 2004 recommending that OEPC seek government
authorization for the assignment!>:

“167. Moores Rowland issued its audit report on 14 July 2004, noting therein
that the assignment of rights and obligations contemplated in the Farmout was
made contingent on future events and that the assignment “might or might not
happen” at the end of the four years during which the conditions were to be
satisfied. The audit report recommended to the DNH that OEPC seek
government authorization for the assignment during that year, assuming the
assignment conditions were satisfied, and that the required ministerial
approval be granted to OEPC in order to properly register the assignment”.

18. The day after the issuance of the audit report, OEPC wrote a letter to the new
Minister of Energy and Mines requesting his approval for the transfer by OEPC to
AEC of legal title to a 40% interest in Block 15. The approval was not granted'®:

“169. The approval sought by OEPC was not granted. Rather, on 24 August
2004, as set forth in more detail later in this Award, the Attorney General of
Ecuador ordered the Ministry of Mines and Energy to terminate the
Participation Contract and the Unitized Fields Joint Operating Agreements
through a declaration of caducidad”.

The VAT Dispute

19. In August 2001, the SRI - Ecuador’s Tax Authority — changed its practice of
refunding value added taxes (“WAT”) to oil companies and retrospectively claimed
refunds of the taxes already paid. OEPC initiated an arbitration (the “VAT
Arbitration”) seeking redress for the measure and obtained a US$ 75 million award
(the “VAT Award”) against Ecuador!’:

“170. In August 2001, Ecuador’s tax authority, the SRI, contrary to its
established practice of refunding value added taxes (““WAT”) to oil companies,
refused to grant such refunds in the future and, retroactively, claimed refunds
of the taxes already paid. OEPC interpreted this decision to be a violation of
Ecuadorian tax laws and the Treaty and, in November 2002, filed an
international arbitration claim against Ecuador to recover the VAT refunds.

171. On 1 July 2004, the VAT Tribunal issued a $75 million VAT Award in
OEPC’s favor, finding that Ecuador’s conduct had been unfair and
discriminatory. The VAT Award was sent to the parties on 12 July 2004, and
was immediately made public.

172. Ecuador challenged the award in the English courts. Its annulment
application was rejected by the High Court on 2 March 2006 and that decision
was confirmed by the Court of Appeal on 4 July 2007”.

20. On August 3, 2004, just a few weeks after the issuance of the VAT Award, Ecuador
enacted the “WAT Interpretative Law” clarifying that the regime of VAT
reimbursements was not applicable to petroleum operations '*:

“548. The VAT Law, also referred to as the VAT Interpretative Law, was
passed by the Ecuadorian Congress on 3 August 2004 very shortly after the
VAT Award’s release on 2 August 2004. Its sole article provides as follows:

Article 69-A of the Internal Tax Regime Law [...] is hereby interpreted in the
sense that reimbursement of Value Added Taxes, VAT, is not applicable to
petroleum activities when referring to extraction, transportation and
commercialization of oil, since petroleum is not produced, but is extracted
from the respective reservoirs”.

The Caducidad proceedings

21. In September 2004, upon request of the Attorney General, the Minister of Energy
and Mines instructed PetroEcuador to initiate the termination procedure of the
Participation Contract!?:

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

“180. Ina letter to the Executive President of PetroEcuador dated 8 September
2004, Minister L6pez, acting upon the Attorney General’s request of 24
August 2004, instructed PetroEcuador to initiate the termination procedure.
The Minister’ s letter attached OEPC’s request of 15 July 2004 for the transfer
to AEC of 40% of the legal title to Block 15, the Farmout Agreement and the
Joint Operating Agreement, as well as a report from the DNH listing various
technical infractions committed by OEPC. Acting on Minister Lopez’s letter,
on 15 September 2004, PetroEcuador notified OEPC of its alleged non-
compliance with the Participation Contract. This notification gave OEPC ten
business days to respond to the allegations. On 24 September 2004, OEPC
sent a detailed 28-page letter to PetroEcuador denying the Attorney General’s
allegations”.

22. The Caducidad proceedings against OEPC culminated on May 15, 2006 with the
issuance of a Caducidad Decree”®:

“199. On 15 May 2006, Minister Rodriguez issued the Caducidad Decree.
The Decree terminated, with immediate effect, OEPC’s Participation Contract
and ordered OEPC to turn over to PetroEcuador all its assets relating to Block
15. The thirty-three page Decree included: (i) a summary of the termination
process; (ii) block quotes from the letters of the Attorney General,
PetroEcuador and OEPC; (iii) additional description of these letters and the
positions articulated therein, as well as descriptions of other documents in the
record; (iv) a description of norms considered; and (v) approximately four
pages of reasoning. The Decree cited as a legal basis for caducidad Articles
74.11, 74.12 and 74.13 of the HCL”.

Law 42

23. In April 2006, Ecuador enacted “Law 42”, which required all companies operating
under participation contracts to contribute 50% of their windfall revenues to the
State?!:

“465. Law 42, also referred to as the HCL Amendment, was passed by the
Ecuadorian Congress on 19 April 2006 and published in the Official Gazette
on 25 April 2006. Law 42 added a provision to the HCL titled ‘State’s
Participation in surplus from oil sales prices not agreed upon or not foreseen’.
This provision, which became Article 55 of the HCL, states, in relevant part,
as follows:

Contractor companies that hold participation contracts for the exploration and
exploitation of hydrocarbons in effect with the Ecuadorian State in accordance
with this Law, without prejudice to the volume of participation crude oil that
corresponds to them, when the average actual monthly FOB sales price of
Ecuadorian crude oil exceeds the average monthly sales price in effect on the
date on which the contract was executed [...] shall recognize a participation
in favor of the Ecuadorian State of at least 50% of the extraordinary revenues
generated by the difference in prices. For purposes of this article,
extraordinary revenues shall be understood to mean the difference in price
described above, multiplied by the number of barrels produced.

DECISION ON JURISDICTION AND AWARD

On May 17, 2006, Claimants commenced an international investment arbitration
against Ecuador under the Treaty, which eventually led to the Decision on
Jurisdiction and the Award challenged in these proceedings.

Decision on Jurisdiction

Respondent submitted two jurisdictional objections:

- Under the first objection Respondent argued that the adjudication of the

Parties’ dispute was governed by the Participation Contract, which
allegedly excluded caducidad from arbitration;

- Under the second objection Respondent averred that Claimants had failed

to respect the six-month waiting period, imposed by Article VI.3 of the
Treaty, for submission of the dispute to arbitration.

The Tribunal issued a Decision on Jurisdiction dated September 9, 2008, (the
“Decision on Jurisdiction”) in which it dismissed the objections and decided as

22,

follows:

“97. For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal decides and declares as follows:
(i) the Respondent's first jurisdictional objection is denied;
(ii) the Respondent’s second jurisdictional objection is denied;

(iii) the Respondent’s alternative request for “an order that this arbitration be
stayed until OEPC challenges the Caducidad Decree in the competent
Ecuadorian administrative court and that court issues a final ruling on such
challenge” is denied; and

(iv) the Tribunal has jurisdiction over both OEPC’s and OPC’s claims in this
proceeding and the arbitral proceedings will continue to the merits phase in
accordance with the calendar established in the Tribunal’s Procedural Order
N°. 1 as modified by Procedural Order N°. 2”.

The Award

On October 5, 2012 the Tribunal issued its Award (the ““Award”), which in its
dispositive section ordered the following?*:

“876. For all of the foregoing reasons, and rejecting all submissions and
contentions to the contrary, the Tribunal DECLARES, AWARDS and
ORDERS as follows in respect of the issues arising for determination in these
proceedings:

(i) Ecuador acted in breach of Article II.3(a) of the Treaty by failing to accord
fair and equitable treatment to the Claimants’ investment, and to accord the
Claimants treatment no less [favourable] than that required by international
law;

(ii) Ecuador acted in breach of Article III.1 of the Treaty by expropriating the
Claimants’ investment in Block 15 through a measure “tantamount to
expropriation”;

(iii) Ecuador issued the Caducidad Decree in breach of Ecuadorian law and
customary international law;

(iv) OEPC breached Clause 16.1 of the Participation Contract by failing to
secure the required ministerial authorization for the transfer of rights under
the Farmout Agreement; as a result of this breach, the damages awarded to the
Claimants will be reduced by a factor of 25% (see subparagraph (v));

(v) Claimants are awarded the amount of US$ 1,769,625,000 (US One billion,
seven hundred sixty nine millions, six hundred twenty five thousand dollars),
as calculated in paragraph 825 of this Award, for damages suffered as a result
of the breaches set out above in subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii);

(vi) Ecuador is ordered to pay pre-award interest on the above amount at the
rate of 4.188% per annum, compounded annually from 16 May 2006 until the
date of this Award;

(vii) Ecuador is ordered to pay post-award interest from the date of this Award
at the U.S. 6 month LIBOR rate, compounded on a monthly basis; and

(viii) Ecuador’s counterclaims, except that counterclaim specified in
subparagraph (iv) above, are dismissed; and

(ix) Each Party is ordered to bear its own costs of the proceedings and the
Claimants and the Respondent are ordered and mandated each to pay half of
ICSID’s and the Tribunal’s costs of and incidental to the proceedings.

877. In accordance with Article 48(4) of the ICSID Convention, Arbitrator
Stern dissents from the above majority and her statement of dissent is
attached”.

Dissenting Opinion

28. Arbitrator Stern dissented from the majority and attached a statement of dissent
(the “Dissent”). Prof. Stern summarized her dissent as follows”*:

“1. The present case is a very complex case to which the three members of the
Tribunal have been extremely devoted during many years. Although I greatly
respect and esteem my distinguished colleagues, I could not concur with them

*4 Dissent at 1-5.
21

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

on several important legal findings. While I subscribe to the analysis of the
facts and the law concluding that the Respondent acted in a disproportionate
manner in its reaction to the serious violation of its laws by the Claimants, I
am in complete disagreement with the way damages have been calculated,
which I consider to be resting on grossly incorrect legal bases. To be accurate,
Idon’t have a problem with figures, I have a problem with principles that were
applied (or not) to reach these figures.

2. As a matter of fact, I disagree with all the answers given to what the
Tribunal has called the “four ‘core’ threshold quantum issues” described in
the following manner (§457 of the Award):

These issues concern the impact (if any) on the Tribunal’s determination of
quantum of:

1) The Ecuadorian Law 42;

2) The Ecuadorian VAT Interpretative Law;

3) The Farmout Agreement; and

4) The fault of the Claimants prior to the Caducidad Decree.

3. To give a general overview of my main points of disagreement, I can state
that they are of two different types.

4. Firstly, there are — as is often encountered in a complex case as the one at
stake — disagreements that would not, by themselves, have prompted me to
write a dissent. On one hand, I consider that the consequence of the fault
committed by the Claimants, when they violated the Ecuadorian law, is overly
underestimated and insufficiently taking into account the importance that each
and every State assigns to the respect of its legal order by foreign companies.
On the other hand, I have a different analysis of the laws applicable in the
determination of damages. These disagreements concern respectively the
issues 4, 1 and 2 above.

5. Secondly, there is the fundamental impossibility for me to follow the
different statements in the Award relating to the effect this Tribunal should
give to the Farmout Agreement. The majority’s position on the effect of the
Farmout Agreement is, in my view, so egregious in legal terms and so full of
contradictions, that I could not but express my dissent. In my view, there are
two major questionable aspects in the majority’s approach to the question of
the effectiveness of the Farmout Agreement: the first is the analysis of the
question of the effectiveness of a legal act under Ecuadorian law, which is
based on a total lack of reasons, with the consequence that I was not able to
follow the “reasoning” from point A to point B, as well as gross errors of law
in the purported interpretation of the content of Ecuadorian law; the second,
which in my view is even a more serious matter, is the manifest excess of
power of the Award nullifying a contract concerning a company which not
only was not a party to the arbitration, but moreover — even if it had been a
party — could not be considered, being a Chinese company, as an investor over
which the Tribunal had jurisdiction under the US/Ecuador BIT”.

IL. THE ANNULMENT PROCEDURE

On October 9, 2012, the Republic of Ecuador filed with ICSID an application for
annulment of the Award and a request to stay the enforcement of the Award
(“Application”).

On October 11, 2012, pursuant to Rules 50(2)(a) and (b) of the ICSID Rules of
Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings of April 2006 (“ICSID Arbitration Rules”),
the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application and notified the Parties
of the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award under ICSID Arbitration Rule
54(2).

On January 18, 2013, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the
ICSID Arbitration Rules, notified the Parties that the three members of the ad hoc
Committee had accepted their appointments and that the ad hoc Committee was
therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. The ad hoc Committee was
composed of Prof. Juan Fernandez-Armesto, a national of the Kingdom of Spain,
President of the Committee; Judge Florentino Feliciano, a national of the
Philippines; and Mr. Rodrigo Oreamuno Blanco, a national of Costa Rica.
Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Senior ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as
Secretary of the ad hoc Committee.

On February 13, 2013, the Claimants filed a request to terminate the stay of
enforcement of the Award.

On March 25, 2013, the ad hoc Committee held a first session with the parties by
telephone conference. During the session the Parties agreed to a series of procedural
matters, including, that this proceeding would be governed by the 2006 ICSID
Arbitration Rules. The Parties confirmed that the Committee had been properly
constituted in accordance with the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration
Rules and that they had no objection to the appointment of any of its members.
During the session a schedule for the written and oral pleadings was fixed.

On April 5, 2013, the Republic of Ecuador filed observations on the Claimants’
request to terminate the stay of enforcement of the Award.

On April 10, 2013, the ad hoc Committee issued Procedural Order No. 1.

On April 22, 2013 the Claimants filed a reply to Ecuador’s observations of April 5;
and on May 6, 2013 Ecuador filed a rejoinder to the Claimants’ reply.

As directed in Procedural Order No. 1, a one-day hearing on the matter of the stay
of enforcement of the Award was held on May 13, 2013, in Paris, France.

On August 12, 2013, Ecuador filed its Memorial on Annulment.

On September 30, 2013, the ad hoc Committee issued its Decision on the
Claimants’ Request to Terminate the Stay of enforcement of the Award. In its
decision, the Committee ordered that the stay of enforcement be maintained for the

time being unconditionally.

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

Ill. GROUNDS FOR ANNULMENT IN THE CONVENTION

 

Respondent is invoking three grounds for annulment:

- that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in violation of Article
52(1)(b) of the Convention,

- that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure
in violation of Article 52 (1)(d) of the Convention, and/or

- that it failed to state the reasons on which the Award is based in violation
of Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention.

The Committee will briefly review these standards in light of the arguments
presented by both parties.

The starting point of such analysis is Article 53(1) of the Convention, which
explicitly states that the award “shall not be subject to any appeal”. The award may
only be subject to annulment if an ad hoc committee finds that one or more of the
five grounds for annulment established in Article 52(1) apply. Awards can be
annulled in their entirety “or any part thereof” [Article 52 (3)]. Committees,
however, are not empowered to amend or replace such awards, nor to review the
merits of the dispute. Factual findings and weighing of evidence made by tribunals
are, as a general rule, outside the remit of ad hoc committees>. An exception could
only be allowed if the applicant can prove that the errors of fact committed by the
tribunal are egregious; in such case it is likely that the error causes the award to fall
within one of the grounds for annulment listed in Article 52(1) of the Convention”®.

MANIFEST EXCESS OF POWERS

Respondent invokes as a first ground for annulment that by rendering the Award
“the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers” [Article 52(1)(b) of the
Convention]. Excess of powers is a polysemic concept:

- in its primary meaning it refers to situations where a tribunal adjudicates
disputes not included in the powers granted by the parties;

- but there is also a secondary sense: when a tribunal having jurisdiction
adopts an erroneous decision that exceeds its powers.

Manifest Jurisdictional Excess of Powers

The power of any arbitral tribunal derives from the authority vested upon it through
the consent of the parties; if arbitrators address disputes not included in the powers
granted to them, or decide issues not subject to their jurisdiction or not capable of
being solved by arbitration, their decision cannot stand and must be set aside.

°5 Malicorp, at 119.
2 Vivendi 1, at 251.

25

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

50. Excess of powers can be committed both by overreach and by default. Awards can
be annulled if tribunals:

- assume powers to which they are not entitled, be it by way of a decision
which is ultra petita or by an excess of jurisdiction,

- do not use the powers that have been vested upon them by the parties;
somewhat paradoxically, a manifest shortfall in the exercise of jurisdiction
may also constitute a manifest excess of power?’

51. Jurisdictional excess of powers requires a finding that the tribunal has misconstrued
the applicable law (e.g. the law regulating ownership of a protected investment) or
has wrongly established the relevant facts (e.g. whether an investor actually controls
an investment)”*. Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention requires that the excess of
jurisdiction resulting from such misconstruction or from such wrongful
determination be “manifest”; if that requirement is fulfilled, the tribunal’s award
deserves annulment.

Failure to apply the proper Law to the Merits

52. “Excess of powers” may exist not only in cases where tribunals wrongly assume
jurisdiction, but also in the case of tribunals who, having jurisdiction, fail to choose
the proper law with regard to the merits of the dispute.

53. Powers vested on arbitrators are not unlimited, but restricted. Arbitrators are
authorized by the parties to make their adjudication of the merits only in accordance
with applicable law, not on the basis of a law different from that agreed by the
parties or ex aequo et bono. If arbitrators do otherwise, they exceed the authority
received from the parties and their decision merits annulment.

54. Accepting this principle, ad hoc committees have concluded that arbitrators
manifestly exceed their powers if they:

- totally disregard the applicable law, or

- ground their award on a law other than the applicable law provided for in
Article 42 of the Convention, i.e. the rules of law agreed by the parties, or,
subsidiarily, the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute and such
rules of international law as may be applicable*”

55. For an award to be annulled, the committee must find that the error made by the
tribunal consisted in applying the wrong law to the merits, not of wrongly

interpreting the correct law. To understand the contrary would imply transforming
the well-settled standard of failure to apply the proper law into an error of law
standard, changing the nature of the ICSID annulment procedure, and transforming
it into an appeal mechanism with respect to the merits. Accepting this principle, ad
hoc committees have made it clear that an error in the interpretation of the proper
law does not constitute a manifest excess of powers*!.

Misinterpretation or misapplication of the proper law to be applied to the merits,
even if serious, does not justify annulment. In exceptional circumstances, however,
a gross or egregious error of law could be construed to amount to a failure to apply
the proper law, and could give rise to the possibility of annulment**. But the
threshold for applying this exceptional rule must be set very high?? — otherwise the
annulment mechanism permitted by the Convention would expand into a prohibited
appeal system on the merits™.

The Meaning of “Manifest”

Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention only permits annulment if a dual requirement is
met: the existence of an excess of powers, and that such excess of powers is
“manifest” — a term which the Parties agree means “perceived without difficulty”*>.

The Parties also agree that this important additional limitation applies both to a
jurisdictional excess of powers and to a failure to apply the proper law*®. This
conclusion, shared by this Committee, has been confirmed by previous
committees*”.

The above said, “manifest” does not prevent that in some cases an extensive
argumentation and analysis may be required to prove that the misuse of powers has
in fact occurred*®,

SERIOUS DEPARTURE FROM A FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE

The second ground for annulment invoked by Respondent is that the Tribunal
engaged in a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. If a tribunal
violates due process, and deprives a party of its right to be heard on equal terms and
to contradict the arguments of the other party, annulment of the award is justified;
justice cannot be achieved through a deeply flawed procedure.

Serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure is frequently invoked by
applicants, normally in conjunction with other grounds. But the hurdles for the

acceptance of this ground are high: in only a few cases has it led to the annulment
of ICSID awards”.

The hurdles are reflected in the wording of Article 52(1)(d), which involves three
requirements*”.

- The procedural rule must be fundamental, and only those essential to the
integrity and fairness of the arbitral process qualify as such;

- The tribunal must have departed from it;

- And the departure must be serious, i.e. the violation must have produced
a material impact on the award; the applicant however is not required to
prove that the violation of the rule of procedure was decisive for the
outcome, or that the applicant would have won the case if the rule had
been applied*!.

FAILURE TO STATE REASONS

The third ground for annulment on which Respondent relies is that the Award failed
to state the reasons on which it is based, as required by Article 52(1)(e) of the
Convention.

The obligation to state reasons stems from Article 48(3) of the Convention, which
requires tribunals to “deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal” and to
“state the reasons upon which [the award] is based”. Unreasoned awards can be
annulled, because parties should be able to ascertain to what extent a tribunal’s
findings are based on a correct interpretation of the law and on a proper evaluation
of the facts*?, But as long as reasons have been stated, even if incorrect,
unconvincing or non-exhaustive*’, the award cannot be annulled on this ground.
Article 52(1)(e) does not permit any inquiry into the quality or persuasiveness of
reasons. As was stated in MINE“*

“the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one
to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A to Point B, and eventually
to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law”*.

Nonetheless, ad hoc committees have held that contradictory or frivolous reasons
are to be equated with a failure to state reasons and can result in annulment**:

- Contradictory reasons cancel each other and will not enable the reader to
understand the tribunal’s motives*’;

- Frivolous reasons are those manifestly irrelevant and known to be so to
the tribunal**®.

But an examination of the reasons presented by a tribunal cannot be transformed
into a re-examination of the correctness of the factual and legal premises on which
the award is based. Committees do not have the power to review the adequacy of
the reasons set forth by the tribunal in its award. Rather, the role of the committee
is limited to analyzing whether a reader can understand how the tribunal arrived at
its conclusion. Broadening the scope of Article 52(1)(e) to comprise decisions with
inadequate reasons would transform the annulment proceeding into an appeal.

Similarly, the failure to address a particular argument raised by the Parties does not
warrant annulment, unless it is decisive to the tribunal’s decision (not obiter
dictum)”. Contradictions, inconsistencies and unreasonable statements in the
award can be cured applying the procedures set forth in Articles 49 and 50 of the
Convention, which provide the parties with the opportunity to request that the
tribunal address omissions, rectify material errors and clarify the interpretation of
dubious points”’.

Iv. GENERAL OUTLINE OF THE GROUNDS FOR ANNULMENT.

68. Respondent submits a total of 13 grounds for annulment

 

t!, The Committee will

analyze these grounds in three different sections:

In Chapter V the Committee will address Respondent’s grounds which
allegedly lead to the annulment of the Decision on Jurisdiction and
consequently would entail annulment of the Award in toto, for lack of
jurisdiction; the Committee will reject these grounds and confirm the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction;

In Chapter VI the Committee will analyze certain grounds for partial
annulment invoked by Respondent, based on the argument that OEPC
does not hold a 100% (but only a 60%) ownership interest in the
expropriated investment*?; the Committee will accept the first of these
grounds, and order the partial annulment of the Award to the extent that
the Tribunal assumed jurisdiction over an investment beneficially owned
by the Chinese investor Andes, who is not protected under the Treaty;

Chapter VII will be devoted to additional grounds submitted by Ecuador,
which if accepted would lead to annulment of the entire Award or of parts
thereof’; the Committee will dismiss these grounds.

51 Some of the grounds are divided into separate sub-division — see R I p. 83 — 218; Respondent has also
submitted a different structure of grounds in R III p. 315.

Decision on Annulment

Vv. THE DECISION ON JURISDICTION

Respondent avers that the Tribunal’s Decision on Jurisdiction must be annulled for
four separate reasons. Three of the reasons are related to the Tribunal’s decision to
assume jurisdiction over Claimants’ claims relating to caducidad, whilst the fourth
refers to the Tribunal’s decision to disregard the mandatory negotiation
requirements of the Treaty. In particular, Respondent requests the annulment of the
Decision on Jurisdiction:

Because the Tribunal rejected Ecuador’s arbitrability objection, and it did
so manifestly exceeding its powers and failing to state reasons (1.);

Because the Tribunal dismissed Ecuador’s objection that OPC had no
standing without stating any reasons and manifestly exceeding its powers

(2.);

Because the Tribunal failed to state reasons for rejecting Ecuador’s
inadmissibility objection (3.); and

Because the Tribunal also failed to give effect to the mandatory
negotiation requirement in Article VI.3 of the Treaty, manifestly
exceeding its powers (4.)

THE ARBITRABILITY OBJECTION

In the course of the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration, Ecuador made two
independent and separate jurisdictional objections related to caducidad™:

The “Jurisdictional Objection” based on the argument that certain
clauses agreed upon in the Participation Contract excluded caducidad
related matters from arbitration — an objection which (although rejected by
the Tribunal) is not a subject matter of this annulment procedure™>;

A second objection, introduced into the proceedings for the first time in
the hearing on jurisdiction®®, based on Article 196 of the Ecuadorian
Constitution [“CE”], the so called “Arbitrability Objection”, which is
the object of this annulment ground.

The Arbitrability Objection submitted by the Republic was based on the following
arguments>’:

The CE is at the summit of the legal pyramid in Ecuador; as a matter of
hierarchy of norms, the CE prevails over international treaties such as the
BIT;

72.

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

Article 196 CE attributes exclusive jurisdiction to the administrative
tribunals of Ecuador to adjudicate any dispute concerning actos
administrativos;

The Caducidad Decree is an acto administrativo;
In accordance with Article 196 CE any dispute concerning the Caducidad

Decree must be submitted to the Ecuadorian administrative tribunals, and
cannot be submitted to ICSID arbitration.

Ecuador’s Arbitrability Objection was rejected by the Tribunal at paras. 86, 87 and
88 of its Decision on Jurisdiction:

“86. More fundamentally, the Respondent cannot invoke its domestic law for
the purpose of avoiding ICSID jurisdiction under the Treaty. As noted earlier,
by virtue of the Treaty, the Respondent expressly consented to the submission
of disputes for settlement by binding arbitration under the Washington
Convention, thereby establishing the basis for this Tribunal’s jurisdiction in
the present circumstances. The Respondent’s Constitution, at Article 163,
recognizes that international treaties duly ratified by the Republic of Ecuador
shall prevail over any laws in Ecuador. This was confirmed at the Hearing by
the Respondent’s own legal expert on Ecuadorian law when he answered
questions posed to him by counsel for the Claimants:

«Q. You agree with me that pursuant to Article 163 of the constitution, in case
of conflict between those duly-ratified international Treaties, on the one hand,
and the arbitration law on the other hand, the provisions of the duly-ratified
international Treaties shall prevail; correct?

A. Yes. That is so.

i]

Q. Fair enough. A very simple assumption; if there was a duly-ratified Treaty
that affirmatively granted jurisdiction to an Arbitral Tribunal, and the
Ecuadorian arbitration law did not grant such jurisdiction because of a failure
to meet certain requirements in that law, the Tribunal would still have
jurisdiction pursuant to that Treaty; correct?

A. In such a situation, if Ecuadorian law, as you referred to, is a law or a lower
level regulation, that would be the case».

87. [...] In its closing argument, counsel for the Respondent also argued that
the “exclusive jurisdiction principle” according to which caducidad decrees
may only be challenged before the Ecuadorian administrative courts is
enshrined in the Ecuadorian Constitution, and that the Constitution prevails
over the Treaty: [quote omitted]

88. The premise to this line of argument is based on a finding that the
Participation Contract, be it Clause 22.2.1 or Clause 21.4, contains a clear and
unequivocal waiver to ICSID jurisdiction. The Tribunal has found earlier in
this Decision that no such waiver has been made under the Participation
Contract. For all these reasons, the Respondent's first jurisdictional objection
is accordingly denied”.

Decision on Annulment

Respondent’s Position

The Republic now argues that the Tribunal’s decision to dismiss the Arbitrability
Objection:

- Failed to state reasons and left the Arbitrability Objection unanswered; or
at least was addressed by the Tribunal in a contradictory fashion
equivalent to a failure to state reasons;

- Amounts to a manifest excess of powers, because it simply ignored
Ecuador’s argument that the CE prevails over the Treaty within the
pyramid of the Ecuadorian legal order>*.

Respondent avers that the Decision should be annulled under Article 52(1)(b) and
(e) of the Convention, for failure to state reasons and for manifest excess of powers,
causing the subsequent nullity of the Award in its entirety*’.

Claimants’ Position

Claimants disagree. In their opinion the Tribunal did not fail to state its reasons in
dismissing Ecuador’s Arbitrability Objection, because it referred to

- the general principle that a State cannot rely on its domestic law to override
its treaty obligations; and

- Article 163 CE which provides that treaties prevail over any laws of
Ecuador.

Furthermore, the Tribunal correctly assumed jurisdiction and so did not exceed its
powers at all, because Ecuador cannot invoke its domestic law (including the CE)
to avoid ICSID jurisdiction and because Article 196 CE simply does not provide
for the exclusive jurisdiction principle that Ecuador claims®'.

 

The Committee’s Decision

The Committee will first address the ground that the Tribunal failed to give reasons
for its decision to dismiss the Arbitrability Objection, and then it will analyze
whether the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers when it took such decision.

Articles 161, 163 and 196 CE® provide as follows:

correspondientes 6rganos de la Funcién Judicial en la forma que determina la
ley.

Failure to state Reasons

The Arbitrability Objection — the argument that the CE requires that disputes
affecting actos administrativos be submitted to administrative courts — was
dismissed by the Tribunal; the reasoning for such dismissal is to be found at
para. 86, where the Tribunal states:

- That Ecuador has “expressly consented to the submission of disputes for
settlement by binding arbitration under the Washington Convention,
thereby establishing the basis for this Tribunal’s jurisdiction”;

- That a State cannot “invoke its domestic law for the purpose of avoiding
ICSID jurisdiction under the Treaty”;

- That the CE recognizes in its Article 163 that “international treaties duly
ratified by the Republic of Ecuador shall prevail over any laws in
Ecuador”; and

- That Ecuador’s own legal expert on Ecuadorian law confirmed this
interpretation of Article 163 CE when examined at the hearing.

The Committee recalls that the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as
the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A to Point
B, and eventually to its conclusion®.

In the present case, it is true that the reasons (contained in para. 86 of the Decision)
precede the precise definition of the Arbitrability Objection (in para. 87). It is also
true that in its reasoning, the Tribunal does not clearly differentiate between the
Arbitrability Objection and the Jurisdictional Objection. But this lack of precision
may be excused, because the Arbitrability Objection only became relevant in the
course of the hearing, and in any case (as will be explained herein below) because
it is without merit. Parties cannot expect that Tribunals devote extensive reasoning
to arguments which, on their very face, cannot succeed.

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

Manifest Excess of Powers

82. Respondent also argues that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers when it
dismissed the Arbitrability Objection, because:

- It ignored the argument that the CE prevails over the Treaty and,
eventually,

- It wrongfully assumed jurisdiction over claims related to caducidad.

83. The first argument is not true; the Tribunal did not ignore the argument put forward
by Respondent that the CE prevails over the Treaty; the Tribunal rejected it,
explaining that a State cannot rely on its own domestic law to avoid ICSID
jurisdiction under the Treaty, and that Article 163 CE expressly provides that
treaties prevail over domestic laws™.

84. The second argument must be dismissed for total lack of merit: the Tribunal was
right in dismissing the Arbitrability Objection and thus assuming jurisdiction with
respect to claims related to caducidad — there is no manifest excess of powers. The
Committee concurs with the Tribunal that the Republic:

- Disregards the basic principle of international law that a State cannot
invoke its domestic law, including its constitutional provisions, for the
purpose of avoiding treaty obligations;

-  Blatantly ignores the very CE, which in Article 163 pays tribute to this
principle of international law, declaring that treaties form part of the
Republic’s internal legal order and prevail over municipal laws, and in
Article 161, which creates a general presumption that all international
treaties in force are in conformity with the Constitution;

-  Misconstrues the impact of Article 196 CE with regard to Ecuador’s
International Law obligations: Article 196 CE does not provide for the
exclusive jurisdiction principle that Ecuador claims; the constitutional rule
permits, but does not in any way mandate, recourse to administrative
courts; to understand otherwise would lead to the conclusion that all actos
administrativos are excluded from the scope of application of the BIT, and
that the only acts which investment tribunals can review are actos
legislativos and actos judiciales, adopted by the Ecuadorian legislative and

“ Decision on Jurisdiction at 86.

65 See Articles 27 and 46 VCLT, ratified by Ecuador (without reservation to Article 27). It is clear from
these international law principles, which codify existing customary international law on the subject, that
Ecuador cannot invoke its domestic law for the purpose of avoiding ICSID jurisdiction under the US-
Ecuador BIT. The same principle appplies even where constitutional provisions are relied upon (see the
judgement of the PCI) Polish Nationals in Danzig, p. 24: “It should however be observed that [...] a State
cannot adduce as against another State its own Constitution with a view to evading obligations incumbent
upon it under international law or treaties in force”).

See also IBM (Jurisdiction Decision) at 72:

“International treaties establish norms of conduct between and for the States, the mandatory character of
which cannot be avoided, the more since current International Law has the tendency to have its norms to
prevail even over the provisions of the Political Constitutions themselves. It appears as such in doctrine and
constitutional texts, but also in jurisprudence on human rights and community law”.

Respondent’s argument.

85. Inconclusion, Respondent’s first ground for annulment, that the Tribunal failed to
state reasons and manifestly exceeded its powers when it decided to assume
jurisdiction over Claimants’ claims relating to caducidad, is dismissed.

»

THE STANDING OBJECTION

86. In this arbitration OPC and OEPC are acting as Claimants - OPC being OEPC’s
parent company. Respondent filed an objection against OPC’s participation (the
“Standing Objection”).

87. The Standing Objection was submitted for the first time in Respondent’s Reply on
Jurisdiction® (the “Reply on Jurisdiction”). Respondent argued that OPC’s
claims should be dismissed for four independent reasons®’. The first reason was
that “OPC [had] failed to establish a basis for its standing as an investor”. This
Standing Objection was developed in five paragraphs (90 — 94), in which the
Republic raised two lines of reasoning:

88. First, Respondent stated that®:

“QQ. [...] OPC’s mere claim to be the ‘ultimate parent’ of a US company that
has an investment in Ecuador [...] is not sufficient to establish that OPC is
also an investor under the Treaty.

91. To prove its investor status, OPC would have to demonstrate how exactly
it controls OEPC in order to establish that its connection to OEPC is close
enough not to reach the ‘cut-off point beyond which claims would not be
permissible as they would have only a remote connection to the affected
company’. OPC failed to do so and thus failed to establish a basis for its
standing as investor”. [Footnotes omitted].

89. Second, Respondent argued that since OPC’s claims are factually and legally
identical to OEPC’s claims, they are not admissible in an arbitration where OEPC
has appeared as a party and is asserting the same claims; investment tribunals have
only granted standing to shareholders, where the shareholders were the true
investors and the companies that were directly affected were mere local vehicles”.

 

90. The Tribunal dismissed Respondent’s arguments and confirmed its jurisdiction over
OPC’s claims in para. 89 of the Decision on Jurisdiction:

“89. It follows that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Claimants’ claims
under both the Participation Contract and the Treaty. For this reason, the
Respondent’s submission that Claimant OPC, the ‘ultimate parent’ of OEPC,
lacks standing to assert claims as an investor in the circumstances because it

is not a signatory to the Participation Contract is moot and need not be
addressed as part of this Decision on Jurisdiction”.

Respondent’s Position

The Republic complains that the Tribunal summarized Ecuador’s position in a
single paragraph and rejected the Standing Objection in two sentences, without
addressing its arguments, giving rise to a failure to state reasons and to a manifest
excess of powers”.

Claimants’ Position
Claimants disagree.

It is Claimants’ submission that it was in its Reply on Jurisdiction when the
Republic for the first time raised the Standing Objection, and it only devoted six
paragraphs to the argument and never disputed that OPC indirectly held a 100%
stake in OEPC. The Tribunal dismissed Ecuador’s objection by stating that OPC
was the “ultimate parent” of OEPC. This reflected the Tribunal’s understanding
that OPC owned and controlled OEPC and had suffered an injury from the illegal
expropriation of its Ecuadorian subsidiary”!.

Claimants add that there can be no excess of powers, because the Treaty expressly
provides that “investment” means:

“every kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or controlled
directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party”.

Since OPC is a company of the “other Party” and it indirectly owns and controls
OEPC, the Tribunal had a tenable basis for finding that OEPC had standing”.

 

The Committee’s De: n

The Committee will first address the issue of failure to state reasons and then the
manifest excess of powers argument.

Failure to state Reasons

Although the Standing Objection was addressed in the body of Respondent’s Reply
submission, in its prayer for relief there was no specific request that the Tribunal
dismiss the claims from OPC for lack of standing. The only prayer for relief was a
request for a “declaration that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the Claimants’
claims for the reasons given in Ecuador’s objections to jurisdiction — but there was
no subsidiary request that if the Tribunal admitted jurisdiction over OEPC’s claims,
it should in any case dismiss those from OPC because of the Standing Objection’’.

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

When Article 52(1)(e) provides that the award can be annulled when it “has failed
to state the reasons on which it is based”, the rule is referring to the reasons used to
support the award’s dispositive section in accordance with the parties’ relief. If
there is no specific request for relief there is, thus, no need to give reasons.

But although there was no obligation to provide reasons, the Tribunal did address
OPC’s alleged lack of legal standing in para. 89 of the Decision, stating the
following reasons for rejecting the proposition:

- First, because the Tribunal had already found that it had jurisdiction under
the Treaty, and consequently any argument that OPC lacked standing for
failure to sign the Participation Contract was moot;

- And second, because OPC was the “ultimate parent” of OEPC, a statement
which reflected the Tribunal’s understanding that OPC owned and
controlled OEPC and was thus an investor under the Treaty.

 

In this second leg of the argument the Tribunal addressed, albeit in a very succinct
manner, the first issue raised in the Standing Objection: whether OPC’s control was
too remote to warrant standing.

The Decision, however, does not seem to analyze Respondent’s second supporting
argument: that OPC lacked legal standing because it was replicating part of OEPC’s
treaty claims. Ecuador is now contending that this failure to address a second
supporting argument amounts to a failure to state reasons, which should lead to
annulment of the entire Award.

. The Republic’s contention cannot succeed, because it is settled law that a tribunal

has no obligation to address each and every argument put forth by the parties”.

Manifest Excess of Powers

. Respondent’s subsidiary argument that by (implicitly) dismissing its Standing

Objection and accepting jurisdiction over OPC’s claims, the Tribunal manifestly
exceeded its powers must also be dismissed.

Article I.1.(a) of the Treaty provides that:

“investment’ means every kind of investment in the territory of one Party
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the
other Party, such as equity, debt, and service and investment contracts”.

The Treaty thus extends its protections to any U.S. company which - either directly
or indirectly — owns or controls an investment in the Republic of Ecuador.

It is a fact that OPC is the indirect owner of 100% of the shares in OEPC, and that
both are U.S. corporations. There is a general presumption that a majority
shareholder also controls the company, a presumption which can only be rebutted
if there are special elements which create doubts about the owner’s control’> — and

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

Ecuador has pled no such special elements. There thus can be no question that
OPC, a U.S. corporation, controls OEPC, and as such has standing to act as
Claimant in the present arbitration. This being so, the Tribunal cannot have
exceeded its powers by confirming OPC’s status as Claimant and accepting
jurisdiction to hear its claims.

Summing up, Respondent’s second ground for annulment, that the Tribunal
manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state reasons when it failed to reject
OPC’s Standing Objection, is dismissed.

THE INADMISSIBILITY OBJECTION

In its Reply on Jurisdiction, Respondent raised a subsidiary argument: even if the
Tribunal had jurisdiction over OEPC’s treaty claims, those claims would be
premature, because Claimants had made no attempt to challenge the Caducidad
Decree before the Ecuadorian administrative courts (the “Inadmissibility
Objection’).

. This argument was allegedly supported by a number of investment tribunals that

had held that a treaty claim is premature, unless there has been a reasonable attempt
by the investor either to pursue redress in the forum specified in the contract or
otherwise petition local authorities to reverse the act of which the investor
complains”. As a consequence, the Republic requested that, pending Claimants’
action before the Ecuadorian courts, the arbitration be suspended”.

Respondent’s Position

According to Respondent, in its Decision on Jurisdiction the Tribunal rejected the
Inadmissibility Objection in a single paragraph, which refers to “the reasons set
forth in this decision”, when in fact the Decision contains no reasons whatsoever in
this regard’*. This failure to state reasons is a ground for annulment.

Claimants’ Position

Claimants disagree. In their opinion, the Tribunal’s reasoning can be followed from
A to B and does not warrant annulment. The Inadmissibility Objection was raised
belatedly and briefly in Ecuador’s Reply on Jurisdiction and addressed by Ecuador
for only a few minutes in two days of jurisdictional hearings”.

The Tribunal rejected it with sufficient reasons, such reasons being that Ecuador
could not use its domestic law to evade its international law obligations, that
Ecuador expressly consented to submission of disputes for settlement by binding
arbitration under the Convention, that the Participation Contract did not waive
Claimants’ rights to pursue ICSID arbitration and that it would have served no

purpose to pursue local remedies given that attempts to reach a negotiated solution
were indeed futile®®.

The Committee’s Decision

. The Tribunal addressed Respondent’s Inadmissibility Objection in the body and in

the dispositive section of its Decision on Jurisdiction:

“96. Finally, it is recalled that the Respondent has requested, as part of its
second jurisdictional objection, ‘an order that this arbitration be stayed until
OEPC challenges the Caducidad Decree in the competent Ecuadorian
administrative court and that court issues a final ruling on such challenge’.
This request is made on the basis of the allegation that the Claimants’ claims
are premature because the Claimants have made no attempt to challenge the
Caducidad Decree before the Ecuadorian administrative courts. For the
reasons set forth in this Decision on Jurisdiction, the Claimants were not
required to do so, and this request is accordingly denied”.

“97. For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal decides and declares as follows:
... (iii) the Respondent’s alternative request for ‘an order that this arbitration
be stayed until OEPC challenges the Caducidad Decree in the competent
Ecuadorian administrative court and that court issues a final ruling on such
challenge’ is denied; ...”

It is clear from para. 96 that the Tribunal decided that Respondent’s Inadmissibility
Objection should be dismissed, because Claimants were not required to challenge
the Caducidad Decree before the Ecuadorian Courts. The reasoning for this finding,
however, is not specifically mentioned, and the Tribunal simply makes a general
referral to “the reasons set forth in this Decision on Jurisdiction”.

. It is Respondent’s contention that in the remaining parts of the Decision on

Jurisdiction no explicit reasoning supporting the Tribunal’s rejection of the
Inadmissibility Objection can be found, and that this failure to state reasons should
lead to an annulment of the Award.

In the Committee’s opinion, the generic cross reference to the Decision in toto must
be understood as a renvoi to para. 86 of the Decision, which conveys the implicit
argument that if investment disputes have to be submitted to settlement by binding
arbitration, such requirement precludes exhaustion of local remedies as a pre-
condition.

The requirement that decisions be reasoned must be gauged in relation to the
reasonableness and chance of success of the underlying proposition. In the present
case, the Respondent’s proposition that local remedies against the Caducidad
Decree before the administrative courts of Ecuador must be exhausted, and that in
the meantime the arbitration would have to be stayed, is unsupported either in the
Treaty or in the Convention, does not lead to reasonable results and ab initio had a
very low chance of success. As the Helnan Committee explained:

89C Tat 94.

40

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

“it would empty the development of investment arbitration of much of its force
and effect, if, despite a clear intention of States parties not to require the
pursuit of local remedies as a pre-condition to arbitration, such a requirement
were to be read back in as part of the substantive cause of action’”*!.

116. In these circumstances, succinct and implied reasons — as those provided by the
Tribunal — may be sufficient to defer annulment of the Award.

 

  

117. The Committee consequently comes to the conclusion that Respondent’s third
ground for annulment, that the Tribunal failed to state reasons when it rejected the
Respondent’s Inadmissibility Objection, should be dismissed.

4. THE NEGOTIATION OBJECTION

118. The caducidad administrative procedure started in 2004. In the course of a two
year long period, OEPC was granted and exercised its right to be heard and the
Ecuadorian administrative authorities debated whether the imposition of the
sanction of caducidad against OEPC was appropriate. It is a fact, acknowledged in
the very Caducidad Decree, that in the course of this procedure OEPC presented a
settlement proposal, which was rejected by PetroEcuador®?. On May 15, 2006 the
Caducidad Decree was issued by Ecuador’s Minister of Energy and Mines. Two
days thereafter, on May 17, 2006, Claimants filed their request for arbitration (the
“Request for Arbitration”).

119. During the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration, Respondent submitted a
jurisdictional objection (the “Negotiation Objection”), arguing that Claimants had
failed to respect the six-month waiting period for the submission of the dispute to
arbitration, mandated by Article VI.3 of the Treaty, which reads as follows:

“3, (a) Provided that the national or company concerned has not submitted the
dispute for resolution under paragraph 2 (a) or (b) and that six months have

elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose, the national or company
concerned may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute
for settlement by binding arbitration: [...]”. [Emphasis added].

120. According to Respondent, this cooling-off period represents one of the
jurisdictional requirements in the Treaty, and an investor’s disregard of this rule
deprives an arbitral tribunal of jurisdiction*’.

The Tribunal’s Decision

121. The Tribunal dismissed the Negotiation Objection in its Decision on Jurisdiction.
After summarizing the Parties’ respective position in paras. 90 — 92, the Tribunal
explained its decision in paras. 93 — 95:

“93, In this regard, the Tribunal recalls that the caducidad procedure at issue
in this arbitration was in fact initiated in 2004. As noted earlier, for some 18
months or so prior to the issuance of the actual Caducidad Decree on 15 May

2006, OEPC made a number of submissions seeking to rebut the allegations
on the basis of which the caducidad procedure was initiated, but to no avail.

94. Furthermore, the Tribunal accepts, albeit without prejudging the merits,
that attempts at reaching a negotiated solution were indeed futile in the
circumstances.

95. The Respondent’s second jurisdictional objection is accordingly denied”.
[Footnotes omitted].

Respondent’s Position

. The Republic states that the Tribunal found that the Article VI.3 requirement had
been met for two reasons:

- Because Claimants had indeed complied with the mandatory six month
waiting period and

- Because in any case negotiations between the two Parties would have been
futile.

It is Respondent’s contention that both findings are grossly incorrect*:

- Claimants did not comply with the mandatory six month negotiation
procedure, because the Tribunal calculated the time period from the
beginning of the caducidad proceedings, when in fact it should have been
calculated from the issuance of the Caducidad Decree — the date when the
dispute actually arose; and Claimants filed the arbitration just two days
thereafter, without any prior notice to the Republic®; previous tribunals
have dismissed jurisdiction on this very ground®®,

- As regards futility, Ecuador argues that settlement discussion would not
have been futile*’ and that the Tribunal decided the contrary with almost
no discussion and no acknowledgement of Claimants’ burden to prove®*.

In Ecuador’s view, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by refusing to give
effect to the mandatory negotiation requirements set out in Article VI.3 of the
Treaty®?.

Claimants’ Position
Claimants disagree.

As regards the futility argument, Claimants submit that the Tribunal cited extensive
arbitral precedent proving that where negotiations are bound to be futile, there is no

need for the waiting period to have fully lapsed. Ecuador is constrained to accept
this legal premise; it only disputes the Tribunal’s factual determination that the
negotiations would have been futile — a question which falls outside the scope of
review of an annulment Committee”.

. Claimants also submit that Ecuador’s argument that a dispute only arose on the date

of the Caducidad Decree, two days before Claimants filed this case at ICSID, is
disingenuous. The dispute already existed in the course of the caducidad
procedure®!. In any case these factual findings are not within the purview of
annulment committees”.

The Committee’s Decision

Respondent argues that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers when it
assumed jurisdiction, without respecting the mandatory six-month negotiation
requirement established in Article VI.3. of the Treaty and requests that the Award
be annulled for this reason.

The Tribunal’s decision is based on two arguments:

- First, the Tribunal established that for some “18 months or so” prior to the
Caducidad Decree OEPC had made a number of submissions seeking to
rebut the allegations on the basis of which the caducidad procedure had
been initiated; and

- Second, the Tribunal found that in the circumstances any attempt at
reaching a negotiated solution was futile; and in a footnote, the Tribunal
referred to a number of decisions from investment tribunals, which had
held that where negotiations are bound to be futile, there is no need for the
waiting period to have fully lapsed”.

The Committee will examine the futility reason first

The Tribunal cited extensive arbitral precedent establishing that where negotiations
are bound to be futile, there is no need for the waiting period to lapse before
claimant is authorized to file the Request for Arbitration. Respondent does not
contest that the Tribunal’s legal argument is right. Respondent’s reasoning is
different: it submits that

“with almost no discussion of the issue and no acknowledgement of
Claimants’ burden to prove, the Tribunal simply concluded that attempts to
reaching a negotiated solution were indeed futile”™*.

. In the present case, the Tribunal, after reviewing and weighing the evidence, came

to the conclusion that attempts at reaching a negotiated settlement were indeed

futile, that the six-month waiting period mandated by Article VI.3. of the Treaty
could be dispensed with, and that Respondent’s Negotiation Objection should be
dismissed. The Tribunal’s factual determination seems reasonable, and the
Tribunal’s legal argument is settled law”.

133. The Tribunal’s dismissal of the Negotiation Objection, based on the argument that
any further negotiation would be futile, must stand.

134, Given that the Tribunal correctly dismissed the Negotiation Objection on the basis
of futility, the questions

- whether OEPC had made a number of allegations in the course of the
caducidad procedure,

- whether these allegations were made before or after the dispute arose, and

- whether these allegations provide an additional reason which supports the
Tribunal’s decision to dismiss the Negotiation Objection

have become moot and need not be addressed.
135. Summing up, Respondent’s fourth ground for annulment, that the Tribunal

manifestly exceeded its powers when it rejected Respondent’s Negotiation
Objection, is dismissed.

Decision on Annulment

PARTIAL ANNULMENT FOR WRONGFUL ASSUMPTION OF
JURISDICTION OVER 40% OF CLAIMANTS’ INVESTMENT

Having dismissed Respondent’s request that the Decision on Jurisdiction be
annulled, the Committee must now turn to the grounds for partial annulment of the
Award invoked by Ecuador. These grounds revolve around the argument that the
Tribunal has wrongly assumed jurisdiction over a 40% share of Claimants’
investment, because that share now belongs to Andes, a Chinese investor not
protected by the Treaty.

. Pro memoria: The execution of the Farmout Agreement between OEPC and AEC

on October 1, 2000 (together with the Joint Operating Agreement) implied the
transfer of a 40% ownership interest in the Block 15 investment from OEPC to AEC
(who thereafter resold its interest to the Chinese company Andes). Since the parties
failed to obtain the required authorization from the Ecuadorian Minister, the
transfer eventually triggered Ecuador’s declaration of caducidad of the
Participation Contract.

The Tribunal found in the Award that Ecuador adopted this caducidad declaration
in breach of Ecuadorian and customary international law, that the Caducidad
Decree resulted in “a measure tantamount to expropriation” and that the Republic
was required to pay damages to Claimants (albeit reduced by a factor of 25%,
because OEPC had failed to secure the required ministerial authorization for the
transfer of rights under the Farmout Agreement).

The grounds for partial annulment submitted by Respondent which will be analyzed
in this Chapter address the following questions:

- Did the Tribunal wrongly assume jurisdiction over the 40% investment in
Block 15 now beneficially owned by the Chinese investor Andes (and
previously by the Bermudan company AEC)?

- As aconsequence thereof, does the Tribunal’s decision to order Ecuador
to compensate OEPC for that 40% interest fall outside its jurisdiction?

The Award

The Tribunal was perfectly aware of the significance of these questions. It
requested additional submissions from the Parties and held a hearing on this very
topic. Having heard the Parties, the Tribunal was unable to reach a unanimous
decision: the majority took one route and arbitrator Stern dissented.

. Inthe Award the majority of the Tribunal accepted the approach of awarding 100%

of the value of the investment: it found that since the assignment of rights from the
Participation Contract had not been authorized by the Ecuadorian Minister, such
assignment was “null and void and has no validity whatsoever, and the Tribunal so
finds”. The assignment “must therefore be disregarded by the Tribunal for purposes
of determining the compensation to which Claimants are entitled”*°. With the result

that in the Tribunal’s opinion, OEPC continued to own, as of the date of the
Caducidad Decree, 100% of the rights under the Participation Agreement and had
to be compensated for 100% of the value of Block 15°’.

Arbitrator Stern strongly dissented.

. Inher opinion at the time of the Caducidad Decree the rights under the Participation

Contract were owned 60% by OEPC and 40% by AEC®®, and OEPC had been fully
paid for the assignment of its 40% interest”. Prof. Stern then found that both under
New York and under Ecuadorian law the Farmout Agreement, not having been
invalidated either by a New York Court or an Ecuadorian Court, should have been
considered as still in force and binding!” and that the ICSID Tribunal exceeded its
powers in annulling AEC’s rights thereunder!®!.

Arbitrator Stern added that title to AEC’s 40% interest in Block 15 was split, the
nominal legal title belonging to OEPC and the beneficial interest to AEC!®?. In
accordance with international law, only the beneficial owner, AEC could claim
compensation for expropriation'. Consequently, OEPC should only have
received 60% of the total damages, in line with the Chorzéw Factory principle of
full recovery!™.

Prof. Stern concluded with the remark that there is no unfairness in Ecuador
acquiring a 100% interest in Block 15, and being only obliged to compensate 60%
of its value — this being purely the result of the limited jurisdiction of ICSID
tribunals!®.

Ecuador’s Request

In the present annulment procedure, Ecuador requests that the Award be partially
annulled, to the extent that it compensates Claimants with any amount exceeding
60% of the value of Block 15'°°. The request is based on three separate grounds
for annulment:

- That the Tribunal wrongly assumed jurisdiction over AEC’s investment,
thus manifestly exceeding its powers;

- That when the Tribunal assessed damages it failed to apply international
law principles, and that this failure amounts to a manifest excess of
powers; and

147. The Committee will approach this request by

1.

- First summarizing the Tribunal’s findings (1.),
- Then summarizing Respondent’s and Claimants’ positions (2. and 3.),

- And thereafter explaining its own decision (4.)

THE AWARD

148. The Tribunal devoted a whole section!®” of the Award to the issue of whether

Claimants are entitled to 100% or only to 60% of the value of Block 15. The
analysis starts with paras 613 and 614, which frame the question:

“613. The Tribunal will now deal with the central issue which, in its view,
after the parties’ arguments have been stripped of their complex legal
ramifications, comes down to the following: does the execution by OEPC of
the Farmout Agreement with AEC on | October 2000 (together with the Joint
Operating Agreement) allow Ecuador, following caducidad, to compensate
OEPC for 60% only of its interest in Block 15 or is it legally obliged to
compensate OEPC for 100% of its interest in Block 15, being precisely what
it has acquired upon the issuance of the Caducidad Decree?

614. In other words, the key issue to be addressed in this section is whether
any assignment to AEC of the 40% beneficial interest in Block 15 was actually
effected by the Farmout Agreements (i.e., the Farmout Agreement and the
Joint Operating Agreement) or whether any such purported assignment was
void and therefore without legal effect. If the former, OEPC would be entitled
to recover 100% of the established value of Block 15 under the relevant
principles of international law; if the latter, it could recover 60% only”.
[Footnote omitted].

149. Since the Farmout agreement is subject to New York law, the Tribunal then

150.

analysed whether a valid assignment of an equitable interest had taken place, both
under Ecuadorian and New York law

108

Ecuadorian Law

The Tribunal first recalled Clause 16.1 of the Participation Contract and Article 79
of the Ley de Hidrocarburos (“HCL”):

“16.1. La transferencia de este Contrato de Participacién o la cesi6n a terceros
de los derechos provenientes del mismo deberdn ser autorizados por el
Ministro del Ramo de conformidad con las leyes y reglamentos vigentes; de

manera especial se cumpliran las disposiciones previstas en el articulo 79 de
la Ley de Hidrocarburos y en los Decretos Ejecutivos Nos. 809, 2713 y 1179”.

“Art. 79: La transferencia de un contrato o la cesién a terceros de derechos
provenientes de un contrato, serdn nulas y no tendrén valor alguno si no
procede autorizacién del Ministerio del Ramo, sin perjuicio de la declaracién
de caducidad segtin lo previsto en la presente ley’.

Applying Article 79 HCL the Tribunal came to the following conclusions:
- The purported assignment had no legal effect “and OEPC retained 100%
of both the legal and beneficial ownership of all rights in the Participation

Contract” 109.

- The invalidity of any purported assignment did not affect the right of the
State to declare caducidad'"”.

After having reached these conclusions, the Tribunal analysed and rejected
Respondent’s counter-arguments:

The Requirement of Judicial Declaration of Nullity

. The first counter-argument submitted by Respondent was that the assignment

created an “absolute nullity” which required a judicial declaration!''.

. The Tribunal disagreed. In its opinion!!?

“622. Although not expressly stated in the Ecuadorian Civil Code, the
Ecuadorian Supreme Court has confirmed on a number of occasions that
Ecuadorian law recognizes automatic nullity or inexistence”.

The Tribunal then referred to four cases in which the Supreme Court of Ecuador
had differentiated between the categories of inexistence, absolute nullity and
relative nullity and concluded that the!!?

“626. [...] intended assignment that occurred under the Farmout Agreement
and the Joint Operating Agreement undoubtedly meets the criteria [...] for
inexistence”

The Tribunal continued!"*:

“626. [...] Where the law itself stipulates that an act has “no validity
whatsoever” there is no need on its face for the assignment to be declared
invalid by a judge, because it could never be valid in the first place — it lacked
an essential element required for life”.

Decision on Annulment

And then explained!!:

“628. As noted above, Article 79 of the HCL is categorical in expressing, not
only the illegal act, but also the consequence of the illegality. Significantly, a
similar provision (Article 1745 of the [1970] Civil Code [Article 1718 of the
2005 Civil Code]) was being applied by the Supreme Court in the above case
(and in others discussed below). Article 1745 [1718] provides that, where the
law requires a public deed, contracts signed in another form “will be deemed
as non-executed or signed”. Thus, the consequence of the illegality is
specified. The result of the Court’s decision that such contracts are
“inexistent” is that Article 1745 [1718] is given effect without the need for a
judicial declaration. In other words, where the law itself clearly states that the
contract is deemed to be unexecuted, and therefore has no life, there is no
requirement for judicial confirmation. Similarly, under Article 79 [HCL], the
law itself has deemed that an unauthorised assignment has no validity
whatsoever, and therefore has no life. The logical consequence of this
provision is that no further action is required to invalidate an unauthorised
assignment”.

New York Law

156. The Tribunal then analysed the issue under New York law and concluded that New
York law results in exactly the same conclusion as Ecuadorian law: where the
governing law of the assignment is a foreign law, New York courts apply the
governing law of the contract containing the non-assignment clause, when
interpreting that clause. As clause 7.02 of the Farmout Agreement states that
mandatory Ecuadorian laws governing the Participation Contract apply, New York
courts would give effect to such laws, including the HCL""®.

Findings
157. In para. 650 the Tribunal came to its main finding:

“650. It follows that, pursuant to New York and Ecuadorian law, the purported
assignment by OEPC to AEC of rights under the Participation Contract
pursuant to the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement is null
and void and has no validity whatsoever and the Tribunal so finds. Under the
doctrine of inexistence and under New York law, there is no requirement that
the Court must first declare the assignment to be invalid”!!”.

The Tribunal then added:

“650. [...] As such, the purported assignment of rights under the Farmout
Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement was not valid and produced no
legal effect. It must therefore be disregarded by the Tribunal for purposes of
determining the compensation to which the Claimants are entitled.
Consequently, the Tribunal finds that OEPC continued to own, as of the date

of the Caducidad Decree, 100% of the rights under the Participation
Contract’”’!'® [Footnote ommitted].

With the following result:

“651. The Tribunal accordingly concludes that the Respondent is obliged to
compensate the Claimants for 100% of their interest in Block 15 which it
acquired upon the issuance of the Caducidad Decree” !°.

The Severance Issue

Although the Tribunal found that the assignment of rights as between OEPC and
AEC was inexistent, at the same time it concluded that “the Farmout Agreement
itself remains a valid contract between OEPC and AEC”, because Article 79 HCL
is concerned with the legal effect of the assignment itself and does not invalidate
the Farmout Agreement or the Joint Operating Agreement!”°. This idea, that it is
possible to sever the assignment of rights, which is null, and the Farmout
Agreement, which remains valid, is further developed in para. 635:

“635. [...] For the avoidance of doubt, as noted above, the Tribunal reiterates
that in the present case it is the validity of the assignment that is under scrutiny,
and not the validity of the Farmout Agreement or the Joint Operating
Agreement. The Tribunal’s findings on the validity of the assignment do not
affect other obligations that might arise between the parties to the Farmout
Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement (such parties being different to
[sic] those in the present arbitration), nor does it affect the ability of AEC to
seek damages from OEPC for a failure to comply with the terms of those
Agreements, such as obtaining necessary government consent for the
assignment”. [Footnote omitted].

The idea that the transaction effected between OEPC and AEC can be severed in
two parts,

- the assignment of rights, which is automatically null and inexistent,

- and the rest of the Farmout and Joint Operating Agreements, which
remains valid,

is one of the most disputed and obscure conclusions of the Award. The issue was
the subject of extensive debate in the course of the annulment hearing, with the

Parties holding opposite interpretations!?!.

Three additional Arguments of Respondent

In the final part of its analysis, the Tribunal dismissed three additional arguments
submitted by Respondent:

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

161. (i) The first argument was unjust enrichment. The Tribunal stated as follows!”?:

“654. [...] the Tribunal notes that the invalidity of the assignment under New
York and Ecuadorian law does not mean that AEC (or Andes) may not have
recourse against OEPC under the Farmout Agreement. As mentioned earlier,
the unauthorised assignment does not invalidate the Farmout Agreement as
between the assignor, OEPC and the assignee, AEC nor is the legal position
affected by the fact that the assignor and the assignee actually implemented
inter se parts of the legally invalid and unauthorised assignment. OEPC
promised to deliver certain rights to AEC under the Farmout Agreement, but
due to its failure to secure authorisation from the Ministry it was in breach of
that promise. This breach of contract may form the basis of a claim by AEC
(or Andes) against OEPC. These factors weigh heavily against any unjust
enrichment arguments raised in respect to OEPC’s entitlement to receive
compensation for 100% of the interests in the Participation Contract”.

162. (ii) The second argument related to the Chorzéw Factory dictum, which reads as

follows!™:

“This principle has the effect, on the one hand, of excluding from the
damage to be estimated, injury resulting for third parties from the unlawful act
and, on the other hand, of not excluding from the damage the amount of debts
and other obligations for which the injured party is responsible. The damage
suffered by the Oberschlesische in respect of the Chorzow undertaking is
therefore equivalent to the total value—but to that total only—of the property,
rights and interests of this Company in that undertaking, without deducting
liabilities”. [Emphasis added].

 

163. The Tribunal found!”*;

“656. As a matter of international law, any liability that OEPC might have to
AEC or Andes under various other agreements (including the Farmout
Agreement) does not affect the Claimants’ right to receive compensation from
Ecuador. Ecuador cannot discount OEPC’s claim by reference to liabilities
that may be owed to third parties such as AEC. This principle is clearly
recognised in the Chorzéw Factory dictum ...”.

164. (iii) The third argument is twofold:

that the Claimants allegedly lacked standing to claim damages beyond
their “remaining” 60% interest in Block 15; and

that no willing buyer would pay a price based on 100% of the value of
Block 15, since OEPC only owns a 60% interest.

“658. [...] In view of the Tribunal’s conclusion in relation to the invalidity of
the assignment as set out above, this objection of the Respondent has become
moot”.

RESPONDENT’S POSITION

Respondent avers that the Tribunal should have granted Claimants damages
equivalent to 60% of the value of Block 15, and that its decision to calculate the
damages as 100% of such value should be annulled, leading to a partial annulment
of the Award. Respondent invokes three separate grounds for annulment!”°:

- First, that the Tribunal exercised ratione personae jurisdiction over a
Chinese company, Andes, without any entitlement arising out of the
Treaty or the Participation Contract, thus manifestly exceeding its powers
(A.);

- Second, that the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable rules of
international law on damages, incurring in a manifest excess of powers
(B.); and

- Third, that the Tribunal acted with manifest excess of powers and failed to
state reasons in reaching the conclusion that the assignment of the Farmout
Agreement would be inexistent under Ecuadorian law (C.)

The Exercise of ratione personae Jurisdiction over Andes

Respondent argues that there is an excess of powers if a tribunal exercises
jurisdiction over a company which is not a party to the arbitration agreement and is
not an investor protected by the applicable BIT!”’.

It is undisputed that the Treaty does not protect Chinese nationals. The ICSID
arbitration clause contained in the Participation Contract only benefits the parties
to such Contract — and Andes does not qualify as such!?*.

The Tribunal, by deciding that Claimants are entitled to damages amounting to
100% of the value of Block 15, took three decisions which affected Andes without
having jurisdiction over it!??:

- First, it nullified the Farmout Agreement without Andes being a party to
this arbitration;

- Second, by granting Claimants damages equivalent to 100% of the value
of Block 15, it effectively granted Andes 40% of that sum (if Claimants
comply with the 2006 Letter Agreement and transfer to Andes 40% of
whatever proceeds they obtain);

- Third, the Tribunal expropriated Andes of its investment of 40% of Block

to Andes 40% of the proceeds of the underlying arbitration.

Failure to apply the proper Rules of International Law on Damages

Respondent submits that the Tribunal also manifestly exceeded its powers when it
failed to apply the proper principles of international law relating to the assessment
of damages'*°. The Tribunal specifically failed to apply the following rules and
principles:

The Inexistence of the Assignment of the Farmout Agreement

Respondent finally argues that if one assumes — as the Tribunal has concluded —
that Ecuador had committed an unlawful expropriation, Claimants would only be
entitled to claim the value of their investment, i.e. their 60% ownership stake in
Block 15 (minus their contributory fault). By finding the assignment to be
inexistent, however, the Tribunal allowed Claimants to recover the value of their
investment and the value of AEC’s 40% stake in Block 15. This finding should be
annulled for manifest excess of powers and for resting the decision on insufficient,
frivolous and contradictory reasons!**:

(i) The excess of powers derives from the fact that the Tribunal actually invented a
set of rules for awarding Claimants damages far greater than the loss they
sustained!* and cherry picked one provision of the HCL, disregarding all the other
provisions of the law!*°.

There is a second reason why the Tribunal committed an excess of powers: it is a
general principle of law that the nullity or inexistence of a contract may be declared
if, and only if, all the parties to the contract are parties to the judicial process. Given
that AEC was not a party to the underlying arbitration, the majority lacked the
authority to declare the Farmout Agreements without validity!*"’. Even admitting
(quod non) that the assignment could be severable from the Farmout Agreements,
Ecuador is at a loss to understand how a claim for the nullity of the assignment

could be admissible when the parties to the assignment are not the parties to the

(ii) The failure to state reasons should also lead to annulment, because the
majority’s determination rests on a combination of frivolous, scarce and
contradictory reasons "9.

CLAIMANTS’ POSITION

Claimants disagree with Respondent’s arguments. In their opinion, Respondent
distorts the Award. The Tribunal only found that the Claimants purported to effect
a transfer of rights under the Participation Contract, and then declared the transfer
to be inexistent, while expressly affirming the validity of the Farmout
Agreement!*°,

The Exercise of ratione personae Jurisdiction over Andes

Claimants aver that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers by improperly
exercising jurisdiction ratione materiae over the Chinese company Andes, because
the Tribunal did not award Andes any damages. The majority simply awarded
Claimants the value of their investment, which was 100% of the rights under the
Participation Contract. As a matter of international law, the Tribunal had to award
Claimants damages reflecting 100% of their investment; it was not entitled to
deduct Claimants’ liabilities — as reflected in the Chorzéw Factory dictum'*!.

. Respondent’s argument that the Tribunal had expropriated Andes’ rights is wrong,

because those rights are unaffected by the Award; the Tribunal expressly affirmed
the validity of the Farmout Agreement!*?.

Failure to apply the proper Rules of International Law on Damages

The Inexistence of the Assignment of the Farmout Agreement

(i) Claimants aver that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers by failing
to apply the proper law when it found that the purported assignment by OEPC to
AEC was inexistent and thus had no legal effects. The Tribunal found that

- Ecuadorian law recognizes the concept of inexistence;

- Following the clear wording of Article 79 of the HCL the assignment was
inexistent rather than an absolute nullity!*”;

- An inexistent act does not need to be invalidated; and

- Even if it were an absolute nullity, pending the judicial declaration the
assignment still had no legal effect'**.

Claimants aver that even if Ecuador’s arguments were correct (quod non), they
would only amount to a mere error.

Finally, Claimants submit that Ecuador is understandably at pains to retreat from
its previous admissions. The Tribunal noted'*? that its conclusions regarding
inexistence of the assignment had previously been fully endorsed by Ecuador and
its legal experts’. In Claimants’ opinion, the fact that Ecuador originally held the
contrary position proves that the Tribunal’s position at least is reasonable — thus
making annulment for gross error of law unavailable'*!.

Claimants also recall that the Tribunal did not declare that the Farmout Agreement
or Joint Operating Agreement was invalid — only the transfer of certain rights!*?.

(ii) The Tribunal’s reasoning can be followed from point A to point B and so does
not warrant annulment!>?;

- Article 79 HCL states that any unauthorized transfer of rights under the
Participation Contract shall “be null and void and shall have no validity

whatsoever”; consequently the purported assignment of rights was invalid;

- The Ecuadorian Supreme Court has confirmed on a number of occasions
that Ecuadorian law recognizes automatic nullity or inexistence;

- No further action is required to invalidate an unauthorized assignment.

Decision on Annulment

Ecuador’s efforts to manufacture a contradiction between the Tribunal’s findings is
unavailing, as is Ecuador’s claim that the Tribunal’s decision rests on frivolous and
contradictory reasons *4,

 

THE COMMITTEE’S DECISION
The Committee must decide whether the majority of the Tribunal fell into any of
the grounds for annulment advanced by Ecuador, when, against the vocal dissent of
one of its members, it assumed jurisdiction with regard to 100% of Block 15,
without taking into consideration that the Claimant, OEPC, had transferred 40% of
its interest to a third party, initially the Bermudan company AEC, which thereafter
sold it to the Chinese company Andes. And, if it comes to the conclusion that the
Tribunal indeed wrongly assumed jurisdiction, the Committee must then decide
whether this excess of powers merits annulment under the strict requirements
imposed by Article 52 of the Convention.

The extent and scope of Claimants’ investments is more than a purely legal issue,
relevant only for the calculation of damages in this case. It has wider repercussions,
touching on the natural tension between general principles of equality and equity
vis-a-vis the jurisdictional scope of ICSID arbitration. This tension is inbuilt in a
legal system which only protects investments held by investors of a certain
nationality, covered by a specific BIT, but denies protection to other investors,
including domestic investors!>°.

Through the expropriation of the Participation Contract, Ecuador acquired a 100%
interest in Block 15; fairness would seem to require that it indemnify 100% of the
value of such asset. And the Tribunal, when it decided to calculate damages on
100% of the investment, was undoubtedly guided by a purpose of delivering a fair
and equitable solution!®.

But viewed from the angle of OEPC, its damage seems to be limited to 60% of the
value of the Block, because ownership over the remaining 40% had been transferred
to a third party (AEC, a company which is not a party to the arbitration, and which
is not protected by the US — Ecuador BIT), which duly paid to OEPC the agreed
consideration and which finally resold the participation to Andes.

To comply with its duty of adjudicating Respondent’s request for annulment, the
Committee will:

- As a first step, review in some detail the underlying facts and the
applicable law (A.);

- Asa second step, it will analyse Respondent’s ground for annulment that
the Tribunal exceeded its powers, and will come to the conclusion that by
assuming jurisdiction over the investment now beneficially owned by the

fairness and equity and the scope of jurisdiction of investment tribunals:

Underlying Facts and Applicable Law
The Participation Contract

In 1999 PetroEcuador and OEPC signed the Participation Contract, which expressly
stated that it was to be governed by Ecuadorian law!°’. The parties agreed that
OEPC, in return for accepting the obligation to explore, develop and exploit Block
15, and being responsible for all associated expenditures, was to receive a share of
the oil produced, the balance corresponding to Ecuador.

. The transfer of the Participation Contract and the assignment to third parties of

rights arising thereunder was regulated in clause 16.1.:

“La transferencia de este Contrato de Participacién o la cesién a terceros de
derechos provenientes del mismo deberan ser autorizados por el Ministro del
Ramo, de conformidad con las leyes y reglamentos vigentes: de manera
especial se cumpliran las disposiciones previstas en el articulo 79 de la Ley de
Hidrocarburos y en los Decretos Ejecutivos Nos. 809, 2713 y 1179”.

Clause 16.1. clearly established that both the transfer of the Contract (i.e. the
transfer of the bundle of rights and obligations corresponding to OEPC) and the
assignment of any right (without obligations) required authorization from the
Minister.

. The Participation Contract also provided that the transfer of rights or obligations

without authorization of the Minister could result in its termination:
“21.1. Terminacién: Este Contrato de Participacién terminara:

21.1.2. Por transferir derechos y obligaciones del Contrato de Participacién,
sin autorizacién del Ministerio del Ramo”.

The Farmout Agreements

In October 2000 OEPC and City Investing Company Limited (“AEC”), a Bermuda
company, executed the Farmout Agreements (consisting of the Farmout Agreement
and the Joint Operating Agreements), which were subject to New York law. The
purpose of the Farmout Agreements was to transfer from OEPC to AEC the
ownership of a 40% interest in the rights and obligations deriving from the so called
“Farmout Property” (a wide concept which included the “Participating
Agreements”, one of which was the Participation Contract). This transfer of
ownership was to be executed in two phases:

- In the first phase OEPC would hold legal title to AEC’s 40% interest in
the Farmout Property “as a ‘nominee””, acting “on behalf of AEC”, OEPC
being obligated, “at the sole risk, cost and expense” of AEC to act with

'S57 Participation Contract Clause 22.1.

S7

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

respect to the 40% Farmout Interest of AEC as AEC shall direct, “‘as if
AEC were a party” to the Participation Contract “owning legal title to a
40% interest” in such Contract and in Block 15198;

In the second phase —which never came into force - OEPC would transfer
to AEC the legal title for AEC’s 40% participation in the Farmout
Property.

Having signed the Farmout Agreements, AEC paid approximately US$ 180 million
to OEPC as consideration for the acquisition of its 40% Farmout Property, the
amount being equivalent to 40% of the expenditure so far. In compliance with the
obligations assumed in the Farmout Agreements, thereafter AEC regularly paid to
OEPC 40% of the expenditures incurred in the exploitation and development of
Block 15, and received 40% of the oil produced.

What were the legal consequences of the Farmout Agreement?

In accordance with the agreed terms, the execution of the Farmout Agreements
resulted in OEPC transferring to AEC ownership of a 40% interest in the Farmout
Property. And clause 1.01 of the Farmout Agreement defined Farmout Property to
include (inter alia) the following:

“(a) the Participating Agreements [which include the Participation Contract]
and the rights and obligations therein granted to OEPC in and with respect to
Block 15 and the related obligations of OEPC [...] accruing after the Effective
Date herunder;

(b) All wells, equipment, ancillary pipelines, facilities and personal property
situated in Block 15 at the Effective Time and owned or granted to and held
by OEPC [...]” [Emphasis added].

The definition of Farmout Property leaves no room for doubt that, as regards the
Participation Contract, what OEPC was transferring to AEC was the ownership of
a 40% interest in the complete bundle of “rights and obligations” which formed
OEPC’s legal position under that Contract — and not simply certain rights deriving
therefrom.

A second element is important: the purpose of the Farmout Agreements was the
transfer of “ownership” over the Farmout Property, including OEPC’s legal
position under the Participation Contract. This conclusion is supported by clause
3.3.1 of the Joint Operating Agreement, which reads as follows:

“Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, all the rights and interests in
and under the Participating Agreements, all Joint Property and any Petroleum
produced from the Agreement Area shall, subject to the terms of the
Participating Agreement, be owned by the Parties in accordance with their
respective Participating Interests” [emphasis added].

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

It is important to note that the conclusion that the Farmout Agreements caused the
transfer of ownership of a 40% interest in OEPC’s rights and obligations under the
Participation Contract is shared by the Tribunal — at least in its initial analysis!>*:

“303. [...] Again, this language explicitly evidences that the Joint Operating
Agreement served to operate a transfer of rights and obligations held under
the Participation Contract, resulting in AEC’s purported ‘ownership’ over
these rights to the extent of its Participating Interest’.

Summing up: upon the execution of the Farmout Agreements in 2000, OEPC
retained a 60% interest in the Farmout Property (which included OEPC’s legal
position under the Participation Contract), and for good consideration transferred
to AEC ownership over a 40% interest in the Farmout Property. The transfer was
never authorized by the Ecuadorian Minister of Mines, as required by Article 79
HCL. However, OEPC and AEC duly complied with the terms and conditions
agreed upon in the Farmout Agreements.

Split Title: Beneficial Ownership and Nominee

Although the Farmout Agreements foresaw a transfer of ownership, the transfer
was timed to occur in two phases, and it was agreed that AEC was only to acquire
formal title over its 40% share in the Farmout Property in a second phase. During
the first phase (which is the only one relevant, because it was during that phase
when the Caducidad Decree was issued) the parties agreed in clause 2.01 of the
Farmout Agreement that title to the 40% interest in the Farmout Property was to be
split:

- AEC, who had paid the consideration for acquiring ownership, would be
the ’beneficial owner” of its portion of the Farmout Property;

- While OEPC would be acting as a “nominee” for AEC, appearing as
formal owner vis-a-vis third parties (including vis-a-vis the Ecuadorian
public administration).

Ownership title was thus divided between a nominee (OEPC, who held legal title
on behalf of the beneficial owner) and a beneficial owner (AEC who bore the costs,
profits, risks and rewards of ownership, whose instructions the nominee agreed to
follow and who thus controlled its share of the investment).

Prof. Stern has drawn attention to the legal relevance of this split ownership
structure created by the Farmout Agreements!.

The Committee agrees with Prof. Stern’s analysis. The Farmout Agreements have
indeed provided that, at the time when the Caducidad Decree was issued, the
Claimants only retained full title over 60% of their investment in Block 15. For the
remaining 40%, OEPC was simply a “nominee”, who held apparent ownership, but

Decision on Annulment

in substance was acting on behalf and for the benefit of the true beneficiary, AEC.
It was AEC who actually controlled a 40% share in the Farmout Property.

The Tribunal’s Disagreement

The majority of the Tribunal, however, disagrees with this analysis. In its Award
it reaches the opposite conclusion'*!:

“658. [...] Also moot is Respondent’s contention that there is a risk of double
jeopardy as AEC has no standing to sue Ecuador directly for compensation

given that it holds no rights — beneficial or otherwise — in the Participation
Contract” [emphasis added].

 

. In the Committee’s opinion, the Tribunal’s finding is inconsistent with the clear

language of clause 2.01 of the Farmout Agreement, which provides that during
phase I of the transaction OEPC

“shall hold legal title to the interest in the Farmout Property represented by
the [40%] Farmout Interest of AEC in the Participating Agreements [which
include the Participation Contract] as_a ‘nominee’, with the obligation to
convey title to such interest to AEC [in phase II]” [emphasis added].

If in the Farmout Agreements the parties agreed that OEPC would act as AEC’s
nominee, the inescapable consequence is that AEC became the beneficial owner of
the interest in the Farmout Property. This conclusion is confirmed by the last
sentence of clause 2.01 of the Farmout Agreement:

“OEPC shall be obligated, at the sole risk, cost and expense of AEC to act
with respect to the Farmout Interest of AEC as AEC shall direct from time to
time as if AEC were a party to the Participating Agreements [which include
the Participation Contract] owning legal title to a 40% interest in the
Participating Agreements and the interests therein granted in Block 15”.

The same principle is repeated in clause 3.2.1 of the Joint Operating Agreement:

“3.2.1 Pursuant to the provisions of the Farmout Agreement, AECI has on the
Effective Date a forty percent (40%) interest in the Participating Agreements
that until the Transfer Date shall be equivalent economically to, but shall not
include, nominal legal title and, thereafter, shall include legal title”.

In view of the clear language of the Farmout Agreements, and the undisputed fact
that OEPC and AEC duly complied with its terms and conditions, and paid the
consideration established therein, the Tribunal’s conclusion that AEC did not
acquire any interest — beneficial or otherwise — in the Participation Contract is
untenable.

Furthermore, the Tribunal’s conclusion is inconsistent with its own finding that the
Farmout Agreements

“303. [...] operate[d] a transfer of rights and obligations held under the
Participation Contract, resulting in AEC’s purported ‘ownership’ over these
rights to the extent of its Participating Interest’.

AEC is not a Creditor

. A corollary of the fact that AEC is a beneficial owner and controller of a 40%

interest in the Farmout Property is that AEC cannot be considered as a creditor,
holding a contractual right to claim from OEPC a share of the Block 15 oil
production.

OEPC and AEC could have structured their relationship as a “cash against future
oil transaction”, as a simple sales agreement, where AEC agrees to pay an uncertain
price (equivalent to a percentage of the expenditure in Block 15) and receives an
uncertain quantity of oil in the future (the agreed percentage of whatever oil the
Block produces).

The parties chose not to do so.

Instead, they agreed on the Farmout Agreements, which formalized a totally
different transaction: a transaction where OEPC transferred to AEC beneficial
ownership and control to a 40% interest in the Farmout Property, and AEC paid the
agreed consideration for the ownership of such asset. As owner of an interest in the
Farmout Property, AEC had the rights and obligations concomitant with its co-
ownership status: AEC participated in the management of the Property, it was under
an obligation to contribute to the expenditure of exploiting and developing Block
15 and it was entitled to collect its portion of the oil revenue generated.

Transfer to Andes and Letter Agreement

In 2005 — five years after the execution of the Farmout Agreements — EnCana,
AEC’s parent company, executed a Share Sale Agreement with Andes Petroleum
Co. (“Andes”), a Chinese company, whereby EnCana sold AEC to Andes!**. The
parties also signed a supplemental indemnity agreement, in which the seller
assumed certain obligations and indemnities related to possible actions by the
Ecuadorian authorities related to Block 15 and the Participation Contract.

Letter Agreement

In February 2006 — i.e. during the Caducidad procedure but before the issuance of
the Caducidad Decree — OEPC and Andes executed a Letter Agreement (the
“Letter Agreement”)! in which

- Andes released OEPC of any liability arising out of the Caducidad
proceedings and acknowledged that OEPC had no obligation to
compensate Andes in case of caducidad [clause 2 (a)];

- OEPC and Andes agreed to share all cost on a 60/40 basis [clause 2 (f)]

- OEPC agreed to share with Andes 40% of whatever monetary award
OEPC received as result of the caducidad proceedings or any monetary
award received from Ecuador, net of any costs, in effect creating a joint
venture [clause 2 (g)].

The Letter Agreement is consistent with and the natural consequence of the
Farmout Agreements.

Under the Farmout Agreements, ownership of the Farmout Property, including
OEPC’s bundle of rights and obligations resulting from the Participation Contract,
was shared 60/40 between OEPC and AEC. When the Republic declared caducidad
of the Participation Contract and took the Farmout Property, AEC was deprived of
its asset and its ownership rights transformed into the right to collect a
compensation, if any, from Ecuador. The Letter Agreement simply acknowledges
and formalizes this fact.

The Caducidad Decree

A few months thereafter, in May 2006, the Ecuadorian Minister of Energy issued
the Caducidad Decree, a ministerial decision adopted after a lengthy preliminary
administrative procedure. In the decision the Minister, applying the HCL, declared
the caducidad of the Participation Contract, as a sanction for the unauthorized
transfer of rights between OEPC and AEC/Andes. The powers of the Minister to
order caducidad derive from Article 74 HCL, the first article in the chapter of the
law devoted to “Caducidad, Sanciones y Transferencias”:

“Art. 74: El Ministerio del Ramo podra declarar la caducidad de los contratos
si el contratista:

(td

11. Traspasare derechos 0 celebrare contrato o acuerdo privado para la cesi6n
de uno o mas de sus derechos, sin la autorizacién del Ministerio;

12. Integrare consorcios 0 asociaciones para las operaciones de exploracién 0
explotaci6n, o se retirare de ellos, sin autorizacién del Ministerio; y

13. Reincidiere en infracciones a la Ley y sus reglamentos”.

The Minister found that OEPC’s conduct had resulted in the grounds for caducidad
set forth in sections 11, 12 and 13 of Article 74 HCL'®. His decision led to the
automatic termination of the Participation Contract!®. Besides, OEPC was forced
to turn over to the State and to PetroEcuador the concession and all assets used in
connection with Block 15, without any compensation!*”.

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

But the most important consequence of the declaration of caducidad was that
Article 79 HCL, a rule establishing that transfers of contract or assignment of rights,
executed without prior administrative authorization, shall be null and void and
without validity, became relevant.

The Nullity under Article 79 HCL
Article 79 HCL provides as follows:

“La transferencia de un contrato 0 la cesi6n_a_terceros de derechos
provenientes de un contrato, serdn nulas y no tendrén valor alguno si no
precede autorizacién del Ministerio del Ramo, sin perjuicio de la declaracién
de caducidad segtin lo previsto en la presente Ley.

El Estado recibira una prima por el traspaso y la empresa beneficiaria debera
celebrar un nuevo contrato en condiciones econémicas mas favorables para el
Estado y para PETROECUADOR, que las contenidas en el contrato
primitivo” [Emphasis added].

The rule applies in two situations:

- The first is if the holder of an oil contract executes a “transferencia de un
contrato”, i.e. if the holder transfers to a third party (the totality or a
portion of) its legal position in the contract (i.e. of the bundle of rights and
obligations arising therefrom); and

- The second is if the holder of an oil contract carries out a “‘cesidn a terceros

de derechos provenientes de_un contrato”, i.e. the holder assigns rights
(but not obligations) deriving from such an oil contract.

The legal provision then orders that, except if the authorization of the Minister has
been obtained, the transfer or the assignment shall be null and void and shall have
no validity whatsoever.

The proper interpretation of Article 79 HCL has been an intensely disputed
question. Two issues have merited special attention:

- whether the nullity predicated by this rule is automatic, not requiring
judicial declaration (h) and

- whether it is possible to sever the transaction between OEPC and AEC
into an assignment of rights on one side, and the remaining content of the
Farmout Agreements on the other, with the assignment being null and
void, and the Farmout Agreements surviving as a valid transaction (i).

Does Article 79 HCL result in Automatic Nullity/ Inexistence?
The majority of the Tribunal accepted that, although not expressly stated in the

Ecuadorian Civil Code, the Ecuadorian Supreme Court had confirmed on a number
of occasions that Ecuadorian law recognizes automatic nullity or inexistence!®.

231.

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

And the Tribunal concluded that Article 79 HCL is one of those instances of
automatic nullity, there being no requirement that the unauthorized transfer or
assignment be declared invalid by a judge, because the law itself stipulates that the
act “has no validity whatsoever”. The same result would — in the opinion of the
majority of the Tribunal — flow from the application of New York law.

Arbitrator Stern dissented.

In her opinion under New York law (which was the contractually relevant law), the
Farmout Agreements, not having been invalidated by a New York court, should be
considered as still in force and binding!”°.

Under Ecuadorian law she came to the same conclusion. Analyzing the very case
law used by the majority of the Tribunal, she concluded that the cases stand for the
principle that inexistence only results from the absence of the solemnity of a legal
deed, when such form is required by law. Absence of other formalities, like the
absence of an administrative authorization, entails an absolute nullity!7!. And
absolute nullity has to be declared by a judge, as is stated without any possible
ambiguity in section 1699 of the Civil Code.

Prof. Stern concluded that if the applicable law was Ecuadorian law, the Farmout
Agreements, not having been invalidated by a court, should also have been
considered as still in force.

The Committee’s Analysis

The Farmout Agreement provides that it is to be governed by New York law “except
to the extent that the laws of Ecuador require application of the laws of Ecuador to
the Participating Agreements”!”?. This implies — as the Award acknowledges — that
New York courts would give effect to mandatory Ecuadorian laws governing the
Farmout Agreement, including the HCL, when considering the validity of the
assignment!’?, and that the materially relevant law is that of Ecuador.

. The Ecuadorian Civil Code contains the following regulation with regard to the

nullity of contracts:

”Art. 1698.- La nulidad producida por un objeto o causa ilicita, y la nulidad
producida por la omisién de algtin requisito o formalidad que las leyes

prescriben para el valor de ciertos actos o contratos [...] son nulidades
absolutas.

Art. 1699.- La nulidad absoluta puede y debe ser declarada por el juez, atin sin
peticidn de parte, cuando aparece de manifiesto en el acto o contrato;
[...]’.[Emphasis added].

Decision on Annulment

Ecuadorian law creates the category of “nulidad absoluta” of a contract, applicable
when there is a failure to comply with a formality or requirement established by
law. Such “nulidad absoluta” must be declared by a judge (i.e. it is not automatic)
in order to produce the voidance of a validly executed contract.

The Committee agrees with Prof. Stern: the nullity deriving from Article 79 HCL
was caused by the failure to comply with a “requisito que las leyes prescriben para
el valor de ciertos contratos”, namely the authorization of the Minister, and thus it
constitutes a “nulidad absoluta” as defined in Article 1698 of the Civil Code, with
the consequence that the nullity had to be declared by a judge.

The majority of the Tribunal based its decision to declare the assignment of rights
inexistent, and thus not requiring a judicial declaration, “[o]n [the] face” of Article
79 HCL'*. Based on this interpretation, the Tribunal concluded that the transfer of
ownership in favour of AEC/Andes, which had occurred in the year 2000, when the
Farmout Agreements had been executed, was inexistent!”>.

The majority of the Tribunal’s interpretation is incorrect: Article 79 does not
mention the concepts of “inexistence” or “automatic nullity”, it simply states that
the transfer or assignment “‘serdn nulas y no tendrdn valor alguno si no procede la
autorizacion del Ministerio”, and this nullity clearly fits into the definition of a
“nulidad absoluta” under Article 1698 of the Civil Code. The words “y no tendrdan
valor alguno” are a simple reiteration of the main effect produced by nullity.
To support its position the Tribunal also invoked Article 1718 of the Civil Code!”®.
Article 1718 provides as follows:

“Art. 1718.- La falta de instrumento ptblico no puede suplirse por otra prueba
en los actos y contratos en que la Ley requiere esa solemnidad; y se miraran
como no ejecutados o celebrados, aun cuando en ellos se prometa reducirlos
a instrumento ptblico dentro de cierto plazo, bajo una clausula penal. Esta
cldusula no tendra efecto alguno”.[Emphasis added]

This provision is irrelevant for the issue under discussion.

Article 1718 refers to the proper formalization of obligations and contracts, and
provides that, if the law requires that a contract be formalized in an “instrumento
ptiblico”, the absence of such requirement renders the contract inexistent. Article
1716 defines “instrumento ptiblico” as a deed authenticated by a notary or other
authorized civil servant. Since it is undisputed that Ecuadorian law does not require
that the Farmout Agreements be formalized in an “instrumento ptiblico”, the rule
provided for in Article 1718 is irrelevant in this case.

The Tribunal also tried to find support for its conclusion in Ecuadorian case law,
which allegedly acknowledges the concept of “inexistence” and “automatic
nullity”!77,

The Committee has analysed the case law referred to by the Tribunal and has found
no support for the majority’s conclusion: all cases deal with the inexistence of
promises to buy/sell which had not been properly formalized in an “instrumento
publico” (i.e. ina notarial deed). The case law is clear that “‘inexistence” only arises
in exceptional cases, when the law requires that the contractual consent be
formalized with “solemnidad” (i.e. in an “‘instrumento ptblico”, as required in
certain contracts involving real estate). There is no discussion that the consent to
enter into the Farmout Agreements was properly formalized and did not require
“solemnidad”. What is being discussed is whether the properly formalized Farmout
Agreement became inexistent by operation of Article 79 HCL. The parties have
not referred to any Ecuadorian case law holding that an otherwise valid contract
was rendered inexistent as a consequence of the failure to obtain an administrative
authorization.

Can the Farmout Agreements be severed for Nullity purposes?

The majority of the Tribunal did not only decree that the assignment of rights
formalized in the Farmout Agreement was inexistent and that no judicial declaration
was required, it also specifically declared that such invalidity did not affect the
Farmout Agreements!”*.

In the course of the arbitration Claimants had argued that under New York law any
portion of the Farmout Agreements which did not require authorization from the
Minister could be severed and would survive, even if the assignment of certain
rights was null and void under Article 79 HCL.

This idea was taken up by the majority of the Tribunal, who agreed that the
assignment of rights could be severed from the underlying Farmout Agreements,
and while the former was automatically null and void and inexistent, by application
of Article 79 HCL, the latter remained valid. The Tribunal expressed its reasoning
with the following words!”?:

“... the Tribunal reiterates that in the present case it is the validity of the
assignment that is under scrutiny, and not the validity of the Farmout
Agreement or the Joint Operating Agreement. The Tribunal’s findings on the
validity of the assignment do not affect other obligations that might arise
between the parties to the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating
Agreement (such parties being different to [sic] those in the present
arbitration), nor does it affect the ability of AEC to seek damages from OEPC
for a failure to comply with the terms of those Agreements, such as obtaining
necessary government consent for the assignment”.

Decision on Annulment

Prof. Stern dissented !*°:

“126. If I understand correctly what the majority wants to convey here, it
seems that it is saying that it cannot judge the validity of the Farmout
Agreement, because it is between parties that are different than the ones before
the ICSID Tribunal, but that it can rule on the validity of the assignment. This
line of reasoning is quite difficult to follow, as it seems to me first that the
parties to the assignment are exactly the same as the parties to the Farmout
Agreement and second that the assignment and the Farmout Agreement are
one and the same thing intrinsically linked together”.

The Committee’s Analysis

The Committee agrees with Prof. Stern that the opinion of the majority of the
Tribunal is difficult to follow, because very little reasoning has been provided.
According to the majority, the nullity would have been generated by Article 79
HCL, but the Tribunal has failed to provide any explanation on why this rule
supports its conclusion.

In fact, the literal wording of Article 79 HCL contradicts the Tribunal’s
conclusions.

Article 79 HCL distinguishes between two types of transactions:
-  “transferencia de un contrato” and
-  “cesién a terceros de derechos provenientes de un contrato”.

The Farmout Agreements qualify as a “transferencia de un contrato”, and not as a
mere “cesién de derechos”. OEPC is not simply assigning certain rights to AEC.
The object of the Farmout Agreements is the transfer to AEC of a bundle of rights
and obligations which constitute 40% OEPC’s position in the Participation
Contract!*!,

If what has triggered the application of Article 79 HCL is the unauthorized
“transferencia de un contrato” executed by means of the Farmout Agreements, the
rule itself mandates that the “transferencia de contrato” shall be null and void and
shall have no validity. There is no room to argue that the Farmout Agreements,
the instrument which formalized the “transferencia de contrato”, can survive,
while the “transferencia de contrato” is (automatically or not, that is irrelevant for
this discussion) null and void. Farmout Agreements and “transferencia de
contrato” are one and the same thing, and both are identically affected by the
nullity brought about by the lack of authorization '*?.

The conclusion would be the same if the Farmout Agreements are considered as a simple “cesién de

derechos”, for the reasons noted by Prof. Stern in her dissent.

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

Claims filed by the affected Parties

Immediately after the issuance by the Minister of Energy of the Caducidad Decree,
Claimants filed this arbitration, requesting compensation for 100% of the assets
taken by the Ecuadorian government.

The Tribunal eventually reached the decision that the Republic had expropriated
Claimants’ investment in Block 15 in breach of Article II.1 of the Treaty, and that
the Caducidad Decree had been issued in breach of Ecuadorian law and customary
international law!®.

. Claimants have been affected by Ecuador’s acts in contravention of the Treaty. But

so were AEC/Andes, being the beneficial owner of a 40% in the Farmout Property,
which included the rights and obligations deriving from the Participation Contract
and all the assets used in Block 15'**. This beneficial ownership was taken by the
Republic of Ecuador, together with the 60% share property of OEPC.

. Notwithstanding the damage suffered, there is no indication in the file that Andes

has filed a separate claim against the Republic, either before the Courts of Ecuador
or before any international tribunal'*°. The only claim submitted has been the
present action, in which OEPC is requesting 100% of the value of Block 15. This
is consistent with the Letter Agreement in which OEPC and Andes agreed that any
reward arising from this procedure will be shared 60/40 — the ownership structure
over the Farmout Property provided for in the Farmout Agreements.

There is also no evidence in the file that any judge or arbitrator, either in Ecuador
or in New York, has declared the nullity of the Farmout Agreements, as a
consequence of the violation of Article 79 HCL (or otherwise). And, in accordance
with basic principles of procedural fairness, the Award rendered in this arbitration
proceeding, in which AEC/Andes was not represented, could in no case result in
the voidance of the Farmout Agreements, to which AEC/Andes were a party.

Excess of Powers in assuming Jurisdiction over the Investment held by Andes

. In the previous section the Committee concluded that:

- upon execution of the Farmout Agreements in 2000, OEPC retained a 60%
interest in the Farmout Property (which included OEPC’s legal position
under the Participation Contract), and for good consideration transferred
to AEC/Andes beneficial ownership over a 40% interest in such Farmout
Property; such transfer was never authorized by the Ecuadorian Minister
of Mines;

- in 2006 the Ecuadorian Government issued the Caducidad Decree, which
led to the automatic termination of the Participation Contract!8°,

established that an administrative authorization should have been obtained
at the time when the Farmout Agreements were executed, and triggered
the application of Article 79 HCL!*’;

- Article 79 HCL provides for the “nulidad absoluta” of any unauthorized
assignment of rights or transfer of agreement, and that such “nulidad
absoluta’” requires declaration by a judge (i.e. it is not automatic), and that
there is no evidence in the file that any judge has declared the nullity of
the Farmout Agreement;

- AEC/Andes was not a party to the underlying arbitration proceedings, and
in accordance with general principles of law, the Award could under no
circumstances declare the invalidity of the Farmout Agreement, to which
AEC had been a party;

- the assignment of rights and the Farmout Agreement cannot be severed: it
is impossible to argue (as the Tribunal did) that the assignment of rights is
invalid, affected by a an automatic nullity or inexistence provoked by the
application of Article 79 HCL, and simultaneously to hold that the
Farmout Agreement is still valid and binding. The Farmout Agreement
embodies a “transferencia de contrato” and both would be identically
affected if the supervening nullity were declared by a judge.

Having established these conclusions, the Committee will now turn to Respondent’s
argument that the Tribunal exceeded its powers by assuming jurisdiction over the
investment now beneficially owned by AEC/Andes — and come to the conclusion
that a manifest excess of powers has indeed occurred (a.). It will then dismiss
Claimants’ counterargument (b.) and will establish the consequences of the partial
annulment of the Award (c.).

The Tribunal’s Assumption of Jurisdiction over the Investment held by Andes

. Respondent argues that an ICSID tribunal commits a manifest excess of powers if

it exercises jurisdiction over the investment held by AEC/Andes

- which is not a party to the arbitration agreement contained in the
Participation Contract and

- which is not a protected investor under the BIT (in this case the Ecuador-
US BIT) from which the Tribunal derives its authority '**.

In the present case the protected investment consists in the so called Farmout
Property, comprising the Participation Contract and the assets used for the
exploitation and development of Block 15, and in accordance with the Farmout
Agreements its ownership is split between OEPC and AEC/Andes

- OEPC being full owner of a 60% interest in the Property, and

- AEC/Andes being the beneficial owner and controller of the remaining
40% interest, which OEPC held as AEC/Andes’ nominee!®?.

Split Title in International Law

259. In cases where legal title is split between a nominee and a beneficial owner
international law is uncontroversial: as Arbitrator Stern has stated in her Dissent!*°
the dominant position in international law grants standing and relief to the owner
of the beneficial interest — not to the nominee.

260. The status quaestionis was summarized thus by David Bederman'®!:

“International law authorities have agreed that the real and equitable owner of
an international claim is the proper party before an international adjudication,
and not the nominal or record owner. This principle was espoused as early as
1876, and was a consistent element in early claims practice. Moreover, claims
tribunals following the First World War explicitly enquired into the beneficial
ownership of property at issue before them. The fact that the nominal owner
did not have a real interest in the subject property, or that the beneficial owner
was not of a proper nationality, was occasionally the decisive ground for
dismissing a claim. Claims settlement commissions after the Second World
War likewise continued this practice, and it has been observed recently in the
jurisprudence of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal. The notion that the
beneficial (and not the nominal) owner of property is the real party-in-interest
before an international court may be justly considered a general principle of
international law”. [Footnotes ommited; emphasis added].

  

261. Other authors have confirmed the conclusion!”.

262. The position as regards beneficial ownership is a reflection of a more general
principle of international investment law: claimants are only permitted to submit
their own claims, held for their own benefit, not those held (be it as nominees,
agents or otherwise) on behalf of third parties not protected by the relevant treaty.
And tribunals exceed their jurisdiction if they grant compensation to third parties
whose investments are not entitled to protection under the relevant instrument.

263. This subjective limitation of ICSID jurisdiction is a natural consequence of
international investment law. Arbitral tribunals are not courts of justice holding
unfettered jurisdiction. The role of arbitral tribunals is not to redress torts

worldwide. Arbitral tribunals are instruments created by and subject to the consent
of States, as formalized in the relevant instrument, and are only empowered to
adjudicate disputes between protected investors and consenting States. Other
disputes are outside their remit. Investors cannot expand the jurisdiction ratione
personae of arbitral tribunals by executing private contracts with third parties.

Specifically, protected investors cannot transfer beneficial ownership and control
in a protected investment to an unprotected third party, and expect that the arbitral
tribunal retains jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute between the third party and the
host State. To hold the contrary would open the floodgates to an uncontrolled
expansion of jurisdiction ratione personae, beyond the limits agreed by the States
when executing the treaty.

The Tribunal committed an Excess of Powers

. The Committee has already verified that with regard to the 40% interest in the

Farmout Property title is split, beneficial ownership and control being held by
AEC/Andes, with OEPC acting as nominee on behalf of the beneficial owner. It has
also concluded that in situations like this international law provides that only the
beneficial owner, AEC/Andes, can claim for interference with its interest, while the
nominee, OEPC, lacks standing to claim in the name of the beneficial owner!®?,

In the present case, the Tribunal has decided to compensate OEPC for 100% of the
investment in Block 15. But 40% of that investment does not belong to OEPC, the
USS. corporation protected by the BIT and which is also party to the Participation
Contract, but to Andes, a Chinese company, unprotected by the BIT and which does
not participate in such Contract. By compensating a protected investor for an
investment which is beneficially owned by a non-protected investor, the Tribunal
has illicitly expanded the scope of its jurisdiction and has acted with an excess of
powers.

The Excess of Powers is manifest

Article 52(1)(b) requires that the excess of powers be manifest. The Committee has
already concluded that this additional limitation applies in situations where it is
argued that the tribunal committed a jurisdictional excess of powers!*4. That said,
“manifest” does not prevent that in some cases an extensive argumentation and
analysis may be required to prove that the misuse of powers has in fact occurred!”°.

In the present case, the excess of powers is manifest: the Tribunal decided to assume
jurisdiction over an investment which, at the relevant time, no longer belonged to
OEPC [for the purposes of Article I(a) of the Treaty], and to compensate Claimants
for 100% of the value of Block 15, without taking into consideration that:

The same conclusion is reached by Arbitrator Stern in her Dissent at 151.

is even higher: only gross and egregious errors of law can lead to annulment (see para 56 supra).

- in accordance with the Farmout Agreement, Claimants for good
consideration had transferred beneficial ownership of a 40% share in the
Farmout Property to AEC/Andes, OEPC remaining simply as a
“nominee”, who holds apparent ownership, but in substance acts on behalf
and for the benefit of the beneficial owner, AEC/Andes!;

- OEPC and AEC/Andes have at all times acted in full compliance with the
terms and conditions agreed upon in the Farmout Agreements, there being
no evidence in the file of any judicial declaration of voidance either by
application of Article 79 HCL or otherwise;

- AEC/Andes not being a party to these arbitration proceedings, the Award
could under no circumstances declare the invalidity of such Agreements;

- The assignment of rights and the Farmout Agreement are one and the
same thing, and that both would be equally affected by a hypothetical
nullity declared in accordance to Article 79 HCL;

- The existence of an uncontroversial principle of international law for
situations when legal title is split between a nominee and a beneficial
owner: as Arbitrator Stern stated in her Dissent!’ and the Committee has
confirmed, international law only grants standing and relief to the owner
of the beneficial interest — not to the nominee.

The Committee’s Decision

The Committee thus finds that the Tribunal committed a manifest excess of powers
for the purposes of Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention.

Article 52(3) of the Convention grants committees “the authority to annul an award
or any part thereof on any grounds set forth in paragraph (1)” of such article.
Exercising its authority under said Article, the Committee partially annuls the
Award, to the extent that the Tribunal has assumed jurisdiction with regard to the
investment now beneficially owned by the Chinese investor Andes (and previously
by the Bermudan company AEC), i.e. AEC/Andes’ 40% interest in the Farmout
Property, and has awarded damages to OEPC based on such decision.

The rest of the Award remains unaffected.

A final caveat: neither the international law principles nor the Committee’s decision
imply that investors holding beneficial ownership are left unprotected from
interferences by host States. Such investors will enjoy the protection granted under
the treaties which benefit their nationality. In the present case, AEC/Andes are
entitled to the protection which investors from Bermuda/China enjoy, when
investing in Ecuador, under applicable bilateral investment treaties or under general
principles of international law. What they are not entitled to — because they are not

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

USS. nationals or companies — is to the protection offered to U.S. investors investing
in Ecuador under the U.S.-Ecuador BIT.

Case Law

273. Investment arbitration case law has acknowledged the principle that under
international law legal standing pertains to beneficial owners and not necessarily to
nominees, and that unprotected parties cannot receive compensation, even if
claimed on their behalf by protected investors.

274. A case which shows striking similarities with this arbitration is Jmpregilo v.
Pakistan.

In Impregilo v. Pakistan an Italian company had created a joint venture
without legal personality under the laws of Switzerland called GBC, in which
it held a majority participation, together with a German, a French and two
Pakistani companies, in order to participate in a tender to construct
hydroelectric power facilities in Pakistan. Impregilo then acted as the only
signatory of the contract on behalf of the joint-venture. It was also the only
claimant in the arbitration. In the procedure it argued that it was under a
contractual obligation to distribute any monetary award with its partners.
Thus, the only way for Impregilo to obtain its stake was for the Tribunal to
permit Impregilo to proceed on behalf of all partners. The claimant reasoned
that it could not be made whole for its own personal damage from the treaty
breaches, unless it collected 100% of the damage suffered by the joint venture,
because it had to distribute any amount awarded with its partners.

275. The Tribunal rejected Impregilo’s attempt to claim amounts that would be turned
over to unprotected third parties stating:

In the Tribunal’s view, Impregilo cannot advance claims in
on behalf of the other participants in GBC.

 

146. The question is raised whether a party who does fall within the ambit of
a BIT and the Convention may act in arbitration proceedings in a
representative capacity, in order to advance claims on behalf of other entities
who do not so qualify. In the Tribunal’s view, the issue turns upon the precise
scope of the parties’ respective consent to the jurisdiction of ICSID. It is now
well-accepted that “consent of the parties is the cornerstone of the jurisdiction
of the Centre”.

147. In this case, Pakistan’s consent is delineated by the BIT. In concluding
the Treaty with Italy, Pakistan has conferred certain rights on Italian nationals
in connection with the protection of investments in Pakistan. It has not

conferred any rights on nationals of any other state, nor on nationals of
Pakistan itself.

148. It must follow that the scope of Pakistan’s consent to ICSID is
correspondingly limited. On a proper construction, Pakistan has consented to
the resolution by ICSID of its disputes arising out of investments made by
Italian nationals in Pakistan. There is nothing in the BIT to extend this to
claims of nationals of any other state, even if advanced on their behalf by

73

276.

277.

278.

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

Italian nationals. Any other interpretation would obviously expose Pakistan to
claims by nationals of any state worldwide.

149. To this end, investors of German nationality [...] and Pakistani

nationality [...] cannot benefit from the protection conferred upon Italian
investors by the 1997 BIT.

(

151. The fact that Impregilo may be empowered to advance claims on behalf
of its partners is an internal contractual matter between the participants of the
Joint Venture. It cannot, of itself, impact upon the scope of Pakistan’s consent
as expressed in the BIT. Equally, the fact that Impregilo may be obliged to
account to its partners in respect _of any damages obtained in these
proceedings is also _an internal GBC matter, which has no bearing on
Pakistan’s agreed exposure under the BIT. If this were not so, any party would
be at liberty to conclude a variety of private contracts with third parties, and
thereby unilaterally expand the _ambit_of a BIT”. [Emphasis added,
footnotes ommitted]!°*.

The Impregilo tribunal concluded that

“[i]t follows that this Tribunal has no jurisdiction in respect of claims on

behalf of, or losses incurred by, either GBC itself or any of Impregilo’s joint

venture partners”!®°.
The decision rendered in the Binder-Haas Claim is particularly interesting?”: in
1945 the Government of Yugoslavia had taken 7,500 shares of the company
Dugaresa which were initially owned by Etexco, a Swiss corporation owned by four
individuals. Some years before the expropriation, these individuals had transferred
their holdings in Etexco to Edwin Binder — an American citizen — to hold as
“constructive trustee”. A claim was brought by Mr. Binder together with the four
individuals (one of which lacked American citizenship). The Commission decided
that Mr. Binder was not entitled to make a claim on his own behalf and that claims
must be filed by the four other persons, who were the real or beneficial owners.
Since one of them was not an American citizen, her claim had to fail. That of the
other claimants succeeded.

In PSEG v. Turkey, an ICSID tribunal held that it would be improper “if
compensation is awarded in respect of investments or expenses incurred by entities
over which there is no jurisdiction”?”!.

PSEG, a US company, was granted an authorization to conduct a feasibility
study for the construction of a coal mine and a coal-fired plant in Turkey.
Thereafter, PSEG signed an implementation contract and a concession
contract. The North American Coal Company (NACC) assisted PSEG with
the mining aspects of the project. Guris, a Turkish company, participated in

the project as a sponsor. The claimants initiated ICSID proceedings under the
Turkey-US BIT and the Tribunal found that Turkey was in violation of the
fair and equitable treatment obligation.

279. In determining the compensation payable, the tribunal denied recovery to PSEG for
contributions made to the project by the other companies. The Tribunal stated
that???

“As the Tribunal noted in the Decision on Jurisdiction of 4 June 2004, these
entities might have a claim against PSEG in the light of intra-corporate
arrangements, but this is not something for which Turkey is liable, directly or
indirectly”.

280. In Mihaly v. Sri Lanka, a case better known for its analysis of pre-investment
expenditures, the ICSID Tribunal also examined the locus standi of the company.

Mihaly International Corp., a US company, wanted to build a power plant in
Sri Lanka. Eventually, Mihaly instituted proceedings invoking the US-Sri
Lanka BIT, looking for reimbursement of its expenditures on the project in its
own name and on behalf of its partner, Mihaly (Canada). Sri Lanka denied any
awareness of it ever dealing with Mihaly (USA) during negotiations and
alleged that Mihaly (USA) had no standing before the tribunal, neither by
reason of its partnership with Mihaly (Canada) nor in its capacity as an
undisclosed assignee.

281. The Tribunal held that Mihaly (USA) was only entitled to file a claim in its own
name against Sri Lanka. However, with regards to the claim of rights on behalf of
its Canadian partner, the Tribunal did not uphold jurisdiction?™:

“To allow such an assignment to operate in favour of Mihaly (Canada) would
defeat the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention and the sanctity of the
privity of international agreements not intended to create rights and
obligations for non-Parties. Accordingly, a Canadian claim which was not
recoverable, nor compensable or indeed capable of being invoked before
ICSID could not have been admissible or able to be entertained under the guise
of its assignment to the US Claimant. A claim under the ICSID Convention
with its carefully structured system is not a readily assignable chose in action
as shares in the stock-exchange market or other types of negotiable
instruments, such as promissory notes or letters of credit. The rights of
shareholders or entitlements of negotiable instruments holders are given
different types of protection which are not an issue in this case before the
Tribunal. This finding is without prejudice to the right of Mihaly (Canada) to
pursue its claims, if any, before another otherwise competent forum”.

b. Claimants’ Counter-Argument

improperly exercising jurisdiction ratione personae over the Chinese company
Andes.

23 Mihaly at 24.

75

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11

283. Claimants’ main argument is that there can be no excess of jurisdiction because the
Tribunal did not award Andes any damages. The Tribunal simply awarded
Claimants the value of their investment, which was 100% of the rights under the
Participation Contract. As a matter of international law, the Tribunal had to award
Claimants damages reflecting 100% of their investment; it was not entitled to
deduct Claimants’ liabilities — as reflected in the Chorzéw Factory dictum?™.

284. The Committee is not convinced.

285. (i) First, the Committee has already concluded that Claimants’ investment only
amounts to 60% of the Farmout Property; for the remaining share of 40% OEPC is
holding title as a nominee, acting on behalf of the beneficial owner, AEC/Andes.
When the Tribunal awarded Claimants a compensation calculated on the basis of
100% of the value of Block 15, it was assuming jurisdiction over Claimants’ alleged
ownership rights over a 40% interest in the Farmout Property, disregarding that in
accordance with the Farmout Agreements Claimants had transferred those rights to
AEC/Andes.

286. (ii) There is a second argument.

 

287. Contrary to the Claimants’ allegations, the dictum in the Chorzéw Factory decision
supports the Committee’s position — not that of Claimants’.

288. The dictum was first invoked by the Tribunal in its Award:

“This principle ... has the effect, on the one hand, of excluding from the
damage to be estimated, injury resulting for third parties from the unlawful act
and, on the other hand, of not excluding from the damage the amount of debts
and other obligations for which the injured party is responsible. The damage
suffered by the Oberschlesische in respect of the Chorzow undertaking is
therefore equivalent to the total value - but to that total only - of the property,
rights and interests of this Company in that undertaking, without deducting
liabilities”. [Emphasis added, footnote omitted].

289. It stands for the common sense proposition that in the calculation of damages for
the taking of assets

- debts and other obligations for which the injured party is responsible
should not be excluded, while

- injury resulting to third parties should indeed be excluded.

To give an example: if a State expropriates a piece of real estate, the
mortgage loan which served to finance the acquisition should not be
deducted from the fair market value; but if the investor before the
expropriation had transferred a 50% share of the property to a third
party, the third party’s share in the value of the investment must be
deducted from the claim for compensation.

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

In the present case, the transaction entered into between OEPC and AEC, and
formalized in the Farmout Agreements, consisted in the transfer of a 40% interest
in the Farmout Property. AEC/Andes became (and has not ceased to be) the
beneficial owner of that portion of the Farmout Property (including the Participation
Contract), and as beneficial owner AEC/Andes could exercise its ownership rights
over the Farmout Property through its nominee. AEC/Andes became a co-owner
of the Farmout Property, not a creditor of OEPC.

The dictum in Chorzéw Factory confirms the Committee’s conclusion: as a matter
of international law, the Tribunal was precluded from awarding Claimants damages
reflecting 100% of the investment, because it was required to exclude from the
compensation the injury caused to a third party, who was the beneficial owner of a
40% interest in the expropriated investment.

Effects of the partial Annulment of the Award

. The Committee has decided to partially annul the Award to the extent that the

Tribunal has assumed jurisdiction with regard to the investment beneficially owned
by the Chinese investor Andes. What remains to be clarified is the precise effect of
this finding”.

In Sub-paragraph (v) of the dispositive section of the Award, the Tribunal made the
following decision”:

“876 [...] (v) Claimants are awarded the amount of US$ 1,769,625,000 (US
One billion, seven hundred sixty nine millions, six hundred twenty five
thousand dollars), as calculated in paragraph 825 of this Award, for damages
suffered as a result of the breaches set out above in subparagraphs (i), (ii) and

(iii)”.
Paragraph 825 of the Award reads as follows:

“825. Having determined earlier that the Claimants’ damages should be
reduced by a factor of 25% because of their own wrongful act which
contributed in a material way to the damages which they subsequently
suffered when the Caducidad Decree was issued on 15 May 2006, the
Claimants’ damages for the expropriation by Ecuador of their interest in the
Participation Contract amount to US$ 1,769,625,000 (US One billion, seven
hundred sixty nine millions, six hundred twenty five thousand dollars) which
the Tribunal orders the Respondent to pay” [Footnote omitted].

Respondent avers that a partial annulment of the Award for excess of powers must
lead to an annulment of Sub-Paragraph (v) of the dispositive section of the
Award”°8_ The Tribunal concurs. The calculation of damages which underlies the
Tribunal’s decision is based on the assumption that OEPC is the owner of a 100%
interest in the expropriated property. This clearly derives from para. 824 of the
Award:

206 A question which was intensely debated during the annulment hearing: HT p. 716 et seq. (Prof. Mayer),
HT p. 980 et seq. (Mr. Rivkin).

207 Award at 876.

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

“824. Using the economic model agreed by Professor Kalt and Mr. Johnston,
the Tribunal, informed by all the findings that it has made in the present
Section of its Award and assisted by Professor Kalt and Mr. Johnston’s agreed
calculations, determines that the Net Present Value of the discounted cash
flows generated by the Block 15 OEPC production as of 16 May 2006 is US$
2,359,500,000 (US Two billion, three hundred fifty nine millions and five
hundred thousand dollars)”. [Footnote omitted].

Consequently, the Committee’s decision to partially annul the Award must lead to
the annulment of the quantification of damages (US$ 1,769,625,000) contained in
Sub-paragraph (v) of the dispositive section of the Award to the extent that it
compensates the Claimants for 100% (and not for 60%) of the value of Block 15—
but not of the rest of such Sub-paragraph.

The next question to be addressed is whether the Committee is authorized to
substitute the annulled figure of damages with the correct number, or whether this
task must be entrusted to a new investment tribunal. The parties have discussed
this issue, and while Respondent favours the constitution of a new tribunal?,
Claimants have accepted that in the proper circumstances annulment committees
are authorized to insert correct data in partially annulled decisions".

The Committee concurs with Claimants.

It is true that annulment committees are not empowered to amend or replace awards.
But this is not the task at hand. What is required in this case, in which the
Committee is partially annulling the Award, is for the Annulment Committee to
substitute the Tribunal’s figure of damages with the correct one. If this task can be
performed without further submissions from the Parties and without additional
marshalling of evidence, committees should be entitled to do so. Basic reasons of
procedural economy speak in favour of this solution. There is no need for the
parties to incur the additional cost and delay of going through a second investment
arbitration, when the correct number can be inserted by the annulment committee,
after performing a very simple arithmetic calculation and without further input from
the parties.

This is the case in the present arbitration.

The Tribunal has established the value of 100% Block 15, i.e. of the Farmout
Property, at US$ 2,359,500,000. Consequently, the value of a 60% interest would
amount to US$ 1,415,700,000. Applying to this amount the 25% reduction factor
explained in para. 825 of the Award, the resulting amount is US$ 1,061,775,000.
This is the proper amount that should have been inserted in Sub-paragraph (v) of
the dispositive section of the Award, reading as follows”!!:

“876 [...] (v) Claimants are awarded the amount of US$ 1,061,775,000 (US
One billion, sixty one millions, seven hundred and seventy five thousand

dollars), as calculated in paragraph 825 of this Award, for damages suffered
as a result of the breaches set out above in subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii)”.

oR

302. Respondent has alleged a number of additional grounds for partial annulment of the
Tribunal’s decision to award damages to OEPC based on a 100% (and not a 60%)
interest in the Farmout Property or which pertain to the 60/40 issue. Since these
grounds, if accepted, would lead to the same result as the partial annulment already
decided by the Committee, they have become moot and need not be further
addressed?!”,

212 These grounds include inter alia the following:

i) The Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by, and failed to state the reasons for, declaring inexistent
the illegal, unauthorized assignment between Claimants and AEC/Andes (RI, ground 14, para.580; RII,
ground 12, para. 582)

(ii) The Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by, after the submission phase of the arbitration had
concluded, raising a new argument for Claimants and awarding Claimants US$ 943 million on that
argument (RI, ground 12, para. 502; RI, ground 10, para. 392).

VII. OTHER GROUNDS FOR ANULLMENT

Respondent avers that there are eight additional grounds?! for annulment, three of
which should result in the annulment of the entire Award, and four in the annulment
of certain parts; there is also an allegation of a serious departure from a fundamental
tule of procedure.

The three grounds for total annulment are:
- The decision to apply the principle of proportionality (1.);

- The decision that Claimants’ violation of the HCL and the Participation
Contract was mere negligence (2.);

- The decision that Claimants’ treaty claims were not defective because this
issue was res iudicata (3.);

The four grounds for partial annulment of certain parts of the Award are:

- The exclusive use of a DCF model in determining the value of the
investment (4.);

- The decision to disregard Law 42 when assessing Claimants’
damages (5.);

- The decision to disregard the VAT Interpretative Law (6.);

- The decision to disregard alternatives to caducidad when awarding
damages (7.);

The alleged serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure affects the
Tribunal’s email dated February 15, 2011 (8.)7!4.

Manifest Excess of Powers

Most of the grounds for annulment invoked by Respondent are based on the
argument that the Tribunal committed a manifest excess of powers by failing to
choose the proper law to be applied to the merits.

It should be remembered that the test for this ground to succeed is very high.

Investment arbitration case law is unanimous in the conclusion that annulment for
failure to choose the proper law applicable to the merits is only permitted if the
tribunal totally disregarded applicable law or grounded its award on a law other
than the applicable law. The error committed by the tribunal must consist in
applying the wrong law, not in wrongly interpreting the correct law.

213 See R III p. 316.
24 Respondent alleges that the decision to disregard alternatives to Caducidad also implied a serious
departure from a fundamental rule of procedure — R III p. 315.

313.

215

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

Misinterpretation or misapplication of the proper law to the merits, even if serious,
does not justify annulment. Only exceptionally gross or egregious errors of law,
acknowledged as such by any reasonable person, could be construed to amount to
a failure to apply the proper law, and could give rise to the possibility of
annulment?!>,

Failure to state Reasons

The same high standard applies to the failure to state reasons, the other ground
frequently invoked by Respondent: as long as reasons have been stated, even if
incorrect, unconvincing or non-exhaustive, the award cannot be annulled. Only total
absence of reasoning or contradictory or frivolous reasons can lead to annulment”!®.

THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY

The principle of proportionality is one of the cornerstones of the Award. The
Tribunal devoted a full section and 35 pages of its analysis to “The Proportionality
of the Sanction for the Unauthorized Transfer of Rights under the Participation
Contract?!’. The Tribunal drew its (in this point unanimous) decision in para
452718;

452. It follows that even if OEPC, as the Tribunal found earlier, breached
Clause 16.1. of the Participation Agreement and was guilty of an actionable
violation of Article 74.11 (or Articles 74.12 or 74.13), the Caducidad Decree
was not a proportionate response in the particular circumstances, and the
Tribunal so finds”.

Respondent’s Position

Respondent argues that in an inherently contradictory decision the Tribunal held
that caducidad was a disproportionate sanction and therefore contrary to
Ecuadorian law, customary international law and the Treaty, despite having found

- That in the Participation Agreement the Parties freely agreed that
caducidad was the applicable sanction if OEPC transferred rights to third
parties without approval and

- That OEPC had transferred rights without such approval?!.
The Award should be annulled because its central holding is that although Ecuador

imposed the exact sanction to which Claimants agreed in the Participation Contract,
that sanction was disproportionate. Such a holding creates an inescapable conflict

with the principle of pacta sunt servanda and represents a textbook example of a
tribunal acting as amiable compositeur™®.

In Respondent’s opinion, the Tribunal avoided the application of the Participation
Contract, a contract executed after extensive arms-length negotiations between
sophisticated parties, and in doing so failed to apply Ecuadorian law and the
international law principle of pacta sunt servanda™'. In fact, what the Tribunal did
was to rewrite the Participation Contract”. Where the will of the Parties is clear —
as it is with respect to the terms of the Participation Contract — the principle of
proportionality has no place?”*.

By purporting to apply a principle of proportionality that is not encompassed in the
Participation Contract, Ecuadorian law, the Treaty or customary international law,
the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers because:

- The proportionality principle is not referred to in the Participation

Contract?”4;

- There is no proportionality principle which overrides the pacta sunt

servanda principle neither under Ecuadorian law??? nor under

international law”;

- The fair and equitable treatment (“FET”) principle in the Treaty cannot be
relied upon to avoid application of the Participation Contract.

The Tribunal also failed to state the reasons on which it decided to hold Ecuador
liable for a breach of the proportionality principle’, and its decision is based on
incomprehensible or, at best, frivolous reasons”°8,

violated that principle when it did so?**. The Tribunal’s reasoning can be followed
from point A to point B and to its conclusion and so does not warrant annulment?*?.

Claimants aver that the Award provides no basis for annulment: the Award clearly
stated the Tribunal’s reasons for its decision that the principle is incorporated into
the Treaty and into customary international law?** and that the proportionality
principle and the pacta sunt servanda principle are not in conflict?*°. Claimants
also reject that the reasoning was contradictory, incomprehensible or frivolous”°.

As regards excess of powers — which Claimants analyse separately — the Tribunal
applied the proper law when it concluded that the Caducidad Decree was a
disproportionate sanction in breach of the Treaty, customary international law,
Ecuadorian law and the Participation Contract”*’. Claimants underline that the
Tribunal declared caducidad on the basis of HCL and not of the Participation
Agreements** and did not rewrite or avoid the application of the Participation
Contract or avoid the application of the pacta sunt servanda principle?*’. Neither
did the Tribunal decide ex aequo et bono when it found that a principle of
proportionality exists under international law™"°.

The Committee’s Decision

. The Committee will analyze Ecuador’s argument that the Award should be annulled

by first explaining the Tribunal’s (unanimous) decision regarding proportionality
(a.) and then reviewing and ultimately rejecting the Republic’s arguments (b.).

The Tribunal’s Decision regarding Proportionality

The Tribunal started its analysis of proportionality stating that under Ecuadorian
law proportionality is a general principle of administrative law. Relying on the
testimony of both Parties’ Ecuadorian law experts and on several Ecuadorian law
authorities (including the CE, Ecuadorian administrative law and Ecuadorian
Supreme Court jurisprudence) the Tribunal found that"!

“398. [...] the Government must weigh the content and purpose of any
sanctioning measure with the conduct which has been impugned, and with the
loss of rights which the individual will suffer by reason of the intended
sanction” [Footnote omitted].

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

The Tribunal’s explanation makes clear that proportionality is a principle to be
applied by the Ecuadorian authorities when adopting actos administrativos or
imposing administrative sanctions. It is not a principle of contract law.

The Tribunal then added that the principle of proportionality is also commonly
applied “in a variety of international settings”, including the WTO Panel decisions
concerning the GATT, decisions of the European Court of Justice, of the European
Court of Human Rights and tribunals in international investment disputes”*?. The
proportionality principle is also “applicable to potential breaches of bilateral
investment treaty obligations”, including the FET standard***. Here the Tribunal
analyzed and relied on a number of ICSID decisions”.

The Tribunal then delved into the precise meaning of proportionality when applied
to the imposition by the public administration of a severe penalty like caducidad.
The Tribunal declared’:

“416. [...] In cases where the administration wishes to impose a severe
penalty, then it appears to the Tribunal that the State must be able to
demonstrate (i) that sufficiently serious harm was caused by the offender;
and/or (ii) that there had been a flagrant or persistent breach of the relevant
contract/law, sufficient to warrant the sanction imposed; and/or (iii) that for
reasons of deterrence and good governance it is appropriate that a significant
penalty be imposed, even though the harm suffered in the particular instance
may not have been serious”.

The Tribunal found that it was ultimately common ground between the parties that
the principle of proportionality applied to the present dispute, because a declaration
of caducidad pursuant to Article 74 HCL is a discretionary administrative sanction
and the parties agreed that4°

“where the Minister has a discretion, the principle of proportionality is
relevant”.

On the evidence presented to it, the Tribunal unanimously concluded that Ecuador
had violated the proportionality principle when it declared caducidad, because the
Minister had other, less traumatic, legal options”*”, but notwithstanding these
alternatives, chose the radical sanction of caducidad, which implied the loss of
Claimants’ total investment, amounting to many hundred millions of US$.

This decision was influenced by the fact that OEPC had successfully litigated
against the Republic in another investment arbitration, and had secured the so-
called VAT Award, which required Ecuador to indemnify OEPC in an amount of
more than U$$ 70 M.

329. The Tribunal noted that farmout agreements are very common in the oil industry,
that Ecuador suffered no harm?“®, that AEC was already an approved operator in
Ecuador’, that some punishment for OEPC’s failure to secure the authorization
may well have been justified’, but

“450. [...] the overriding principle of proportionality requires that any such
administrative goal must be balanced against the Claimants’ own interests and
against the true nature and effect of the conduct being censured. The Tribunal
finds that the price paid by the Claimants — total loss of an investment worth
many hundreds of millions of dollars — was out of proportion to the
wrongdoing alleged against OEPC, and similarly out of proportion to the
importance and effectiveness of the “deterrence message” which the
Respondent might have wished to send to the wider oil and gas community”.

330. The Tribunal concluded”*!:

“452. It follows that even if OEPC, as the Tribunal found earlier, breached
Clause 16.1 of the Participation Contract and was guilty of an actionable
violation of Article 74.11 (or Articles 74.12 or 74.13), the Caducidad Decree
was not a proportionate response in the particular circumstances, and the
Tribunal so finds. The Caducidad Decree was accordingly issued in breach of
Ecuadorian law, in breach of customary international law, and in violation of
the Treaty. As to the latter, the Tribunal expressly finds that the Caducidad
Decree constituted a failure by the Respondent to honour its Article II.3(a)
obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment to the Claimants’ investment,
and to accord them treatment no less [favourable] than that required by
international law”.

And clause 21.1. of the Participation Contract states as follows:
“21.1. Terminacién: Este Contrato de Participacién terminara:

(

21.1.1. Por declaratoria de caducidad emitida por el Ministerio del Ramo por
las causales y bajo el procedimiento establecido en los articulos setenta y
cuatro (74), setenta y cinco (75) y setenta y seis (78) de la Ley de
Hidrocarburos, en lo que sean aplicables;

21.1.2. Por transferir derechos y obligaciones del Contrato de Participacién,
sin autorizacién del Ministerio del Ramo”.

The Alternatives in Case of unauthorized Transfer

In accordance with the HCL and with clause 21.1 of the Participation Contract an
unauthorized transfer of the Participation Contract can lead to two different results:

(i) The first alternative is an administrative declaration of caducidad by the
Ecuadorian administrative authorities.

Article 74 HCL authorizes the Minister, after having observed the appropriate
procedimiento administrati vo”, to adopt an acto administrativo, the declaration of
caducidad, premised on one or more of the grounds set forth in the HCL (not in the
Contract) having been met. And one of such grounds is the unauthorized transfer
of rights and obligations deriving from the Participation Contract. As a matter of
Ecuadorian domestic law, if the holder of the concession contract disagrees with
the Minister’s acto administrativo, it can be appealed before the appropriate
Tribunal contencioso-administrativo™>.

Caducidad is not a contractual decision; it is an administrative act regulated in the
HCL. Clause 21.1.1. of the Participation Contract simply draws the contractual
consequences of a declaracién de caducidad adopted by the Minister: in that case
the Participation Contract — a contract signed between Petroecuador (not the
Republic) and OEPC — is terminated.

But caducidad not only provokes the contractual termination of the Participation
Contract, it also implies a severe administrative sanction under Article 75 HCL:
OEPC is required to turn over to the Government all assets and equipment used for
the exploration and production of Block 15, without any compensation, and to
forfeit any bonds or guarantees‘.

(ii) Unauthorized transfer of the Participation Contract can also lead to a different
result: PetroEcuador can choose to exercise its contractual right to terminate the
Participation Contract under clause 21.1.2., which provides that if OEPC transfers

See the reference to the procedimiento administrativo in clause 21.1.1. of the Participation Contract.

253 Article 173 CE.
254 Clause 21.2.4 includes a cross-reference to the sanction. But Ecuador’s right to take OEPC’s Block 15
assets without compensation derives from Art. 75 HCL, not from Clause 21.2.4.

Decision on Annulment

its rights and obligations without ministerial authorization, the Participation
Contract can be terminated by a decision adopted by PetroEcuador (not by the
Republic). This decision is contractual in nature, does not constitute an acto
administrativo, and any dispute with regard thereto must be adjudicated in
accordance with the arbitration clause contained in such Contract.

Contractual termination by PetroEcuador leads to ordinary restitution under civil
law — it does not result in OEPC’s obligation to turn over all Block 15 assets to the
State without compensation”.

Ecuador’s Decision

In the present case the Republic opted for the first alternative: after having followed
the appropriate administrative procedure, which included OEPC’s right to be heard,
the Minister adopted an acto administrativo declaring caducidad, the Caducidad
Decree. The issuance of the Decree produced the sanction provided for in Article
75 HCL: OEPC was forced to turn over to the public administration all Block 15
assets, which represented investments amounting to many hundred millions of US$,
without any compensation.

Against this factual and legal backdrop Ecuador is arguing

- That the application of the proportionality principle is in contradiction
with the pacta sunt servanda principle, and that the Tribunal rewrote the
Participation Contract to insert the proportionality principle;

- That in the Participation Contract the parties had agreed that the
declaration of caducidad by the Minister would automatically lead to
termination, and where the will of the parties is clear, there is no place for
proportionality.

The Committee’s Decision

Ecuador’s arguments fail, being based on a wrong understanding of what the
Tribunal decided and what the Parties agreed upon.

In its Award the Tribunal decided that both Ecuadorian and international law
require that when administrative authorities adopt decisions to sanction citizens,
they must apply the principle of proportionality, weighing the severity of the
sanction against various factors (which include the harm caused and the nature of
the violation), in order to avoid that the irregular behaviour of the citizen be
sanctioned with a disproportionate penalty.

After
- noting a close connection between the VAT Award (which required the

Republic to pay a significant indemnity to OEPC) and the declaration of
caducidad and the existence of “‘ill-feeling against OEPC” in Ecuador,

Decision on Annulment

- establishing that Ecuador had suffered no harm as a consequence of the
violation,

- taking into account that Ecuador could have imposed a less drastic
sanction and indeed had done so in past similar violations,

the Tribunal, weighing the available evidence, found that the caducidad decision
“was not a proportionate response in the particular circumstances”>*°.

The Tribunal has convincingly reasoned and explained its decision. But even if the
reasoning had been less convincing, the weighing of evidence and the eminently
factual evaluation of whether an administrative decision is or not proportional, form
part of the Tribunal’s prerogatives, which under Article 52 of the Convention, as a
general rule, fall outside the remit of an ad hoc committee.

There is a further argument: the Tribunal’s finding is also perfectly consistent with
the Parties’ agreement (under clause 21.1.1 of the Participation Contract) that a
declaration of caducidad would result in termination of the Contract. That clause
can only refer to a properly adopted declaration of caducidad, not to one which was
taken in contravention of Ecuadorian law. The clause does not imply — as Ecuador
seems to say— that OEPC consented that any declaration of caducidad, however
adopted, could result in termination and loss of all assets without compensation.

A simple reductio ad absurdum proves the point: assume that the Minister’s
declaration had been adopted with desviacién de poder or with corruption. Clause
21.1.1. cannot be construed as OEPC’s ex ante acceptance that a declaration of
caducidad, even if adopted under such irregularities, would legitimatize the
termination of the Contract and seizure of assets without compensation.

Inexistence of the Principle of Proportionality in applicable Law

Ecuador also argues that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers because
the principle of proportionality is allegedly not encompassed in the Participation
Contract, Ecuadorian law, or in customary international law.

The argument cannot succeed, because the standard for annulment in allegations of
misapplication or misinterpretation of law applicable to the merits is especially
high: only exceptionally gross or egregious errors of law could be construed to
amount to a failure to apply the proper law to the merits, and could give rise to the
possibility of annulment?*’. The Tribunal has not committed any gross or egregious
error of law. To the contrary: the Tribunal has convincingly explained that the
principle of proportionality between intensity and scope of the illicit activity, and
severity of the sanction is a general principle of punitive and tort law, both under
Ecuadorian and under international law.

The Committee has summarized the Tribunal’s reasoning on this issue in the
preceding sub-section?*. The reasoning can be followed from point A to point B
and to the Tribunal’s decision. Respondent’s argument that the Tribunal failed to
state the reasons on which it decided to hold Ecuador liable for a breach of the
proportionality principle, or that its decision is based on incomprehensible or,
frivolous reasons, fails.

THE FIND! IF NEGLIGENCE

 

Respondent’s Position

Respondent argues that the Tribunal failed to state the reasons on which it based its
decision and manifestly exceeded its powers when it held that Claimants were
merely negligent in failing to disclose the true nature of the Farmout Agreement to
Ecuador and to obtain ministerial authorization in 2000. This finding allegedly had
a case-determinative effect on the Tribunal’s holding in relation to two key issues,
the proportionality of the Caducidad Decree and Claimants’ appropriate percentage
of fault?>?.

 

Respondent adds that the Tribunal’s analysis is self-contradictory. The Tribunal
labeled Claimants’ conduct as negligent, but described it precisely in intentional,
not negligent terms”. The Tribunal created a new kind of violation of the HCL
(a merely negligent one) and then concluded that Ecuador had acted
disproportionally in declaring caducidad”*'. In so doing, the Tribunal ignored
uncontroverted evidence**’, misapplied Ecuadorian law?®, provided no reasons?
and contradicted many of its own findings in other parts of the Award”. The
Tribunal also failed to state reasons, the finding of negligence remaining
unexplained” and self-contradictory?”’.

Ecuadorian law distinguishes between conduct that is “dolosa” and conduct that is
“culposa” (with three different levels of “culpa”) — but the Tribunal never
mentioned, much less applied, the standard of care that governed Claimants’
conduct under Ecuadorian law?®*. The Tribunal simply averred that OEPC was
negligent because it lacked bad faith — without any analysis, consideration,
reference or mention of the legal standard under Ecuadorian law?®. And the
Tribunal’s determination of negligence affected both the finding of lack of
proportionality and the issue of quantum?”°.

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

The Tribunal’s determination that OEPC negligently breached the Participation
Contract and violated the HCL ignores settled Ecuadorian law, which does not take
into account the actor’s intent when evaluating or determining a violation of the
HCL. Thus the Tribunal manifestly failed to apply Ecuadorian law and
international law, and acted ex aequo et bono",

Claimants’ Position

. Claimants first line of defense is that the Committee should not consider this ground

for annulment for two reasons:

- Factual findings are not reviewable in an annulment; and the Tribunal’s
negligence finding was a factual finding?”*;

- Furthermore the finding only affected two issues on which Ecuador
prevailed: the dismissal of Claimants’ legitimate expectations claim and
the determination of contributory fault by OEPC, which resulted in a
reduction of the amount of damages by 25%”.

. In addition, Claimants submit that the foundation of Ecuador’s argument is wrong.

The Tribunal did not artificially create a new kind of violation of the HCL —- a
merely negligent one?”*. Nor did the Tribunal identify negligence as a factor in its
proportionality analysis, let alone a determinative one?”. Instead, the Tribunal
based its argument that the Caducidad Decree lacked proportionality on three
findings:

- That Ecuador suffered no harm;
- There existed in Ecuador ill feeling against OEPC; and

- Ecuador could have imposed less drastic sanctions?”°.

. Furthermore, the Tribunal clearly stated the reasons for its finding that Claimants

did not act in bad faith but were merely negligent?”’, and in its conclusion that the
Caducidad Decree was a disproportionate sanction in breach of the Treaty,
customary international law and the Participation Contract?’*. The Tribunal’s
reasoning can be followed from point A to point B and so does not warrant
annulment?”?.

negligence (a.) and then reviewing and ultimately rejecting the Republic’s
arguments (b.).

a. The Tribunal’s Decision regarding Negligence

360. In essence, Ecuador’s ground for annulment is based on one single word, used by
the Tribunal in one single paragraph of the Award — paragraph 380.

361. Paragraph 380 reads as follows:

“380. The Tribunal reiterates its conclusion. As the Tribunal’s analysis of the
Farmout Agreements earlier in this Award has demonstrated, the Claimants’
interpretation of the Farmout Agreement was wrong. However, the Tribunal
does not consider, as the Respondent has argued, that it was made in bad faith.
The Claimants’ failure to seek ministerial authorization was a mistake, a
serious mistake, but it was not done in bad faith. Should Paul MacInnes and
his colleagues, during their visit with Minister Teran on 24 October 2000, have
given him a copy of the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating
Agreement so that his advisors could have formed their own opinion about the
true nature of the transaction? As stated earlier, the Tribunal has no hesitation
in answering its own question in the affirmative. OEPC and AEC were
negligent in not doing so. But again, the Tribunal does not find that failure to
do so amounted to bad faith. They may have been negligent but there was no
intention on their part to mislead. They were simply convinced that they were
right and acted accordingly without seeking to mislead the Ecuadorian
government. In a number of instances, in the fall of 2000, they revealed
publicly in Ecuador that they had entered into a farmout transaction with
AEC”. [Emphasis added].

362. This paragraph concludes a very long section (Section 2) entitled “OEPC’s Duty to
obtain Authorization for the Transfer of Rights under the Participation Contract”,
devoted to a detailed analysis of Claimants’ failure to request authorization for the
execution of the Farmout Agreements from the Ecuadorian government. In
paragraph 380 the Tribunal “reiterates the conclusions” to be drawn from the
preceding section; these conclusions are eminently factual and consist of the
following three findings:

- That Claimants’ failure to seek ministerial authorization was a serious
mistake;

- That Claimants were “negligent” when they failed to deliver a copy of the
Farmout Agreements at the visit to the Ecuadorian Minister;

- That there was however no bad faith and no intention to mislead.
Legal consequences

363. The Tribunal’s factual findings gives rise to two legal consequences:

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

(i) The first consequence is drawn by the Tribunal in paragraph 383, which provides
as follows”:

“[...] Having concluded above that OEPC’s failure to secure the required
authorization on the part of the Ecuadorian authorities in October 2000, while
not amounting to bad faith, was negligent, the Tribunal considers that the
Claimants cannot be found to have had a legitimate expectation that the
Minister would not exercise his discretion and impose caducidad”.

In the Tribunal’s opinion, Claimants’ negligence leads to the forfeiture of any
legitimate expectation that the Minister would not exercise his sanctioning powers
and decree caducidad.

(ii) The second consequence is drawn in the following section (Section 3) entitled
“The Proportionality of the Sanction for the unauthorized Transfer of Rights under
the Participation Contract”. The section starts at paragraph 384, in which the
Tribunal once again reiterates its factual findings:

“384. The Tribunal has found that the Farmout Agreement and the Joint
Operating Agreement operated to effect a transfer of rights under the
Participation Contract from OEPC to AEC. The Tribunal has also found that
this transfer required authorization on the part of the Ecuadorian authorities,
that this authorization was not sought, but that OEPC’s failure to secure such
authorization in October 2000, while imprudent and ill advised, did not
amount to bad faith” [Emphasis added].

It is worth noting that in this summary of facts, the Tribunal drops the expression
“negligent”, and substitutes it with “imprudent”. The use of this synonym shows
that the Tribunal never gave a precise legal meaning to the concepts “negligent” or
“imprudent” — they were used as convenient adjectives to describe Claimants’
conduct. Contrary to Respondent’s allegation, the Tribunal never had the intention
of creating a new kind of violation of the HCL — a merely negligent one.

After this summary of its previous findings, contained in paragraph 384, the
Tribunal devotes a 35 page long discussion”*! to the legal issue of proportionality,
reaching the conclusion that the sanction of caducidad imposed by the Government
was a disproportionate punishment for Claimants’ wrongdoing, for three reasons:

- because Ecuador suffered no harm,

- because there was ill feeling against OEPC arising from its success in
securing the VAT Award, and

- because the Republic had the alternative of imposing less drastic
sanctions”*?,

The Tribunal’s finding that OEPC’s conduct had been “imprudent”, “negligent”
and “ill advised”, but did not amount to “bad faith”, is not mentioned expressis

verbis among the reasons canvassed by the Tribunal to justify its disproportionality
conclusion. The Tribunal however refers to Claimants’ negligent or imprudent
conduct in paragraph 384, the first of the proportionality section, as a “preliminary
Observation”; thus, it is very likely that this factual finding weighed in the
Tribunal’s mind when it decided that the caducidad was a disproportionate
sanction.

Review of Respondent’s Arguments

The Republic argues that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers when it held
that Claimants were merely negligent in failing to disclose the true nature of the
Farmout Agreement to Ecuador and to obtain ministerial authorization and failed
to state the reasons on which it based its decision. Claimants disagree: in their
submission, the Tribunal’s findings were purely factual, only related to issues on
which Ecuador prevailed, and were properly reasoned.

71. The Committee has already noted that as a general rule factual findings and

weighing of evidence made by tribunals are outside the scope of review of ad hoc
committees — an exception could only be allowed if the applicant can prove that the
errors of fact committed by the Tribunal are so egregious as to give rise to one of
the grounds for annulment listed in Article 52(1) of the Convention?*?.

In paragraphs 380, 383 and 384 of the Award the Tribunal finds that the Claimants,
although they failed to request the necessary authorization, did not act in “bad
faith”, that they “may have been negligent, but there was no intention on their part
to mislead”, and that their failure to secure the authorization “while imprudent and
ill advised, did not amount to bad faith”.

. These are all factual findings, which the Tribunal adopted after having reviewed the

extensive evidentiary record, heard the witnesses and weighed the available
evidence. The Tribunal is best placed to perform this task, and its conclusions
should not be second-guessed by an ad hoc committee — save in exceptional
circumstances, when the errors of fact committed by the tribunal are so egregious
as to give rise to one of the grounds for annulment established in Article 52(1) of
the Convention.

No exceptional Circumstances
This exception is clearly not applicable in the present case.

The reasoning used by the Tribunal in reaching its conclusion that Claimants acted
negligently, but not in bad faith, is straightforward and easy to follow:

- There was a “debate within the ranks of OEPC as to whether or not
ministerial authorization was necessary”**+ and “the two camps within
OEPC had sound and valid reasons”?8>;

“[T]he mutual waiver executed by OEPC and AEC on 31 October 2000
[...] confirms the prevailing OEPC and AEC view that no governmental
approval was required for the transfer of the 40% economic interest. This
waiver is consistent with Version A [of the draft letter], the script of the
first three paragraphs of the 25 October letter but not with the fourth
paragraph of that letter”?*°. “That paragraph is misleading. The Tribunal
does not believe that OEPC intended to mislead Minister Teran but that

nevertheless was the result of the imprecise wording”?*’;

“[O]n 1 November 2000, OPC issued a press release. That news release is
wholly inconsistent with the theory of the Respondent that the Claimants
wanted to conceal the transaction”*8;

Claimants were “simply convinced that they were right and acted
accordingly without seeking to mislead the Ecuadorian government””*?;

“In a number of instances in the fall of 2000 [Claimants] had revealed
publicly in Ecuador that they had entered into a Farmout transaction with
AEC. When they realized that their behaviour, and in particular the last
paragraph of their 25 October letter, created confusion within the Ministry,
they tried to dissipate that confusion”?”°;

“Claimants’ interpretation of the Farmout Agreement was wrong.
However, the Tribunal does not consider, as the respondent has argued,
that it was made in bad faith”??!;

All these arguments lead the Tribunal to the following conclusion??:

“OEPC’s failure to secure the required authorization on the part of the
Ecuadorian authorities in October 2000, while not amounting to bad faith, was
negligent”.

376. Against this background, Respondent’s annulment request cannot succeed.

377. Contrary to Ecuador’s submission, the Tribunal did not fail to give reasons, its
analysis is not self-contradictory, and the Tribunal most certainly did not create a
new kind of violation of the HCL. The Tribunal simply made a judgmental analysis
of Claimants’ conduct, and for the reasons clearly explained in the Award,
concluded that OEPC had not acted with bad faith, but simply imprudently or
negligently. The Committee understands this conclusion to mean that OEPC had
not acted with gross negligence which is commonly regarded as amounting to or
equivalent to bad faith, but had acted only with simple imprudence or negligence.
It then applied this factual finding to justify the dismissal of OEPC’s legitimate

378. There is no basis for an annulment. Ecuador’s ground for annulment is dismissed.

379, Clause 22.2.1. of the Participation Contract reads as follows:

“En el caso de controversias que pudieren surgir a causa de la aplicacién de
este Contrato de Participacién, la Contratista, de acuerdo con la legislacién
del Ecuador, renuncia de manera expresa a utilizar la via diplomatica o
consular, o a recurrir a cualquier 6rgano jurisdiccional nacional 0 extranjero
no previsto en este Contrato de Participacién, o a un arbitraje no reconocido
por la ley ecuatoriana 0 no previsto en este Contrato de Participacién. El
incumplimiento de esta disposicién sera motivo de caducidad de este Contrato
de Participacién”.

380. In the jurisdictional phase of the procedure, Respondent made and the Tribunal
dismissed a jurisdictional challenge, arguing that clause 22.2.1. of the Participation
Contract implied an agreement that caducidad related disputes be exclusively
solved by the Ecuadorian administrative courts. In paragraph 70 of the Decision on
Jurisdiction, the Tribunal stated its decision:

“70. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants regarding the interpretation of
Clause 22.2.1 of the Participation Contract. The Tribunal does not accept that,
by virtue of this provision, the parties agreed that caducidad-related disputes
under the Participation Contract would solely be resolved by submission to
the Ecuadorian administrative courts, i.e. the TCA. This is simply not what
the clause says”.

381. The defense that claims must be first submitted to the Ecuadorian administrative
courts was again brought up by Ecuador in the merits phase of the arbitration. In
the Award, the Tribunal dismissed the argument with the following reasoning””?:

“291. [...] The Claimants were legally obliged, says the Respondent, to pursue
a local challenge to the Caducidad Decree before the courts in Ecuador.

292. In brief, the Claimants answer that this is a “recycled” version of the
jurisdictional argument advanced by the Respondent in its jurisdictional
challenge which has been dismissed by the Tribunal in its Decision on
Jurisdiction and which is now being “reincarnated” as a merits defense.

293. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants. The matter is res judicata”.

382. The Award then made a cross-reference to paragraph 70 of the jurisdictional
Decision (quoted above), and summarily came to the following conclusion?**:

Decision on Annulment

Respondent’s Position

Ecuador avers that Claimants did not seek a reasonable resolution of the caducidad
claims in the Ecuadorian administrative courts before submitting their Request for
Arbitration; instead they filed such Request almost immediately””’. This fact has
given rise to two successive defenses, in the jurisdictional phase first and then in
the merits phase.

In its merits argument Ecuador submits, as a substantive matter, that Claimants’
treaty claims must be dismissed, because the Minister’s Caducidad Decree does not
rise to the level of an international treaty breach, Claimants having failed to first
challenge the declaration in the Ecuador administrative courts?®. Respondent
argues that when the Tribunal dismissed this argument in its Award, it manifestly
exceeded its powers and failed to state reasons.

Respondent adds that the defense that a treaty claim is defective on the merits is
distinct from a jurisdictional objection that the claim is not admissible for failure to
exhaust administrative remedies.

The Tribunal rejected Ecuador’s argument on the mistaken basis that it was the
same argument that Ecuador had raised during the jurisdictional phase. Without
any reasoning or analysis, the Tribunal stated, in conclusory fashion, that the matter
is res iudicata. I n holding so, the Tribunal failed to discuss the applicable law
governing res iudicata and the case law presented by Respondent””’, and also
whether Ecuador’s defense was indeed barred by that doctrine?**. The Tribunal’s
interpretation of the principle of res iudicata was egregiously incorrect, and the
error was so grave as to be tantamount to a manifest excess of powers”. The
absence of any rationale or, at best, the merely perfunctory nature of the reasons on
this point makes it impossible for the reader to follow the Tribunal’s reasoning?”

Claimants’ Position

Claimants aver that the arguments presented by Ecuador in the jurisdictional and
merits phase were indistinct. They relied on exactly the same premise, that the State
should be afforded the opportunity to review the egregious conduct, made the same
arguments and used the same authorities*”'. In the Award, the Tribunal again
dismissed the recycled objection, referring to res iudicata, with the meaning that it
had already considered and decided this issue*’’. The Tribunal did state its reasons

for dismissing Ecuador’s recycled jurisdictional objection; it had been argued
previously and dismissed and consequently it was res iudicata*™.

In any case, the Tribunal’s invocation of res iudicata was proper, because there was
sufficient identity of grounds, Ecuador’s submissions in both the jurisdictional and
merits phase being founded on the same holdings from the same, inapplicable, case
law. If the Tribunal had not unanimously rejected Ecuador’s arguments as res
iudicata, and had once again dealt fully in the Award with Ecuador’s repetitive
argument, there is no reason to believe that the Tribunal would have come to a

different conclusion than it did in the Decision on Jurisdiction*™*.

The Committee’s Decision

This annulment ground revolves around the issue whether Claimants, as a
precondition to filing their caducidad related claims in the investment arbitration,
were forced to submit such claims to adjudication by the Ecuadorian administrative
courts.

The issue was brought up by Respondent in the jurisdictional phase of the
arbitration. It gave rise to the so-called first Jurisdictional Objection. The Tribunal
rejected it, arguing that Ecuador could not rely on its domestic law to evade ICSID
arbitration*®’, and that the parties had not agreed that caducidad related claims

would solely be resolved by submission to the Ecuadorian administrative courts*”®.

In the merits phase Ecuador brought up the same argument again. It argued that*°”:
“291. [...] Claimants’ Treaty claims are ‘substantially defective’ even if the
Tribunal has jurisdiction over these claims because ‘the act of the Minister in
issuing the Caducidad Decree cannot attach responsibility to the State as a
substantive matter when there was a mechanism available for review of that

act, which the investor simply failed to invoke’”.

The Tribunal dismissed Ecuador’s objection with little difficulty, holding that:
- Ecuador’s attempt to require Claimants to pursue their claims in Ecuador’s

local courts was a “recycled” version of its jurisdictional objections that
had been “reincarnated as a merits defense”*°8;

 

 

- The Tribunal had already “stated very clearly” that it rejected Ecuador’s
argument that Claimants were required to bring their claims to local
Ecuadorian courts prior to bringing their claims before ICSID*”;

- Thus the Tribunal had already “dispose[d] of the Respondent’s
preliminary objection”?!°;

- Therefore the Tribunal agreed with Claimants that Ecuador’s attempt to
re-litigate its claims was barred by “res iudicata”.

The reasoning can be followed from point A to point B and to its conclusions, to
use the MINE test?!!, and therefore does not justify annulment, because the reader
“can understand how the tribunal arrived at its conclusion”?!?.

Respondent avers that the Tribunal’s decision to refer to the principle of res iudicata
was egregiously incorrect, and the error was so grave as to be tantamount to a
manifest excess of powers. This is not so. The principle of res iudicata is a
characteristic feature of most domestic legal systems, but it is also an important
principle of international law*!?. In its Decision on Jurisdiction the Tribunal had
already dismissed Ecuador’s argument that the proper forum to adjudicate any
caducidad dispute was the Ecuadorian administrative courts. In the merits phase
of the procedure Ecuador chose to bring up the same argument again — thinly
disguised as a merits defence. The Tribunal was perfectly entitled to summarily
reject it, reasoning that the same defence had already been conclusively rejected in
the Decision on Jurisdiction.

The ground for annulment is dismissed.
DCF MODEL AS EXCLUSIVE VALUATION METHODOLOGY

The Tribunal, having established that Ecuador had breached the Treaty, turned to
the quantification of the losses suffered by OEPC. As a first step, the Tribunal
determined that a DCF valuation was the proper methodology to establish the value
of Block 153"*:

“708. The Tribunal is of the view that, in this case, the standard economic
approach to measuring the fair market value today of a stream of net revenues
(i.e., gross revenues minus attendant costs) that can be earned from the
operation of a multi-year project such as OEPC’s development of Block 15 is
the calculation of the present value, as of 16 May 2006, of the net benefits, or
“discounted cash flows”.

The Tribunal then described how it would approach the task of valuing OEPC’s
315,

assets” ”:
“709. Using a DCF model as the starting point for measuring FMV, the
Tribunal further observes that the analytical framework for determining FMV
in the present circumstances requires several steps. These steps are clearly
summarized by the Respondent. The Claimants agree. They are:

(a) Determination of the size of the reservoir [...];
(b) Creation of a production profile [...];

(c) Assignment of risk adjustment factors [...];
(d) Application of a price forecast [...]; and

(e) Application of a discount rate [...]”.

In subsequent sections the Tribunal analyzed the different steps, determined the
proper inputs into the DCF model and asked both parties’ experts to run the DCF
model using those inputs. Having done that, the Tribunal reached the conclusion
that the fair market value of Claimants’ expropriated assets amounted to US$ 2,359
M?!° — a figure which was then reduced by 25% due to Claimants’ contributory
fault.

The Tribunal also analyzed the possibility of using other valuation techniques:

First it referred to the comparable sales methodology, noting that “[t]he Respondent
submits that the examination of comparable sales is also critical ‘because it allows
the evaluator to test the reasonableness of the DCF assumptions against market
conditions”, while “Claimants maintain that it is inappropriate”*!’. The Tribunal
found in favour of Claimants?!*:

“787. Having considered the parties’ arguments and the evidence of their
respective witnesses and experts, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that
“each oil and gas property presents a unique set of value parameters”.
Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that it can derive no assistance from an
analysis of the seven transactions which the Respondent has submitted as
comparable sales”.

Second, the Tribunal also addressed the EnCana sale of 2005 as a separate
comparable transaction*!?, coming to the conclusion that it was “an inapt choice for
a comparable analysis”, because it was contaminated by the caducidad decision*”°,

because oil prices had moved and because it included non-Block 15 assets*”!.

Respondent’s Position

Respondent argues that the Award should be annulled, because the Tribunal failed
to state the reasons for basing itself exclusively on a DCF model to determine the
fair market value of OEPC’s investment?2?, notwithstanding Ecuador (and its

expert) repeatedly insisted that any such analysis should be both vetted and
corroborated with three other valuation methods*”?:

- Comparable sales analysis,
- Actual sales data and
-  Pay-out consideration***+.

Ecuador does not dispute that the Tribunal examined and rejected the “comparable
sales data” methodology presented by Ecuador’s expert. However, according to
Respondent, the two other alternative valuation methods advanced by it were not
similarly addressed, and were dismissed without a single reason**°. Given that
Ecuador had urged the Tribunal to corroborate any DCF analysis with other
methods of valuation, such /acuna in the Tribunal’s reasoning requires that its
decision on damages be annulled*”°.

This is Ecuador’s first argument.

The Republic advances a second argument why the Award should be annulled: the
Tribunal contradicted itself, initially stating that it would use the DCF model “as a
starting point for measuring FMV”*’, but then valuing Claimants’ investments
exclusively on the basis of a DCF model*”*.

Claimants’ Position

Claimants disagree. In their opinion the Tribunal did not fail to state reasons for its
decision to exclusively use a DCF analysis in determining the value of OEPC’s
investment*”’. The Tribunal’s reasoning can be followed from point A to point B
and to its conclusions, and so does not warrant annulment>”°,

Claimants then address Respondent’s specific reasons for requesting annulment.

The first reason alleged by Ecuador is that the Tribunal did not expressly reject
every argument presented by the Republic: the Award did not address, and
dismissed without a single reason, two alternative valuation methods proposed by
Ecuador, actual sales data and pay-out consideration.

. Claimants disagree: according to their submission the Tribunal did consider and

expressly rejected the actual sales data methodology, i.e. the data deriving from the
EnCana sale. Thus, the only alternative valuation method that the Tribunal did not
expressly reject was pay-out consideration, which the Republic had mentioned only

in a mere paragraph in each of its pre-hearing written pleadings and not at all in its
post-hearing brief on quantum**!. This is— in Claimants’ submission — not a ground
for annulment.

 

 

Second, Claimants advance that the Tribunal did not contradict itself, because it
never stated that the DCF model was “a starting point” to be followed by
consideration of alternative valuation methods. It is impossible to identify any
genuine contradiction in the Tribunal’s reasoning on damages that could warrant
annulment**?,

The Committee’s Decision

This ground for annulment is based exclusively on an alleged failure to state
reasons.

In this case, the failure to state reasons alleged by Ecuador refers to the Tribunal’s
quantum determination. Annulment of quantum decisions face an additional
hurdle: ad hoc committees have consistently held that tribunals have a wide margin
of discretion with respect to the calculation of damages**?.

Ecuador’s specific Request

The starting point of Respondent’s ground for annulment is the methodology
chosen by the Tribunal to establish quantum — a DCF model:

- The Tribunal justified its choice arguing that “the standard economic
approach to measuring the fair market value today [...] of Block 15 is the
calculation of the present value, as of 16 May 2006, of the net benefits or
‘discounted cash flows’”**4;

- It then added that DCF methodology was “the economically appropriate
and reliable measure of the cumulative economic harm suffered by the
Claimants as a consequence of the contract termination’”>**;

- That “the discounted cash flow method is the most widely used and
generally accepted method in the oil and gas industry for valuing sales or
acquisitions”**°;

- And came to the conclusion that supplementing the DCF model with
comparable sales analysis would be inappropriate and unreliable, because
“each oil and gas property presents a unique set of value parameters”**’;
Respondent’s expert had acknowledged “the difficulty in finding truly

comparable situations”>38;

Respondent’s expert [...] is unreliable in this case

and “the comparable sales approach of the
99339,

- Finally the Tribunal added the EnCana sale was not a useful comparable
because of contamination due to the possible issuance of the Caducidad
Decree*®, differences in the price of oil and the inclusion of non-Block 15
assets*"!.

Ecuador does not dispute that the Tribunal’s findings are properly reasoned. Its line
of argument for seeking annulment is more nuanced:

First, the Republic argues that the Tribunal failed to examine two alternative
valuation methods advanced by Ecuador (actual sales data and pay-out
consideration), which were dismissed without a single reason**”, This failure to
address particular arguments advanced by the Respondent should lead to the
annulment of the damages calculation and of the Award in toto*.

Respondent’s argument is factually wrong. As the Claimants have correctly
averred, the Tribunal did address and ultimately reject the application of the actual
sales data deriving from the EnCana sale*#*, Thus the only alternative valuation
method that the Tribunal did not expressly reject was pay-out consideration, an
obscure methodology which Respondent had briefly mentioned in its pre-hearing
written pleadings and had failed to include in its post-hearing brief on quantum**>.
Tribunals do not have the duty to address every single argument advanced by each
party. Only case-decisive arguments must be answered. Respondent has failed to
prove that the application of pay-out consideration, as an alternative methodology
to complement the valuation resulting from DCF methodology, was a case-decisive
argument, that would lead to a significant modification of the compensation to be
awarded. The fact that Respondent failed to refer to pay-out consideration in its
final and conclusive quantum brief seems to indicate the contrary: that Ecuador
itself was of the opinion that it lacked materiality for the Tribunal’s compensation
decision.

There is a second argument which is being advanced by the Respondent: it submits
that there is a contradiction in the Award, because in paragraph 709 the Tribunal
states that it will be “using a DCF model as a starting point for measuring FMV”,
while in fact the Award established the value of the investment exclusively on the
basis of a DCF model.

The argument is without merit. The Tribunal never stated that the DCF model was

The Award speaks for itself.

The ground for annulment is dismissed.

THE DECISION TO DISREGARD LAW 42 WHEN ASSESSING CLAIMANTS’ DAMAGES

 

In March 2006 the President of the Republic submitted to the Ecuadorian Congress
a bill proposing an amendment to the HCL. On 19 April 2006 the bill was passed
and became Law 42. This new law added the following provision to the HCL:

“Las compaiifas contratistas que mantienen contratos de participacién para la
exploracién y explotacién de hidrocarburos vigentes con el Estado
ecuatoriano de acuerdo con esta Ley, sin perjuicio del volumen de petréleo
crudo de participacién que les corresponde, cuando el precio promedio
mensual efectivo de venta FOB de petréleo crudo ecuatoriano supere el precio
promedio mensual de venta vigente a la fecha de suscripcidn del contrato y
expresado a valores constantes del mes de la liquidacién, reconoceran a favor
del Estado ecuatoriano una participacién de al menos el 50% de los ingresos
extraordinarios que se generen por la diferencia de precios. Para los propésitos
del presente articulo, se entenderé como ingresos extraordinarios la diferencia
de precio descrita multiplicada por el nimero de barriles producidos.

EI precio del crudo a la fecha del contrato usado como referencia para el
cdlculo de la diferencia, se ajustaré considerando el indice de Precios al
Consumidor de los Estados Unidos de América, publicado por el Banco
Central del Ecuador”.

Law 42 thus obliged concessionary companies to pay to the Ecuadorian state 50%
of their “ingresos extraordinarios”, such term being defined as the number of
barrels produced multiplied by the increase in the price of crude, at the time when
the concession was granted and when the oil was produced.

In quantifying the value of Claimants’ losses that resulted from Ecuador’s breaches,
the Tribunal needed to consider whether Law 42 should be factored into the
calculations. The Tribunal devoted a 26-page long section to this issue**° and came
to the following conclusion*“”:

“547. For all the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal will disregard Law 42 for the
purpose of its valuation of the quantum of the Claimants’ damages”

Arbitrator Prof. Stern dissented** and reached the opposite conclusion*”:

“13, As a result of the foregoing, I consider that Law 42 should have been
taken into account in the calculation of damages”. [Emphasis in the original]

425. The impact of Law 42 in the valuation of OEPC’s assets is very substantial; the
non-application reduces the value of the assets by at least US$ 816 M**, although
the actual impact could be higher**!.

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

Respondent’s Position

Respondent argues that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers (a) and failed
to state reasons (b) on which it based its decision to assume jurisdiction over Law
42 matters and to disregard the Law 42 levy when assessing Claimants’ damages.
In total Respondent lists 11 different reasons which in its opinion should lead to
annulment.

Excess of Powers
Respondent lists five reasons why the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers:

First, the Tribunal refused to consider whether under international law, Law 42 was
a “matter of taxation”, and as such excluded from the Tribunal’s jurisdiction
pursuant to Article X.2 of the Treaty. Instead, the Tribunal decided to apply
Ecuadorian law to conclude that Law 42 was not “a matter of taxation” and hence
was not excluded from jurisdiction*. This, in and of itself, is sufficient to warrant
annulment of the Award, as shown in several prior annulment decisions**?.
Ecuador then criticizes the Tribunal’s additional argument that “even if Law 42
were a tax”, it “would be captured by the ‘exception to the exception’ of Article
X.2(c)” because “the Participation Contract [...] in the opinion of the tribunal is an
investment agreement”*+. The Respondent disagrees with the Tribunal and
submits that the Participation Contract cannot be characterized as an investment
agreement, and that the Tribunal failed to state reasons and committed a manifest
excess of powers, for failure to undertake the mandate entrusted to it*> and for
failure to consider and apply the applicable law, ruling instead as an amiable
compositeur*®.

Second, the Tribunal expressly refused to apply international law when it
disregarded the international law principle according to which “States are not liable
to pay compensation to a foreign investor when, in the normal exercise of their
regulatory powers, they adopt in a nondiscriminatory manner bona fide regulations
that are aimed at the general welfare”*’, merely on the basis of a re-written
Participation Contract***.

Third, the Tribunal also manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to apply the
international law principle according to which, absent an express and specific
stabilization undertaking by the State, the fair and equitable treatment standard does
not include a legitimate expectation that the State will not amend its laws and
regulations*°. The Tribunal’s unreasoned refusal to follow the well-known
international law principle on the sole basis that the Participation Contract (which

does not include any stabilization clause and moreover expressly provides for the
application of new fiscal measures in Clauses 8.6 and 11.11) would somehow
“fetter the State’s exercise of its regulatory powers”, constitutes a manifest excess
of powers.

Fourth, the Tribunal also manifestly exceeded its powers when it effectively
disregarded the plain text of Law 42 (in particular Article 2), distinguishing between
“participation in volumes” of crude oil (guaranteed by clause 8.1. of the
Participation Contract and unaffected by Law 42) and “participation in revenues”
obtained by the concessionary (impacted and reduced by Law 42, but not
guaranteed by the Participation Contract) to conclude that Ecuador had breached
the Participation Contract**!. Several ad hoc committees have found an annullable
error where a tribunal, like in the present circumstances, failed to abide by the
ordinary meaning of the term of the legal instrument it purports to interpret and
apply?®.

 

Fifth, the Tribunal failed to apply the international law standard for determining the
FMV of Block 15 (the willing buyer/willing seller standard) and thereby manifestly
exceeded its powers**.

 

Failure to state reasons

Respondent says that the Tribunal failed to state reasons or provided directly
contradictory reasons (equivalent to no reasons) in order to avoid applying Law 42
to its calculation of the compensation:

. Sixth, the Tribunal defined Law 42 as a “unilateral decision of the Ecuadorian

Congress to allocate to the Ecuadorian State a defined percentage of revenues
earned by contractor companies such as OEPC that hold participation contract”*™,
while only one paragraph earlier it contradicted itself when it held that Law 42 “is
neither a royalty, a tax, a levy or other measure of taxation under the Participation
Contract’”*®. The contradiction could not be more glaring, as the definition
provided by the Tribunal of Law 42 is exactly that of a tax measure*®.

Seventh, in seeking to retain jurisdiction over Law 42 faced with Article X.2 of the
Treaty, the majority failed to give any reasons whatsoever for holding that “even if
Law 42 were a tax” it “would be captured by the ‘exception to the exception’ of
Article X.2(c)”. The Tribunal’s entire reasoning is found in a single sentence*”:
“the Participation Contract [...] in the opinion of the tribunal is an investment
agreement”. This conclusion is simply asserted or postulated instead of being
reasoned. It fails to even mention Ecuador’s contrary arguments and prevents the

reader from following the Tribunal’s reasoning from point A to point B and
eventually to its conclusion*®.

Eighth, the Tribunal acknowledged that the Participation Contract guaranteed
OEPC a participation in the production of crude, but also found that “by taking 50%
of OEPC’s revenues [Law 42] modified radically the participation percentages
agreed in Clause 8.1739. If Clause 8.1, as the Tribunal held, allocates only crude
production and not revenues, it is simply impossible to follow the Tribunal’s
rationale for concluding that Law 42’s taking of a percentage of revenues
constitutes a breach of clause 8.13”.

It was not disputed in the underlying arbitration that Clause 8.1’s participation
formula allocates only crude production to OEPC (not revenues) and that OEPC
continued to receive, even after the enactment of Law 42, all of the crude production
resulting from the application of Clause 8.1. Accordingly, how can a law taxing
revenues breach a contractual clause allocating crude volumes*”!?

Ninth, the Award fails to state reasons for why, after Claimants abandoned their
argument that Law 42 somehow breached Clause 5.3.2. of the Participation
Contract (contractor’s right to freely dispose of it participation in barrels), the
Tribunal found that such breach had occurred*”?. Respondent acknowledges that
the Tribunal gave reasons for one breach of the Contract — the breach relating to
Clause 8.1. But a single reasoning cannot cure the Tribunal’s failure to state reasons
for all other breaches*”?.

 

Tenth, the Tribunal failed to state reasons for why the introduction of Law 42, aside
from the contractual framework, implied a unilateral and substantial modification
of the “legal framework that existed at the time the Claimants negotiated and agreed
the Participation Contract [...]”°"4. The Award is notably silent as to what the legal
framework supposedly modified was, since not a single provision of Ecuadorian
law is cited in support of the majority’s finding?”>.

Furthermore, the Tribunal did not address the implications of the Constitutional
Court’s upholding of Law 42’s legality, which included a response to arguments of
breach of contract37°.

Eleventh, the Award failed to state the reasons for its holding that Law 42 flouts
Claimants’ legitimate expectations, in addition to a breach of the Participation

Contract, considering that the FET standard does not equate to the stabilization of
the legal framework*”’.

Claimants’ Position

Claimants submit that Ecuador’s submission on Law 42 belie its true complaint:
that the Tribunal decided against Ecuador, not that the Tribunal committed
annullable errors. Ecuador grossly distorts the true factual and procedural
background and none of its complaints have any merit, let alone constitute
annullable errors*”°.

Excess of powers

In Claimants’ opinion the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers by failing
to apply the proper law, when it decided to disregard Law 42 for the purposes of
valuing Claimants’ investment:

First, Ecuador claims that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by refusing
to consider whether under international law, Law 42 was a matter of taxation for
purposes of the Treaty. The Claimant avers that the Tribunal did not refuse to do
so, because it analyzed whether Law 42

 

“is [...] a tax, a royalty, a levy or, more generally, a ‘matter of taxation’ under
the Treaty [...]”>”"

and came to the conclusion that it is not**,

Besides, Ecuador feigns ignorance of its own prior confirmation in the VAT
Agreement of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction regarding Law 42. Ecuador cannot, on the
one hand, agree in a contract that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over Law 42 and
now contend that the Tribunal’s confirmation of that jurisdiction is a manifest
error**!,

Finally, Ecuador also ignores the Tribunal’s unequivocal conclusion that Law 42,
even if it was a matter of taxation, would be captured by the exception to the
exception of Article X.2.(c) of the Treaty. Ecuador had consistently asserted, over
the course of the VAT Arbitration and the appeal of the VAT Award, that the
Participation Contract constituted an investment agreement within the meaning of
the Treaty. The evidence contained in the VAT Award showing that Ecuador has
consistently treated the Participation Contract as an investment agreement is
“implicit in the considerations and conclusions contained in the Award” — to use
the phrase coined by the Wena committee**?.

Second, Ecuador says that the majority refused to apply international law when it
disregarded the international law principle that States are not liable to pay
compensation when adopting in the normal exercise of regulatory powers non
discriminatory bona fide regulations aimed at the general welfare. In fact what
happened was that the Tribunal decided that, on the facts of the case, the principle
offered Ecuador no defense. Ecuador improperly challenges the merit of that
conclusion**3,

Third, Ecuador complains that the Tribunal exceeded its powers by failing to apply
the principle according to which, absent a stabilization undertaking, the FET
standard does not include a legitimate expectation that the State will not amend its
laws and regulations. Again, this complaint has nothing to do with a manifest excess
of powers; it exclusively pertains to the merits of the Tribunal’s decision. The
Tribunal held that because Claimants relied upon Ecuador’s — specific
representations, Claimants’ legitimate expectations were protected by the Treaty.
Ecuador may disagree with this finding of fact, but it cannot take its annulment case
any further***+.

Fourth, Ecuador complains that the Tribunal disregarded the plain text of Law 42,
which distinguishes between participation in volumes of crude oil and participation
in revenues obtained by the concessionary.

In Claimants’ opinion this merits contention has no place in an annulment
procedure. In any event, on the substance of the argument, Ecuador is clearly
wrong. The Tribunal understood that Law 42 nominally mandated Ecuador to take
cash rather than crude, but it had the effect of radically diminishing Claimants’
participation in crude by taking 50% of its gross revenues from the sale of that
participation in the crude oil. Clause 8.2. of the Participation Contract defines
Claimants’ gross revenue simply as the market value of Claimants’ participation in
crude. It cannot be controversial that a measure taking away half of the market
value of crude will effectively take away the crude that yields that market value.
The Tribunal rejected Ecuador’s nonsensical proposition that Law 42 did not affect
Claimants’ rights under the Participation Contract, because Law 42 seized the cash
representing the crude’s market value rather than the physical crude itself.**°

Fifth, the Republic says that the Tribunal failed to apply the international law
standard for determining FMV — the willing buyer/willing seller standard. This
again is a rank appeal of the Tribunal’s merits findings and offers no conceivable
ground for annulment**°, The Tribunal accepted Claimants’ reasoning that a State
cannot reduce its liability on the basis of a wrongful act, such as Law 42. It
explained that “‘a valuation tool like the willing buyer analogy cannot override that
principle”**’.

Failure to state Reasons

. Sixth, there is nothing contradictory in the Tribunal’s finding that Law 42 is a

“unilateral decision of the Ecuadorian Congress to allocate to the Ecuadorian State
a defined percentage of revenues earned by contractor companies such as OEPC
that hold participation contract”*** and its finding, on the other hand, that Law 42
is “neither a royalty, a tax, a levy or any other measure of taxation under the
Participation Contract”**?.

In the course of the procedure, Ecuador itself submitted categorically that Law 42
is not a tax, because it had not been enacted in accordance with the special
legislative procedures reserved for taxes under Ecuadorian Law. Its present position
is a stunning about-face*”’.

Ecuador’s complaint is in essence that the Award erred in the application of
international law — which is beyond the review of this Committee. When the Award
analyzed whether Law 42 “is a tax, a royalty, a levy or, more generally, “a matter
of taxation” under the Treaty”**', it applied international law*”?.

Seventh, even if Law 42 were a tax, the Tribunal clearly stated that it would be
captured by the exception to the exception set forth in Article X.2.(c) of the Treaty,
because the Participation Contract is an investment agreement.

Ecuador’s criticism of the Tribunal’s decision in this regard is not just baseless it is
also astoundingly misleading. Ecuador asserted for the first time in its Post-Hearing
Brief on Law 42 that the Participation Contract was not an investment agreement.
Previously and consistently Ecuador had taken the position over a decade of
arbitration and appellate proceedings that Claimants’ Participation Contract did
constitute an investment agreement within the meaning of Article VI of the Treaty.
The argument was specifically made in the course of the VAT Arbitration and
Award, which form parts of the factual matrix considered by the Tribunal.

. Eighth, the Tribunal stated its reasons for concluding that Law 42, by taking 50%

of gross revenues above the reference price, constituted a breach of Clause 8.1,
modified the contractual and legal framework and frustrated Claimants’
expectations. There is no inconsistency between the Tribunal’s reference to
Claimants’ contractual rights to receive a participation in the production of crude
oil and its statement that Law 42 takes 50% of OEPC’s revenues. What Ecuador
calls an inconsistency is in fact the Tribunal’s considered rejection of Ecuador’s
unsustainable argument that the Participation Contract allowed Ecuador to deprive
Claimants of an economic benefit of their contractually agreed participation in
crude (i.e. its revenue) as long as it did not physically seize that participation in
crude (i.e. the volume of crude)*”?.

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

Ninth, Ecuador complains that Claimants withdrew their Clause 5.3.2. claim and
that the Award does not include the reasons relied upon by the Tribunal to address
a claim previously abandoned. Claimants did not do so, nor did the Award find that
the Claimants withdrew this claim. The Award cannot be required to provide
reasons for considering a withdrawn claim when no claim was withdrawn**.

 

Tenth, Ecuador’s argument that the Award did not provide reasons for finding that
Law 42 modified the legal framework at the time when the Participation Contract
was executed is equally invalid. It is obvious that the introduction of a law that did
not exist at the time the Participation Contract was entered into and which
unilaterally modified the parties’ bargain is a change of the legal framework*”.

Ecuador now further states that the Tribunal failed to assess the implications of the
Constitutional Courts decision, which referred to the breach of contract argument.
However, Ecuador had specifically argued in the arbitration that the Tribunal did
not need to consider the lawfulness of Law 423%. Besides, Ecuador has not
established that the constitutionality of Law 42 is pivotal or outcome
determinative*”’.

Eleventh, Ecuador alleges that the Award failed to state reasons for finding that, in
addition to a breach of the Participation Contract, Law 42 flouted the Claimants’
legitimate expectations. The Award stated its reasons: “the investor, OEPC, was
justified in expecting that this contractual framework would be respected and
certainly not modified unilaterally by the Respondent”*”®.

The Committee’s Decision

The Committee will analyze this ground for annulment by summarizing the
Tribunal’s decision regarding Law 42 (a.), the Republic’s arguments for requesting
the annulment (b.) and then adjudicating the jurisdictional objection (c.) and the
application of Law 42 in the DCF model (d.).

The Tribunal’s decision regarding Law 42

In April 2006, a month before the expropriation of Claimants’ investment in Block
15, the Republic adopted Law 42, which modified the HCL in two aspects:

- First it created a new category of income for the State related to the
exploration and exploitation of crude deposits called the “participacién
del Estado en los excedentes de los precios de venta de petréleo”?””
(“State Participation”);

- Then it defined the obligation of concessionary companies to acknowledge
in favour of the Ecuadorian State (“reconocerdn a favor del Estado

Ecuatoriano”) a State Participation equal to 50% of the “ingresos
extraordinarios que se generen por la diferencia de precios”. And such
“diferencia” is calculated by multiplying the number of barrels produced
by the difference between crude oil prices at the time of execution of the
contract and present market prices*”’.

465. What is the legal nature of the State Participation created by Law 42?

466. Law 42 does not clarify the issue. The Ecuadorian legislator adopted a policy of
calculated ambiguity, expressed in the choice of the term “‘participacién”, a novel
concept which had not been used either in the HCL nor in the Participation Contract,
and which does not seem to have a specific legal meaning under Ecuadorian law.
The ambiguity continued during the arbitration and was reflected by the Tribunal
in the Award“°!:

“The Tribunal recalls that the Respondent, throughout the Hearing on
Quantum, was loath to characterize Law 42”.

467. The legal nature of the State Participation is especially relevant in order to establish
the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, because Article X (2) of the Treaty limits the jurisdiction
of investment tribunals in “matters of taxation”. Article X (2) reads as follows:

“2. Nevertheless, the provisions of this Treaty, and in particular Article VI

(a) expropriation, pursuant to Article III;

(b) transfers, pursuant to Article IV; or

(c) the observance and of terms of an investment
[...]”. [Emphasis added].

 

468. Article X (2) thus excludes from the jurisdiction of an investment tribunal any
“matter of taxation”, except if the “exception to the exception” applies: that the
investment consists in an investment agreement and the dispute relates to its
observance and enforcement.

469. When confronted with the Law 42 argument, the Tribunal faced two distinct issues:

- The first was whether it had jurisdiction at all to address any Law 42 matter
(i), and

- The second, whether it should deduct the amounts accruing under the Law
42 levy in favour of the Republic, from the DCF model (thus reducing the
compensation by more than US$ 800 M) (ii).

Decision on Annulment

(i) The jurisdictional Challenge

The argument that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction could be affected by Law 42 only
became relevant at a very late stage of the arbitration; it was at the Hearing on
Quantum when the Respondent*

“488. [...] for the first time in these proceedings, claimed that “the question
of Law 42 is excluded from the Arbitral Tribunal’s jurisdiction in accordance
with Article 10 of [the] Treaty”. In effect, as will be seen, the Respondent was
now adopting the position that Law 42 was a “matter of taxation” [Footnote
omitted].

Recalling that at the Hearing on Quantum the Respondent had categorically
submitted that Law 42 “is not a tax”, because it did not follow the special procedures
required in the Constitution**’, the Tribunal came to the conclusion that the State
Participation was not a tax*:

“509. For purposes of characterizing Law 42, it is sufficient for the Tribunal

to conclude, as it now does, that the participation of Ecuador under Law 42

“in surplus from oil sales prices not agreed upon or not foreseen,” is neither a

royalty, a tax, a levy or any other measure of taxation under the Participation

Contract”.

But then ad cautelam the Tribunal added a second argument*®:

“497. [...] even if Law 42 were a tax, it would not, in the opinion of the
Tribunal, create a jurisdictional barrier to the Claimants’ Law 42 claim under
the Treaty for the following reasons”.

The Tribunal then explained its reasoning*°:

“499. The Tribunal is of the view that Law 42, even if it was characterized as
a “matter of taxation”, would be captured by the “exception to the exception”
of Article X.2(c) of the Treaty. The dispute between the parties, in the present
arbitration, relates directly to the observance and enforcement of the terms of
the Participation Contract which, in the opinion of the Tribunal, is an
investment agreement under Article VI(1)(a) of the Treaty”.

With this “belt and braces” double reasoning, the Tribunal dismissed Respondent’s
jurisdictional objection.

(ii) The Impact of Law 42 on the Compensation

The Tribunal then analysed the impact — if any — of Law 42 on the calculation of
compensation owed to OEPC and came to the following conclusions:

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

The Tribunal first examined the contractual bargain negotiated by the parties when
they executed the Participation Contract, and concluded thus:

“522. It is clear to the Tribunal that, in the Participation Contract, the
Claimants knowingly accepted the risk of losses on its investment in case of a
low price scenario and the Respondent knowingly forewent the opportunity to
increase its participation in case of a high price scenario. This was the bargain
which was struck by the parties and which was reflected in the Participation
Contract”.

Then it analysed the impact of Law 42 on this contractual bargain, and found that
the State Participation “struck at the very heart of OEPC’s acquired rights under the
Participation Contract’”*°’, because*®*

“525. [...] with the introduction of Law 42, the Respondent modified
unilaterally and in a substantial way the contractual and legal framework that
existed at the time the Claimants negotiated and agreed the Participation
Contract and thereby violated Clauses 5.3.2 and 8.1 of the Participation
Contract”.

. The Tribunal made the following legal inferences*”:

“527. In conclusion, Law 42 is in breach of the Participation Contract and
flouts the Claimants’ legitimate expectations. It is, as a result, in breach of the
Respondent’s Article II.3(a) Treaty obligation to accord fair and equitable
treatment to the Claimants’ investment and the Tribunal so finds”.

The Tribunal also addressed Respondent’s argument, that any willing buyer
wishing to value the FMV of the Participation Contract, would have used the
existence of Law 42 as a factor to obtain a reduction of the price to be paid. The
Tribunal rejected the argument, accepting Claimants’ reasoning that*!°

“541. [...] a State cannot reduce its liability for wrongful act [here,
expropriation/disproportionate sanction via caducidad] on the basis of another
wrongful act [applying Law 42 to OEPC in breach of the Participation
Contract][...] A valuation tool like the willing buyer analogy cannot override
that principle”. [Emphasis in the original].

Summary of Respondent’s Arguments

Ecuador submits 11 grounds for the (partial) annulment of the Award, based on
alleged abuse of powers in five cases, and on failure to state reasons in the
remaining six, arguing that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to address disputes
relating to Law 42 and that it erred when it decided to deduct the State Participation
mandated by Law 42 from the DCF model.

The Committee will analyze first the grounds for annulment based on a
jurisdictional objection (c. infra) and then the remaining grounds affecting the use

of Law 42 in the DCF valuation (d. infra). This distinction is relevant, because the
powers of ad hoc committees are quite different in one scenario and in the other:

- The primary concept of excess of powers refers to situations where a

tribunal adjudicates disputes not included in the powers granted by the
parties; if a Tribunal exceeds its jurisdiction and such excess is manifest,
its decision cannot stand.

- The situation is quite different if a tribunal having jurisdiction adopts an

erroneous decision that is said to exceed its powers; in this secondary
concept of abuse of powers, annulment requires that the error committed
by the tribunal consisted in applying the wrong law (not of wrongly
interpreting the correct law) or that the error amounts to a gross or
egregious error of law — a much more onerous test than in a case of primary
excess of powers*!!,

The Jurisdictional Objection

482. Article X (2) and of Article VI (1) of the Treaty read as follows:

483.

“Article X.2.
Nevertheless, the provisions of this Treaty, and in particular Article VI and
VII, shall apply to matters of taxation only with respect to the following:

(a) expropriation, pursuant to Article III;
(b) transfers, pursuant to Article IV; or
(c) the observance and of terms of an investment

 

“Article VI.1.

For purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is a dispute between a Party
and a national or company of the other Party arising out of or relating to (a)
an investment agreement between that Party and such national or company;
(b) an investment authorization granted by that Party’s foreign investment
authority to such national or company; or (c) an alleged breach of any right
conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment”. [Emphasis
added].

The Tribunal’s Award

In the past Ecuador consistently argued that the Participation Contract was an
investment agreement for the purposes of Article VI of the Treaty. The argument
was employed in the VAT arbitration to support Ecuador’s claim that the Treaty’s
fork in the road provision should apply to OEPC’s VAT claim. For this reason
Ecuador argued in the VAT Arbitration and before the English High Court and the
English Court of Appeal that the Participation Contract was an investment
agreement. As the High Court confirmed*!?,

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

“Ecuador argued that the claims of OEPC before the Quito courts related to
an investment agreement between Ecuador (via PetroEcuador) and OEPC, and
so fell within the terms of Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT”.

The VAT Arbitration is relevant to this arbitration: the Tribunal expressly listed the
VAT Arbitration and Respondent’s appeal of the VAT Award in its description of
the factual matrix considered by the Tribunal in its Award*!?.

In the Hearing on Quantum Ecuador changed its position and for the first time
claimed that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to address any Law 42 dispute, because
the State Participation created by such Law was a “matter of taxation” excluded by
Article X (2) of the Treaty from the jurisdiction of investment arbitration tribunals,
and because the “exception to the exception” did not apply.

In the Award, the Tribunal dismissed Respondent’s jurisdictional challenge,
concluding that the State Participation created by Law 42 was not a “matter of
taxation’’*!4, But the Tribunal did not stop there, and added the following alternative
reason:

“499. The Tribunal is of the view that Law 42, even if it was characterized as
a “matter of taxation”, would be captured by the “exception to the exception”
of Article X.2(c) of the Treaty. The dispute between the parties, in the present
arbitration, relates directly to the observance and enforcement of the terms of
the Participation Contract which, in the opinion of the Tribunal, is an
investment agreement under Article VI(1)(a) of the Treaty”.

Summing up, the Tribunal rejected the jurisdictional challenge based on a main and
on an alternative reason:

- The main reason being that in the Tribunal’s opinion Law 42 was not a
matter of taxation,

- And the alternative reason that the dispute affected the observance and
enforcement of an investment agreement and consequently fitted within
the “exception to the exception”,

both reasons being independent from each other, and the validity of one reason
sufficing to establish jurisdiction*!>.

Respondent’s Claims for Annulment

. Respondent claims that the Tribunal erred when it dismissed the jurisdictional

challenge, and that the error affected both the main and the alternative reasons.

As regards the alternative reason, the so called “exception to the exception”,
Ecuador asserts that in the present case neither of the two conditions required by
Article X of the Treaty was met:

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

- the Participation Contract was not an investment agreement for the
purposes of Article VI of the Treaty, because its clause 22.1.4 did not
specifically refer to Article 30 of the 1997 Investment and Protection Act
—allegedly a requirement of Ecuadorian law for a contract to be considered
as an investment agreement;

- furthermore, the dispute did not relate to the observance and enforcement
of the terms of an investment agreement*!®.

Respondent’s claim for annulment is supported by three grounds:

- First, the decision implies a manifest excess of powers, because it amounts
to a failure on the part of the Tribunal to undertake the mandate entrusted
t4l7
to it*!”;

- Second, there is also a manifest excess of powers because the Tribunal
failed to apply the proper law and ruled instead as an amiable

compositeur*! 8,

- Third, the Tribunal failed to give reasons for its finding*!®.
The Committee’s Decision

For convenience the Committee will start its analysis with the alternative reason,
i.e. with the Tribunal’s decision in para. 499 of the Award, establishing that the
“exception to the exception” applied, thus creating jurisdiction to adjudicate Law
42 matters.

The “exception to the exception” revolves around the issue whether the
Participation Contract could be considered an “investment agreement” for the
purposes of Article X (2) of the Treaty. This provision includes a cross reference
to Article VI (1) (a), which describes an investment agreement as an agreement
between a State and a national or company of the other State. The Treaty thus
establishes three requirements for the existence of an “investment agreement”:

- That there is an “agreement”,
- That it relates to an “investment”, and

- That it is executed between a State and a national of the other contracting
State.

The Tribunal reasonably found that the “exception to the exception” provided for
in Article X (2) was applicable:

- It first found that the Participation Contract indeed is an investment
agreement under Article VI(1)(a) of the Treaty, i.e. that it meets the three

requirements set forth in that Article: (i) that it is an agreement, (ii) that it
formalizes an investment and (iii) that it binds Ecuador (through
PetroEcuador) with a U.S. investor;

- It then found that the dispute relates directly to the observance and
enforcement of the terms of the Participation Contract; and this is indeed
so, because the Tribunal’s main conclusion as regards the merits was that

“Law 42 is in breach of the Participation Contract and flouts the Claimants’
legitimate expectations”?

The Tribunal thus justified and reasoned that the two requirements set forth in
Article X (2) of the Treaty for the “exception to the exception” to apply, namely

- the execution of an investment contract, and

- the existence of a dispute which refers to the observance and enforcement
of the terms of the investment contract,

had been duly met. In so doing, the Tribunal did not fail to undertake the mandate
entrusted to it, it certainly did not act as an amiable compositeur and it did not fail
to reason its decision.

The Tribunal failed to address Respondent’s argument that the Participation
Contract did not constitute an investment agreement, because it lacked an allegedly
required reference to a specific Ecuadorian law. But this failure can never lead to
annulment. Tribunals have a duty to justify their decision — not to address every
single subordinate argument submitted by the parties, especially if the argument on
its very face is meritless.

Having found that the Tribunal in any case had jurisdiction to address the Law 42
dispute under the “exception to the exception” rule of Article X (2) of the Treaty,
the question whether Law 42 is a “matter of taxation” has become moot and does
not need to be addressed.

Application of Law 42 in the DCF Valuation

Turning now to Respondent’s substantive ground for annulment: in the Award the
Tribunal decided that Law 42 should not be taken into consideration in determining
the value of the investment, i.e. that in the DCF model the stream of income of
Block 15 should not be reduced by the amount of the State Participation mandated
by Law 42.

The Tribunal’s decision can be summarized as follows:

20 Award at 527.

118

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

- The introduction of Law 42 implied a unilateral and substantial violation
of the contractual framework agreed among the Parties in the Participation
Contract*?!;

- Claimants had a legitimate expectation that the Participation Contract
would be complied with???;

- Law 42 is in breach of the Participation Contract (and also of Article II (3)
(a) Treaty, which creates an obligation to accord fair and equitable
treatment to the Claimants’ investment)‘;

- A State cannot reduce its liability on the basis of its own wrongful acts;
Law 42 is wrongful, because it constitutes a breach of the Participation
Contract*?*;

 

- For all these reasons, the Tribunal decided to disregard Law 42 in its
quantum valuation*>.

499. Ecuador challenges these findings arguing that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its
powers and failed to state reasons, and that the Award should be annulled.

500. The Committee will briefly analyze each of the nine merits grounds for annulment
invoked by Respondent and come to the conclusion that all of them should be
dismissed. The numbering is the same one followed in the section “Respondent’s
Position” (some numbers are omitted, because jurisdictional grounds have already
been analyzed in the preceding section)*®:

manner bona fide regulation that are aimed at the general welfare”*”’,

Ecuador’s failure to honour its contractual and Treaty obligations, offered
Respondent no defense. There is no excess of powers.

Third

Respondent also argues that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by failing
to apply the international law principle that the FET standard does not include a
legitimate expectation that the State will not amend its laws and regulations, absent
an express and specific stabilization undertaking by the State*°.

Respondent’s complaint cannot succeed for analogous reasons. The Tribunal never
contradicted the international law principle quoted by Respondent. The Tribunal
correctly held that Claimants were entitled to assume that Ecuador would respect
the contractual framework agreed between the Republic and the investor**!.

Fourth

Respondent says that the Tribunal also manifestly exceeded its powers when it
effectively disregarded the plain text of Law 42, which distinguishes between
“participation in volumes” of crude oil (guaranteed by clause 8.1. of the
Participation Contract and unaffected by Law 42) and “participation in revenues”
obtained by the concessionary (impacted and reduced by Law 42, but not
guaranteed by the Participation Contract), to conclude that Ecuador had breached
the Participation Contract*?.

Respondent’s annulment claim cannot succeed. Ecuador’s challenge is not an
annulment ground — it is a merit contention, already submitted to the Tribunal and
dismissed by the Tribunal in the Award, with proper reasoning.

In para. 521 of the Award the Tribunal dealt with the very argument which the
Respondent is now re-submitting as a ground for annulment. The Tribunal
dismissed it with the reasoning set forth in paras. 523 and 524: under the
Participation Contract, OEPC had the right to receive a participation in the crude
oil produced, and to freely dispose of such participation at market prices***. The
Tribunal correctly concluded that Law 42 affected this right and that by enacting
Law 42 Respondent unilaterally modified the contractual framework agreed upon
in the Participation Contract***+.

Fifth

Ecuador submits that the Tribunal failed to apply the international law standard for
determining the FMV of Block 15 (the willing buyer/willing seller standard) and
thereby manifestly exceeded its powers*.

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

The ground of annulment is without merit. The willing buyer/willing seller standard
is simply a valuation tool used for calculating compensation in certain
circumstances. Tribunals have a wide discretion in selecting and applying valuation
tools. Selection of one valuation tool in preference to another, or failure to apply a
valuation tool does not give rise to a manifest excess of powers.

Sixth

 

Respondent says that the Tribunal committed a glaring contradiction: in para. 510
of the Award when it defined Law 42 as a

“510. [...] unilateral decision of the Ecuadorian Congress to allocate to the
Ecuadorian State a defined percentage of revenues earned by contractor
companies such as OEPC that hold participation contract”,

while only one paragraph earlier it held that Law 42

“509. [...] is neither a royalty, a tax, a levy or other measure of taxation under
the Participation Contract’***.

The claim is dismissed.

There is absolutely no contradiction between the Tribunal’s statements in paras.
509 and 510.

In para. 509 the Tribunal simply states that the State Participation “is neither a
royalty, a tax, a levy or any other measure of taxation under the Participation
Contract”, ie. in accordance with Ecuadorian law. This is an undisputed
conclusion, since Ecuador itself categorically averred that Law 42 is not a tax under
Ecuadorian law, because it had not been enacted in accordance with the special
legislative procedures required for the enactment of tax laws in Ecuador.

Para. 510 then draws the only possible conclusion from the preceding analysis:
since under Ecuadorian law the State Participation is not a tax, it must be a sui
generis decision adopted by Congress to allocate to the State a defined percentage
of revenues earned by concessionary companies.

Eighth

Respondent argues that the Tribunal failed to state reasons, when it acknowledged
that the Participation Contract guaranteed OEPC a participation in the production
of crude, but then found that “by taking 50% of OEPC’s revenues [Law 42]
modified radically the participation percentages agreed in Clause 8.1477. If Clause
8.1, as the Tribunal held, allocates only crude production and not revenues, it is
simply impossible to follow the Tribunal’s rationale for concluding that Law 42’s
taking of a percentage of revenues constitutes a breach of clause 8.1478.

Decision on Annulment

This ground for annulment is in fact a restatement of the fourth, this time under the
guise of lack of reasons. It has no merit. The Tribunal’s reasoning in paras. 521-
525 is coherent and permits a reader to follow the trail of analysis.

Ninth

The Republic submits that the Award fails to state reasons for the conclusion that
Law 42 breached clause 5.3.2 of the Participation Contract*”.

Clause 5.3.2 of the Participation Contract grants OEPC the right to

“recibir y disponer libremente de la Participacidn de la Contratista establecida
en la clausula 8.1”.

Both clauses are linked: clause 8.1. defines OEPC’s participation, while clause
5.3.2. OEPC’s right to receive it and freely dispose of it. The Tribunal found that
the right to freely dispose*”°

“524. [...] becomes meaningless unless it includes the right “freely” to enjoy
the revenues from such disposal. Law 42 extinguished that right with respect
to half of all revenues accruing from sales by OEPC at a price in excess of
the reference price”.

The Tribunal’s reasoning permits any reader to get from point A to point B and
establish the appropriate conclusion without difficulty. There is no failure to state
reasons — although Respondent may not agree with the reasoning. The request is
dismissed.

Tenth

The Republic avers that the Tribunal failed to state reasons for why the introduction
of Law 42, aside from the contractual framework, implied a unilateral and
substantial modification of the “legal framework that existed at the time the
Claimants negotiated and agreed the Participation Contract [...]”*4'. Besides, the
Tribunal did not address the implications of the Constitutional Court’s upholding
of Law 42’s legality, which included a response to arguments of breach of
contract”,

Respondent’s argument is misplaced: the contractual framework was modified
through the enactment of a Law, and consequently the applicable legal framework
was also affected. Finally, whatever arguments the Ecuadorian Constitutional
Court might have used is irrelevant for this arbitration: what is relevant are the
arguments actually submitted by the Parties to the Tribunal in the course of the
procedure. The request for annulment is dismissed.

Eleventh

Finally, the Respondent argues that the Award failed to state the reasons for its
holding that Law 42, in addition to a breach of the Participation Contract, flouts
Claimants’ legitimate expectations, considering that the FET standard does not
equate to the stabilization of the legal framework“.

Ecuador’s argument must be dismissed.

In para. 527 of the Award, the Tribunal found that “Law 42 is in breach of the
Participation Contract and flouts the Claimants’ legitimate expectations”. The
Tribunal had explained its decision in the preceding paragraph“:

“526. [...] The investor, OEPC, was justified in expecting that this contractual
framework would be respected and certainly not modified unilaterally by the
Respondent”.

An investor’s legitimate expectations are those which have been embodied in the
terms of the contract. Every investor who executes a contract with a State has an
expectation that the State will comply with its obligations and not modify
unilaterally the agreement reached.

oR

Summing up, the Committee concludes that the Tribunal’s findings that it held
jurisdiction to adjudicate the Law 42 dispute and that the State Participation
mandated by Law 42 should not be deducted from the stream of income included
in the DCF model do not give rise to any grounds for annulment.

THE DECISION TO DISREGARD THE VAT INTERPRETATIVE LAW.

In 2001 the Ecuadorian tax authority altered its policy of refunding VAT to oil
companies. The tax authority refused to grant such refunds in the future, and
retrospectively sought to claim reimbursement of refunds already paid. Claimants
claimed that this measure was a violation of the Treaty and Ecuadorian law and
commenced the first investment arbitration against Ecuador, the so called VAT
Arbitration“,

In 2004 the tribunal issued the VAT Award, which found that Ecuador was obliged
to reimburse OEPC for VAT, that OEPC had a legitimate expectation that the tax
would be reimbursed and that Ecuador had breached its Treaty obligations*®. It
ordered Ecuador to reimburse outstanding amounts — in excess of US$ 75 M.

Just a few weeks after the VAT Award had been issued, the Ecuadorian Congress
adopted the VAT Interpretative Law, a one article text that provided:

“Art. 1.- Interprétase el articulo 69-A (72) de la Ley de Régimen Tributario
Interno introducido por la Ley 99-24, publicada en el Suplemento del Registro
Oficial No. 181 del 30 de abril de 1999, en el sentido de que el reintegro del
Impuesto al Valor Agregado, IVA, no es aplicable a la actividad petrolera en
lo referente a la extracci6n, transporte y comercializacién de petrdleo crudo,
puesto que el petréleo no se fabrica, sino que se lo extrae de los respectivos
yacimientos”.

530. The Tribunal found that it was “obvious” that the VAT Interpretative Law “was a
direct response to the VAT Award”““”,

531. Enactment of the VAT Interpretative Law gave rise to a doubt: whether it should
be taken into consideration for quantifying Claimants’ damages — a question very
similar to that posed by Law 42 with regard to the State Participation.

532. The Tribunal analyzed the issue and decided not to reduce Claimants’ damages on
account of the VAT Interpretative Law. It found that the VAT Interpretative Law
was designed to achieve the same objective as the administrative measures that the
VAT Tribunal had already found to be in breach of Claimants’ Treaty rights**:

“558. While the VAT Interpretative Law was presented as an attempt to clarify
the confusion identified by the VAT Tribunal, the fact of the matter is that the
VAT Interpretative Law accomplishes the very same effect as the SRI Decrees
which the VAT Tribunal had found to be in breach of certain provisions of the
Treaty”.

533. The Tribunal then stated“:

“560. In the view of the Tribunal, the VAT Interpretative Law, unfairly and
arbitrarily, frustrated the legitimate expectations of the Claimants in precisely
the same way as the SRI’s Decrees and is thus also in breach of the Treaty. As
such, as between the Claimants and the Respondent, the VAT Interpretative
Law is without legal effect and should not be taken into account as a factor
which impacts the fair market value of the Claimants’ investment”.

534. And concluded*?:

“564. As the Tribunal emphasized earlier, nullus commodum capere de sua
injuria propria: a State cannot be allowed to take advantage of its own
wrongful act. The result of the implementation of that well-known principle
of international law is that “the effects of actions taken by the nationalizing
State in relation to the enterprise which actions may have depressed its value”
must be disregarded in the determination of that value. The Tribunal, applying
that principle to the facts of the present case, concludes that it must disregard

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

535. The Tribunal could have stopped here. But it didn’t. It added an alternative
argument — that the VAT Interpretative Law should also be disregarded because it
triggered Clause 8.6 (e) of the Participation Contract, entitling the hypothetical
willing buyer to apply a correction factor to offset the economic burden**!.

536. Clause 8.6 (e) of the Participation Contract reads as follows:

“8.6. Estabilidad econémica: En caso de que por accién del Estado
Ecuatoriano o PETROECUADOR, ocurriere cualquiera de los eventos que se
describen a continuacién, que tenga consecuencias en la economia de este
Contrato de Participacién:

(

No. 01044 de 5 de octubre de 1998, que consta como Anexo No. XVI,
mediante el cual la Direccién de Servicio de Rentas Internas manifiesta que
las Importaciones que realice la Contratista para la[s] operaciones del Bloque
15 bajo el esquema del Contrato de Participacidn, estan gravadas con dicho
tributo.

En los casos sefialados en los literales [...] e) se incluird un factor de correcci6n
en los porcentajes de participacién, que absorba el i 2 o disminucié:
de la carga econémica, conforme al Anex[o] No. XIV” [Emphasis added].

537. The Tribunal’s alternative reasoning is contained in paras. 567, 568 and 569 of the
Award:

“567. It is clear that, for the correction factor to be triggered automatically into
effect, the VAT Interpretative Law must be found to have an impact on the
economy of the Participation Contract. The Tribunal notes that the parties to
the Participation Contract did not in any way specify how that impact was to
be measured. It is thus left to the Tribunal, in the exercise of its discretion, to
do so.

568. The Tribunal recalls that the VAT Award held that OEPC has “a right to
reimbursement (of the VAT) under the law” and that “this reimbursement was
not included in OEPC’s contract”. The right of the Claimants to be reimbursed
the Value Added Tax has now been legislated out of existence. There is no
doubt, in the view of the Tribunal, that the VAT Interpretative Law has
thereby increased the economic burden of the Claimants and thus impacted
the economy of the Participation Contract.

569. Consequently, any hypothetical willing buyer of OEPC’s rights under the
Participation Contract, relying on the findings and conclusions of the VAT
Tribunal, would be entitled to apply for a correction factor in the participation
percentages to absorb the increase in its economic burden in accordance with
Clause 8.6 and Annex No. XIV of the Participation Contract” [Footnotes
omitted].

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

Ecuador now avers that the Tribunal failed to provide satisfactory reasoning for its
alternative finding and that the failure to state reasons merits annulment of the
Award.

The Parties’ Positions

Respondent takes issue with the Tribunal’s reasoning. The Award simply equated
the terms “economy of the contract” (clause 8.6 (e) first paragraph) and “economic
burden” (clause 8.6 (e) last paragraph), implying that every collection of VAT had
ipso facto an impact on the economy of the Participation Contract. Considering the
Parties’ diverging positions in this respect, this finding warranted some kind of
explanation, as arbitrator Stern noted in her dissent*?.

According to Respondent, the reasoning of the Award fits into one summary
sentence, which fails to provide any reason whatsoever as to why the concepts of
“economic burden” and “economy of the contract” should be understood as being
equivalent*>?:

“568. [...] There is no doubt, in the view of the Tribunal, that the VAT
Interpretative Law has thereby increased the economic burden of the
Claimants and thus impacted the economy of the Participation Contract’**.

Claimants disagree.

Ecuador’s challenge to the Award’s obiter reasoning regarding Claimants’
alternative argument cannot undermine the Tribunal’s conclusion that the VAT
Interpretative Law should be disregarded**>. As Ecuador itself notes, “the Parties
agree that the failure to address a particular argument they raised does not warrant
annulment unless it was ‘decisive’, i.e., material to the tribunal’s decision (not
obiter dictumy’*®. Since the clause 8.6 (e) argument was not material to the

majority’s decision, the Committee need not consider Ecuador’s arguments about
457
we’.

Claimants add that the Tribunal in any case provided substantial reasons for the
argument**® and that Ecuador’s complaint boils down to the proposition that the
Tribunal should have addressed a question that was not before the Tribunal —
whether “economy of the contract” and “economic burden” were equivalent to one
another. The Tribunal was asked to decide “whether or not clause 8.6 (e) of the
Contract is triggered into effect in the circumstances of the present case”**? and this
is exactly what the Tribunal did*,

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

The Committee’s Decision

The Tribunal’s conclusion with regard to the VAT Interpretative Law is that it
should not be taken into consideration in the DCF model used for valuing
Claimants’ investment (thus increasing the compensation in an amount which
Respondent estimates in the US$ 30 M range**!). The main reason for this finding
is analogous to that used to exclude Law 42: the enactment of the VAT
Interpretative Law was in breach of Claimants’ rights under the Treaty and thus
could not be used to reduce Respondent’s liability*?.

Ecuador is not asking the Committee to annul this finding. Neither does Ecuador
challenge the reasoning invoked by the Tribunal to support it. Ecuador only
challenges an additional argument adduced by the Tribunal, and it does so for
alleged failure to state reasons.

After having reached its conclusion with regard to the VAT Interpretative Law, the
Tribunal could have stopped its reasoning. It did not. Instead the Tribunal took up
an additional argument to confirm the conclusion it had already reached: even if the
VAT Interpretative Law were to be applied (quod non), clause 8.6 (e) of the
Participation Contract required that a correction factor be introduced, neutralizing
the effect of the VAT Interpretative Law*®.

Ecuador is asking the Committee to annul this additional argument for lack of
reasons.

Ecuador’s request cannot succeed. Committees are empowered to annul decisions,
if the Tribunal fails to state the reasons on which such decisions are based (not the
reasoning itself). In this case it is undisputed that the decision not to apply the VAT
Interpretative Law is properly reasoned. The existence or inexistence or the quality
of any additional reasoning can never lead to annulment of the decision.

In any case, the reasoning underlying the additional argument brought up by the
Tribunal can be properly followed from point A to point B through to its
conclusions, as Claimants have convincingly explained in their Second
Submission’,

THE DECISION TO DISREGARD ALTERNATIVES TO CADUCIDAD

Ecuador argued in the course of the arbitration that the HCL only authorized the
Republic two actions in response to Claimants’ unauthorized transfer of rights: it
could either declare caducidad or do nothing*®. The Tribunal rejected the
contention and identified various alternatives*°:

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

“434. In summary, the Tribunal considers that the foregoing options existed
as an alternative to caducidad, namely:

i) insistence on payment of a transfer fee in the order of USD 11.8 million;
and/or

ii) improvements to the economic terms of the original contract; and/or

iii) a negotiated settlement which could of course have covered any areas that
the parties so desired, including payment of the transfer fee which had been
avoided, renegotiation of the contract and additional compensation” [Footnote
omitted].

The Parties’ Positions

Respondent first argues that the Tribunal’s finding that Ecuador did have
alternatives to declaring caducidad was a manifest excess of powers, “since a
simple review of the Participation Contract and the HCL shows no such
alternative”“*’,

Ecuador then submits a second argument: the consequence of having lawful
alternatives is that such alternatives should have been considered in assessing
damages owed to Claimants. Otherwise any damages award would
overcompensate and unjustly enrich the Claimants***. Damages should have
consisted in the difference between the FMV of Block 15 and the amount of any of
those alternative sanctions. In awarding damages that failed to consider these
alternatives the Tribunal failed to apply, or alternatively grossly misapplied,
international law on damages and thus manifestly exceeded its powers*®. The
Tribunal also failed to state reasons for its decision*””.

 

Claimants disagree.

As regards the first ground for annulment invoked by Ecuador, Claimants aver that

Respondent has failed to elaborate and to cite any excess of powers*7!.

Addressing the second ground, Claimants allege that Ecuador could have argued
that the damages should be reduced on account of the costs of alternatives to
caducidad. It chose not to do so.

Ecuador had in fact submitted a counterclaim for the Claimants’ failure to pay the
required assignment fee and negotiate a new Participation Contract — which
correspond to some of the alternatives to caducidad*”*. But then Ecuador withdrew
the counterclaim*”’.

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

Ecuador cannot now fault the Tribunal for failing to quantify these alternatives,
because other than the cost of the transfer fee, Ecuador never presented evidence
on the economic impact of these alternatives*’*. A Tribunal is not required to
address every single argument presented by the parties, especially an argument that
was introduced as a counterclaim that was dropped and that became redundant
given the very large penalty imposed by the Tribunal to reflect Claimants’
contributory negligence*”>.

The Committee’s Decision

. Respondent submits two separate grounds for annulment.

. The first is based on the argument that a simple review of the Participation Contract

and the HCL shows that there is no alternative to caducidad and that the Tribunal
committed a manifest excess of powers when it held otherwise. The ground was
not further elaborated, and received no further attention in Respondent’s Reply*”®.
In any case it is without merit. The Tribunal came to the conclusion that alternatives
to caducidad existed, and the Respondent has not been able to prove that this
constitutes an error of law (and even less so that it is an egregious error of law which
merits annulment).

The second ground is that the Tribunal should have considered in its quantum
calculation the impact of an alternative to caducidad. The difficulty in this
argument is that it was never pleaded by Respondent in the arbitration, and that the
Tribunal already factored into the compensation calculation a 25% reduction as a
sanction for Claimants’ behaviour. It can never lead to annulment of the Award.

The ground for annulment is dismissed.
THE TRIBUNAL’S EMAIL DATED FEBRUARY 15, 2011

During the month of November of 2009 a hearing on quantum was held in Paris. A
few months thereafter, on 12 February 2010 Claimants, acting on behalf of both
Parties, made the following procedural proposal to the Tribunal*”’:

“557. Moreover, the Tribunal’s request followed the parties’ own procedural
proposal that Claimants had articulated a year earlier in their letter of February
12, 2010:

“Both parties have stated to the Tribunal that they are willing to return their
models with inputs requested by the Tribunal if the Tribunal were to find that
helpful in preparing a final award”. CEA-80, Claimants’ Letter of February
12, 2010”. [Emphasis added].

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

A year later the Tribunal took up this offer. On 15 February 2011 the President sent
the following email (the “February Email”) to the Parties*”*:

“The Tribunal has reached the point in its deliberations where it requires the
tance of both parties’ experts, Mr. Joseph Kalt and Mr. Daniel Johnston,
in order to help the Tribunal assess the proper calculation of damages.

 

Therefore, in accordance with Rule 34 (2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the
Tribunal calls upon the parties to produce Messrs. Kalt and Johnston for
consultation with the Tribunal at the ICSID’s headquarters in Washington at
10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 27 April 2011. If the parties agree, the Tribunal
would wish to consult with the parties’ experts alone without the presence of
counsel”.[Emphasis added].

The experts’ cooperation eventually led to a Joint Expert Report that presented an
agreed DCF valuation, on which the Tribunal relied in its damages calculation*””.

The Parties’ Positions

Respondent argues that the Tribunal committed a serious departure from a
fundamental rule of procedure by issuing the February Email: it was a
“determination of liability” which failed to state reasons, and thus violated Article
48(3) of the Convention and Arbitration Rule 47, which require that the award state
the reasons upon which it is based**°.

Ecuador does not deny that the Tribunal had the authority to call upon the Parties
to produce evidence pertinent to the issues in dispute. Ecuador’s challenge is that,
in so doing, the Tribunal communicated to the Parties its ultimate decision on
liability, without any reasoning or explanation whatsoever**!, Ecuador avers that
ICSID tribunals should only issue a decision on liability by way of an award. Yet
the Tribunal did not follow that orthodox approach. It communicated its ultimate
decision on liability through the February Email**?.

Claimants disagree.

In Claimants’ submission, Ecuador’s claim fails on the very first hurdle: it cannot
properly identify the relevant rule of procedure that could have plausibly been
violated**?. The Tribunal was acting perfectly within its powers as articulated in
Article 43 of the Convention and Arbitration Rule 34 (2), which empower tribunals
to call upon the parties to produce documents, witnesses and experts**+, Articles
48 and 49 of the Convention (and Arbitration Rules 47 and 48) only apply to final
awards, and not to other, less formal communications. The February Email was not
a decision on liability — and certainly not an ultimate one. The Tribunal did not

purport to have reached a conclusive decision, and the arbitrators were free to
present any award they saw fit, after the February Email**°.

The Committee’s Decision

This claim for annulment is submitted under Article 52 (1) (d) of the Convention:
that the Tribunal has committed a serious departure from a fundamental rule of
procedure — a ground with a high standard for its acceptance**°,

Respondent argues that the February Email sent by the Tribunal meets these
requirements, because, although it is not an award, it formalizes the Tribunal’s final
and binding decision accepting the Respondent’s liability, without providing any
reasoning, and thus flouts Article 48(3) of the Convention.

The argument is totally without merit.

A quantum hearing had been held in November 2009. Thereafter both Parties had
offered the participation of their experts to re-run the DCF model with input from
the Tribunal. In the February Email the Tribunal simply accepted this offer — a
decision which was well within its powers under Article 43 of the Convention and
under Arbitration Rule 34 (2).

. The February Email is not a final and binding decision on quantum. It is simply a

procedural request for the Parties’ experts to come forward and help the Tribunal
in the assessment of damages. It did not create res iudicata. Every arbitrator
remained free to decide on the merits one way or another. The February Email did
not formalize a merits decision. Since it did not, the Tribunal was not required to
provide reasons.

The ground for annulment is dismissed.

VIII. COSTS AND EXPENSES

. The Parties submitted their statements on costs simultaneously on June 8, 2015.

Ecuador informed the Committee that its total costs incurred in connection with this
annulment proceeding were US$ 4,098,034.26 in legal fees, plus US$ 547,102.11
in administrative costs and US$ 973,440.50 in ICSID costs (registration fee and Ad
Hoc Committee’s fees)**”.

Claimants declared that their legal fees and expenses in connection with this
annulment proceeding were US$ 3,932,575.79 in legal fees, plus US$ 508,209.06
in administrative costs***,

489

. Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:

“... the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the
expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall
decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the
members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the
Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award”.

Article 52(4) extends the application of this provision to annulment proceedings.

Neither Ecuador nor Claimants have completely prevailed in the present annulment
proceedings. The Republic was requesting a decision annulling the Award in its
entirety — the Committee has dismissed this request. Alternatively, Ecuador
submitted a petition for partial annulment, which the Committee has accepted.
Claimants were defending the full validity of the Decision and the Award.

The Committee has thus not ruled completely in favour of any of the parties.
Ecuador’s claims were prima facie serious. Furthermore, each side presented valid
and reasonable arguments in support of its respective case, and both acted fairly and
professionally.

In view of these circumstances, the Tribunal decides that Claimants shall bear one
half, and Respondent the other half of the costs incurred by ICSID in relation to
the proceedings, and that each side shall bear its own litigation costs and other
expenses. Since Respondent has advanced US$ 1,000,000 towards the costs
incurred by ICSID, Claimants shall reimburse Respondent half of that amount, by
offset against the compensation due under the Award.

ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11
Decision on Annulment

Ix. SUMMARY

Respondent requested in its Reply on Annulment that the Committee:
“4. Annul the Award in its enterity; or

ii. alternatively, partially annul the Award as described in this Reply on
Annulment at paragraphs 230, 285, 358, 391, 404, 494, 641, 652, 745, and
769; and

iii. in any event order Claimants to bear the entire costs of this annulment
proceeding, including the ICSID costs and Ecuador’s legal costs and other
expenses”.

As regards its first petition, Ecuador alleged four grounds which would result in
annulment of the Decision on Jurisdiction and, consequently of the entire Award.
The Committee rejected all of these grounds. Ecuador also submitted a number of
additional grounds for the total annulment of the Award, which the Tribunal also
rejected. Thus Ecuador’s first petition is entirely dismissed.

As regards Ecuador’s alternative petition for partial annulment, such petition has
succeeded. The Committee has found that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its
powers by wrongly assuming jurisdiction with regard to the investment now
beneficially owned by the Chinese investor Andes, with the result that the
compensation owed to Claimants should be reduced from 100% to 60% of the value
of Block 15.

The Tribunal has established the value of 100% of Block 15, i.e. of the Farmout
Property, at US$ 2,359,500,000. Consequently, the value of a 60% interest would
amount to US$ 1,415,700,000. Applying to this amount the 25% reduction factor
explained in para. 825 of the Award, the resulting amount is US$ 1,061,775,000.
This is the proper amount that should have been inserted in Sub-paragraph (v) of

the dispositive section of the Award*”, reading as follows:

“876. [...] (v) Claimants are awarded the amount of US$ 1,061,775,000 (US
One billion, sixty one millions, seven hundred seventy five thousand dollars),
as calculated in paragraph 825 of this Award, for damages suffered as a result
of the breaches set out above in subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii)”.

The rest of the Award remains unaffected.

Respondent alleged a number of additional grounds for partial annulment of the
Tribunals’ decision to award damages to Claimants based on a 100% (and not a
60%) interest in the Farmout Property or which pertain to the 60/40 issue. These
grounds have become moot.

4° The same conclusion could be reached by simply calculating 60% of US$ 1,769,625,000

133

proceedings, and that each side shall bear its own litigation costs and other expenses.

Xx. DECISION

590. For the reasons set forth above, the Committee unanimously renders the following
decision:

1. The Committee partially annuls the Award, on the ground of manifest excess of
powers [ICSID Convention Article 52(1)(b)], to the extent that the Tribunal
assumed jurisdiction with regard to the investment now beneficially owned by
the Chinese investor Andes (and previously by the Bermudan company AEC),
with the result that the proper compensation owed by Respondent to Claimants
should be the amount calculated in para. 586 of this Decision.

2. The rest of the Award remains unaffected.
3. All other grounds of Respondent’s application for annulment are rejected.

4. Each Party shall bear one half of the ICSID costs, and its own litigation costs
and expenses incurred with respect to this annulment proceeding.

5. The stay of enforcement of the Award is declared automatically terminated in
accordance with Rule 54(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.
