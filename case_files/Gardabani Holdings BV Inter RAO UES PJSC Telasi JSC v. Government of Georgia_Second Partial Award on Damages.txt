53. For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the appropriate valuation date for Telasi’s and
Inter RAO’s damages Sa The Tribunal is satisfied that this provides a reliable
basis for the assessment of those damages.

54. Accordingly, the Tribunal prefers and adopts the Experts’ estimate of damages using the

valuation date ——h Sa. which yields total damages ESS aeer
55. As the Claimants have stated, they do not seek double recovery whether as between
claimant companies or as between this arbitration and the ICSID arbitration.”° In this regard, the

Claimants submitted as follows:

As demonstrated above, the Claimants have all suffered losses in relation to
Telasi and the Khrami Companies, with some acquiring a right to compensation
based on contract and some based on the Treaty, Naturally, the Claimants (and
the Inter RAO Group as a whole) do not seek double compensation for the harm
caused, whether as between the SCC and ICSID arbitrations or as between
Claimants. However, each of the Claimants has an independent right to
compensation, and until compensation is actually paid to one of them there can
be no double compensation.

Subject to the requirement that compensation for a single to harm (to Telasi and
the Khrami Companies, respectively) can only be paid once, the Claimants
should be permitted discretion to decide among them how best to enforce the
compensation rights to which they are all entitled. The Claimants hope that
Georgia will comply voluntarily with this Tribunal’s award. Otherwise, the
Claimants’ enforcement strategy may be dictated by various considerations,
including the relative enforceability of SCC and ICSID awards and Georgia's
ability to exercise police powers to influence Telasi and the Khrami
Companies.*!

56. The Tribunal will address the question of possible double recovery and the admissibility
of the claims for damages in the ICSID Arbitration in the ICSID Award which the Tribunal will
issue separately, in due course. For the purposes of this arbitration, the relevant question relates to
the payment of compensation due to Telasi and Inter RAO.

57. In their request for relief, the Claimants request the payment of damages within a range
depending on the loss suffered by the relevant Claimants: Telasi (on an FCFF basis) and Inter
RAO (onan FCFE basis).** The Claimants explained that Telasi’s claim at the company level was
higher than that on behalf of Inter RAO at the shareholder level; the difference being (a) tax on
dividends, and (b) the fact that Silk Road (and Inter RAO) only owned 75% of Telasi.** In this
regard, the Tribunal understands that Inter RAO’s damages in the amount of
calculated on an FCFE basis are subsumed within Telasi’s damages —/— =] calculated
onan FCFF basis. Accordingly. the Respondents are required to pay compensation of either ij
| Telasi oY to Inter RAO.

58. The Claimants also request that the Tribunal declare that the compensation it orders is on
an after-tax basis. In addition, they request the award of an indemnity in respect of any taxation of
the award (by the tax authorities of Georgia, The Netherlands, the Russian Federation or any other

country). According to them, the valuation of their losses has been prepared by Mr. Peer on an

respect to the claims related to Telasi.

after-tax basis. As a result, any taxation of the amounts awarded to the Claimants would result in
their effectively being taxed twice for the same income. as

59. The Claimants submit that each of Telasi and Inter RAO have separate claims and an
independent right to an award of compensation. In addition, they say that they should be permitted
discretion to decide how best to enforce those awards. Further, since their damages have been
calculated on an after-tax basis, the Claimants request that the Tribunal order compensation on
that basis, together with an indemnity in respect of any taxation of the award by the tax authorities
of Georgia, The Netherlands, the Russian Federation or any other country. Otherwise, any taxation
of the amounts awarded would result in their being taxed twice for the same income.

60. In the Tribunal’s view, the Claimants’ request for separate awards for the payment of
compensation to each of Telasi and Inter RAO is not practical. The tax treatment of compensation
paid to Inter RAO in The Netherlands or the Russian Federation was not addressed by the Parties
in any detail and appears complex, which creates uncertainty and potential complications regarding
payment of full compensation to Inter RAO. As a result, the Tribunal is not satisfied that separate
orders of compensation to each of Telasi and Inter RAO are appropriate. Rather, an order to pay
compensation to Telasi will provide simplicity and greater certainty and avoid the possible need
to monitor and address questions of indemnity from taxes relating to compensation paid to Inter
RAO.

61. As the Experts have calculated damages after taxes, Telasi is entitled to an award on that
basis, together with an order providing for an indemnity from liability for taxes imposed by the

Georgian taxation authorities.

0. According) IIe. Tribunal orders the

Government of Georgia to pay to Telasi the amount of a. This amount is to be paid
on an after-tax basis and the Claimants are entitled to an indemnity in respect of any taxation of

the award by the tax authorities of Georgia.

Vil. INTEREST

63. The Parties have each requested the payment of interest on the amounts they have claimed
against each other.

64. The Claimants submit that Mr. Peer established the present value SS
losses as of the first valuation date he used a - The Claimants say that as that date
(and, presumably, the updated valuation dates used in Mr. Peer’s subsequent calculations) serves
as the proxy for the date of the award, no separate pre-judgment interest is required.”

65. The Claimants also submit that the Tribunal should award post-award interest at the
reasonable commercial rate that it deems applicable. Further, they submit that interest should be
compounded on a quarterly basis accruing until payment is made in full.?6

66. The Respondents claim pre- and post-award interest on all amounts due to Georgia under

the 2013 Memorandum on the basis of the SSS Se

67. The Respondents also submitted that there is no basis to award compound interest as
requested by the Claimants. The Respondents say the Claimants have not demonstrated that
compound interest is permitted by Georgian law. In any event. they say that the payment of
compound interest is not automatic and that the Claimants have not demonstrated any special
circumstances which would justify compounding interest in this case.™*

an award of interest. Accordingly, the Tribunal will invite further submissions from the Parties
