INTRODUCTION
THE PARTIES

The Claimants in this arbitration are CC/Devas (Mauritius) Ltd. (“CC/Devas”), Devas Employees
Mauritius Private Limited (“DEMPL”) and Telcom Devas Mauritius Limited (“Telecom Devas”),
each incorporated in Mauritius. The Claimants bring their claims under the Agreement between
the Government of the Republic of Mauritius and the Government of the Republic of India for

the Promotion and Protection of Investments entering into force June 20, 2000.

The Claimants are represented in this arbitration by Mr. John L. Gardiner, Mr. Timothy G. Nelson,
and Ms. Betsy A. Hellmann, of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, One Manhattan
West, New York, NY 10001-8602, United States of America, and by Mr. David Kavanagh, of
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, 40 Bank Street, Canary Wharf, London E14 5DS,
United Kingdom.

The Respondent in this matter is the Republic of India.

The Respondent is represented in this arbitration by Mr. George Kahale III and Mr. Benard V.
Preziosi, Jr., of Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP, 101 Park Avenue, 35th Floor, New
York, New York 10178, United States of America.

THE ESSENCE OF THE CLAIMANTS’ CASE ON DAMAGES.

The Claimants assert that “the only remaining issue in this case is the amount of compensation
that the Claimants are entitled to receive from the Respondent arising out of the Respondent’s

multiple treaty violations, as set out in the Tribunal’s July 25, 2016, Award.”!

The Claimants contend that the determination of compensation due is governed by the principles
put forward by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the Chorzéw Factory case, and
that compensation should restore them to the situation which would have existed if the unlawful

acts had not been committed.”
The Claimants recall that the Tribunal held in the Award on Jurisdiction and Merits “that the

protection of essential security interests accounts for 60% of the Respondent’s decision to annul

Claimants’ Submission on Quantum I.

the Devas and that the ip ion owed by the Respondent to the Claimants for the
expropriation of their investment shall therefore be limited to 40% of the value of that
investment.”? Accordingly, the Claimants primarily calculate their compensation claims on the
basis of 25.2 Megahertzs (“MHzs”) of available spectrum (which corresponds to 40% of the 63
Mudzs of initially envisaged available spectrum).’ In other words, they present the valuation of an
investment that the Claimants might have made, had they been able to secure only 25.2 Mhz of

spectrum (“Reduced Spectrum Scenario”).

In a Reduced Spectrum Scenario, the Claimants contend that Devas Multimedia Private Ltd.
(“Devas”) would have made use of only one satellite and worked with new technology for its
ground network to maximally use the limited available spectrum. They argue that with these
changes Devas would still have been able to deliver the same broadband wireless access (“BWA”)

and audio-video (“AV”) services in the urban areas from which most of its revenue is originated.*

The Claimants criticize as “hopelessly implausible, and, indeed, mak[ing] sense only if one were

deliberately seeking to undermine Devas’s value’”®

the Respondent’s contentions that in a “but
for” world the Respondent’s military would have commandeered both satellites and would have
interleaved its 60% of appropriated spectrum with Devas’ spectrum across each of the

transponders, so that both sides’ spectrum would have been divided in small slices.”

The Claimants’ experts, Mr. Benjamin Sacks and Mr. Coleman Bazelon, Principals of The Brattle
Group (“Mr. Sacks” and “Mr. Bazelon,” respectively), apply the Income and Market approaches
to determine the fair market value of Devas as of a valuation date of February 17, 2011—the day
on which the Agreement for the Lease of Space Segment Capacity on ISRO/ANTRIX S-band
Spacecraft between Antrix Corporation Ltd. (“Antrix”) and Devas (“Devas Agreement”) was

annulled.*

Pursuant to the Tribunal’s request of November 13, 2017, they also address an alternative

valuation approach, calculating 40% of the value of the investment as it was actually made by the

Claimants, i.e. in consideration of all rights and obligations set out in the Devas Agreement,
including access to 63 Mhz of S-band spectrum (“Original Spectrum Scenario”).

THE ESSENCE OF THE RESPONDENT’S CASE ON DAMAGES

 

The Respondent asserts that the Claimants’ calculation of Devas business’ fair market value bears

no relationship to reality.°

The Respondent criticizes that the Claimants purport to obtain in this case a value which is almost
identical, despite relevant differences, to the value put forward in a parallel arbitration conducted
before the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”
and “ICC Arbitration,” respectively), in which a final award was issued in 2016. In the present
case, the Respondent recalls, the Claimants have assumed the use by Devas of only 40% of the
spectrum that was assumed to be available in the ICC Arbitration and the payment of a fee for
terrestrial use of spectrum which is twelve times the amount used in the ICC Arbitration.'° The
Respondent contends that the Claimants obtain essentially the same value for Devas’ business,
despite the spectrum reduction and the payment of a much higher re-use fee, by manipulating

projected cash flows to match a target value.!!

Furthermore, the Respondent argues that, as is reflected in contemporaneous documentary
evidence and the testimony of Government officials, it is stated Indian policy to charge a fee for
the use of spectrum which is commensurate with the spectrum’s auction value.!? The application
of the auction price as re-use fee would suffice to cause Devas’ business to have a negative value

of USD 549 million, even without any other adjustment to the Claimants’ model.'*

The Respondent disagrees with the relevance for the present case of the test set out in the Chorzé6w
Factory judgment, as it considers that the Tribunal held that the Claimants are entitled to

compensation under Article 6 of the Treaty, not on the basis of any other theory or measure."

In any event, even if Chorzéw Factory were relevant, the Tribunal would be required to award
compensation that would re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed,
had the unlawful act not been committed. The Respondent claims that Devas would “definitely”
have been subject to all of India’s policies and procedures, which indicates that “in all probability”
Devas would not have been granted a licence; and if a change in policy allowed terrestrial use of

such spectrum, spectrum fees to be charged would have been commensurate with auction prices.'*

The Respondent does not agree with the distribution of spectrum in the Reduced Spectrum
Scenario advanced by the Claimants as it considers that their assumption of a contiguous spectrum
allocation not only overstates Devas’ spectrum entitlement but also adversely impacts the

deployment of spectrum allocated for its essential security interests.'°

The Respondent also criticizes the lack of consideration for the allegedly inevitable delay in the
launch of the satellites which, as military satellites, would have needed to be launched using
India’s indigenous Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (“GSLV”) and required further
testing. The Respondent claims that if such delays were considered, the value of Devas would be

significantly reduced.!”

The Respondent regards the use of discounted cash flow (“DCF”) valuation methodology as
inappropriate for this case and raises concerns with its implementation by the Claimants, which
it considers to have “overstated revenues and understated costs by using assumptions that are
unwarranted.”!*

Pursuant to the Tribunal’s request of November 13, 2017, the Respondent also addresses an

alternative valuation approach for the Original Spectrum Scenario. The Respondent’s position is

AWARD ON JURISDICTION AND MERITS

On July 25, 2016, the Tribunal issued the Award on Jurisdiction and Merits (the “Award on

Jurisdiction and Merits” or “Partial Award”), the dispositive part of which provides:
501. For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal decides and awards as follows:

(a) Unanimously, that the Claimants’ claims relate to an “investment”
protected under the Treaty;
(b) Unanimously, that the notice of termination of the Devas Agreement sent

by Antrix to Devas constituted an act of State attributable to the
Respondent.

 
 

(c) By majority, that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the Claimants’
claims insofar as the Respondent’s decision to annul the Devas Agreement
was in part directed to the protection of the Respondent's essential
security interests;

 

(4) By majority, that the Respondent has expropriated the Claimants’
investment insofar as the Respondent’s decision to annul the Devas
Agreement was in part motivated by considerations other than the
protection of the Respondent's essential security interests;

(c) By majority, that the protection of essential security interests accounts for
60% of the Respondent’s decision to annul the Devas Agreement, and that
the compensation owed by the Respondent to the Claimants for the
expropriation of their investment shall therefore be limited to 40% of the
value of that investment;

@ UU i , that the has breached its ion to accord
fair and equitable treatment to the Claimants between July 2, 2010 and
February 17, 2011.

 

(g) | Unanimously, that the Claimants’ other claims shall be dismissed;

(h) Unanimously, that any decision regarding the quantification of
compensation or damages, as well as any decision regarding the allocation

of the costs of arbitration, shall be reserved for a later stage of the
proceedings.”!

Arbitrator David Haigh appended a dissenting opinion, in which he notably disagreed with the
majority’s conclusions that the Respondent’s decision to annul the Devas Agreement was in part
directed to the protection of the Respondent's essential security interests, and that the protection
of essential security interests accounted for 60% of the Respondent’s decision to annul that

Agreement.

WRITTEN PROCEEDINGS ON DAMAGES

Following several unsuccessful attempts since August 2, 2016 by the Parties to consult bilaterally
on the further timetable of the proceedings, the Tribunal, on September 5, 2016, formally invited
the Parties to initiate consultations in respect of a procedural calendar for the quantum phase
without delay and to inform the Tribunal of the results of such consultations by September 27,
2016. In default of agreement, the Tribunal proposed several possible dates to hold a telephone
conference with the Parties, following which the Tribunal would determine the procedural

timetable by way of a procedural order.

On September 15, 2016, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had reached agreement in
principle on a briefing and hearing timetable assuming the availability by the Tribunal on specific

dates.

On September 22, 2016, the Tribunal notified the Parties of its availability for a hearing on

quantum.

On September 27, 2016, the Parties informed the Tribunal about their agreement on the timetable

for the written submissions and the hearing on quantum on the basis of the Tribunal’s availability.

On September 29, 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 Concerning the Procedural
Calendar for the Quantum Phase, which memorialized the Parties’ agreed proposal regarding the

procedural calendar.

On October 27, 2016, the Respondent submitted a letter informing the Tribunal that on August
11, 2016, India’s Central Bureau of Investigation had filed charges against Devas and a number
of its present and former officers and directors, as well as a number of former Indian Government

officials with crimes under the Indian Penal Code and the Prevention of Corruption Act. The

Respondent further contended that if such charges were upheld, the Devas Contract would be void
ab initio under Indian law and the Tribunal’s determination that it was a valid and binding
agreement and an “investment” under the Treaty could not be sustained. Accordingly, the
Respondent requested the stay of arbitral proceedings pending the resolution of the criminal
charges, and asked that the case be dismissed if those charges were upheld. The Respondent
further indicated that it was moving to set aside the Award on Jurisdiction and Merits on a number
of grounds under the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure relating to these illegalities, “essential

security interests” and certain “pre-investment” issues.

On November 21, 2016, the Claimants opposed the Respondent’s requests. The Claimants argued
that the purported recent developments pre-dated the agreement between the Parties on a
procedural calendar for the quantum phase, which was memorialized in Procedural Order No. 6.
Therefore, the Respondent should be held to such agreement. Furthermore, the Claimants
contended that the findings in the Award on Jurisdiction and Merits, as a partial award, were final

and binding within the meaning of Article 32(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules.

On December 21, 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 Concerning the Respondent’ s
Request for Suspension of the Proceedings. The Tribunal noted that “[t]he Partial Award on
Jurisdiction and Merits (...) was final and binding under Article 32(2) of the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules in respect of the matters decided in it by the Tribunal.” Moreover, “the CBI
investigation was initiated in 2014 and its Charge Sheet was issued on 11 August 2016. The
Respondent was therefore aware of its contents when it agreed to the timetable for the
determination of damages as contained in Procedural Order No. 6 of 29 September 2016.” The
Tribunal thus concluded that “[i]n the present circumstances, (...) the Respondent’s application
for a stay must be denied, and that this arbitration shall proceed on the basis of the timetable set

forth in Procedural Order No. 6.”

On December 28, 2016, the Respondent submitted a letter confirming that it was prepared to
proceed in accordance with the briefing schedule but making clear that it reserved the right to

raise this issue and to challenge any future award which may be rendered in this case.

On January 16, 2017, the Claimants submitted their Submission on Quantum (“Claimants’

Submission on Quantum’).

On May 15, 2017, the Respondent submitted the Counter-Memorial on Quantum (“Respondent’s

Counter-Memorial on Quantum’).

On the same date, the R d d the duction of certain dc by the Claimants

and further requested that the process of document production be handled by an “exchange of

correspondence” instead of a “formal process involving a ‘Redfern Schedule’ .

On June 2, 2017, the Claimants provided their comments and requested that the Respondent’s
document production request be denied in full on the basis that Procedural Order No. 6 did not
contemplate a phase for document production and because the Respondent’s requests did not meet
the UNCITRAL Rules or the IBA Rules standards. In any event, if the requests were granted, the

Claimants requested that a Redfern Schedule be used.

On June 12, 2017, the Respondent submitted its comments and contended that the fact that
Procedural Order No. 6 did not contemplate a document production phase was irrelevant since,
under Article 24(3) of UNCITRAL Rules, an arbitral tribunal may order the production of
documents “at any time during the arbitral proceedings.” The Respondent further contended that

its document production requests met the applicable legal standards.

On June 21, 2017, the Claimants submitted further cc ding the scope, rel

 

and materiality of the Respondent’s document production requests.

On July 19, 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8 Concerning the Respondent’s
Request for the Production of Documents Pertaining to Quantum. The Tribunal denied the
Respondent’s request but invited the Claimants to instruct their experts to address four points
identified by the Respondent within Request 4 in their Reply Expert Report: “(i) the alternatives
for the split of the spectrum resulting from the Tribunal’s decision regarding India’s essential
security interests; (ii) the impact on Devas’ purported ‘first mover’ status of a delay in satellite
launch and/or a delay in the implementation of Devas services by reason of the status of the
terrestrial technology that is assumed; (iii) the impact on Devas’ business of its inability to provide
mobile telephony services; and (iv) the 6 July 2010 letter from the Secretary of the DOT to the
Department of Space (Ex. R-138) and the 28 July 2010 letter from the Wireless Advisor to the
Department of Space (Ex. R-139).”

On July 31, 2017, the Claimants submitted the Reply on Quantum (“Claimants’ Reply on

Quantum’).

On September 20, 2017, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that, at its request, the Parties had
agreed to an extension of the time by which the Respondent was to submit its Rejoinder on
Quantum from October 16 to October 20, 2017. On the same date, the Tribunal approved the

extension agreed between the Parties.

On October 10, 2017, in preparation for the damages hearing, the Tribunal invited the Parties to
confer and provide their views, if possible jointly, on a draft Procedural Order No. 9 addressing

logistical and procedural aspects of the quantum hearing by October 20, 2017.

On October 13, 2017, the Claimants’ counsel informed the Tribunal that they had conferred with
the Respondent’s counsel in view of the fact that the Respondent’s Rejoinder on Quantum was
due on October 20, 2017, and had agreed to request the Tribunal that the Parties be permitted to

provide their comments on draft Procedural Order No. 9 by October 27, 2017.

On October 16, 2017, the Tribunal granted the extension requested by the Parties of the time limit

for the submission of comments on draft Procedural Order No. 9.

On October 20, 2017, the Respondent submitted the Rejoinder on Quantum (“Respondent’s

Rejoinder on Quantum”).

On October 27, 2017, the Parties submitted their comments on draft Procedural Order No. 9. The

Parties agreed on all but one procedural issue.

On October 31, 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9 Concerning the Hearing on

Quantum.

On November 13, 2017, the Tribunal requested the Parties to ask their experts to provide by
November 29, 2017 a calculation of the amount of compensation based on the following
alternative approach: “What is 40% of the value of the investment as it was actually made by the
Claimants, i.e. in consideration of all rights and obligations set out in the Devas Agreement

including access to 63 Mhz of S-band spectrum?.”

On November 29, 2017, the Parties submitted their expert reports providing a calculation of the

amount of compensation based on this alternative approach.

By letter of December |, 2017, the Tribunal informed the Parties that due to an unexpected health
issue affecting a member of the Tribunal the hearing was postponed to a date to be determined in

due course.

On December 5, 2017, the Respondent informed the PCA that, in light of the unforeseen
developments resulting in the postponement of the Hearing on Quantum, the Parties had agreed
to delay the submission of preliminary comments concerning the alternative damages calculations
presented by the experts on November 29, 2017, at least to January 19, 2018. On the same date,

the Tribunal confirmed that the requested submission extension was granted and noted that,

should the Parties require further time beyond January 19, 2018 to submit their comments, the

Tribunal would be open to considering any request for a further postponement in due course.

On January 9, 2018, the Respondent conveyed the Parties’ agreement that the submission date of
January 19, 2018 should be extended sine die and informed the Tribunal that the Parties would

revert as soon as possible on a new agreed date or on alternative dates in the absence of agreement.

On January 11, 2018, the Tribunal confirmed that it was agreeable to extending the date for the
Parties’ comments on the alternative quantum calculations sine die. The Tribunal also informed
the Parties that it looked forward to hearing from the Parties at their early convenience in respect

of a new due date for such comments, if possible agreed between the Parties.

On February 27, 2018, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties recalling its January 11, 2018
communication, advising that it would hope to receive the Parties’ comments no later than in the
course of the month of April, and renewing its request to the Parties to consult with each other

with a view to agreeing on a due date for such comments.

On March 20, 2018, the Tribunal requested the Parties to revert by March 26, 2018, with an agreed
due date for the Parties’ comments on the alternative quantum calculations in the course of April,
noting that should no such date be agreed by that date, it intended to set a due date without further

consultation of the Parties.

On March 21, 2018, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that the Parties had exchanged proposals
and planned to update the Tribunal in this matter by March 23, 2018.

On March 23, 2018, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that the Parties had agreed on a
submission date of April 26, 2018 at 10 p.m. United States Eastern Daylight Time. The Claimants
also expressed their understanding as to the content of such submissions, and noted that they
intended to seek permission from the Tribunal to submit a copy of the Deutsche Telekom AG v.
India interim award on jurisdiction and merits (the “DT Award”) into the evidentiary record and
to make written observations on its relevance to this proceeding as part of their April 26, 2018

submission.

On the same date, the Respondent provided its views as to the content of the April 26, 2018
submissions as well as its intention to seek the Tribunal’s permission to submit the application to

set aside the DT Award that was filed with the Swiss Federal Tribunal.

On March 26, 2018, the Claimants confirmed the Parties’ agreement to the submission in this

arbitration of the DT Award and India’s set aside application before the Swiss Federal Tribunal,

and that the Parties should be permitted to comment on the relevance (if any) of both documents
in their forthcoming April 26, 2018 submissions. The Claimants also set out the Parties’

disagreement as to the admissible content of such submissions.

On March 27, 2018, the Respondent provided its comments on the Claimants’ communication of

March 26, 2018 regarding the admissible content of such submissions.

On April 3, 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 10 Concerning the Contents of the
Parties’ April 26, 2018 Submissions.

By letter dated April 10, 2018, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that GSAT-6A, the second
satellite, had been launched on March 29, 2018 and had encountered technical problems

immediately after launch.

On April 26, 2018, both sides submitted comments on alternative valuation calculations that had
been requested by the Tribunal, enclosing supplemental expert reports; and both sides also
submitted comments on the relevance (if any) of the DT Award and on India’s set aside

application before the Swiss Federal Tribunal.

As part of its April 26, 2018 submission, the Claimants requested the Tribunal to order the
Respondent to “(i) immediately produce [Appendix] VA-10 in unredacted form, together with all
other documents previously redacted by India (as logged in the February 14, 2014 and July 11,
2014 redaction logs); and (ii) immediately produce in unredacted form all documents disclosed
by it in [Deutsche Telekom AG v. Republic of India, PCA Case No. 2014-10 (the “DT
Arbitration”)]. Claimants reserve the right to request further relief once the full contents of such
documents are disclosed to Claimants.”

On May 2, 2018, the Respondent submitted a Reply to Claimants’ Observations on the Impact
of the DT Award in this Arbitration.

On May 7, 2018, the Claimants provided observations on the Respondent’s Reply dated May 2,
2018, and “request[ed] that the Tribunal grant the relief requested at paragraph 104 of Claimants’
April 26, 2018 submission and thus order the production of all documents, within three (3)
business days, produced in the DT case along with complete copies of all documents that were

produced in this arbitration in redacted format.”

By letter of the same date, the Respondent noted, inter alia, that it would respond to the Claimants’
new submission at the hearing; it also requested the Tribunal’s permission to introduce a new

document relevant to discount rates for the valuation of venture capital projects into the record.

On May 10, 2018, the Respondent provided observations on the Claimants’ letter of May 7, 2018;
and enclosed “a copy of the final version of the document [Appendix VA-10] produced in the DT

case, where it was marked as Ex. C-252.”

On May 11, 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 11 Concerning the Claimants’
Requests for Additional Document Production and the Respondent’s Request for Leave to
Introduce New Evidence. Pursuant to this Procedural Order, “[t]he Respondent [wa]s requested
to produce to the Claimants and the Tribunal, in the same form as they were produced in the DT
Arbitration, all other documents on the record of the present arbitration which were produced in
the DT Arbitration in more complete form.” Moreover, “[t]he Respondent’s request for leave to

introduce into the record the document described in its letter dated May 7, 2018 [wa]s granted.”

By e-mail of May 15, 2018, the Respondent alleged that Deutsche Telekom’s (“DT”)”* Memorial
on Quantum in the DT Arbitration, together with accompanying witness statements and expert
report, “contains positions that are materially inconsistent with those of the Claimants in this
case,” evincing “fundamental factual discrepancies that go to the heart of Claimants’ valuation
exercise.” The Respondent noted in particular that the evidence in the DT Arbitration raised
questions as to whether the cash flows in certain models prepared by Devas between 2007 and
2009, referred to as the Series-C Model, the Bravo Model and the Darwin Model, were expressed
in real or nominal terms; and requested “a telephone conference with the Tribunal at the earliest

possible time.”

By correspondence of May 17, May 18, May 19, May 20, May 21, May 23 and May 24, 2018,
the Claimants and the Respondent exchanged views on ways in which the purported discrepancies
between the evidence submitted in the present arbitration and the evidence submitted in the DT

Arbitration might be addressed.

On May 18, 2018, the Respondent produced to the Claimants and the Tribunal certain documents
pursuant to the Tribunal’s decision in Procedural Order No. 11, and introduced into the record a

new document with leave of the Tribunal.

The defined term DT will be used throughout the text to refer to the Deutsche Telekom group of companies,
including Deutsche Telekom AG and any affiliates.

On May 25, 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 12 Concerning Quantum Evidence
Tendered in Proceedings Instituted by Deutsche Telekom. Pursuant to this Procedural Order, the
Respondent “[wa]s requested, in accordance with Article 23(4) of the UNCITRAL Rules, to
produce the DT quantum papers, including but not limited to witness statements by DT’s (former)

On October 24, 2018, the Respondent submitted a letter from the tribunal in the DT Arbitration
directing India to “take the necessary steps, if any, vis-a-vis the Mauritius BIT tribunal to allow

for filing of the entire quantum record of the Mauritius BIT arbitration.”

On the same date, the Claimants were invited to provide their comments, if any, on the

Respondent's letter.

On October 26, 2018, the Claimants indicated that they did not object to the submission of the

entire quantum record of this arbitration in the DT Arbitration.

By letter dated October 30, 2018, the Tribunal confirmed that it did not have any objection to
India filing the quantum record of this arbitration in the DT Arbitration and, for the sake of good

On March 9, 2020, the Respondent transmitted to the Tribunal copy of a decision of the French
Court of Cassation”® together with a copy of the text of the “rapporteur” of the Court. That
decision annulled a previous Paris Court of Appeal decision and returning it to a different
formation of the Paris Court of Appeal. That decision essentially deals with matters having to do
with the jurisdiction of the ICC to authorize the Antrix case to be heard under its rules and
procedures. As such, the Tribunal considers that it does not need to address this matter in the

present case.

By letter dated April 9, 2020, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit two simultaneous rounds
of costs submissions and requested the Parties to detail separately the costs incurred during the

jurisdiction and merits phase, and the costs incurred during the quantum phase.

office.

On May 8, 2020, the Parties simultaneously submitted their submissions on costs (the

“Claimants’ Submission on Fees and Costs” and the “Respondent’s Cost Submission”).

On May 22, 2020, the Parties simultaneously submitted their comments on the other side’s
submission on costs (the “Claimants’ Comments on Respondent’s May 8, 2020 Costs

”” and the “Respondent’s C on Clai ission on Costs”).

29(2) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules to submit a copy of the Deutsche Telekom AG v. The
Republic of India final award dated May 27, 2020.

On June 15, 2020, the Claimants objected to the production of the said award.

On June 26, 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 17, Concerning a Request for Leave
to Submit the DT Quantum Award into the Record, whereby it authorized the production of the
said award with the provision that each Party would have the right to submit comments that could

not exceed three pages.

(c) an order that such sums be payable net of taxes, charges, or other set-offs (i.e.
Respondent may not withhold or offset payment of any portion of the award

compensation in this case, the Respondent disputes this, and considers that the only applicable

standard to calculate compensation is contained in Article 6 of the Treaty.

In this case, the Parties made only limited references to the consideration of sunk costs in their
evidence and oral submissions. Instead, the Parties focused their attention on the DCF

methodology and the comparable valuation asserted by their respective experts.

THE CLAIMANTS’ POSITION

The Claimants assert that the determination of compensation in this case, as with any violation of
international law, is governed by the principles espoused by the Permanent Court of International
Justice in the Chorzéw Factory case,™ which establishes that “reparation must, as far as possible,

wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all

probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.”*°

According to the Claimants, “one thus compares the situation that would have existed, but for the
violation, to the situation post-violation, and formulates compensation to restore Claimants to the

“but for” situation.”** Applied to this case,

monetary compensation must be sufficient to restore Claimants to the position they would
have enjoyed had Respondent not engaged in an unlawful expropriation of their investments
in February 2011, not violated its FET obligations with respect to Claimants’ investments
during 2010/2011, and instead conducted itself with good faith towards Claimants and Devas
Multimedia Private Limited (“Devas”), and “fully respected” the contract between Devas and
Antrix Corporation Limited (“Devas Agreement”), albeit with a reduced spectrum allocation
of just 40% of the originally envisioned 63 MHz of S-band spectrum that had been allocated
for Devas’s use.*” [footnotes omitted]

  

The Claimants assert that the Award on Jurisdiction and Merits confirms the unlawful seizure by
the Respondent of Devas’ investments in 25.2 MHzs of spectrum.** Furthermore, they claim that

in cases of unlawful seizure compensation is due for the “fair market value of that investment in

the situation that would have existed had the violation of international law not occurred” *° (the

“but for” scenario).

The Claimants assume that, consistently with Chorzéw Factory and the International Law
Commission Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts 2001
(“ILC Articles”), in a “but for” world the government would have acted reasonably and rationally
with respect to Devas, would have respected the terms of the Devas Agreement and would not
have been animated by plans to “annul” it.“° Moreover, the Claimants assume the fulfilment by
the Respondent of its international obligations under the bilateral investment treaty (“BIT”)

protecting the Claimants’ investments.*!

These assumptions are regarded by the Claimants as a simple corollary of the Chorzéw Factory
principle that the “consequences” of illegality must be “wiped out.” Furthermore, the Claimants
also invoke the principle that a respondent cannot pre-suppose in a “but for” analysis that it would
have continued to violate its own contractual undertakings or subject investments to further
expropriation.” In support of their position the Claimants refer to the Azurix case, the Lemire
case, and the Occidental case.** Likewise, the Claimants also argue that this is also consistent

with the principle of pacta sunt servanda,“

The Claimants accepted at the Hearing on Quantum that “those principles would apply under the
standard set forth in Article 6(1) of the Mauritius Treaty.”*> Nevertheless, they reiterated their
position and argued that “even if there’s no practical distinction in this case between the treaty
result (...) and the result under Chorzow factory, under customary International law,’ the treaty

standard sets a baseline below which compensation should not fall, and not an upper limit.*7

The Claimants, quoting CMS Gas Transmission Co. v. Argentina, also contend that the concept

of “fair market value” has the following “internationally recognized” definition;

the price, expressed in terms of cash equivalents, at which property would change hands
between a hypothetical willing and able buyer and a hypothetical willing and able seller,
acting at arm’s length in an open and unrestricted market, when neither is under compulsion
to buy or sell and when both have reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts.**

The Claimants further argue, relying on the Tribunal in Compajifa del Desarrollo de Santa Elena,
S.A. v. Costa Rica, that the fair market value of an asset should be assessed “by reference to its
highest and best use.”“? Accordingly, they claim to be entitled to recover the value of their
respective shares of Devas’ expropriated assets, including 25.2 MHz of spectrum, put to its

highest and best use.*°

The Claimants accept that the burden of proof of the losses suffered lies on them and, following
the Khan Resources tribunal, consider that the applicable standard is
balance of probabilities (...) scientific certainty is not required and it is widely acknowledged

by investment treaty tribunals and publi ssment of damages is often a
difficult exercise and will usually involve some degree of estimation and the weighing of

 

competing (but equally legitimate) facts, valuation methods and opinions (...).

It is the Claimants’ submission that they have met their burden of proof in this case.**

THE RESPONDENT’S POSITION

The Respondent denies the applicability of the Chorzéw Factory standard of compensation to this
case as it considers that the Tribunal held in the Award on Jurisdiction and Merits that the only

applicable standard to calculate compensation is Article 6 of the Treaty.**

While the Claimants justify the applicability of the Chorzéw Factory standard on the basis that
the expropriation of 40% of their investment was unlawful, the Respondent affirms that the term

“unlawful” does not appear anywhere in the Tribunal’s ruling.**

Page 30 of 163

In any event, the Respondent claims that the Treaty standard of compensation should be
applicable regardless of whether the expropriation was lawful or unlawful. To this effect it relies,

among others, on British Caribbean Bank Ltd. v. Government of Belize:

at no point does the Treaty, being a /ex specialis, distinguish between lawful and unlawful
expropriation (...) Once the violation of the Treaty provisions regarding expropriation is
established, the State has breached the Treaty. Neither is the Tribunal convinced that the
generally accepted fair market value standard was intended to apply only in cases of the so-
called “lawful expropriation” (...).°

The Respondent also quotes Guaracachi America, Inc. and Rurelec PLC v. Plurinational State of

Bolivia, which held:

The BIT makes no distinction between the compensation to be provided in respect of an
unlawful expropriation as opposed to a lawful one, and the Tribunal does not find any reason
to believe that the illegality of the expropriation renders what the BIT deems to be “just and
effective compensation” suddenly inadequate.
Moreover, the Respondent claims that the Tribunal expressly held in the Award on Jurisdiction
and Merits that the Claimants are entitled to “compensation under Article 6 of the Treaty,”*”
which provides that compensation for expropriation “shall amount to the market value of the
investment expropriated.” Accordingly, “Claimants are only entitled to claim compensation for
the ‘market value of the investment’ as of the valuation date, February 2011, not the Chorzéw

Factory standard, as Claimants wrongly allege.”** [emphasis in original]

The Respondent also contends that the Claimants have essentially misinterpreted the Chorzéw
Factory standard by assuming that “the “but for” world would be one that would cater to Devas’
interests over the Government’s essential security interests.”°°

While considering the discussion of the Chorzéw Factory standard’s applicability purely
academic in this case because the result would be the same whether or not the standard is
applied; the Respondent further argues that the Claimants are not entitled to ignore any fact that

negatively affects their value but, “rather, it requires that all factors, negative as well as positive,

that “in all probability” would have been present must be taken into consideration.”°' [emphasis

in original] The Respondent quotes several authorities in this regard.°*

The Respondent also criticizes that the Claimants consider that, in their calculation, they may
assume the “highest and best” use of the asset, while disregarding the Government’s
determination of the manner in which it would need to deploy the spectrum to protect its essential
security interests.* As the Claimants’ own authorities acknowledge, the “highest and best use” is
circumscribed by “all pertinent legal, physical, and economic constraints.”

The Respondent states that a but-for assessment would need to take into account the Indian
regulatory regime (which would have precluded the terrestrial use of the spectrum or, if such use
were permitted, would require that a charge commensurate with auction prices would be levied);
the Government’s need for a shared satellite configuration; and the delay in the satellites’

deployment.

Finally, the Respondent notes that, while the Claimants assert a breach of due process by the
failure to inform them timely of the decision to reserve the spectrum for non-commercial use,

they do not put forward any damage claim for that alleged breach.

In sum, the Respondent’s submission is that the “claimant’s burden of proof is not met merely

because liability has been found’ and criticise the Claimants’ “conclusory statements that the

Devas business must have had some value and that, therefore, [the Respondent’s] and Dr Flores’s

conclusion that the DCF analysis actually results in a negative value cannot be right.”

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

Establishing the valuation date in this case is relatively straight-forward. Both Parties appear to
agree that the valuation date should be immediately before the announcement of the Indian

Cabinet Committee on Security (“CCS”) decision of February 17, 2011.

Beyond the identification of the proper valuation date, however, the Claimants contend that
determining the value of Devas requires the Tribunal to exclude from consideration potentially
adverse effects on the value of Devas attributable to India, preceding that date. For example, it is
said that the Tribunal should disregard the possibly negative impact of the February 8, 2011 press
conference, at which Dr. Radhakrishnan together with Dr. Kasturirangan, announced publically

the Space Commission’s intention to annul the Devas Agreement.

The Tribunal has no difficulty accepting that any adverse impact on value of such governmental
actions shortly ahead of any taking must be disregarded. Otherwise, a state wishing to expropriate
the property of a foreign investor would only need to have one of its officials announce an
intention to take over the investor’s property without compensation and then delay that actual
decision. In such circumstances, the value of the investment would deteriorate and would not have

the same value as it would have had, but for such announcement or intervention.

This approach is found specifically in Article 6(1) of the Treaty in relation to valuing property
that has been expropriated. It says, in part, “[s]uch compensation shall amount to the market value
of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation or before the impending
expropriation became public knowledge.” The Tribunal recognizes this provision embodies what
is practically a universal principle to be applied in expropriation cases: the expropriating authority
cannot take advantage of its own conduct where it may have negatively influenced or adversely

affected the value of what was to be taken ahead of the valuation date.

Less obviously, the Claimants say this approach may be important as well when considering the
Respondent's reliance, for example, on statements made by persons whose views were solicited
in 2010 by Dr. Radhakrishnan in the context of the potential annulment of the Devas Agreement,
such as those of P.J. Thomas, Secretary, WPC Wing, DOT, to Secretary, DOS concerning the
potential commercial use of the S-band allotted to Devas and the potential terrestrial use of the S-

band.”

The Claimants invoke the standard articulated in the Chorzow Factory case for compensation,”
that is, to make reparation in an amount that would, “so far as possible, wipe out all the

consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have

existed if that act had not been committed.”’? The Respondent objects to applying this standard
and says the Tribunal “clearly held” that “the applicable standard to calculate compensation” in

this case “is exclusively Article 6 of the Mauritius Treaty.””

The Respondent says that Article 6 provides only that compensation for expropriation “shall
amount to the market value of the investment expropriated” which may be something less than
the fair market value that might be potentially claimed under the Chorzéw Factory standard.”
Moreover, the Respondent says that the Tribunal did not make an express finding of unlawful
conduct in the Partial Award and that such a finding would have been necessary in order to apply
the Chorzéw Factory standard.’° Despite these submissions, the Respondent concedes, however,
that the discussion about the compensation standard is purely academic in this case since even
under the Chorzéw Factory standard, the result would be the same." Contrary, it says, to the
Claimants’ arguments, the Chorzéw Factory standard does not allow the Claimants to ignore any
fact that negatively affects value. “Rather, it requires all factors, negative as well as positive that
‘in all probability’ would have been present must be taken into consideration.””” Several
authorities are cited in support. Among others, India refers to CDSE v. Costa Rica,” Phillips

Petroleum v. Iran,” and Yukos v. Russia.*°

In response, the Claimants pointed to findings in the Partial Award in relation to breaches of
Articles 4(2) and 6 of the Treaty (governing fair and equitable treatment (“FET”) and
expropriation, respectively), contending that these findings amounted to a finding of unlawful

expropriation (as well as bad faith conduct in breach of the FET standard).*! The Claimants also

argue that India has not disputed that, in principle, the relevant business asset should be valued

based on its “highest and best use.”*?

The Claimants submitted that comp ion is calculated in a “hypothetical context where the
State would not have resorted to such maneuvers, but would have fully respected the provision
of the treaty and the contract concerned.”** They say, therefore, that both the Chorzéw Factory
mandate and the principle of full reparation apply, including looking to the highest and best use

of the property that has been taken.

The Tribunal finds that the debate over whether it must apply the concept of either market value
or fair market value, as acknowledged by the Respondent, is really academic in this case. We
should not overlook actions by the state that may have negatively affected the value of what was
taken as a result of the decision of the CCS in February 2011. Put in affirmative terms, the
Tribunal determines that it should apply the standard language of reparation as set out in the
Chorzéw Factory case. In particular, the Tribunal finds that the phrase, “market value” used in
Article 6 of the Treaty does not preclude reliance on these well-recognized and standard
descriptions of what should be determined when deciding quantum or value of what was, in this
case, unlawfully taken without compensation at the time. Moreover, if it were necessary to do so,
the Tribunal would affirm that Treaty breaches of FET and expropriating property without

compensation were both unlawful actions for which the Claimants may seek full compensation.

The Tribunal will, therefore, review the issues raised in this quantum phase of the arbitration with
the objective of finding an amount that will, “as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of
the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that
act had not been committed.”*

The Tribunal has read with great attention and respect the award in the Deutsche Telekom AG v.
The Republic of India submitted by the Respondent on June 29, 2020. As will be seen below,
based on its own analysis of the evidence and the pleadings of the Parties in this case, the Tribunal,

by majority, has come to different conclusions.

APPLICABLE “BUT FOR” SCENARIO

The Tribunal will now consider which circumstances would have prevailed in the event that the
unlawful conduct had not occurred. The Tribunal will address several defining features of the

“but for” scenarios discussed by the Parties.

As was noted by the Tribunal in its letter to the Parties of November 13, 2017, the Parties’
discussion on the applicable “but for” scenario was based on the characterization of the damages
claim by the Claimants and focused initially on the value of Devas in the hypothetical event that
it had obtained only 40% of the originally allocated spectrum. In other words, the valuation
concerns the value in early February 2011 of the Claimants’ investment in Devas, had that
company been able to secure only 25.2 Mhz of spectrum. This “but for” scenario will be referred

to as the “Reduced Spectrum Scenario.”

As will be seen below, the main areas of discussion between the Parties in the Reduced Spectrum
Scenario concern the S-band spectrum distribution and satellite capacity allocation between the
Parties; the impact of satellite launch delays on Devas’ value; and the likelihood of Devas
obtaining, but for the decision to annul the Devas’ Agreement, the relevant regulatory approvals
to operate its intended BWA and AV services, notably by being granted a terrestrial re-use license
from the Wireless Planning and Coordination Wing (“WPC” and “WPC License,” respectively),

against the payment of a fee to be established by the authorities.

By the same letter of November 13, 2017, the Tribunal requested the Parties to ask their experts
to provide additional reports addressing an alternative valuation approach in which they would
calculate the amount of 40% of the value of the investment as it was actually made by the
Claimants, i.e. in consideration of all rights and obligations set out in the Devas Agreement
including access to 63 Mhz of S-band spectrum. This “but for” scenario will be referred to as the

“Original Spectrum Scenario.”

Furthermore, under both the Reduced Spectrum Scenario and the Original Spectrum Scenario, the
Parties address two possible situations with regard to the services which Devas may have been
able to provide: (i) the provision of both BWA and AV services; and (ii) the provision of AV
services only. Whether both types or only one type of services was to be provided has a significant

impact on the value of Devas, as will be apparent in the following sections.

REDUCED SPECTRUM SCENARIO

On the assumption that Devas would have to operate with a reduced spectrum, the Parties disagree
on several aspects of the Reduced Spectrum Scenario, including: (i) the amount of spectrum
entitlement and its division over one or two satellites; (ii) the satellite configuration and the impact
of possible launch delays; (iii) regulatory risks; and (iv) applicable license fees. Finally, the

Parties also discuss the value of an AV Services—only business in the Reduced Spectrum Scenario.

1. Spectrum Entitlement and Division

On the assumption that Devas would have to operate with a reduced spectrum, the Parties disagree
as to the actual amount of spectrum entitlement as well as to how such spectrum would likely
have been allocated and, in particular, whether it was reasonable to assume that the entirety of the

spectrum would have been allocated on one and the same satellite.

a. Contiguous 25.2 MHz Spectrum Allocation to Devas in One Satellite

The Claimants argue that in a “but for” world Devas would have had 25.2 MHz of downlink
spectrum available instead of the 70 MHz originally envisaged (of which 7 MHz had already been
reserved for use by the Indian Space Research Organization (“ISRO”))® and 0.2 MHz of uplink

spectrum. *¢

The 25.2 MHz of available spectrum for Devas in the Claimants’ “but for” scenario is the product
of multiplying the 63 MHz of spectrum which were originally envisaged for Devas’ use by 40%,*”
which is the extent of spectrum which, on the Claimants’ interpretation, was regarded by the
Tribunal in the Award on Jurisdiction and Merits to have been expropriated for purposes other

than the protection of India’s essential security interests.**
The Claimants argue that in such a scenario Devas would have:

(a) reconfigured one of the two Satellites (and not used the other), and (b) worked with new

technology for its ground network to maximally use the 25.2 MHz of spectrum available (...)
with these technology changes, having 25.2 MHz of spectrum would not have materially
affected Devas’s ability to deliver BWA and AV services in the urban areas in India (...)
from where the vast bulk of its revenues were to be generated.*? [footnotes omitted]

In contrast, in the less-profitable rural areas Devas would not have built a terrestrial BWA network

90

and would offer a reduced package of AV services.” This would have only had a minor impact

on Devas’ revenues which were largely generated from customers in urban zones.”!

The Respondent, on the other hand, considers that the Claimants engage in a distorted analysis of
the available spectrum and propose a satellite configuration that would deprive the Government
of the effective use of the limited spectrum that the Tribunal had determined it would need for its

essential security interests.°?

The Respondent contends that the spectrum split is not just a “mathematical matter,” as not all of
the spectrum on each of the transponders is “usable” and it is necessary to have unused “guard
band” spectrum to assure the realisation of the satellite payload systems.*? By not taking this into
account, the Respondent argues, the Claimants have overstated their spectrum entitlement.”

Moreover, the Respondent also disagrees with the way in which the split is put forward by the
Claimants, which assume a contiguous allocation and the use of one satellite only. This would
leave the Government with the entirety of the second satellite and only a small portion of the first
one. The split envisaged by the Claimants would thus have an adverse impact on India’s ability

to protect its essential security interests.°°

The Respondent claims that Devas would not be viable as a company with the reduced spectrum,
and that the Claimants’ preferred configuration is designed to make Devas viable at the expense

of India’s essential security interests.°°

b. Non-contiguous 19.44 MHz Spectrum Allocation to Devas Divided in Both
Satellites

The Respondent argues that Devas would at most have had use of 19.44 MHz of downlink
spectrum and 2.916 MHz of uplink.®’ Furthermore, as the Tribunal found that 60% of the
spectrum was to be allocated for India’s essential security interests, the “Claimants cannot now
assert that the Government would have been required to deploy that spectrum in a manner that
best suited Devas’ commercial needs.”

The Respondent affirms that with a spectrum split and satellite configuration consistent with its
essential security interests, Devas would have been left with “non-contiguous spectrum, usable
with only smaller channel sizes supported by the LTE standard (...) that would have limited
Devas’ service offerings.”*? The Respondent endorses the conclusion of its technical expert, Mr.
Sharony (hereafter, “Mr. Sharony’’) that this would have had a negative impact on Devas’ ability
to compete effectively.”!

On the other hand, the Claimants’ experts consider that the Respondent’s proposed distribution
of the spectrum “would be so grossly inefficient as to be perverse (...) the only discernable (sic)
“rationale” for Mr. Parikh’s suggested satellite configuration and use of S-band spectrum is that
it depresses Devas’s value.”!®! Mr. Parikh is the Deputy Director of the Satellite Communication
and Navigation Payload Area of the Space Application Center (ISRO) and his testimony has been

submitted by the Respondent (“Mr. Parikh”). Furthermore, the Claimants contend:

Mr. Parikh’s assumptions about bandwidth and channels, and guard bands also would result
in large amounts of empty, unused spectrum and would clearly hamper India’s use of the S-
band for military needs. These arguments are manifestly implausible, and therefore cannot

2. Technical Risks

On the assumption that Devas would have to operate with a reduced spectrum, the Parties disagree

with regard to the technical risks that Devas’ business would face.

a. Satellite Configuration and Launch Delays

The Parties are in disagreement as to whether it was reasonable to assume that Devas would have
been able to use one or two of the satellites. As a result, they take different views as to launch

delays that Devas would have to factor in before being provided with satellite capacity.

i. One Dedicated Satellite for Devas Unimpeded by Delays

The Claimants contend that Devas would have had the right under the Devas Agreement to
delivery of two satellites, which were almost complete by June/July 2010! and were to be
launched by mid-July 201 1.'* Devas would have used either of those satellites.'°* In this regard,
the Claimants argue that the Award on Jurisdiction and Merits did not rule that the satellites
GSAT-6 or 6A were needed for military use.!°° They consider that in a situation where India acted
reasonably there would have been no reason why such a satellite could not have been launched

for Devas in 2011.'”

The Claimants affirm that in a “but for” world “Devas would not be tethered to the two-satellite

configuration proposed by India.”!*

[emphasis in original] Moreover, the Claimants consider
that, since the satellite that would be dedicated for Devas’ use “would not involve the military, it
would not have been subject to any delays or refits associated with the military or the purported

need to launch the satellite using an Indian GSLV.”!

The Claimants also assert that in a “but for’ world Antrix would have complied with its
contractual obligation to launch the satellites promptly.''° In any event, Devas had already taken
the initiative to identify a third-party launch vehicle to cover for any contingency.'!' They further
point out that “India itself uses foreign-made launch vehicles in practice. As Mr. Sethuraman
admits, India’s last military satellite, GSAT-7, was not launched using the GSLV or any other
Indian vehicle.”!!? [emphasis in original] Mr. Sethuraman is Associate Director, Satellite
Communication Program at the Satellite Communication and Navigation Program Office (ISRO);
his testimony has been submitted by the Respondent (“Mr. Sethuraman’’). In fact, the launch
was carried out by a European consortium, as reported by Indian press: “India’s first exclusive
defence satellite GSAT-7 was successfully launched by European space consortium,

Arianespace’s Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou spaceport in French Guiana.”!!3
The Claimants further argue:

In all events, even had there been some delay in launching a satellite that would allow Devas
to start offering services, this would not have affected the basic viability of the busine
because, as Claimants have shown, they would fully have met that challenge in a manner that
preserved its business, e.g. by accelerating the roll-out of its services to make up for any
delay, to ensure that its rollout was not impaired. ''*

 

In contrast, the Respondent argues that the spectrum split put forward by the Claimants would
leave the Government with very limited capacity in one satellite which the Respondent considers
as a “grave risk if Satellite 2 were to fail.”!!°

The Respondent explains that “the Government has a 24 x 7 operational philosophy for its military
satellites, meaning that, in order to assure that the military requirements are covered at all times,

two operational satellites in the same service are necessary.”!!¢

ii. Shared Satellites to Be Launched with Indian Autochtt Technol

The Respondent argues that it needs access to both satellites, such that if one satellite were to fail,
the Government would at least have some coverage for its essential security interests.!'? Pursuant
to the Respondent’s proposal, the Government would have at least two satellites covering the
same area and, “while such a spectrum split and satellite configuration would not have been
optimal for Devas, the Government’s essential security interests should not be compromised in
order to accommodate Devas’ entertainment business.”!!*

The Respondent contends that, while the Claimants’ proposal gives no consideration at all to the
Government’s essential security interests,!'? the Respondent’s proposed shared satellite
configuration gives additional capacity to the Government and meets its load sharing
requirements. The Respondent’s approach is therefore superior to the Claimants’ proposals,
which the Respondent regards as based on the erroneous premise that the Claimants are entitled
to define the satellite configuration in a manner that “assur[es] it the maximum benefit irrespective

of the Government’s essential security interests.” !”°

In the Claimants’ view, “[t]here is no credible evidence that India does, in fact, approach military
satellites in that fashion” and, in any event, it would be “irrelevant to the outcome of this issue.” 7!
The Claimants also contend that “every satellite has internal redundancy built into it so that if a
transponder malfunctions, coverage is not lost. Because satellites are constructed this way, there
is rarely total in-orbit failure of a satellite. India’s claimed “risk” of total in-orbit failure is greatly
overstated.”'?? Moreover, according to Mr. Gary Parsons, engineer Member of the Board of
Directors and shareholder of Devas, whose witness testimony has been submitted by the
Claimants (“Mr. Parsons”), it is uncommon for militaries worldwide to operate a redundant

satellite. He points out:

[N]one of the last three satellites that India claims were for military use have in-orbit
operational back-ups nor has India launched two complementary satellites in order to
“diversify” its risk of in-orbit failure. Indeed, in the two years since GSAT-6 was launched,
and despite its claims of an alleged “grave risk” in not having a second satellite in orbit, India

has not launched GSAT-6A, as a back-up or otherwise. '?* [footnotes omitted]

The Respondent addresses these assertions by stating that the Claimants do not comprehend the

* while satellites have some internal

difference between load sharing and redundancy;'”
redundancy, it relates to specific components only (those with higher failure rates). Satellites do
not have redundant transponders, nor does the unfurlable antenna (the failure of which would
render the satellite useless) have any redundancy.'?° Furthermore, even if redundant components
may remedy many potential failures, “the problems associated with the inability to load share that
are inherent in the dedicated satellite configuration would remain.” !”°

Regarding the lack of back-ups, the Respondent claims that its plan was to develop experience
prior to launching satellite GSAT-6A, which was scheduled for December 2017 or January
2018.!77

According to the Respondent, in a “but for” world both satellites would have been reconfigured
to be used by the military and they would have required to have been launched using India’s
indigenously developed launch technology.'!”* Despite the Claimants’ denial of relevant launch

delays, the Respondent considers them inevitable to make possible:

the Government’s reconfiguration of the satellites for dual military/commercial usage, the
Government's assessment of the causes for the GSLV launch failures, its development of
solutions and the testing of the modified launch equipment, and the Government's need to
develop ground systems (including handheld devices) that were compatible with the S-band
satellite signals. !2?

 

The Respondent points out that satellite GSAT-6 was launched by ISRO on August 27, 2015,'°
and that there is no reason to believe that the delay would have been significantly different had

the Government been limited to 60% of the capacity of the satellites rather than 100%.!*!

Page 43 of 163

The Respondent also affirms that Devas had no right under the contract to obtain a third-party
launch vehicle, despite the Claimants’ assertions that Devas had already taken the initiative to
find such a third-party. '*? The Respondent affirms that “GSAT-6 and GSAT-6A, unlike GSAT-
7, are not ordinary communication satellites. Rather, they contain India’s state-of-the-art
unfurlable antenna” and India was not prepared to share these advanced and unique features with

any third-party launcher.'*4

The Respondent criticizes the Claimants’ assertion that any delay would have been mitigated “by

”*134 as a bold statement without

accelerating the roll-out of its services to make up for any delay’
any evidence to support the feasibility of such acceleration.'** The Respondent argues that if an
acceleration of services roll-out was possible, it would have been done in any event, since Devas

was to generate negative cash flows for nine years according to the Claimants’ experts.!°°

The Respondent discards the Claimants’ statement that Antrix was contractually obligated to

launch satellites promptly, as Antrix could not have launched the satellite if the Government

137

  

refused to permit it to be launched by a third-party in light of its essential security interests.
Furthermore, even assuming that Antrix’s delay could not be excused as force majeure, the
maximum amount it would be required to pay for delay would have been USD 5 million. In the
event of material breach, Devas was entitled to terminate the contract and to obtain the refund of

the Upfront Capacity Reservation Fees, but nothing more.'**

The Respondent contends that a reasonably informed buyer in February 2011 would have known
that a delay in the launch would have had an adverse effect on value. A shift of the launch date to
July 2014, without any other change in the Claimants’ model, would have decreased their DCF
valuation from USD 1,284 million to USD 68.9 million, while a delay to July 2015 (which roughly

million.

iii. One Satellite Dedicated to Devas Still Affected by Launch Delays

The Respondent claims that, even if Devas had been given a dedicated satellite as assumed by the
Claimants (which for the reasons set out above would have been contrary to India’s essential
security interests), such satellite would have still needed to be reconfigured to function with a
reduced spectrum. In this regard, the Respondent claims that the nine-month period which the
Claimants allow for such reconfiguration is “overly simplistic.”“° According to Mr. Parikh “the
procurement, installation and testing of the new payload would have taken between 15 and 21
months.” 4!

Moreover, the Respondent submits that regardless of when such reconfiguration may have been
finished, the “satellite would have had to have been launched from India by an indigenous Indian
satellite under the watchful eye of ISRO and Indian security forces, not by a third-party.” "? The

Respondent suggests:

[OJnce it had been determined to use a satellite with India’s state-or-the-art unfurlable
antenna for the Government's essential security interests, an identical satellite would not have
been permitted to have been launched with a foreign launch vehicle. '“3

b. Technical Challenges

The Parties are in disagreement with regard to the feasibility of certain technical assumptions and
the impact that technical challenges would have over the viability of Devas’ business. In
particular, the Respondent challenges the feasibility of the technologies which the Claimants
envisage would have been used in the Reduced Spectrum Scenario and the competitiveness of the

Devas’ business with the assumed download speed and “oversubscription ratio.”

i. Novel Technologies (LTE, DVB-SH and eMBMS

in the Reduced Spectrum Scenario would involve the use of LTE technology and an efficient cell

site configuration, which would result in higher cell capacity and reduced network costs; the use
of a 20 MHz channel for BWA services (in contrast with the three 10 MHz channels previously
envisaged); and the merging of Devas’ terrestrial network for AV and BWA services into a single

terrestrial network using “eMBMS” technology, which would result in significant cost savings. '“

According to the Claimants, LTE and DVB-SH technologies were in their infancy and required
“an appropriate ecosystem” which, the Claimants submit, “was being accelerated for Devas” with
DT’s assistance. '*> The Claimants also point out that Mr. Sharony opined that TD LTE technology
“would be available in India in 2012, which is consistent with the valuation evidence.” “°

With regard to e€MBMS technology, in the Claimants’ view, the introduction of such technology
was feasible as at the valuation date, as is illustrated “by the fact that DT, Devas and Alcatel
Lucent were actively engaged in developing eMBMS for use by Devas at the time the contract
was annulled.”'*’ The Claimants consider that Mr. Sharony does not question its viability from a
technical perspective but rather “complains” that it was not commercially deployed until 2014.“
Nevertheless, the Claimants consider that Mr. Larsen’s evidence that “there was a commercial
case for eMBMS with Devas and that, before annulment, DT was driving its development”
remains “unchallenged.” ?

The Respondent contests the availability as of February 2011 of the technology relied on by the
Claimants in order to develop the technological arrangements required in the “Reduced Spectrum
Scenario,” noting that “as of February 2011, no TD-LTE network had been commercially
deployed anywhere in the world.”!*° The Respondent points out that TD-LTE was deployed in

India for the first time in April 2012 by one of the giants of the Indian telecommunications

market.'*! Accordingly, the Respondent considers that the “Claimants” assumption that they could

have rolled out commercial services using TD-LTE combined with e-MBMS technologies as of
January 2012 is totally unsupported.” !*?

According to the Respondent, “most of the telecommunication giants considered the business

case for eMBMS still not proven in 2016 (...) It is still not clear today whether it is commercially

viable. DT hasn’t rolled it out commercially anywhere.” In any event, the Respondent argues

that “the record shows that it would not have been ready for use by Devas until 2014 at the

earliest.”'*4

ii. Download Speed

The Respondent criticizes that the Claimants have updated the download speeds for BWA
services assumed in the Darwin Model to meet the requirements for broadband services
recommended by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (“TRAI”) for 2011, but have not
also assumed that they would have to grow at a higher rate than envisaged in the Darwin Model
in order to reach the download speed recommended by TRAI for 2016.'% In the Respondent’s
view, this means that “without adjustment, Devas would have had a manifestly uncompetitive
business.” !** According to the Respondent, if the costs necessary to achieve that were included in
the Claimants’ model, “the value calculated by Claimants’ experts would be entirely

eviscerated.”!*”

Moreover, the Respondent contends that the “[a]ctual download speeds for BWA services in India
demonstrate that Devas would have been uncompetitive had it achieved the speeds based on the

growth rates assumed by Claimants’ experts.”!** In the Respondent’s view,

Devas could not reasonably expect to offset the costs associated with increasing download
speeds with an increase in the price of the services, as the large Indian companies that are
offering BWA services are actually charging prices that are lower than prices that Claimants’
experts are projecting for Devas[.]'

In response, the Claimants argue that Mr. Flores’ criticism relies “on a single comment to a series
of comments on proposed guidelines, and the comment he relies on was not adopted for several
years after it was first made (in different market circumstances).”!® [emphasis in original] The
Claimants also underscore that Mr. Bazelon met the “actual bandwidth requirements in 2011”
[emphasis in original], and that the document on which —Mr. Flores relies “deals with service in
rural villages and acknowledges that as of 2011 3G and BWA systems may support lesser
bandwidth.”'6!

The Claimants contend that Mr. Flores refers to speeds obtained by other operators after the
valuation date “but notably does not mention the substantial reduction in the costs of providing
bandwidth (...) that occurred in the same period to support those increased speeds.” ©? According
to the Claimants, Mr. Bazelon’s examination at the Hearing on Quantum “dispel[ed] any doubt
that the projected download speeds contained in the TRAI recommendation are not a reasonable

basis for reducing value or adjusting the cash flows.”!

iii. “Oversubscription Ratio”

The “oversubscription ratio” reflects the number of broadband customers which have access to

the same bandwidth at any particular time.'°! The Respondent criticizes that the Claimants have

assumed a 50:1 “oversubscription ratio” which, the Respondent submits, is too high given that in
2009 the TRAIT issued guidelines limiting the oversubscription ratio for enterprise customers to
30:1 in order to ensure a higher service quality.'®* The Respondent notes that Devas’ expert in the
ICC Arbitration adjusted the oversubscription ratio in the Darwin Model to follow TRAI’s

guidance, while the Claimants have not done so.'®

According to the Respondent, if the 30:1 ratio were applied to Devas’ enterprise customers
following the TRAI guidance, “the costs in the Devas model would have to be adjusted upward,
having another significant negative impact on net present value.”!® Furthermore, the Respondent

underscores that the prices used by the Claimants’ experts

are actually 69% higher than the prices Devas had in its own model. If one were to use the
30 to 1 oversubscription ratio together with the prices in the Devas model and leave all of
Claimants’ other untenable assumptions intact, the Devas business would have a net present
value of negative US$104.5 million. '* [footnotes omitted]

In contrast, the Claimants are of the view that, “even assuming that the Indian regulator would
enforce uneconomic oversubscription factors on all operators,” the costs which Devas would have
had to incur to meet a 30:1 oversubscription ratio for enterprise users “would have been wholly
mitigated by a moderate 6.6% increase in prices to those enterprise users, which appears more
than achievable because quality would increase as well.”!® According to the Claimants, even if
Devas were to raise its prices by 9.1% or 9.2% to offset such additional costs, its business would
still be competitive, as it could command a higher price.'”°

The Respondent disputes the assertion that the Claimants could have avoided this issue merely

by increasing their prices and without any adverse market consequences. !7!

3. Regulatory Risks

The Parties disagree as to whether Devas would have obtained the necessary licenses to actually

provide all the BWA and AV services which it envisaged to develop.

a. Obtainment of WPC License for Terrestrial Re-use of Spectrum

The Claimants note that Devas had received Internet Service Provider (“ISP”) and Internet
Protocol Television (“IPTV”) licenses which enabled it to roll-out satellite-only line of sight
services without the need of obtaining any further licenses.'”* The Claimants underscore that the
Tribunal found in the Award on Jurisdiction and Merits that Devas had a right to deliver line of
sight services without requiring any further license from the WPC and stress that “this is res
judicata in these proceedings. It is thus inappropriate, and legally irrelevant, for India to try to re-
open the debate on this subject.”!*

However, the Claimants acknowledge that for Devas to have been able to deliver the full suite of
BWA and AV services envisaged in its most recent business model, “it would have required a
WPC operating license authorizing it to re-use its satellite spectrum terrestrially.”!* The

Claimants affirm that they demonstrated during the merits hearing that

Devas had finalized a draft WPC application for its AV/BWA business with the input of
high-level Antrix/ISRO representatives and was prepared to submit the application as soon
as it received a firm launch date from ISRO, a prerequisite for submission.'75

The Claimants refer to the Tribunal’s holding in the Award on Jurisdiction and Merits that
“because of problems of interference, [it] would not have been possible for competing services to

operate in the same spectrum,”!”

as the spectrum was allocated to Devas. The Claimants interpret
this finding as recognition that Devas possessed a “box-out” position with respect to its spectrum

that prevented any other commercial operator from using it.!”’ Furthermore, they affirm that this

finding is res judicata, so the Respondent’s efforts to re-open the debate in this regard are

inappropriate.'”8

The Claimants point out that a similar finding by the tribunal in the ICC Arbitration (the “ICC
Tribunal’) led that tribunal to conclude that this situation, which prevented the auctioning of the
spectrum, incentivized any regulator to reach an agreement with Devas on reasonable licensing

fees.!”

They also assert that these circumstances have led authorities, in every other jurisdiction where
this issue has emerged, to deal exclusively with the holder of satellite spectrum.'* In this context,
they submit that Devas had every reason to expect, and India every reason to grant, a full terrestrial
re-use license allowing Devas to provide AV and BWA services throughout India at a reasonable

fee, 181

Moreover, the Claimants point out that in 2009 India granted Devas all necessary licenses to
develop experimental trials to conduct a full AV/BWA Business with terrestrial re-use, including
not only the experimental license'*? but also a license to import wireless transmitting and
receiving apparatus into India,'*’ an extension of the original experimental license, '* and various

siting clearances for AV/BWA towers.'*

In this regard, the Claimants sustain that “no rational
government would have lent its own time and resources to a trial program if (as it now claims)

the system was never going to be and, indeed, could not be, approved.” !*°

Furthermore, they consider that with ISRO/Antrix’s help, to which Devas was contractually
entitled, “it was reasonable to believe that such authorization would be forthcoming.” '*’ They
also point out that the Devas Agreement envisaged the establishment of a hybrid satellite-

terrestrial communications system and, accordingly:

From the outset, DOS/ISRO, therefore, at all times knew that, at the appropriate time, they
would be contractually obligated to support an application by Devas for frequency
authorization to operate the terrestrial component (...) It further follows that DOS was not
aware of any actual prohibition on the use of the terrestrial component of the system in S-
band spectrum (...) (otherwise, DOS would have had no reason to embark on this venture in
the first place). '**

 

The Claimants rely on several documents put forward by the Respondent to support their claim
about the likelihood of terrestrial re-use authorization. Firstly, the Claimants argue that the letter
from Dr. Radhakrishan to the Law Ministry asking advice “on whether [the] ANTRIX-Devas
contract need[s to] be annulled (...) to ensure a level playing field for the other service providers
using terrestrial spectrum”'*® belies India’s case that Devas could have never received a license
for BWA services. There would have been no need to question whether the Devas Agreement
needed to be annulled to preserve the level playing field in the area of BWA terrestrial services,
if Devas could not be a player in that area in the first place.'°°

Second, the Claimants also contend that the two letters from the Indian Department of
Telecommunications (“DOT”) to the Indian Department of Space (“DOS”) of July 6 , 2010 and
of July 28, 2010,'°! on which the Respondent places great reliance, “are not competent evidence”

of how Indian regulators would have acted in a “but for” scenario, as they “were written in

response to a June 16, 2010 letter from Dr. Radhakrishnan’’'”’ in which he was “seeking advice

99193

concerning the annulment [of] the Devas Agreement.”'”* Accordingly, the Claimants argue that

given that the primary motivation of DOT appears to have been to aid Dr. Radhakrishnan in
his effort to annul the Devas Agreement (a process that was deemed unlawful by this
Tribunal), these letters should be excluded from any consideration of the value of the
spectrum that was lost as a consequence. !**

 

The Respondent, on the other hand, argues that the Secretary of the DOT and the Wireless Advisor
did not take any position on the question of the annulment of the Devas Agreement in their
letters.!°° Rather, they only expressed their “firm views” that if the spectrum were to be used
terrestrially for commercial services and such use were to be granted to Devas, “Devas would be
required to pay a spectrum charge commensurate with the amounts paid in the 2010 auction of
BWA spectrum.”!*° The Respondent criticizes as baseless the Claimants’ argument that these
communications should be disregarded in a “but for” scenario'”’ (see below, “India’s Level

Playing Field Policy”).

In any event, the Claimants contend that the above-referenced letters actually undermine India’s
position. In the Claimants’ view, “they do not reflect a genuine ‘level playing field’ analysis; they
take no account of Devas’s incumbency, and they rely on a false ‘auction’ paradigm that could
never have applied to the satellite spectrum already allocated to Devas.”'°* The Claimants’
position is that such letters overlook the “significant difference” between an authorization to re-
use spectrum and the granting of spectrum, as noted by the Indian Supreme Court in Centre for
Public Interest Litigation v. Union of India et al.'°* In particular, the Claimants argue that the July

28, 2010 letter actually undercuts the Respondent's position because the letter “[b]y its own terms

(...) contemplates authorizing Devas’s use of terrestrial components in the S-band for BWA

services: the only issue the letter raises is price.”?”

The Claimants also rely on the 2005 TRAI Recommendations which, they consider, “explicitly
encouraged such re-use [of the satellite spectrum terrestrially].””"! The Claimants note that the

TRAI recommended that

the licenses to be granted to potential satellite radio service providers should allow for the
evolution of services from the initial simple, audio/data broadcasting to include video,
internet applications and other advanced services. Such a licensing regime will encourage
free growth of new applications and services which could be exploited due to the
technological developments in the field of broadcasting and telecommunication. This
licensing approach will also lead to flexible and efficient utilization of resources including
scarce radio frequency spectrum.2°2

  

In the Claimants’ view, to the extent that

the terrestrial component of the satellite AV services already had been considered and
approved by TRAI as part of its regular process and recommendations, the WPC could not
legitimately have declined an application by Devas to provide AV services using CGC,
particularly since Devas was always willing to pay the fees set out in the 2005 TRAIT
Recommendations.”

According to the Claimants, “Indian telecom regulations are informed by international practices.
TRAI looked to international practices in issuing 2005 TRAI recommendations.” The
Claimants also set forth the argument that Indian telecommunications policy requires that
spectrum be put to its highest and best use and such policy has to adapt to keep pace with
technological change.”° Therefore, “under its own constitution and statutes, India is not permitted
to arbitrarily deny Devas an authorization to re-use its satellite spectrum terrestrially.”?°°

Claimants’ view, the fact that the WPC did not give a negative answer to DT’s approach for
comfort, but “was noncommittal either way,” evidences that the licensing hurdles put forward by

the Respondent are a “litigation invention.”

b. Unlikelihood of Award of Terrestrial Re-use License

The Respondent underscores that for Devas to be able to provide its intended services, it would
have required a license from the WPC for which it had not even applied and which the
Government had no obligation to grant.” In the Respondent’s submission, “[t]here’s no
stabilisation clause or anything guaranteeing [Devas] that a certain policy has to be adopted or
that spectrum charges should be to their liking.”?!° Devas’ investors were fully aware of the risk

that such licenses might not be awarded.”!! The Respondent points out:

DT (...) actually undertook due diligence with regard to the spectrum issues. DT invested in
Devas knowing that there was uncertainty as to whether the required licenses to roll out the
Devas services would be granted.?!?

The Respondent further affirms that Mr. Larsen’s Witness Statement does not reflect the
substance of his testimony in the arbitration brought forth by DT. Mr. Larsen, whose testimony
has been submitted by the Claimants, is Senior Vice President within the Group Technology
Department of DT in Bonn (“Mr. Larsen”). According to the Respondent, inter alia, he does not

inform the Tribunal that

DT approached WPC as part of its due diligence in order to get comfort on the licensing
issue, and the WPC did not provide the desired comfort; and that DT then requested Devas
to obtain comfort from the WPC in writing, but Devas never obtained that comfort and did
not even want to approach the authorities at that stage.?'>

Furthermore, the Respondent submits that Devas “flatly misrepresented the legal (...) position to
DT during the negotiations, telling DT that it had (...) all the necessary approvals for the full suite

of contemplated services.”

The Respondent also contests the Claimants’ assertion that they could not apply for a license until

a firm satellite launch date was obtained?’ and notes:

It was obviously the strategy of Devas and its shareholders to wait to make an application for
an operating license for Devas’ hybrid system until the satellite was launched (...) hoping
that with the launch the Government would change its policy regarding the use to which the
S-band spectrum could be put and ignore its level playing field policy.?"°

In any event, Devas’ license application would have had to be reviewed by the Apex

Committee,?"”

which, according to the Respondent, “would reject the application because the
services Devas intended to offer were not covered by an extant licensing and spectrum regime.”?!8
The Respondent maintains that “the Government’s contemporaneous view [was] that terrestrial
transmissions were not permitted in the portions of S-band in which Devas hoped to operate a

terrestrial business.”?!

Accordingly, the Respondent argues that there was a substantial risk that the necessary licenses
would not be granted and Devas’ proposed services could never be provided, rendering the
proposed business valueless.””° In the Respondent’s view, the Claimants have not satisfied their
burden of proving that the necessary licenses would have been granted,””! and rely on the Bear

services had never been previously authorised: “the S-band spectrum at issue has never been
designated for terrestrial use in India (...) its use terrestrially would not have been permitted in
the absence of a change in policy.”?74
Regarding the alleged “box-out” position held by Devas, the Respondent concedes that another
operator could not use the same spectrum at the same time in the same location as Devas.”°
However, the Respondent asserts that it was not excluded that spectrum in close proximity to the
frequency range used by Devas could be used by a competitor as long as there was sufficient
guard band.”*° According to the Respondent, - the “so-called box-out theory (...) is bogus as a
technical matter.””’ In any event, the Respondent argues that if there were anything behind such
theory, as explained by Ms. Revathi, “the WPC would have regulated to address it (...) there was
(...) no stabilisation clause (...) nothing that would immunize Devas from such legitimate
governmental action.”?”
The Respondent argues that the Claimants have no legitimate basis to rely on the 2005 TRAI
Recommendations applicable to satellite radio in the changed technological and regulatory
environment of 2010-2011.” In support of this position the Respondent relies on Mr. M.
Bhagirath’s testimony (Senior Deputy Wireless Advisor to the Government of India in the
Wireless Planning & Coordination Wing, hereafter “Mr. Bhagirath”). Mr. Bhagirath considers

that the 2005 TRAI Recommendations have no significance given that they

pre-dated its recommendations in 2007 and 2008 relating to auction (...) The 2005
recommendations, relating to a different service, were issued prior to the time that the value
of spectrum was fully appreciated and would have had no effect on the amount that would
have been imposed in 2011 for the use of the spectrum in S-band, which had not been
designated for terrestrial use and which would have been subject to a separate TRAI

Furthermore, the Respondent also refers to a decision by the Supreme Court of India which found

as follows;

[T]echnological developments in telecommunications are taking place at an abnormal pace.
Various policy decisions taken at one point of time may, therefore, require a relook (...)
circumstances may even mandate change of existing policy altogether.?*!

The Respondent further notes that the Claimants themselves have relied on this same decision of
the Supreme Court. However, the Respondent contests the Claimants’ view that the decision of
the Supreme Court would support their argument to the effect that, if a new complementary
ground component (“CGC”) is introduced by an incumbent operator due to technological
evolution, the government must grant an authorization at a reasonable fee.”*? The Respondent

argues that, under Indian law, the Government has

the exclusive privilege to establish, maintain and work the telegraphs (...) and has the right
to grant licenses to others “on such conditions and in consideration of such payments as it
thinks fit.”?9

The Claimants, on the other hand, criticize that Mr. Bagirath cites no support for his position that
the 2005 TRAI Recommendations had been superseded or repealed.?** The Claimants affirm that
he

does not identify with any specificity, which 2007 recommendations or 2008

government think that they should be binned, because now we have the 2007 and 2008.”*° The

Claimants also note that Mr. Bhagirath said in cross-examination that “he had not seen any
document confirming that the 2005 recommendations had indeed not been accepted.”?*”

Furthermore, the Claimants note that the characterization of the 2008 TRAI Recommendations as

a “value-destroying” event was rejected by the ICC Tribunal.?** The Claimants submit that the

ICC Tribunal found that such Recommendations “only applied to the S-band allocated to DOT

for terrestrial use. They did not apply to satellite spectrum allocated to the Department of Space

for satellite use.”?

The Respondent contends that if the Government had authorised the terrestrial use of the
spectrum, it would have regulated it in a manner consistent with its level playing field policy.”
It would thus have made sure that Devas could have used spectrum for transmitting satellite
signals without interference, while allowing the same spectrum to be used terrestrially in other

regions where Devas operated with different satellite spectrum.™*!

4. Applicable License Fees

On the assumption that Devas would have to operate with a reduced spectrum, and on the further
assumption that Devas would be granted by the relevant authorities the necessary licenses to
provide all services that it intended to provide, the Parties disagree as to the amount of the fees

that would have been levied.

a. Establishment of a “Reasonable” Fee

Concerning AV services, the Claimants affirm that the TRAI had already addressed in June 2005
the question of the issuance of a terrestrial repeater license and suggested that such license should

242

be provided to satellite operators for a fee of 4% of gross revenue.*** Therefore, the Claimants

consider that the ““WPC, acting fairly and rationally, as it must be assumed to act in a “but-for”

world, would have permitted Devas to operate an AV satellite with repeaters business.”

Concerning BWA services, the Claimants endorse Mr. Bazelon’s view that “Devas should have
obtained a full re-use license enabling it to provide full BWA services at a reasonable fee, and
certainly substantially less than fees paid at auction for unencumbered spectrum.” In support

of their position, the Claimants rely on a recent judgment by the Supreme Court of India, in Centre

for Public Interest Litigation v. Union of India,** which provided:

[T]he issuance of licenses is different from the granting of spectrum, and that the (...) fee
paid for Infotel for authorization to provide new services was not inadequate as Infotel had
already been allocated spectrum and was not looking for more spectrum in order to provide
these additional services.”4°

Similarly, according to the Claimants, Devas had already been allocated spectrum under the
Devas Agreement and also had obtained an ISP license to provide certain services. Thus, the

Claimants contend:

If anything, Devas (like Infotel) required an additional authorization from the WPC to re-use
its allocated satellite spectrum terrestrially to provide additional services, in its case BWA
services. Just as Infotel received permission to provide mobile voice telephony services by
the payment of an incremental license fee, Devas equally should have received permission
for terrestrial re-use to provide BWA services (...) To suggest that Devas would have been
required to pay auction-level prices for this additional WPC authorization to use its already-
allocated spectrum is unsupportable.”“”

According to the Claimants, in a “but for” world the letter by the Secretary of the DOT of July 6,
2010 and the letter by the Wireless Advisor to the Government of July 28, 2010 concerning the
application of prices commensurate with auction rates should be disregarded because they were
produced “‘in direct response to Dr. Radhakrishans’s request for advice on the “annulment” of the
Devas Agreement, and thus are not competent evidence of how a regulator, acting reasonably and
fairly (and not animated by an annulment agenda) would have acted.”™“* The Claimants endorse

Mr. Bazelon’s position that “the rationalizations in those letters for charging “auction” rates do

not, as an economic matter, make sense when applied to Devas, which already was the incumbent

in that S-band spectrum.””°

Furthermore, the Claimants consider that the Respondent cannot construct its but-for scenario on

250

the assumption that it would have committed additional Treaty violations,~® which is the case

here, as the Respondent's position to the effect that

the Indian government was at liberty (through the WPC) to levy a fee that effectively
prohibited Devas from operating a business (...) surely would have given rise to further BIT
violations, either on the basis that the purported “fee” amounted to a confiscatory measure in
violation of Article 6, or that it constituted a breach of the FET or MFN provisions in
Article 4.75!

The Claimants note that their experts have based their calculations of Devas’ fair market value on
the assumption that Devas would have been charged an annual Terrestrial Re-Use Fee
commensurate with the highest internationally reported terrestrial fee applied in the world in 2011
(which is the fee applied in Slovenia),”” the application of which to the case would result in an

annual fee of USD 361.7 million in the Reduced Spectrum Scenario.”*?

The Respondent’s expert, Mr. Flores, Managing Director of Econ One Research Inc. (“Mr.
Flores”), disputes the selection of Slovenia’s fees as the highest internationally observable fee
and proposes the fee of Italy as a benchmark.?*4 While such fee is still not indicative of what India
would have charged (see below), Mr. Flores considers the selection of Slovenia’s fee incorrect

and claims that Italy’s fee is more appropriate as it applies “‘[i]f CGCs constitute an independent

terrestrial network,’ as in the case of Devas.”** [footnotes omitted] The application of Italy’s fee

to this case would result in a drop of Devas’ valuation from USD 1,495 million to USD 941

million, all else being equal.?*°

Nonetheless, the Claimants point out that Mr. Flores does not specify which fee was finally agreed

with the Italian authorities and contend that “the limited publicly-available data” suggests that it

differs from the “proposed” fee discussed above.”*” Accordingly, they argue that Slovenia’s fee

remains the “highest actualized and evidenced fee.”***

b. India’s Level Playing Field Policy

The Respondent contends that “even if Devas would have obtained the requisite licenses, which
is highly unlikely on the record of this case, the spectrum charges it would have had to pay would
have rendered the proposed Devas business economically non-viable.”° According to the
Respondent, the evidence demonstrates that India would have applied its level playing field
policy, which would involve charging Devas a spectrum fee commensurate with auction prices.”

The Respondent points to the testimony of “senior Indian regulators” introduced by the

261

Respondent,’ whom the Respondent characterizes as “the senior government officials

responsible for administering these regulations and implementing the policy on a daily basis.”
Likewise, the Respondent relies on “contemporaneous documents,” in particular a letter from the
Secretary of the DOT of July 6, 2010 and a letter from the Wireless Advisor to the Government
of July 28, 2010, “which express the firm views that if the spectrum were to be used terrestrially
for commercial services and use such were to be granted to Devas, Devas would be required to
pay a spectrum charge commensurate with the amounts paid in the 2010 auction of BWA

spectrum.”265

According to the Respondent, “the level playing field policy was so essential to the regulatory

structure that it would never be cast aside in the manner hypothesised by Claimants.”

The Respondent refuses the Claimants’ assertion that the Chorzéw Factory principle requires
disregarding such letters in a “but-for” world. First, the Respondent considers that the principle
is irrelevant to the case as the Tribunal determined in the Award on Jurisdiction and Merits that
the Claimants are entitled to compensation under Article 6 of the Treaty, not on any other basis.
In any event, even assuming its relevance, the Respondent claims that Chorzéw Factory “does
not dictate that the policies of India should be ignored.”

The Respondent also addresses the Claimants’ contention that applying a level playing field
policy would result in further Treaty violations by pointing out that “the precedents are unanimous
that such policy decisions do not constitute treaty breaches (...) it is not the function of an arbitral
tribunal to make policy for India.”?°”

The Respondent argues that the Claimants stretch Chorzéw Factory beyond recognition because,
if the fee on which they have based their calculations (the equivalent to the one used in Slovenia)
were replaced by an amount equivalent to auction prices following India’s level playing field
policy, the value of Devas’ business under their own modelling assumptions would be negative.7

The Respondent notes:

The upfront spectrum charge for the use of 25.2 MHz of S-band spectrum based on the price
obtained in the June 2010 auction of BWA spectrum in the 2300-2400 GHz band would be
US$ 3.428 billion.”

The Respondent contends that, “even at the ridiculously low 10.3% discount rate Claimants’
experts have used (...) the value that would result from that substitution would be negative

US$ 741 million, without making any other adjustments to Claimants’ cash flows.”?”°

In the Respondent’s view, the reason why the Claimants have assumed that this policy, which is
at the heart of the Indian regulatory regime, would not be applicable to Devas in a “but-for” world,

is that Devas could not compete on a level playing field.?”!

In response to these views, the Claimants maintain that the Respondent’s argument that Devas

mm

would never have received authorization for the terrestrial component of its system is invalid.

According to the Claimants, the Respondent “points only to a hodgepodge of things as ‘evidence’

9273

of this policy,”*”* and none of the documents relied on by the Respondent “actually addresses the

position of a satellite operator seeking to re-use terrestrially satellite spectrum to which it already

has access.”?”4

In the Claimants’ view, the “level playing field” theory has a “key flaw” in that “it falsely treats
a satellite operator who already has spectrum rights as an entry-level BWA ‘player’ who has no
rights at all unless it wins those rights at auction.”?”°

Accordingly, they consider that the Respondent’s argument that any spectrum fees would be

commensurate to auction pricing

does not withstand objective scrutiny because it fails to take into account: (a) the significant
policy differences between the re-use of satellite spectrum and the auctioning of terrestrial
spectrum; (b) the fact that, far from being a new entrant, Devas was the S-band spectrum
incumbent (...) by virtue of the “box-out” position held by Devas, there was no terrestrial
competitor capable of bidding for spectrum (thus making the auction paradigm irrelevant).?”°

5. Viability of an “AV Services-Only Business” in the Reduced Spectrum Scenario

On the assumption that Devas would have to operate with a reduced spectrum, the Parties also

address the possibility that Devas would only be able to provide AV services. As the following

paragraphs set out, the Parties disagree as to what would be the value of Devas in such

circumstances.

The Claimants assert that even in default of obtainment of a WPC License for BWA services (i.e.
if WPC refused to grant the license or put forward an unreasonable fee), Devas could still provide
AV services, as they could be delivered directly from the satellite in areas with a clear line of
sight and “through the use of a Complementary Ground Component (‘CGC’) in areas where a
direct line of sight to the satellites was unavailable” (i.e. using terrestrial towers to repeat the

signal on the ground).”””

The Claimants contend that, given the specific provisions of the 2005 TRAI recommendations,

India’s claim that the WPC would have rejected an application by Devas to use CGC as part

of its AV-only business is disingenuous — particularly given that its witnesses elsewhere
dge that TRAIs play a si role in the tel i

arena in India.?”8

 

In this scenario, Devas would have followed a different tower network configuration to optimize
its AV services.?” Mr. Bazelon indicates that such network would be built more efficiently as
Devas would use higher towers that would cover a wider area, thereby reducing the number of

towers and associated costs, without creating any interferences with the BWA network.?*°

The Claimants affirm that the Respondent’s expert, Mr. Flores, “fails to supply any proper basis
for disregarding Brattle’s independent valuation of an AV-only business as being worth USD 434
million.”**!

In contrast, the Respondent argues that “an AV-only business would require a separate licence

99282

from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting”*’ and notes that “no such service has ever

been licenced in India.”***

Mr. Flores suggests in his second expert report that there would be three possible regulatory

scenarios in an AV-only business. Namely, (i) that Devas would be only permitted to transmit

over a satellite (“satellite-only” scenario), (ii) that Devas would be permitted to use a terrestrial
network as a gap filler in areas with line-of-sight issues (i.e. urban areas) but only to broadcast
the same content that was broadcast over the satellites (the “gap-filler” scenario); and (iii) that
Devas could broadcast extra content over its terrestrial network (the “extra-content” scenario).**
Mr. Flores points out that the Claimants do not engage with scenarios (i) and (ii) supposedly
because they would lead to a negative valuation, but rather only engage with the third possible
regulatory scenario, although that scenario would be inconsistent with regulatory policy in
India.”** In contrast, the Claimants argue that their account of the AV-only business “assumes
that only content that was available on the satellite would be re-transmitted through its terrestrial
repeaters; no ‘new’ (i.e. not carried on the satellite) content would have been transmitted through

its repeaters.” 28°

In any event, Mr. Flores argues that, even assuming that terrestrial use of the spectrum were
authorised, the 2005 TRAI recommendations only support, at most, the gap filler scenario.’ Mr.
Flores refers to his First Report, where he showed that under a gap filler scenario which aligns
with the 2005 TRAI recommendations “Brattle’s FMV of Devas’ AV-only business of US$ 434.3
million would become negative, all else being equal.”*** [emphasis in original] The Respondent

underscores that “[t]here is no commercial satellite to mobile AV business anywhere’ in the

compensation based on the purported AV-only business.”?°°

1. Spectrum Entitlement and Division

323. The Parties address Devas’ spectrum entitlement on the assumption that Devas would have to

operate with the same spectrum as originally envisaged in the Devas Agreement.

324. The Claimants’ expert, Mr. Bazelon, in his third expert report issued in response to the Tribunal’s
request to the Parties of November 13, 2017 to address an alternative valuation approach,

addresses Devas’ spectrum entitlement and its use in the Original Spectrum Scenario as follows:

With the full 70 MHz of spectrum available, Devas’s planned AV services would be
delivered nationally via satellite broadcast, and supported by a network of terrestrial towers
in urban areas while Devas’s planned BWA services would be offered in urban areas over a
terrestrial BWA network using the same satellite spectrum that had been allocated to Devas
under the Devas Agreement.

325. Mr. Bazelon incorporates by reference in his third report his analysis of the key market

developments which purportedly made Devas’ proposed BWA business “highly attractive”??? in

the Indian market as of the valuation date;

 

4G networks, like Devas’s planned BWA network, are capable of providing high throughput
and download speeds in ways 2G and 3G networks cannot, so this smartphone-related
demand radically increased the demand for, and value of, 4G (i.e. BWA) spectrum (...) So
as of at least early 2011 there was a strong expectation of high and growing demand for 4G
services in the coming years with a single private nationwide competitor for Devas (...) By
2010 the view that, eventually, every cellphone user would have a smartphone and demand
lots of bandwidth had moved from a potential future to reality (...) In India, the number of
mobile subscribers grew from 99 million voice subscribers by year end 2007 to 584 million
by year end 2010.7 [footnotes omitted]

326. Mr. Bazelon also regards as equally applicable to the Original Spectrum Scenario his analysis of
the technological progress achieved by Devas, which by 2011 had achieved several important

technological milestones.”

327. Mr. Bazelon claims that in addition to AV and BWA services, Devas also planned to provide
additional societal services under the Original Spectrum Scenario including emergency

communications, disaster warning, transportation and logistics services.?°>

The Respondent and its expert do not explicitly address this issue in their supplemental

submis

 

‘ions or expert reports.
2. Technical Risks

On the assumption that Devas would have to operate with the same spectrum as originally
envisaged in the Devas Agreement, the Parties discuss certain main features of Devas’ business
configuration, including the appropriate technology arrangements and satellite launch dates in

these circumstances.

a. Technology in Devas’ Business Plan

Mr. Bazelon notes in his third report that his overview of Devas’ original business plan in his first
report applies equally to the Original Spectrum Scenario.” The main aspects of Devas’ original

business plan are the following:

Devas would broadcast the AV content using ten downlink transponders and five spot beams
on two satellites in the downlink frequency bands, and have user communication to the
satellites through the MSS spectrum (...) Devas’s AV services would consist of basic (free-
to-air) channels and premium packages as well as pay-per view services (...) Devas’s original
plan was to use 20 MHz of spectrum to offer the AV broadcast service and use an additional
10 MHz as a “guard band.” This would allow it to utilize 20 MHz of the remaining BSS
spectrum for its BWA service (with an additional 10 MHz available) (...) Devas planned to
offer BWA services via a terrestrial network to fixed and mobile devices in cities with
populations greater than 200,000 people. As of 2009, Devas planned to offer differentiated
retail and enterprise plans (...) By at least 2010, Devas had determined it would roll out its
network using LTE from the outset.” [footnotes omitted]

 

 

Nonetheless, he points out that, while in the Reduced Spectrum Scenario “Devas would integrate
its planned urban AV and BWA segments into a single LTE network””* using eMBMS
technology, in the Original Spectrum Scenario this was merely a possibility. While this option
would allow a reduction in network costs, it would also involve a reduction in value due to the
necessary delay in AV services deployment and the payment of an additional terrestrial re-use fee
for 5 Mhz of spectrum. Accordingly, assuming that Devas would have been charged the highest

terrestrial re-use fee seen internationally, “the eMBMS integration is not as attractive a

proposition and my cash flow projections in the Original Spectrum Case assume that Devas would
not have proceeded with it.”?”

Similarly, Mr. Flores notes that, in contrast with the Reduced Spectrum Scenario in which the
Claimants’ experts assume that Devas would have relied on eMBMS technology, in the Original
Spectrum Scenario they assume that Devas would have delivered AV services over a separate
terrestrial DVB-SH network, which would require the original equipment contemplated in the
Darwin Model (increasing both OPEX and CAPEX in comparison with the Reduced Spectrum
Scenario).* The Darwin Model is a pre-dispute business plan made by Devas in the ordinary
course of business in 2009, which is being used by the Claimants’ experts in the present arbitration
as a basis for the development of their DCF valuation of Devas.*"!

Mr. Bazelon also notes that without spectrum constraints Devas could offer the full set of initially
envisaged AV services in rural areas too, such that it could have charged the originally planned
prices in rural areas (i.e. without a 50% price reduction commensurate to the limited AV services

available in those areas in the Reduced Spectrum Scenario).*”?

b. Satellite Launch Dates

Mr. Bazelon notes that the two satellites Devas would have used in the Original Spectrum

Scenario were nearly completed by mid-2010 and that he is

instructed to assume that the first satellite would have been launched on July 1, 2010 and that
the second satellite would have been launched six months later on January 2011. The lease
term under the Devas Agreement would, accordingly, start on July 1, 2010. Roll-out of the
AV terrestrial network would start in October 2010 in Devas Group 1 (Bangalore) (...) Devas
would not have had to reconfigure the satellite to accommodate the reduced spectrum and
therefore would not have delayed the launch date by one year, as assumed in the Reduced
Spectrum Case.*°* [footnotes omitted]

Furthermore, the Claimants argue that in the Original Spectrum Scenario “a postponement of the

launch date does not decrease value. In fact, it could add value.”*™

Mr. Flores criticizes as illogical the Claimants’ experts’ assumption that in the Original Spectrum
Scenario the satellites would have been launched in July 2010 (GSAT-6) and January 2011
(GSAT-6A), as opposed to the July 2011 launch date assumed in the Reduced Spectrum Scenario.
He contends that no investor would have made such an assumption as of the valuation date. One
cannot carry out an economic valuation as of February 2011 assuming the occurrence of events
in 2010 which everyone knows did not occur.*** However, such assumption by the Claimants
accelerates CAPEX, number of subscribers and roll-out of AV services, which the Claimants’
experts assume to be available in urban areas from October 2010 instead of January 2012 (as they
assume in the Reduced Spectrum Scenario).*° On the other hand, he notes that the launch of two

satellites instead of one results in higher satellite costs.*””

3. Regulatory Risks

The Parties are in disagreement as to the likelihood that Devas would obtain from the relevant
Indian authorities all the licenses required to provide the services envisaged by Devas, as already

noted above in respect of the Reduced Spectrum Scenario.

Mr. Bazelon opines that being in a “box-out” position, Devas would have reasonably expected to
receive authorization for terrestrial re-use of spectrum.*** He points out that he was instructed to
calculate the terrestrial re-use fee on the basis of the highest internationally observable fee.” In

the Original Spectrum Scenario,

Devas would have had available 30 MHz for its BWA network. Under the high Terrestrial
Re-Use Fee I was instructed to apply, I assume that Devas would use only 20 MHz of
spectrum for BWA services and leave the additional 10 MHz available as an option for future
capacity expansion. This is a conservative assumption because, as I noted, Devas and the
WPC would be rationally expected to reach an agreement on a reasonable fee that would
allow such spectrum to be put to its highest and best use.*!”

Mr. Flores notes that the Claimants’ experts affirm that in the Original Spectrum Scenario Devas
would pay a terrestrial spectrum re-use fee of USD 289.4 million (commensurate with the fee
applied in Slovenia) for a 20 Mhz LTE channel, but Devas would not need an additional 5 Mhz
LTE channel as would have been required in the Reduced Spectrum Scenario.*!! This implies that
the terrestrial spectrum fees would be lower in a scenario where Devas would have had 63 Mhz

of spectrum available than in a scenario where Devas only had 25 Mhz of spectrum available.

Mr. Flores also notes that Devas’ expert in the ICC Arbitration assumed payment of fees for the
full 70 Mhz of spectrum and that, if this approach had been followed here and the spectrum fees
be updated to account for 70 Mhz of available spectrum, the Claimants’ experts’ valuation of

Devas would be negative USD 428.9 million, all else being equal.*!”

4. Applicable License Fees

On the assumption that Devas would have to operate with the same spectrum as originally
envisaged in the Devas Agreement, and on the further assumption that Devas would be granted
by the relevant authorities the necessary licenses to provide the services which it intended to
provide, the Parties are in disagreement as to the amount of the fees which would have been

levied.

Mr. Bazelon calculates the applicable terrestrial re-use fee on 20 Mhz of spectrum on the basis of
the highest internationally observable fee and obtains a fee amounting to USD 298.4 million per

313

year.*!* He points out:

[S]ince in the Original Spectrum Case the terrestrial AV retransmissions do not use the BWA.
network, the fee applied to the BWA spectrum in the Reduced Spectrum Case would not be
appropriate in the Original Spectrum Case. Instead, recognizing that the TRAI recommended
a fee for AV repeaters of 4% of AGR and that I already model Devas paying 6% of AGR, I
did not include any fee for the AV portion of the terrestrial network.*!4

On the other hand, Mr. Flores claims that, if terrestrial spectrum re-use fees were calculated using
an upfront fee commensurate with the 2010 BWA auction results, as according to Indian

regulators would have been the case following Indian policy, whether for 20 or for 25 MHz, the

Claimants’ experts’ DCF valuation of Devas would turn negative, even maintaining all other

assumptions.*!°

5. Viability of an “AV Services-Only Business” in the Original Spectrum Scenario

On the assumption that Devas would have to operate with the same spectrum as originally
envisaged in the Devas Agreement, the Parties also engage with the possibility that Devas would
only be able to provide AV services. The Parties are in disagreement as to the value of Devas in

such circumstances.

The Claimants contend that, given that the 2005 TRAI Recommendations specifically
contemplated such business and encouraged it, no licensing problem would arise.*!° Mr. Bazelon
calculates the value of an AV-only business under the Original Spectrum Scenario assuming that
“Devas would have been allowed to re-use the satellite spectrum terrestrially to offer audio and
video services but not to offer BWA services.””*"” In this case, Devas would have built the same
network of terrestrial towers as he described for an AV-only business under the Reduced
Spectrum Scenario.*!* However, Devas would have used two satellites, so his calculation includes

upfront capacity reservation fees and lease fees for both satellites.*!°

Mr. Bazelon underscores that in the Original Spectrum Scenario Devas would have been able to
deliver its AV services as originally planned, so he does not assume a 50% reduction in revenues
from rural areas.*”° Moreover, he also assumes that AV services would have been rolled out earlier

in this scenario.™!

On the other hand, as pointed out above in the discussion of the Reduced Spectrum Scenario, the

Respondent argues that “an AV-only business would require a separate licence from the Ministry

99322

of Information and Broadcasting and notes that “no such service has ever been licenced in

India.”*

Mr. Flores notes that the AV-only business would consist of AV services delivered directly from
the satellite and, if terrestrial repeating were authorized, a terrestrial DVB-SH network. In the
Original Spectrum Scenario Devas would not have faced a 50% reduction in the number of
channels available in rural areas and the corresponding decrease in price. Accordingly, the pricing

for the AV plans put forward by the Claimants’ experts’ model matches the Darwin Model.*?>

99326 5

Mr. Flores identifies “a number of flaws”**° in the Claimants’ DCF projections of Devas’ AV-

only business in this scenario, including:

an inappropriate terrestrial spectrum fee, roof rental costs, tower height, and the premature
rollout of AV services. In addition, Devas’ AV-only business would still face a number of
issues, including uncertainty over obtaining authorization for a terrestrial repeater network,
competition from other TV providers, and a lack of marketability.22”

  

Mr. Flores recalls his previous reports to the effect that, should Devas not obtain an authorization
of terrestrial use of spectrum (“‘satellite-only scenario”), only customers with a direct line-of-sight
to the satellite (i.e. in rural areas) would have been able to access its services. In his assessment,
a satellite-only business is valueless. Even if Devas were given authorization for terrestrial re-use
of spectrum, it would still have to face competition from both DTH and mobile TV operators
providing services over BWA networks, and the use of a commercially unproven and
unsuccessful technology, namely DVB-SH (...) Devas would also have been at a severe

competitive disadvantage due to the lack of playback and on-demand services.**

Mr. Flores claims that addressing such challenges would be particularly difficult for Devas
because (i) the quality of the broadcast from the satellites would remain static for the 12-year lives
of the satellites, and (ii) as LTE networks are more widely used than DVB-SH networks, one
would expect the latter to evolve more slowly.*”° He points out that no company in the world had
successfully commercialized a DVB-SH-based mobile TV service and contends that Devas’ AV-
only business lacks viability.**° As noted above, the Respondent relies on the inexistence of any

39331

successful “commercial satellite to mobile AV business anywhere’’**! in the world to conclude

that “there is no basis whatsoever for any compensation based on the purported AV-only

business.”**

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

The Tribunal is not retaining the Reduced Spectrum Scenario for the purpose of valuation of
damages in this case. The Respondent, in February 2011, did take over 100% of Devas and, in its
Award on Jurisdiction and Merits, the Tribunal by majority concluded that only 40% of the value
of Devas was subject to compensation. A willing buyer,** just before the Respondent ’s decision
to takeover Devas, would have first determined the value of 100% of Devas as a whole and then
decided how much it was ready to pay for the shares held by the Claimants, which were their only

investment.

The Tribunal’s task therefore is to determine the value that a willing buyer would have been ready
to pay, just before the CCS decision of February 17, 2011, for the shares in Devas held by the
Claimants who, together holding 37.6% of Devas’ shares, had effective control of that company
and then to retain 40% of that value as subject to compensation in proportion to the Claimants’
shareholding in Devas. The Tribunal sees no reason why such a buyer at that time would have

limited himself to bidding for only 40% of the Claimants’ shares in Devas.

The Tribunal will now proceed to its analysis of the various issues raised by the Parties under the

Original Spectrum Scenario.

1. Spectrum Entitlement and Division

The Tribunal is satisfied that, subject to the issuance of the necessary licenses and but for the
February 17, 2011 CCS decision, Devas would have operated with the same spectrum as
originally envisaged in the Devas Agreement. The Tribunal is also satisfied that, subject to the
same conditions, Devas would have proceeded with both planned AV and BWA services as

described by Mr. Bazelon in his third report and summarized in paragraphs 325-327 above.

2. Technical Risks

The Tribunal notes that the Parties are in disagreement as to whether terrestrial re-use of the

spectrum would have been permitted by the Indian authorities (for further discussion on this issue,

see section on Regulatory Risks below). Nevertheless, the Tribunal also notes that the Parties’
respective experts agree that, in the Original Spectrum Scenario (and assuming that terrestrial re-
use of spectrum were permitted), Devas would have delivered AV services over a separate
terrestrial DVB-SH network and that this would require equipment contemplated in the Darwin

Model.

The Tribunal also agrees with Mr. Bazelon that, in a context without spectrum constraints, Devas
would have been in a position to offer the full set of initially planned services and prices in rural

areas.**°

a. Evolution of the Business Environment Between 2009 and 2011

The Tribunal notes that Mr. Bazelon did a series of updates to the Darwin Model to reflect relevant

technological developments and market changes.**° These updates notably relate to:

(a) Devas’ subscriber base projection, which was updated to reflect India’s population growth

projections on the basis of a 2011 census;
(b) Devas’ decision to roll out its network using LTE instead of WiMax by at least mid-2010;

(c) _ higher cell capacity and reduced network costs as a result of the implementation of a cell

site configuration made possible by the use of LTE technology;
(d) lower costs of LTE radio equipment than assumed in the Darwin Model;

(e) doubling the speed initially available under the retail BWA plans that Devas expected to
offer to customers (while maintaining the price), given the speed of BWA services offered

by competitors as of 2011;

(f) higher costs for Devas of acquiring content for AV services.**”

See Bazelon I {{ 26-30, incorporated by reference in Bazelon III { 8. See also, Bazelon III 13; Flores III

Mr. Bazelon also sought to account for hypothetical technological changes in the event of a Reduced
Spectrum allocation. However, these changes are not relevant for the Tribunal’s decision, which is based
on the Original Spectrum scenario. See Expert Report of Mr. Benjamin Sacks, dated January 16, 2017

Page 75 of 163

In the Tribunal’s view, however, a more comprehensive analysis is called for. In conducting a
valuation of the Claimants’ investment, the relevant perspective is that of a hypothetical
knowledgeable, willing, and unpressured buyer in February 2011, when that investment was lost.
The Tribunal has no doubt that such a buyer would have accorded considerable weight to the
analysis contained in the Darwin Model; it might well have prepared a modified DCF analysis of
its own based on that model. In addition, however, a knowledgeable, willing, and unpressured
buyer in February 2011 would have formed its own, independent view of the business outlooks
for Devas, and it would not have relied in that regard on Devas’ or DTs projections made back in

2008 and 2009.

i. Positive Market Development after 2008/2009

A hypothetical knowledgeable, willing, and unpressured buyer in February 2011 would have

noted a number of positive developments since 2009.

The most noteworthy of these factors is that DT was still a committed partner of Devas. It
followed through on its promise to contribute valuable expertise, manpower, contacts, and
goodwill. While the prospect of DT’s immaterial contributions would have been “priced in” when
Deutsche Telekom Asia (“DT Asia”) contributed capital in 2008 and 2009, it clearly would have

been reassuring for a buyer in 2011 to see that Devas could continue to count on DT’s support.

DT’s continued support would also seem to increase, in the eyes of a willing buyer in February
2011, the chances of Devas’ succeeding in adapting to new market needs or challenges, should it
turn out (as will be addressed in the following sub-section) that aspects of the original business

plan were unlikely to be adequate.

A willing buyer would also have noticed that Devas was able to meet certain important milestones
between 2009 and February 2011. For instance, in 2009, Devas obtained all necessary licenses
from the Indian authorities to develop its experimental trials so as to conduct a full AV/BWA

4° and various siting clearances for AV/BWA towers.*"! While the Tribunal

experimental license,
concurs with the Respondent that the grant of the trial license to Devas as such did not, under
Indian law, affect the need to obtain regulatory approvals for the future, definitive terrestrial re-

use of spectrum,*?

the Tribunal has no hesitation to find that a willing buyer would have seen the
trial license as a value-enhancing factor: it would have confirmed to it, first, that Devas was
actively and successfully developing applications for its technology and, second, that Devas was

capable of navigating the regulatory environment and build confidence with the Indian regulators.

Finally, a willing buyer in February 2011 would have felt encouraged by the enormous success
of smartphones and tablets, which by then had become apparent to industry professionals and
professional investors. Neither technology was in existence in 2005, when Devas tried to convince
venture capital firms of its business plan.*7 In 2008 and 2009, when the Darwin Model was
completed and DT Asia made its capital contributions, those technologies were in their early

infancy. As the Claimants’ expert points out:

Starting in mid-2008 the iPhone, and similar easy-to-use flat-screen mobile devices, known
as smartphones, rapidly and substantially increased the demand for high download speeds
and high throughput capacity on wireless networks. For example, in 2009, AT&T’s U.S.
network (then the exclusive network for iPhones in the United States) experienced severe
service problems due to a “tsunami” of demand for bandwidth that “no one was prepared
for” due to the iPhone. 4G networks, like Devas’s planned BWA network, are capable of
providing high throughput and download speeds in ways 2G and 3G networks cannot, so this
smartphone-related demand radically increased the demand for, and value of, 4G (i.e., BWA)
spectrum. #5

While in 2011 smartphones may not have been as widely available in India as in the United
States,** the Tribunal has no hesitation to conclude that the general environment for a technology
company in the communications sector, which had secured substantial satellite bandwidth for the

transmission of data for mobile BWA and AV services, was promising.

ii. Corresponding New Chall to Devas’ Technology Model

At the same time, the Tribunal acknowledges that a willing buyer analysing Devas’ prospects in
February 2011 would also have been conscious of technological developments in the area of

mobile technology that call Devas’ specific business model into question.

The Tribunal recalls that, in the Original Spectrum Scenario, Devas originally intended to rely on
a combination of DVB-SH technology and WiMAX technology, with the latter being eventually

347

replaced with the more advanced LTE standard;*”’ and it later envisaged a combination of DVB-

SH technology and LTE technology.** Yet, that technology model presented certain limitations.

As regards AV services, Devas’ reliance on DVB-SH technology would not have looked
particularly attractive to a willing buyer in 2011, as such technology was in fact not used in the
majority of smartphones.*” As a result, most smartphones would not have the capability of
capturing Devas’ AV signal directly. Rather, a separate receiver would be required to use Devas’
services. While these external receivers, to which the mobile telephone must be connected by

cable, also called “access ports,”**°

were relatively handy, the need for an external access port
would put Devas at a real disadvantage to competitor services offered by mobile telephone
companies that could be captured directly by a smartphone. The Tribunal considers that a willing
buyer in the telecommunications sector, in 2011, would have hesitated to invest in technology

using an external antenna for connectivity.**!

As regards BWA services, a willing buyer would have been conscious of the considerable
uncertainty in early-2011 surrounding the LTE technology that would be required to use Devas’
services. Mobile telephones featuring such technology were only beginning to be

352

commercialized, and that in markets other than India.** In fact, the cost of rolling out such

technology was regarded as so high that the cost of LTE devices in India was a limiting factor.**

Page 78 of 163

There was no certainty in early-2011 that, or when, LTE technology would be widely used in

India.

Perhaps more fundamentally, the Tribunal must be cognizant of the fact that Devas’ customers
would not have been able to use their Devas devices for placing and receiving regular telephone
calls. That is so because Devas had no license for mobile telephony.**+ Accordingly, Devas’
customers would not be assigned a telephone number in the Indian telephone network and would
be unable to place and receive calls within that network. While the Claimants’ expert notes that

*5° it is evident to the Tribunal that

Devas’ customers could still have used voice-over-IP services,
such voice-over-IP services are no equivalent substitute for the attribution of a regular telephone
number, enabling the user to place and receive calls within the national telephone network. As a
result, the Tribunal finds the conclusion of the Respondent’s expert**° that Devas’ customers
would in practice have had to carry two mobile devices — a mobile telephone from another
operator and a Devas BWA device — to be convincing. There is indeed a real question whether
customers in India would not have preferred to subscribe to both telephony services and data
services from the same provider, using one and the same smartphone. Devas was thus at a
disadvantage compared to competitors with a telephony license, and a willing buyer in 2011

familiar with the telecommunications market would have been acutely aware of that aspect.

iii. Conclusion

The Tribunal thus concludes that a 2009 outlook on the business environment in 2011, as it
underlies valuations based on the Darwin Model, both understates the market potential and
overstates Devas’ likely success in that market. It understates the market potential because a buyer
in early-2011 would have found an investment in the Indian broadband wireless mobile telephone
sector even more attractive than in 2009. It overstates Devas’ likely success because a buyer in
2011 would have had doubts as to whether Devas’ technology model, developed in the years

before the smartphone revolution, was an adequate fit for that burgeoning market.

In the Tribunal’s view, it is not clear that a knowledgeable, willing, and unpressured buyer in
February 2011 would have committed substantial capital to develop a mobile multi-media service
that could not be accessed from a regular smartphone. At the same time, the Tribunal is not

prepared to adopt a static view of Devas’ likely market behaviour, as appears to underlie the

Respondent’s approach. It would be implausible to assume that Devas would have taken no

measures to adapt to the new smartphone world.

While there is no specific evidence on the record that Devas was already working toward a
different technology model, with the help of DT, in particular, Devas would have had the capacity
to adapt its technology model over time, including potentially by obtaining a telephony license.
Devas’ position in February 2011 remained a privileged one because the company had exclusive

use of satellite spectrum.

b. Satellite Launch Dates

The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that one could not assume that a willing buyer in
February 2011 would have based his purchase price on a satellite launch date in July 2010 which
did not occur. However, the Tribunal notes the earlier assurance given to Devas to the effect that
work on GSAT-6 was almost completed. The Tribunal refers in particular to the minutes of a
meeting, on April 15, 2009 of the Geosat Programme Management Office, ISRO Satellite Centre,
Bangalore, at which the Managing Director of Antrix “stressed that the satellite has to be launched
in early 2010 for which efforts should be increased and concentrated to ready the satellite by year
end.”?57 At another joint status review meeting of 11 and 12 November 2009, between Devas and
ISRO/Antrix, an overview of the project was presented by Mr. V.R. Pratap, Project Director,
GSAT-6 (Devas), ISRO Satellite Centre, Bangalore. That 34-page document demonstrated the
very advanced readiness of the Satellite Realization Schedule, including a planned launch on June
19, 2010 for GSAT-6 and on March 25, 2011 for GSAT-6A.*°* Even Dr. Radhakrishnan, who
was by then improperly manoeuvring to annul the Devas Agreement, stated in early February

2010 that a new deadline for the launching of the satellite would be on September 1, 2010.**

The Tribunal is of the view that a launch date of June 2011 for GSAT-6 and June 2012 for GSAT-

6A would have been a reasonable assumption to adopt by such a willing buyer in early 2011.

3. Regulatory Risks

In its Award on Jurisdiction and Merits,*® the Tribunal reached the following conclusion: “[o]n

the basis of the evidence received by the Tribunal, it is satisfied that, even without a WPC license,

Devas could have rolled-out satellite-only services. The Tribunal also notes that it has been
satisfactorily established that, because of problems of interference, it would not have been
possible for competing services to operate in the spectrum.” This is what has been described as
the “box-out” position of Devas. The key issue concerning regulatory risks is whether Devas

would have obtained a WPC License and, if so, at what price.

As to the possible issuance of a WPC License, the Tribunal recognizes that the Devas Agreement
does not make it a formal obligation for the WPC to issue such a license but it cannot ignore the
fact that the Devas Agreement describes Antrix as “a marketing arm of Department of Space and

is the entity through which ISRO engages in commercial activities’**!

and that as part of that
Agreement, Article 1.0 of Exhibit D states that “ANTRIX shall provide appropriate Technical
assistance to DEVAS for obtaining operating license and approvals from various ministries so as
to deliver DEVAS services and use ground/Terrestrial Equipments required to offer the
Service.” Moreover, it is worth reminding that, from October 2009 through July 2011, Dr. K.
Radhakrishnan, the key actor in this dispute, was at the same time (a) Chairman of the Space
Commission, (b) Chairman of ISRO (c) Secretary of DOS and (d) Chairman of Antrix. The
Chairman of Antrix was therefore in an excellent position to assure approval by the other agencies
in which he occupied a very senior position. It is also worth noting that the Prime Minister was

the minister responsible for DOS.

The Tribunal also refers to following statement as reported in the Minutes of the Status Review

of GSAT 6 with M/s Devas Multimedia Pvt., Ltd., on 11 April 2009 at the ISRO Satellite Centre:

Shri. KR Sridharamurthi, Managing Director, Antrix highlighted that GSAT 6 satellite scores
over other satellites in many ways like adaptation of I2K bus, providing satellite terrestrial
hybrid system for multimedia services with payload configuration being very unique making
GSAT 6 a significant project adding a feather in the cap of ISRO. He stressed that the satellite
has to be launched in early 2010 for which efforts should be increased and concentrated to
ready the satellite by year end. He also remarked that the S-Band frequency spectrum was
very important and there was a time limit to the allotted spectrum and hence, all efforts are
to be put to retain our right over this important asset by launching the satellite in time. He
also mentioned that a lot of recognition awaits thi 363

In addition, as late as 8 February 2011, Dr. Kasturirangan, a senior member of Antrix, had this to
say at a press conference in presence of Dr. Radhakrishnan (Chairman of the Space Commission,

Chairman of ISRO, Secretary of DOS and, Chairman of Antrix):

I think that Devas technology is the outcome of a consortium of top designers of
communications systems across the world. Don’t think that this is done in the Indian
laboratory. It is a very unique technology which has been contributed by some of the best
peers in the field.

The Tribunal is left with little doubt that, in such a context, and had Dr. Radhakrishnan acted in
accordance with the text of Article 1.0 of the Devas Agreement, a WPC License would have been
issued in favor of Devas for the provision of BWA and AV services. In this regard, the Tribunal
recalls that the Parties are in agreement that a WPC License would have been required in order
for Devas to be able to terrestrially re-use the spectrum allocated to it for the provision of its
envisaged BWA and AV services*® (the Tribunal has already found in its Award on Jurisdiction

and Merits that a WPC License would not have been required for satellite-only services**).

4. Applicable License Fees
There remains the question of the fees that WPC would have required Devas to pay.

The Respondent argues that, under the level playing field policy in operation in India, Devas
would have had to pay an amount equivalent to the amount charged to other applicants for a WPC
License in 2011. It points out in particular to an auction of BWA spectrum in 2010 at which
Infotel paid Rs 12,847.77 crore (USD 2.74 billion) for a 20 MHz national portfolio. On that basis,
its expert argues that, even using Devas’ proposed discount rate in the ICC Arbitration, an auction

in the present case would have resulted in a substantial negative net present value for Devas.**”

The Tribunal does not question the general level playing field policy adopted by the Respondent
in connection with BWA spectrum allocation; it considers however that the Respondent’s

argument does not take into consideration the particular situation of Devas.

Page 82 of 163

The Tribunal has already ruled in its Award on Jurisdiction and Merits that it has been
satisfactorily established that Devas was in a “box-out” situation. Due to interference which
would have resulted from its activities in the spectrum allocated to it, there would have been no

other competing application for operation in that spectrum.

Moreover, the Tribunal has to bear in mind the public interest policy that the Respondent’s
officials expressed in seeing Devas pursuing its activities in the spectrum allocated to it and that
leaving the spectrum severely underused, in case Devas could not secure a WPC License at a
reasonable price, would have been looked upon as unacceptable from a public policy point of

view.

The Tribunal’s conclusion in this respect is that Devas and the WPC would have entered into
negotiation in order to arrive at a mutually satisfactory fee level for a WPC License for terrestrial
re-use of spectrum, rather than leaving it unused. In that respect, a reference to the highest fee
registered in the world outside India for a WPC License, as proposed by the Claimants, appears

reasonable and will be used as a basis for establishing the damages suffered by Devas.

AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION DUE

The Tribunal shall now turn to the calculation of damages on the basis of the “but for” scenario

just described.

In summary, the amounts claimed by the Claimants in each possible “but for” scenario are the

following:

- For a BWA and AV services business under the Reduced Spectrum Scenario and applying
pre-award interest at the LIBOR rate + 4% as of November 30, 2017, CC/Devas and Telcom

WHETHER DEVAS, IN I REAL OR

NOMINAL TERMS

 

OWN BUSINESS MODELS, EXPRESSED CASH FLOW:

 

As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal will address a particular, disputed question of fact, which
has a significant impact on the Tribunal’s valuation: whether Devas, in its own business plans and
notably in the Darwin Model, expressed cash flows in real or in nominal terms. Put simply, cash
flows expressed in nominal terms (also referred to as current dollar terms) reflect the expected
inflation, while cash flows expressed in real terms (also referred to as constant dollar terms) do
not take account of future inflation. The accuracy of any valuation in this arbitration that is based

on, or informed by, the figures stated in Devas’ business plans depends on this threshold question.

The Tribunal recalls that, on June 1, 2018, pursuant to Procedural Order No. 12, the Respondent
submitted a series of documents from the DT Arbitration, including a Witness Statement by Mr.
Scheuermann of DT*”? and an Expert Report of Mr. Greg Harman of FTI Consulting.*”*
According to the Respondent, these documents imply that the models developed by Devas (the
Series-C Model, the Bravo Model and the Darwin Model) were expressed in nominal terms.*”°
The Claimants dispute that implication and maintain that their business plans were based on cash

flows expressed in real terms.

1. The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants dispute the Respondent’s contention that Mr. Scheuermann’s witness statement
and the expert report from the DT Arbitration “show that the projected cash flows in the ‘Darwin’
model (and preceding Devas business models) may have been made on a ‘nominal’ basis, i.e.

incorporating the effect on prices and costs of any future currency inflation, rather than a ‘real’

basis (which excludes those effects).”*”° According to the Claimants, the Respondent puts forward
this theory “in the hope that this might lead to the application of a higher (nominal) discount rate
to the cash flows in the Brattle damages model, with a corresponding reduction in Claimants’

damages.”*”7

The Claimants refer to two presentations made by Devas to DT in November 2007, which
explained that their financial model was “built in REAL terms with adjustments for incremental
real (relative) annual increases/decreases in prices/costs.”*”* According to the Claimants, the cash
flow projections in the Series-C Model (“business plan attached to the March 2008 Share
Subscription Agreement with DT Asia”)*” were done in real terms, as was the case with the
subsequent Bravo Model and Darwin Model.** In the Claimants’ view, this is evidenced by the

existing contemporaneous record.**!

In support of their position the Claimants further submitted a witness statement by Mr.
Viswanathan, CEO of Devas (“Mr. Viswanathan”).**? Mr. Viswanathan affirms that
contemporaneous documents show that Devas modelled its cash flows in real terms*** and, while
Devas worked with DT “to refine the company’s business model (culminating in the Darwin
Model) (...) [he] do[es] not recall any discussion or agreement with DT that Devas would change
its modelling assumption from real to nominal.” According to Mr. Viswanathan, he would recall

such a modification, had it occurred, “because it would have required a wholesale change of the

assumptions in the Darwin Model to convert them from real to nominal, and resulted in

significantly different cash flows.”**

The Claimants argue that there is no sign that Devas’ internal modelling methodology would have
changed from real to nominal terms, because, if that were the case, “[t]he signs of such a
conversion would be readily discernible in the cash flows.”***

The Claimants also dispute the relevance of Mr. Scheuermann’s witness statement for the present
arbitration, arguing that “his testimony refers to an internal DT valuation process, not a Devas
(much less Claimants’) valuation.”**° In the Claimants’ view, “it is stated in the clearest terms
possible [in his witness statement] that he was not personally involved in the Darwin model. Most
of his testimony relates to his internal evaluations.”**’ Thus, the Claimants consider that there is
“no discrepancy” between his testimony and their damages case.*** In any event, while it may be
the case that DT produced internal valuations on a “nominal” basis (and it may even be the case
that DT mistook Devas’ figures for nominal, rather than real, figures), nothing done by DT in its

internal valuation process is attributable to either Claimants or Devas.**°

Similarly, the Claimants dispute the relevance of Mr. Scheuermann’s oral testimony at the
quantum hearing in the DT Arbitration, submitted into the record by the Respondent pursuant to
Procedural Order No. 16.*”° According to the Claimants, the “Respondent’s counsel carefully led
Mr. Scheuermann to confirm it was his ‘understanding’ that ‘the business plans [he was] dealing
with were in nominal terms’ (...) Mr. Scheuermann answered in the affirmative, but then clarified
that his understanding was premised on DT’s own ‘normal’ practice of preparing DCF valuations

in nominal terms.”*"!

In the Claimants’ submission, Mr. Scheuermann’s testimony confirms their position that, while

DT may have had an internal practice of conducting valuations on a nominal basis, and DT may

even have mistakenly taken Devas’ figures for nominal, DT’s internal valuation process is not

attributable to Devas or the Claimants.*””

Likewise, the Claimants argue that “[Mr.] Harman’s selection of a valuation methodology for DT

cannot disturb the contemporaneous documentary record showing Devas’ management generated
cash flows on a real (not nominal) basis.”*°>

Furthermore, the Claimants argue that, while Mr. Flores had affirmed that he had concluded that

the models were nominal “despite eight reports by him where he treated them as real,”*°* Mr.

Flores accepted in cross-examination that “he doesn’t actually have a position on the issue.”*°°

2. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent points out that Mr. Scheuermann’s witness statement affirms that “[t]he [Series-
C] model was in nominal terms, and therefore so too was the WACC.”?°° The Respondent also
notes that Mr. Scheuermann applied a nominal discount rate when using the Bravo Model.*””
Furthermore, the Respondent underscores that the expert report of Mr. Harman asserts that the

Darwin Model is in nominal terms.***

Similarly, the Respondent relies on Mr. Scheuermann’s oral testimony at the quantum hearing in

the DT Arbitration, in which he confirmed his written testimony.*”” According to the Respondent,

when you prepared and created your discount rate, you did it in nominal terms also? A. Exactly. So this is
the normal way of how do we and Deutsche Telekom prepare the DCF valuation, yes.”

his written and oral testimony is relevant because the Claimants had put great reliance on DT’s
role in developing the cash flows, while now, as a result of the Respondent’s arguments regarding
the real/nominal issue, they are trying to “downplay” DT’s significance and “discredit” Mr.
Scheuermann.“
According to the Respondent, Mr. Scheuermann “‘is the only person who has submitted a witness
statement in either arbitration who has personal knowledge and was personally involved in the
development of those models.”“°! The Respondent disputes that Mr. Viswanathan has any
knowledge of the development of such models, as he “was at a high level of supervisory
capacity."
The Respondent argues that “if the DT testimony on the basic issue of real versus nominal cash
flows in the Series-C, Bravo and Darwin Models is accurate, that in and of itself would mean that
under Claimants’ own figures on quantum in this case, the value of the proposed Devas business
would be negative, wholly apart from all of the other basic flaws in Claimants’ quantum

analysis.”4°> [emphasis in original]

In particular, the Respondent underscores that “if the nominal equivalent of Mr. Sacks’ 10.3%
real discount rate (which Mr. Sacks himself calculates at 14.3%) were to be applied to the Brattle
Model, even taking every single input into that model as correct, the net present value of Devas

would be negative.’”4*

3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Respondent raises three arguments in support of its claim that the cash flows expressed in the
models developed by Devas were in nominal rather than in real terms, which the Tribunal wishes

briefly to recall.

the business plans that you were dealing with were in nominal terms? A. Yes, that’s right. Q. And therefore,
when you prepared and created your discount rate, you did it in nominal terms also? A. Exactly. So this is

Its first argument is based on Mr. Scheuermann’s testimony in the DT Arbitration. Mr.
Scheuermann was Head of Corporate Finance when DT started to look at the opportunity to invest
in Devas. He was later appointed V.P. M&As at DT (2011). As head of Corporate Finance, he
was leading the DT evaluation team when, in 2008, the Series-C model was developed jointly

with Devas*5

as a refinement of a previous business plan presented by Devas to DT in November
2007.4 In his Witness Statement, he declares that he was involved in the model’s building and
adjustment and he states that “[t]he model was in nominal terms, and therefore so too was the
WACC.”“"7 However, he adds that “[a]t the time the Darwin Model'*”*! was agreed, I was not
involved in its review as I had already completed my internal valuation and had gone back to
working on other projects.“ DT’s review of the Darwin Model was principally carried out by
Mr. Larsen, a witness who testified in this case. Moreover, Mr. Scheuermann makes it clear*!°
that DT had also asked him to lead DT’s own valuation of Devas, which was not destined to be

shared with Devas, but rather to help DT decide on the size of its investment in Devas.

The second argument raised by the Respondent is based on an Expert Report submitted on 4 May
2018 by Mr. Greg Harman, FTI Consulting in the DT Arbitration.*!! The Respondent points out
that Mr. Harman states that “Figure A4-1 below presents an overview of the structure of the
Darwin Model. The model’s key output is a forecast of Devas’ free cash flows in nominal terms
(i.e. including inflation).”*!? The Respondent also quotes another section of that report where Mr.
Harman states: “I have calculated the cost of equity on a nominal post-tax basis in INR terms.”*!3
The third argument raised by the Respondent in support of cash flows in nominal terms is based
on an excerpt from the Darwin Excel file.*'* That excerpt shows that the Darwin model included

an inflation forecast of 5% a year for the satellite lease cost.

For their part, the Claimants mention the following points in support of their view that the cash

flows in the Darwin Model are in real terms.

First, they refer to Devas’ Financial Models Sensitivities & Adjustments of November 3, 2007 (a
document submitted to DT and subsequently jointly refined) which states categorically: “Model
is built in REAL terms with adjustments for incremental real (relative) annual increases/decreases
in prices/costs”4!5

Secondly, the Claimants point out the statement of the CEO of Devas, Mr. Viswanathan to the
effect that Devas “sought to exclude the effect of inflation (in what was then in India a rising and
variable inflation environment).”"!°

Thirdly, the Claimants refer to the computations made by Mr. Bazelon and Mr. Sacks to prove
that the basis had not been changed from real to nominal between 2007 (date of Devas’ first

known business plan presented to DT) and 2009.
The Tribunal will now proceed with its analysis of the submissions made by the Parties.

As to Mr. Scheuermann’s testimony in the DT Arbitration, the extent of his involvement is unclear
for a man of his responsibility, and the Tribunal has no evidence on how much he was involved
in the detailed assumptions and computations of the models used by Devas in the 2008
transaction. Rather, his evidence seems to relate to internal models prepared by DT. As stated by
Mr. Scheuermann in his testimony, “I did not provide my valuation to Devas as it was only used
for internal purposes to present to the DT Management and Supervisory Board to seek approval
for DT’s further investment in Devas.”4””

As mentioned above, when invited by the Tribunal to appear before it, Mr. Scheuermann declined
to do so, thus depriving the Parties and the Tribunal of the opportunity to question him about his
statement. The Tribunal is not in a position to determine whether DT’s own calculations of Devas’
cash flows were in nominal rather than in real terms. It notes however that DT’s own internal

valuation of Devas in July 2009 established Devas’ enterprise value at USD 1.15 billion.*"

As to the expert report of Mr. Harman in the DT Arbitration,*!® his assertion that the Darwin
Model is in nominal terms and that he used that basis to make his analysis is of little probative
value. He states in several instances that he retains the Darwin Model assumptions and posits that
it is stated in nominal terms, as if it were obvious. However, paragraphs 4.15 to 4.27 of his report
make it clear that the Darwin Model was the end-product of a series of refinements and
adjustments made to Devas’ original business plan presented to DT in November 2007. This
original business plan was categorically presented as prepared in real terms.*° Mr. Harman does
not offer a convincing personal analysis that either Devas was originally mistaken or that the
model shifted from real to nominal when being refined. He just seems to take it for granted that
the Darwin Model was in nominal terms. Moreover, he states that the assumptions underlying the
model were reasonable because he was told as much. For example, he writes: “[f]rom 2011, I
assume that the unit costs above would evolve in line with the escalation factors considered in the
Darwin Model. Dr Larsen considers that these assumptions remained appropriate”; also “[t]he
Darwin Model projected prices to remain constant up to two years after launch in DG1 and then
to decline at a rate of 0.5% per quarter (i.e. 2.0% per annum). I retain the Darwin Model’s price
trend assumptions for the following reasons: (1) the pricing assumption reflect (sic) Devas
contemporaneous market expectations and Dr Larsen considered the inputs in the model were
reasonable.”?! There is nothing in the above to prove that the Darwin Model was indeed stated
in nominal terms. The Tribunal notes that the Respondent did not request the appearance of Mr.
Harman and that, while the Respondent indicated in its transmission letter that it did not agree
with the rest of his report, the Tribunal cannot but notice that, even if Mr. Harman’s calculations
were made in nominal terms in his DCF analysis, he nonetheless arrived at the conclusion that

Devas had an enterprise value of USD 1.618 billion*” on February 17, 2011 (the Valuation Date).

The Tribunal notes that Mr. Brent Kaczmarek, who was acting as a claimant expert in the ICC
Arbitration, also took the Darwin Model as the starting base for his evaluation. He wrote in his
paragraph 132: “[mJost costs and revenues are modelled in local currency. (...) The model also
excludes inflation. Accordingly, the model projects revenues and costs in real terms (i.e. net of
inflation).”*?3 When adjusting the model “to reflect new information as of 25 February 201 1 rather

than mid-2009,” Mr. Kaczmarek did it in real terms: “[w]e projected both the retail and enterprise

BWA prices to drop 2 percent annually in real terms in accordance with Devas/DT’s
contemporaneous expectations (...) We also project the AV prices to drop 2 percent annually in
real terms.” The opinion is the opposite of Mr. Harman’s opinion, but the Tribunal notes that there

is no more “proof” in Mr. Kaczmarek’s report than in Mr. Harman’s report.

Faced with these contradictory assertions, the Tribunal found it particularly important to look for
convincing evidence within the model itself. More precisely, the Tribunal examined the Brattle

4 rather than

Model (prepared by Mr. Bazelon and Mr. Sacks) submitted by the Claimants,
directly the Darwin Model, keeping in mind that the Brattle Model is the latest update of the

Darwin Model. The Brattle Model is indeed the one underpinning the quantitative claim.

In this regard, the Tribunal notes the following with regard to the Respondent’s third argument
quoted above in paragraph 409 (i.e. that the Darwin Excel file> shows that the Darwin model
included an inflation forecast of 5% a year for the satellite lease cost). The Tribunal notes that in
the Devas Agreement,*”® it is stated that “[a]ll the lease payments, which are specified in this
contract are subject to adjustment for price variation as per the following formula, depending on
the year for which the lease payment is applicable”; said formula is based on the wholesale price
index. It can be inferred that the “inflation rate” included in the Darwin Model for leases reflects
a contractual obligation related to that specific element, rather than the intent to systematically
reason in terms of inflation-adjusted figures. In the original Darwin Model, this cost escalation
was supposed to start in 2010. Second, and most importantly, the Tribunal notes that the Brattle
Excel file?’ does not show any inflation on the satellite lease cost; it shows only the adjustment
prescribed in paragraph 2-1-2-1 of the Lease Agreement,*”* which is an increase in payment when
cash flows become positive. This particular adjustment is not at all related to inflation and is a
one-time, pre-determined adjustment. The evidence thus shows that satellite lease costs are stated

in real terms in the Brattle Excel file.

An examination of personnel costs in the Brattle Model supports the idea that the model is
expressed in real terms: the SG&A Inputs tab*” shows that DMPL personnel costs, and other
general expenses, were set to increase at the rate of 4% per year (lines 21 to 87), whereas DMAI
personnel costs and other general costs were expected to increase by 1% per year (lines 94 to
114). The 4% rate is crucial: it must be determined whether it is a real rate of increase (above the

8° reveal that both

rate of inflation) or a nominal one. Publicly available statistics about India
before and after 2009 and 2011, the rate of salary increases in India was much higher than the
general inflation rate, yielding positive real rates of salary increases. Salary nominal growth rates
have hovered around 10%-12% between 2006 and 2011, and the general rate of inflation (CPI)
was about 7.3%. The real rate of salary increases therefore stood around 4%. It was thus perfectly
logical to include in the Brattle model an expected real increase of 4% per year. This figure could
by no means represent a nominal growth rate as it stood far below observed nominal rates. Of
course, if rates of increase were stated in real terms, the cash-flows were stated in real (constant)

rupees or dollars.

Finally, the Tribunal considers the Claimants’ argument persuasive that there does not appear to
have been any conversion of the economic modelling underlying the Darwin Model from real
terms into nominal terms between 2007 and 2009.**! Various figures contained in the 2009
model*” would have been higher, had such a conversion to nominal terms taken place.*** It may

reasonably be inferred that the model was and always remained expressed in real terms.

Contrary to the situation concerning Mr. Scheuermann, Mr. Viswanathan appeared before the
Tribunal and his testimony both in writing and upon cross-examination was quite categorical as

to his knowledge that the models used by Devas were in real and not nominal terms.***

Finally, the Tribunal notes that, in the ICC Arbitration, Mr. Kaczmarek’s Expert Report stated

that the Devas models were made on a real terms basis and that this view was not challenged by

the Respondent at the time. Mr. Flores, the Respondent’s expert in this case as well as in the ICC

Arbitration wrote some eight reports in the ICC Arbitration and in this case without questioning

whether the Devas models were based on real terms. When questioned about this matter during

the Hearing on Quantum in this case, he stated that it was not immediately apparent to him

whether the Darwin Model was in real or nominal terms but that he was now “leaning towards”
nominal terms but had “no 100% certainty.”

On the basis of the written evidence submitted to it and the oral testimony of Mr. Viswanathan

before the Tribunal, the Tribunal has come to the conclusion that the cash flows in the Series-C,

Bravo and Darwin Models were in real and not in nominal terms.

VALUATION METHODOLOGY
1. The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants’ experts, Mr. Sacks and Mr. Bazelon, use a combination of the Income Approach
and the Market Approach to determine Devas’ fair market value on the valuation date.**° In
particular, Mr. Sacks values Devas’ combined AV/BWA business using DCF valuation, and Mr.
Bazelon values the BWA business segment alone using a Market Approach.’ Afterwards, Mr.
Sacks calculates the value of Devas using the average of the values produced through these

valuation methods.***

a. Methodology as Developed in relation to the Reduced Spectrum Case

The Claimants contend that “the particular income method used by Brattle, the venture capital
method, is specifically tailored to measuring the value of young companies in Devas’
situation.”**° According to the Claimants, such method, as laid out by Professor Metrick, “calls

for a three-stage test.

According to the Claimants, “[s]tep 1 is to take the business plan and estimate the value that

BWA/AV business would have had once it reaches what is called the venture capitalist exit point

accordingly, Mr. “Sacks takes the cash flows and applied the same discount rate as would apply
to a mature Indian telecommunications company to get a mature exit event value.”“4!

“Step 2 takes into account the risk of failure because he then makes a very significant adjustment
called the ‘pre-revenue adjustment.’ That reduces the cash flows to reflect the chance the company

would not make it to maturity.”

studies (...) we’re able to see the compilation of company failure and maturity rates (...) one can

On that basis, Mr. Sacks concludes that the fair market value of Devas in the Reduced Spectrum

Scenario is USD 1.5 billion.”

Separately, applying a Market Approach, Mr. Bazelon calculates the value of Devas’ BWA
segment.**! The Claimants assert that he demonstrates that the value of Devas’ BWA segment

can be benchmarked against the June 2010 BWA spectrum auctions in India as such market

provides a highly reliable comparable. *** Accordingly,

Dr. Bazelon equates the USD 2.74 billion paid by Infotel for a 20 MHz national portfolio as
a baseline comparable, a reliable measure of the cost of a business license to provide BWA
services. In other words, in 2010, a third party like Infotel was willing to pay USD 2.74
billion (and undertake costly “build-out” requirements) to become a BWA service
provider.‘

 

On this basis, he adjusts Infotel’s baseline price to take into account the differences with Devas’
rights and concludes that Devas’ BWA segment had a fair market value of approximately USD
1.7 billion in the Reduced Spectrum Scenario as of the valuation date.

The Claimants’ experts also calculate Devas’ value for the alternative scenario of an AV services-
only business. In this case, Mr. Bazelon uses the Darwin Model, removing all cash flows related
to BWA segment but retaining all satellite-related costs and 50% of the shared personnel, general
and administrative expenses.**> Mr. Bazelon also assumes that licensing costs for terrestrial
transmission of AV content would be 4% of gross revenues, as indicated by TRAI in the 2005
guidelines and obtains the cash flows.**° The Claimants note that, “[b]ecause the AV model
already includes a 6% adjusted gross revenue ISP fee, no additional licensing costs are

necessary.”**’ Mr. Sacks applies the same discount rate, terminal growth rate and pre-revenue

adjustment as used in the valuation of the combined AV/BWA business and obtains a value of

USD 469 million for an AV-only business.***

As it will be discussed below (under the heading of quantification), the Claimants’ experts have
accepted some of the Respondents’ criticisms to their valuation and introduced certain downward
adjustments in their second experts reports, submitted by the Claimants with their Reply on

Quantum.

The Claimants respond to the Respondent’s criticism concerning the use of DCF for a start-up
company like Devas, arguing that “Brattle’s DCF model is based upon contemporaneous, real-
world business records and projections” and constitutes a sufficient basis for using the DCF

method in this case, especially as there is no doubt about the demand for Devas’ services.*°°

Nevertheless, the Claimants acknowledge that the ICC Tribunal was not prepared to accept the
use of a DCF valuation, although they disagree with the view that DCF methodology is too
speculative in this case.* In particular, the Claimants contend that “there are numerous

economists who have endorsed a DCF method even for early stage companies.” *°!

Likewise, the Claimants criticize the Respondent’s reliance on the World Bank Guidelines to
deny the appropriateness of using DCF by arguing that these Guidelines cannot be regarded as
international valuation standards.*°? The Claimants refer to Professor Marboe’s criticism thereto,
who, in the Claimants submission, noted that “not only are these not cited in the economic
literature, they themselves are mere proposals by committee of lawyers at the World Bank over
20 years ago’*® and affirmed that “‘[t]o the extent they purport to restrict the use of DCF to a

“going concern’” the approach “is not entirely in accordance with international valuation

standards.”4*

The Claimants affirm that, the fact that Devas did not have a track record of revenue generation
when the expropriation took place does not exclude the use of an income approach. The Claimants

refer to scholarly analysis noting that

[a] number of investment tribunals applied an income valuation approach also without a track
record. This is not only true for cases where the valuation could be based on solidly
formulated long-term contracts but also in cases where the future profitability depended on
economic circumstances, such as consumers’ demands and expenditures. *°*

b. Methodology as Applied to the Original Spectrum Case

In his third expert report, submitted in response to the Tribunal’s letter dated November 13, 2017,
Mr. Bazelon addresses the valuation of Devas in the Original Spectrum Scenario. He notes that
the DCF valuation spreadsheet which accompanied his first expert report allowed the viewer to
switch the scenario under analysis between the cash flows and valuation results for the Original
Spectrum Scenario and the Reduced Spectrum Scenario; hence all the information necessary to
develop cash flow projections under the Original Spectrum Scenario was included in his first

report.*%

Mr. Bazelon limits his discussion to aspects that differ from those discussed in respect of the
Reduced Spectrum Scenario.*”’ He notes that in the Original Spectrum Scenario Devas would
have leased transponder capacity on two satellites, both of which were nearly completed by mid-
2010.48 Thus, his Original Spectrum model incorporates upfront capacity reservation fees and

annual lease fees for both satellites at the levels specified in the Devas Agreement.*

Mr. Bazelon points out that, with the exception of the timing of the first satellite launch and the
use of two satellites instead of one, he maintains all other structural aspects of the cash flows
model in the Original Spectrum Scenario identical to those of the Reduced Spectrum Scenario, as

they are based on Devas’ own Darwin Model.*”

As he considers that Devas would have been able to offer the same BWA services and almost the
same AV services in the Reduced Spectrum Scenario (due to technological reconfigurations) as
in the Original Spectrum Scenario, “the pricing assumptions are the same (...) with one exception:

the price of AV services in rural areas.”*7! In the Original Spectrum Scenario Devas would have

been able to provide all the initially envisaged AV services also in rural areas, such that prices for
these services would not have been reduced by half.“ The BWA network configuration and

equipment costs would have been the same under both scenarios.*”*

Moreover, the Claimants assume that in the Original Spectrum Scenario the launch of AV services
in urban areas would not have been delayed. Mr. Bazelon has thus been instructed to assume that
its roll-out would have started in October 2010, shortly after the satellite launch would have taken
place in July 2010, and otherwise maintains the staggered roll-out pattern assumed in the Darwin

Model.‘ Accordingly,

with these two exceptions — full AV service pricing in rural areas and an earlier start of the
AV service — the description in my First Report of Devas’s AV and BWA services, prices,
and penetration rates remains applicable in the Original Spectrum Case.*7>

Mr. Bazelon also adopts the operating cost structure and estimates reflected in the Darwin Model
as in the Reduced Spectrum Scenario.‘ In the Original Spectrum Scenario he assumes the
payment of leasing fees for two satellites instead of only one, because in this scenario both
satellites would be used.*”’ Furthermore, he assumes the yearly payment of a terrestrial re-use fee

for 20 Mhz of spectrum of USD 289.4 million.4”*

The Market Approach used by Mr. Bazelon to value the BWA business remains unchanged in the

Original Spectrum Scenario and results in an estimate of USD 1.7 billion.*”

Likewise, Mr. Sacks relies on Mr. Bazelon’s cash flow projections to perform a DCF valuation
of Devas under the Original Spectrum Scenario.**° Mr. Sacks contends that the following steps
over the cash flow projections developed by Mr. Bazelon and applied in the Reduced Spectrum
Scenario remain unchanged for valuation purposes under the Original Spectrum Scenario: (i)
projecting cash flows from year 10 forward using a terminal growth rate of 4.5 %, which is

consistent with India’s expected GDP growth rate; (ii) conservatively modelling that Devas would

not have cash flows after the renewed Devas Agreement expired in 24 years; (iii) calculating the

17, 2011 by acknowledging its status as a young company, and thereby using a method akin to
the well-established “venture capital method” [i.e. by applying a pre-revenue adjustment for the
probability of failure, and discounting based on the cost of capital]; (v) reducing the fair market
value of Devas by the cost of the Build-Out requirement to reflect the risk that such a requirement

would be imposed on Devas.**!

Pursuant to the Tribunal’s letter dated November 13, 2017, the Parties also had the opportunity
to submit preliminary comments on each other’s alternative calculations. Accordingly, the
Claimants provided their views on the Respondent’s alternative calculations within their April
26, 2018 submissions,**? including the submission of supplemental expert reports by Mr.

Bazelon*® and Mr. Sacks.‘**

The Claimants maintain that, in sustaining that Devas lacked any value, Mr. Flores ignores the
Tribunal’s finding that Devas had “significant value.”**° The Claimants affirm that Mr. Flores’
main theme in purporting to justify his negative valuation of Devas relates to licensing, and
reiterate that his “arguments ignore Devas’s box-out position — an issue already decided by the
Tribunal in the Merits Award (...) as well as international licensing norms in this area and India’s

own policies.”“*° [emphasis in original, footnotes omitted]

Furthermore, the Claimants argue that Mr. Flores (i) “inappropriately double-counts risks”;**” (ii)
“misrepresents core economic concepts,” notably the concept of “target return”;*** (iii) “tries to
hide that delays in satellite launch likely increase Devas’s value, and even if they did not, any

diminution in value could be significantly mitigated by not delaying the entire BWA roll-out by

2. Respondent’s Position

The Respondent rejects the applicability of a DCF methodology to value Devas’ business under
both the Reduced Spectrum Scenario and the Original Spectrum Scenario, as described in the

following paragraphs.

Furthermore, the Respondent underscores that the Claimants “had not presented any claim based

on any recognised methodology other than DCF,”*”!

so “[t]he main question before [the Tribunal],
therefore, is whether Claimants have carried their burden of proving that their DCF valuation for
either the AV/BWA business or the AV-only business is reasonable.”**? The Respondent disputes

this, as described in the following paragraphs.

a. Methodology as Developed in relation to the Reduced Spectrum Case

The Respondent contends that a DCF “approach is highly suspect in the circumstances of this

case, which involves a start-up company with no track record in a highly regulated industry with

9493

significant risks and uncertainties. Furthermore, the Respondent claims that not only Devas

itself did not have a track record but that this is “also true for the type of business that Devas
wanted to embark on in India.”“*

and scholarly analysis. The Respondent underscores:

Arbitral practice has frequently rejected an income valuation approach [i.e. the DCF
approach] when the company was not an ongoing business with a proven record of
profitability. The main argument was that without a past record future calculation would be
wholly speculative.4

The Respondent further asserts that the high degree of volatility reflected by the DCF model upon
which the Claimants rely demonstrates the instability and lack of reliability of the DCF in the
circumstances of this case.*”? The Respondent underscores that this position was adopted by the

ICC Tribunal, which held:

[A]n aspect of the DCF methodology that the tribunal finds particularly troubling in this case
is that small variations in the assumptions used (...) can dramatically and unrealistically
change Devas’ value (...) The Tribunal understands that the reason for the extreme sensitivity
of the DCF methodology in this case is the length of the period that it would take for Devas
to become cash positive (...) it makes Devas’ DCF methodology an unrealistic and unreliable
vehicle for determining its damages.5

The Respondent also criticizes the market approach advocated by the Claimants by asserting that
it consists of a circular argument:*°' it assumes that Devas had the right to use the satellite
spectrum terrestrially at an annual fee equivalent to the one applied in Slovenia rather than an

upfront spectrum fee commensurate with the price paid by its competitors at the 2010 BWA

auction, which is the position of Indian regulators.*°”

Therefore, the Claimants’ market approach assumes that Devas had the right to use the spectrum
terrestrially, although it was not authorised to do so, and at a fee that would have been contrary

503

to India’s level playing field policy.°°’ The Respondent contends that a willing buyer would not

have assumed that it would be permitted to pay a lower spectrum charge than its competitors had

to pay at an auction.

b. Methodology as Applied to the Original Spectrum Case

In his supplemental expert report, submitted in response to the Tribunal’s letter dated November
13, 2017, Mr. Flores addresses the Claimants’ experts’ valuations under the Original Spectrum
Scenario on the basis of the DCF models submitted with their second expert reports.*°

Mr. Flores notes that, similarly to the Reduced Spectrum Scenario, the Claimants’ experts’ model
in the Original Spectrum Scenario is highly sensitive to changes in inputs.*”° He presents a tabular
sensitivity analysis showing the impact on the Claimants’ experts’ DCF model of several
assumptions, namely: (i) two year delay in operation; (ii) 10% fewer subscriptions; (iii) 10%
higher costs; and (iv) 10% lower prices.*””

Mr. Flores applies to the Original Spectrum Scenario the same corrections that he sets out in his
second expert report and concludes that “as in the Reduced Spectrum Case, a hypothetical buyer
would not have assigned value to either Devas’ combined AV/BWA business or its AV-only
business under the Original Spectrum Case.”*°*

Pursuant to the Tribunal’s letter dated November 13, 2017, the Respondent provided its views on
the Claimants’ alternative calculations within its April 26, 2018 submissions, including the

provision of a second supplemental expert report of Mr. Flores.% According to the Respondent,

Claimants’ alternate valuation remains surrealistic in both the inputs into their cash flows and
their use of an indefensible discount rate. As shown by Dr. Flores, the basic conclusion that
no reasonable assumptions exist that would lead to a positive net present value for the

proposed Devas business remain intact.*!

The Respondent considers that the Claimants do not properly address its argument that a DCF
valuation “is wholly inappropriate, as the proposed Devas business (...) had no track record of
profitability whatsoever.”*!' In this regard, the Respondent argues that the World Bank Guidelines
on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment, case-law and commentaries make clear that this
is the “quintessential example” of a case in which a DCF valuation should not be used,*!”
underscoring that the use of DCF was also rejected in the ICC Arbitration.*!? The Respondent
rejects the Claimants’ criticisms of such guidelines.*'* Moreover, the Respondent disagrees with
the Claimants’ contention that Devas “actually satisfies the objective criteria for a going concern

o9515

as laid out in the guidelines, arguing that the World Bank Guidelines refer to the operating

history of the business and not a preoperational business model.°!¢
Addressing the appropriateness of the “Original Spectrum Scenario,” the Respondent argues that

even proceeding on the assumption of only 60% military use of the spectrum in question,
there would be no basis for awarding compensation by taking 40% of the value that the Devas
business would have had (assuming that it had any value, which is not the case under any
reasonable assumptions) if there had been no essential security interests whatsoever, as that
would effectively ignore, and indeed contradict, the Tribunal’s finding that 60% of
Respondent's decision was justified by its essential security interests.*!”

 

According to the Respondent, this must be why the Claimants in their original submissions on
quantum, took the same approach as the Respondent and valued the proposed Devas business on

the basis that only 40% of the spectrum would be available to it.°!*

QUANTIFICATION

Besides disagreeing about the appropriate methodology for valuing the Claimants’ investment,
the Parties take different views on several aspects of the calculation of compensation, which have

a major impact on quantification.

1. The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants explain the calculation carried out by their experts as follows.

a. Reduced Spectrum Scenario

Applying the DCF method as described above (see Section VI.B.1), Mr. Sacks concludes that the
fair market value of Devas on the valuation date is USD 1.5 billion.*'? As set out above, in
application of the Market Approach, Mr. Bazelon concludes that Devas’ BWA segment has a fair
market value of approximately USD 1.7 billion in the Reduced Spectrum Scenario as of the

valuation date.*”°

As both approaches produce close results, Mr. Sacks averages them to obtain a value of USD 1.54
billion for the BWA segment. To obtain the total value of Devas’ business, Mr. Sacks adds USD
120 million corresponding to the AV segment’s value, and the resulting total value is USD 1.66
billion for the combined AV/BWA business.*?! Moreover, as described above, the Claimants’
experts also calculate Devas’ value for the alternative scenario of an AV services-only business

as amounting to USD 469 million.*”?

The Claimants’ experts have accepted two criticisms regarding their damages quantification that
had been put forward by the Respondent in its Counter-Memorial on Quantum, which leads to a
downward adjustment to their damages calculation of 7% in their Reply on Quantum.*”* This
downward adjustment results from the following corrections: Mr. Bazelon accepts that he had
mistakenly (i) modelled working capital equal to one month’s EBITDA instead of revenues; and

(ii) modelled bandwidth demand only based on IPTV data instead of also including the demand

for BWA traffic. The corrections lead to a combined reduction of USD 181 million to his DCF

value for Devas’ BWA/AV business in the Reduced Spectrum Scenario.*>
Pursuant to this downward adjustment, the total value of Devas’ BWA/AV business claimed by
the Claimants is USD 1.540 billion;*?° and Devas’ value for the alternative scenario of an AV

services-only business is USD 434 million.*””

In his third report, Mr. Sacks updates the amount of damages to which each of the Claimants is
entitled for the combined AV/BWA services business under the Reduced Spectrum Scenario
(according to their respective shareholdings in Devas) applying pre-award interest at the LIBOR
rate + 4% as of November 30, 2017; and concludes that CC/Devas and Telcom Devas are entitled
to USD 364 million each, and DEMPL is entitled to USD 74 million.*

He also updates the amount of compensation to which each Claimant would be entitled in the
AV-only case under the Reduced Spectrum Scenario applying pre-award interest at the LIBOR
rate + 4% as of November 30, 2017 and concludes that CC/Devas and Telcom Devas are entitled
to USD 103 million each, and DEMPL is entitled to USD 21 million.*”

The Claimants contest the findings of Mr. Flores. They consider that he attempts to maximise the
discount rate by adding risks that have already been accounted for in the cash flows. The
Claimants criticize that Mr. Flores affirms that “country risk” is absent (while the Claimants’
expert model is built on Indian-specific data) and that he adds a “size premium” (or “alpha’’)
(while this argument has been rejected in the literature and in recent investor-state cases).**°

531

Furthermore, the Claimants argue that he seeks to “load’”°*! cash flows with further, value-

depressing inputs which are not appropriate.*” According to the Claimants, Mr. Flores “should

have assumed that Devas would react like a rational economic actor and mitigate, if not
completely offset, the negative value of the same.”***

In particular, the Claimants defend their choice of discount rate and maintain that “only after there
are heavy reductions in Devas’s cash flows is the mature-company WACC used to discount to
present value (...) it is in fact inappropriate to include diversifiable risks in both the discount rate
and the cash flows, as Dr. Flores urges.”*** Thus, they request that “Dr. Flores’s plea to boost the
discount rate to account for risks already factored into the cash flows should be rejected.”**°

[emphasis in original]

The Claimants regard it as “inconceivable that a legitimate valuation of Devas would result in a
negative value, particularly in light of this Tribunal’s findings that even as of 2008, Devas had
considerable value based on DT’s USD 75 million investment and business resources for a 20%**°
equity stake.”**” [emphasis in original] The Claimants note the view of their expert, Mr. Sacks,
that, given the above-mentioned investment by DT, “the implied fair market value of Devas in
March 2008 was at least USD 375 million.”*** [emphasis in original] According to the Claimants,

the above-mentioned market value

is before taking into account the numerous synergies and in-kind contributions DT actually
contributed as a strategic investor, such as its experience in building state of the art terrestrial
communications networks capable of providing the most sophisticated BWA services, its
technical expertise, and its ability to obtain competitive pricing and purchasing power for all
of the necessary components of the ground network.** [emphasis in original]

Hence, the Claimants’ position is that DT’s investment in Devas on March 2008 constitutes a
“real-world transaction” which determines that Devas’ fair market value at that time “[wa]s
demonstrably greater than $375 million when the investment in-kind of Deutsche Telekom is

taken into account.”™ In particular, the Claimants dispute the Respondent’s argument (see

section 2 below) that the preferential character of the shares acquired by DT Asia could be of

significance in assessing the value of the transaction:**!

DT [Asia] did not obtain control of the board or the supervisory directors, and as a result, it
did not have the contractual right to trigger a liquidation and did not have the right to a
preference distribution at will.**

The Claimants underscore that the Respondent recognizes that “DT invested with full knowledge
that a WPC license would need to be obtained”™* but ignores that this has “profound value
implications.” According to the Claimants, “DT viewed Devas as an extremely valuable company

before it had even applied for a WPC license.”*“4 [emphasis in original]

Moreover, the Claimants argue that between March 2008 and February 2011 Devas’ value grew
over that period of time;* pointing to several “increased value-drivers,” including: the
obtainment of experimental licenses*“* and the development of experimental trials which
confirmed the viability of the Devas’ system;*‘” significant technological developments (like the
development of the LTE system and the emergence of e€MBMS technology);** and the “explosive
growth in demand for data services in India.”*“ According to the Claimants, “the only negative
event during this period was the action of Dr. Radhakrishnan in seeking to covertly recapture the
70 MHz of spectrum for India. As a matter of law, this negative event must be eliminated from
consideration in the “but for” case.”

Finally, the Claimants point out that Mr. Flores was also the testifying expert for Antrix before
the ICC Tribunal, which determined that his “no damages position” was “plainly unfounded and
unpersuasive.”**! The ICC Tribunal noted that in September 2009 “sophisticated investors made

a substantial further investment in’ Devas, which was “entirely inconsistent with” and

“rendered unpersuasive” Mr. Flores’ zero-dollar valuation.** Furthermore, the Claimants also

note that Mr. Flores

exclusively testifies in favour of sovereign defendants, often in cases where, as in the ICC
Arbitration, India’s current counsel is representing the sovereign in question. The close
alignment in past representations, together with the close alignment in his and India’s
assertions that there is “no value” or “no damages,” raises obvious questions about Dr.
Flores’s independence and impartiality.** [footnotes omitted]

 

b. Original Spectrum Scenario

Mr. Sacks concludes that Devas’ BWA segment value in the Original Spectrum Scenario on the
basis of his DCF analysis is USD 1,053 million.** He recalls that Mr. Bazelon’s valuation of the
same segment under the Original Spectrum Scenario following the Market Approach amounts to
USD 1,705 million.*°° He gives equal weight to both valuations and reaches an average fair
market value of Devas’ BWA segment as of the valuation date in the Original Spectrum Scenario

of USD 1,379 million.**”

Since there is no market comparable for the AV segment, he only calculates its fair market value
on the basis of DCF valuation, which results in USD 468 million.** Accordingly, the fair market
value of the combined AV/BWA business on the valuation date in the Original Spectrum Scenario

is USD 1,848 million.

Therefore, the value of Devas under the Original Spectrum Scenario is 20% higher than its
estimated value under the Reduced Spectrum Scenario, which amounted to USD 1.540 million.*
The Claimants consider that the “modest difference” is not surprising since Devas would be able
to essentially provide the same services under both scenarios at nearly the same projects costs.**!
He notes that the higher valuation in the Original Spectrum Scenario results from higher AV

revenues in rural areas, earlier AV revenues in urban areas and lower total terrestrial re-use fees,

all of which increase Devas’ value.* He also notes that Devas would have to incur the costs of
the AV terrestrial network and lease fees for the second satellite in the Original Spectrum

Scenario, which partially offset the abovementioned value-increasing factors.°

Mr. Sacks relies on Mr. Bazelon’s cash flow projections for an AV-only business to perform a
DCF valuation under the Original Spectrum Scenario and concludes that it would have a fair
market value of USD 631 million, which is 45% higher than the value of USD 434 million under
the Reduced Spectrum Scenario. In this case, “the cash flow projections exclude all BWA-
related revenues and costs and reflect the optimized AV architecture that would have been
possible if there was no need to coordinate it with an overlapping BWA network.”°° This larger

difference is explained because the Original Spectrum Scenario involves

the doubling of rural revenues (no longer subject to a 50% reduction in content caused by the
reduced amount of spectrum) and an earlier start of the AV services and the partially
offsetting increase in costs for the second satellite capacity reservation and lease fees.*

Mr. Sacks further notes that his understanding of the Tribunal’s instructions is that

it has been suggested that compensation could be calculated using the Original Spectrum
Case and multiplying it by 40% to reach a value of Devas (having allowed for those parts of
the taking that were judged to be covered by “essential security” interests”). I present no
opinion on the appropriateness of that approach, which I understand is a legal matter. If one
applies that method, however, 40% of Devas’s FMV as of February 17, 2011 is USD 739.1
million.°7

He notes that the Claimants are partial shareholders in Devas, so it is still necessary to calculate
compensation commensurate with their shareholding.*** He applies pre-award interest at the
LIBOR rate + 4% as of April 26, 2018; and concludes that CC/Devas and Telcom Devas are
entitled to USD 179 million each, and DEMPL is entitled to USD 37 million.”

Within the AV-only business valuation under the Original Spectrum Scenario, Mr. Sacks
concludes that 40% of its value is USD 252.4 million.°” He also calculates the amount of damages
to which each Claimant would be entitled on the basis of their shareholding and including pre-
award interest at the LIBOR rate + 4% as of April 26, 2018; and concludes that CC/Devas and
Telcom Devas are entitled to USD 61 million each, and DEMPL is entitled to USD 12 million.“

2. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent’s position is that “no award of compensation can be justified in this case.”*” In
addition to the criticisms to the Claimants’ experts’ valuation, which will be set out in the
following paragraphs, the Respondent criticises the Claimants’ reliance on the implicit USD 375
million dollar value of Devas on the basis of DT’s USD 75 million investment on March 2008.*7?

The Respondent underscores that

DT [Asia] was not a common shareholder (...) Its risk was very limited. It had preferred
dividend rights and preferred liquidation rights in case things went badly. It also knew that
no major capital expenditures would be made unless and until the licencing risks could be
overcome and the business case made. And, finally, they received those additional
protections I talked about in the form of representations and warranties from Devas.*”*

In the Respondent’s view, if a transaction were to be used to extrapolate the value of a business,

of shares in ber of 2009

it should be “a common share t ion, such as the p
(...) which was at $146 per share rather than the 2,645 per share for the DT transaction.”*” If
such a transaction is used to extrapolate the value of the business, the Respondent submits, the

result is about USD 22 million, rather than USD 375 million.*”°

The Respondent explains the calculations carried out by its expert, Mr. Flores, as follows.

a. Reduced Spectrum Scenario

The Respondent notes that the Claimants have not argued any specific compensation claim for
the violation of the FET standard,*”’ and points out that Chorzéw Factory “would only call for
reparation for the actual damage that was a direct consequence of the breach, not the consequences
of the legitimate act of the taking.”°’* In this regard, the Respondent quotes a scholarly article,

which points out:

[A] mere finding of a breach of due process at the time of the expropriation does not warrant
mechanically awarding the full value of the asset as of the date of the Award. Rather, when
applying the Chorz6w rule, tribunals should analyse what the actual damage sustained by the
injured party was as a direct consequence of the given procedural irregularity.°””

The Respondent notes that the Claimants have neither claimed nor proved that any treaty violation
occurred in this case which “would entitle them to compensation above and beyond the market
value of the property taken.”**°

More specifically, the Respondent contests the validity of the Claimants’ inputs to their cash flows
calculation. It notably criticizes the following aspects: (i) the Claimants have assumed a roll-out
of Devas’ services using terrestrial technologies which in 2011 and 2012 were in their infancies,
largely untested and not in commercial use anywhere in the world;**! (ii) they have assumed
population figures (which drive the number of customers and therefore impact revenues) which

582

would not have been available to a buyer on February 2011;°** (iii) while the Darwin model only
projected cash flows for 10 years, the Claimants have come up with projections of their own for
an additional 14-year period by simply assuming a 4.5% annual growth on the basis of India’s
GDP (data that is unrelated to the Darwin Model’s cash flows);** (iv) they have assumed that
working capital requirements should be equal to one month of revenues (and have further

miscalculated working capital relying upon EBITDA, which is a measure of profit rather than

revenues);** (v) they have updated the download speeds for BWA services assumed in the
Darwin Model to meet the requirements for broadband services recommended by TRAI, but did
not also assume that they would have to grow thereafter at a higher speed than that used in the
Darwin Model in order to reach the speed recommended by TRAI;** and (vi) they have assumed
a 50:1 “oversubscription ratio,” which is too high since in 2009 the TRAI issued guidelines

limiting the oversubscription ratio to 30:1.°°°

The Respondent contends that, if all these errors in inputs to the cash flows were corrected, this
would have a significant negative impact on Devas’ value.**’ However, the Respondent points
out that “the effect of these errors pales in comparison to the effect of the selection by the
Claimants’ experts of a grossly inadequate discount rate.”*** In the Respondent’s view, “there’s
no need to argue about cash flows if any reasonable discount rate would get you to a negative net
present value under [the Claimants’] own numbers.”**?

The Respondent strongly criticizes the adoption of a discount rate of just over 10% “on par with
the giants in the Indian telecommunications industry,” while Devas was “a start-up with no
customers and no infrastructure.”**° The Respondent notes that such an assumption is unjustified
because Devas’ business “was replete with risks and uncertainties that were far more extensive
and with implications far more profound than those that applied to incumbent players.”**!
Likewise, the Respondent criticizes that the Claimants’ experts purport to deal with those risks
by reducing the cash flows accounted for in their model, rather than adjusting the discount rate,
notably by (i) assuming an annual spectrum charge equal to that charged by Slovenian authorities
in Slovenia; (ii) adding a “pre-revenue adjustment”; (iii) assuming that after twenty-four years

Devas’ business would cease because Indian authorities would not negotiate a lease extension;

and (iv) assuming that India would require Devas to meet the build-out requirements for a
terrestrial system equivalent to those that a Pan Indian operator would have to achieve.*”

The Respondent contends that these adjustments to the projected cash flows (i) do not adequately
account for the risks inherent in the Devas’ business as a start-up company without customers or
infrastructure which was wholly dependent on the satellites’ launch; and (ii) are adjustments
which would have been required in any case and do not offset the real risks faced by Devas.** In
particular, the Respondent argues that only the “pre-revenue adjustment” would be an attempt to
deal with start-up risk, while the other three adjustments would have nothing to do with it and

would merely be part of the process of computing the cash flows.*™*

Specifically, the Respondent argues that the inclusion of a charge for build-out obligations is a
requirement that must be reflected in the projected cash flows in any event for the model to be
correct, so it is not apparent why it should be considered a “a risk-reducing adjustment”*”> to the
cash flows.*** Likewise, the Respondent asserts that the assumption that the inclusion of an annual
re-use fee found appropriate by a foreign regulator (i.e. Slovenia) is a risk-reducing adjustment is
without merit. Such annual fee is far below the upfront auction price which Indian regulators
would have charged, and no willing buyer would have treated the high probability of a spectrum
charge, which would have rendered the business non-viable, as mitigated by the inclusion in the

cash flows equivalent to a foreign fee.*””

The Respondent also rejects the Claimants’ qualification of the inclusion of “renegotiation risk”
as a “conservative assumption,” as there is no reason why a reasonable buyer would assume that
the Government would permit Antrix to lease the satellites for a further period, so the exclusion

of cash flows after year 24 is not a risk-reducing factor.°**

The Respondent also criticizes the application of a 39% “pre-revenue” reduction to the cash flows
in order to account for the increased risk related to the start-up nature of Devas.*” According to
the Respondent, a 39% pre-revenue adjustment is inadequate because it “assumes that only 39
percent of start-ups fail and 61 percent succeed.” In the Respondent’s view, however, “39 percent
grossly underestimates the start-up risk of failure.” The Respondent contends that the
Claimants have attempted to “to downplay that risk, but studies have shown that a substantial
majority of start-ups fail.”©"' Thus, in the Respondent’s view, such 39% pre-revenue adjustment

602

“grossly understates the start-up risk of failure’ and its only purpose is “to manufacture a

positive net present value despite the fact that any reasonable discount rate, taking out that 39

percent PRA, would yield a negative net present value.”

The Respondent relies on the analysis of Mr. Flores to prove that the Claimants’ analysis is
flawed. First, the study on which the Claimants’ experts rely warns that failure rates therein are
understated as many mergers and acquisitions are actually “disguised failures.”°* Second, the
application of a pre-revenue reduction does not circumscribe that risk and does not justify the use
of a discount rate commensurate with established companies, which is precisely what the
Claimants’ experts have done.**

In the Respondent’s view, the pre-revenue adjustment was not correctly implemented by the
Claimants, since “39 percent PRA has the same economic effect as increasing Brattle’s discount
rate from 10.3 percent to 13.4 percent. So that’s a 3.1 percent increase (...) nowhere near the rates

and the range (...) that venture capitalists routinely apply to account for start-up risk.”°°

In support of its position regarding the inadequacy of the Claimants’ discount rate, the
Respondent refers to the range of discount rates (from 26 to 34%) which Millennial Media
“considered appropriate for valuing their start-up” in a public filing.’ The Respondent

underscores that Millennial Media is a multi-media start-up which has Columbia Capital, “the

venture capital parent of one of these Claimants,” as its major shareholder, and Mr. Gupta (a
witness in the first phase of this proceedings) as a board member.*” Likewise, the Respondent
relies on Mr. Scheuermann’s witness statement in the DT Arbitration which, according to the
Respondent, recognised that start-up risks had to be accounted for in the discount rate.”
Reference is also made by the Respondent to the inclusion of “company specific risk premium”

on the discount rate by Mr. Kaczmarek in the ICC Arbitration.*!°

In sum, the Respondent points out that the Claimants’ experts seek to justify the application of a

discount rate ate with that to a large, d and successful company
by making so-called risk-reducing adjustments to the cash flows. However, the “risk” these
adjustments address is practically certain (such as the imposition of a build-out requirement), and
the adjustments do not address the actual risks faced by Devas (e.g., non-renewal of the lease on
the same terms after 12 years).°!!

The Respondent affirms that no willing buyer would have followed the unorthodox approach of
treating a start-up company as if it were an established, major player.°!? Rather, the Respondent
argues that the March 2008 transaction whereby DT Asia acquired 20% of equity in Devas, on
the implicit assumption of a discount rate of 31.5%, provides a useful indication of what would
be a realistic discount rate.

Mr. Flores calculates that a willing buyer, taking into account the risks Devas faced at the date,
would have applied a discount rate of 32.4%.°"* If such a discount rate is applied to the Claimants’
cash flows, without the pre-revenue adjustment but without making any other adjustments, Devas

would have had a negative value of USD 2.5 billion.

Moreover, the Respondent underscores that even if a discount rate of 21.1% is applied, as was put
forward by Devas’ expert (Mr. Kaczmarek) in the ICC Arbitration, a negative value of 1.5 billion

would be reached.°"* In fact, the Respondent claims that without changing the Claimants’ model

underlying assumptions, Devas’ business only obtains any positive valuation at a discount rate

below 15.8%.°1®

b. Original Spectrum Scenario

In his supplemental expert reports, Mr. Flores argues that “under a proper analysis of the Original

Spectrum Case, the Devas business had no value as of the valuation date.”°"”
Mr. Flores asserts that all the corrections to the Claimants’ experts’ cash flow projections which
he sets out in his second report “apply equally to the Reduced Spectrum Case and the Original

Spectrum Case.”*'* He contends:

The cumulative impact of these changes, even using Brattle’s unreasonably low discount rate,
yields a negative net present value (“NPV”) for Devas, Therefore, a prospective buyer would
not be interested in investing in the Devas business.°!”

Mr. Flores claims that if terrestrial spectrum fees (whether for 25 or 20 Mhz) were assessed using
an upfront fee commensurate with the 2010 BWA auction results, in accordance with the position
of the Indian regulators, the Claimants’ experts’ valuation would become negative, even
maintaining all their other assumptions.©°

Moreover, Mr. Flores recalls that he had also already proposed a discount rate which accounts for
start-up risk. He argues that “at any discount rate above 16.5%, the NPV of Devas in Brattle’s
Updated Model in the Original Spectrum Case becomes negative, without applying any of the
corrections to the cash flows” which he had argued for.*?! He also points out that applying the
discount rate considered appropriate by Devas’ expert in the ICC Arbitration (21.1%, which is
much lower than the implicit discount rate in the DT transaction) results in a negative NPV of

over a billion dollars.°”?

Regarding the Claimants’ experts’ AV-only business valuation, Mr. Flores also claims that there

are certain flaws in their projected cash flows in the Original Spectrum Scenario:

(i) Brattle incorrectly assumes that Devas would not have been charged an AV terrestrial
spectrum fee, and (ii) Brattle again incorrectly assumes that the first satellite was launched
in July 2010, with AV services beginning in October 2010.

He argues that the ISP license alone (which is the only one license accounted for by the Claimants’
experts in their DCF calculations for an AV-only business) would not be sufficient to develop
Devas’ proposed AV-only business since such services “would have been subject to other licenses
and fees that would have to be determined, as no license existed that would cover Devas’ proposed
services.”°*4 He recalls that Mr. Jain, Deputy Director General in the Data Services Wing of the
Department of Telecommunications and whose testimony has been submitted by the Respondent

(“Mr. Jain’), asserted in this regard:

If such service license(s) would have been brought into existence (...) the fees and charges
(...) would have included not only an annual license fee, but also a non-refundable entry fee
in order to provide its services (...) plus an upfront spectrum charge commensurate with
auction prices (...) plus annual spectrum charges equal to a percent of AGR (...) or an amount
based upon a formula that, inter alia, takes into account the spectrum used, the services
provided and the area covered.©5

Furthermore, he criticizes that the Claimants’ experts’ AV-only business valuation in the Original
Spectrum Scenario “is based on the obviously incorrect assumption that the satellites were
launched in July 2010 and that the AV services began in October 2010.”°° Mr. Flores contends
that one cannot carry out an economic valuation as of February 2011 assuming the occurrence of
events in 2010 which everyone knows did not occur.’ Therefore, even assuming the launch date
of July 2011 (which is the date used by the Claimants’ experts in the Reduced Spectrum Scenario),
this would move the launch of AV services one year forward to October 2011 and result in a
reduction of Devas’ AV-only business’ value of 11% in this scenario.°°* He also points out that
such a launch date would still be unrealistic as the launch did not actually occur until August

2015.5

As with respect to the scenario of a combined AV/BWA business, Mr. Flores also criticizes the
use of a 10.3% discount rate in the scenario of an AV-only business. He considers that rate

unreasonably low and inadequate for a start-up company. He notes that applying a discount rate

which includes start-up risk like the one implicit in the DT transaction (and excluding the 39%
pre-revenue adjustment) results in a negative value of USD 108 million in this scenario, even

accepting all other assumptions made by the Claimants as correct."

In sum, Mr. Flores explains that the conclusions in his second report remain unchanged if the
Original Spectrum Scenario applies: once appropriate corrections are made to the Claimants’ DCF
model, both Devas’ combined AV/BWA business and its AV-only business have no value.*!
Accordingly, he concludes that, on the alternative valuation approach, “40% of the value in the

Original Spectrum Case is still zero.”°*

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS
1. Introduction of Tribunal’s Analysis of Quantum

In its Award on Jurisdiction and Merits, the Tribunal determined that the interest held by Devas
under the Devas Agreement was a valuable asset.°*? The Tribunal’s objective now is to determine
the value of what was taken by India as of February 17, 2011 when the CCS made its decision to

cause the annulment of the Devas Agreement.

The summaries of the Parties’ positions in the immediately preceding section of this Award and
the evidence of their expert witnesses make it abundantly clear that the differences between the
Parties are vast. On the one hand, Claimants’ experts, Mr. Benjamin Sacks and Mr. Coleman
Bazelon, have opined that the full value of Devas,™ in the Original Spectrum case, was in the
order of USD 1.848 billion and, in the Reduced Spectrum Case, in the order of USD 1.540
billion.*> Mr. Daniel Flores, on the other hand, opined that in either scenario, Devas had no value

in February 2011 and was, arguably, worth as little as negative USD 2.5 billion.**

In order to determine to what extent the Tribunal should rely on either of these dramatically
differing opinions, the Tribunal will examine the underlying analyses performed by those experts.

Among other things, the Tribunal will consider the date of valuation and what valuation principles

to apply, whether the DCF approach to valuation can be utilized in this case, and whether a market
approach to value is helpful. Based on its examination of these issues, the Tribunal will seek to

determine a reasonable value for Devas as of the valuation date.

The valuation date and applicable valuation principles have already been addressed in section

IV.C above.

2. The DCF or Cash Method for Valuation

The Respondent has vigorously disputed the reliability of the DCF method for determining the
value of Devas as of February 17, 2011. It contends that this approach is “highly suspect in the
circumstances of this case, which involves a start-up company with no track record in a highly
regulated industry with significant risks and uncertainties.”°” This submission was further

developed in Respondent’s Rejoinder on Quantum. There, India submitted:

In its Counter-memorial on Quantum, Respondent pointed to the extreme sensitivity of
Claimants’ DCF model to even slight adjustments to its cash flow assumptions, highlighting
the inappropriateness of using the DCF methodology in this case. Respondent also showed
that the problem associated with this extreme sensitivity is exacerbated by the surrealistic
nature of the inputs in Claimants’ model, which not require slight adjustments but bare (sic)
no relationship to reality.°**

 

Referring to the decision in the Metalclad case, the Respondent highlighted that tribunal’s
conclusion: “[w]here the enterprise has not operated for a sufficiently long time to establish a
performance record or where it has failed to make a profit, future profits cannot be used to
determine going concern or fair market value (...) The Tribunal agrees with Mexico that a
discounted flow analysis is inappropriate in the present case because the landfill was never
operative and any award based on future would be wholly speculative.” ° The Respondent cites

other authorities to similar effect.“

India has also referred to the decision in the earlier ICC Arbitration involving Devas and Antrix
in which that tribunal, after reviewing the expert opinions before it on the potential value of Devas,
determined that it would not be appropriate to rely on a DCF methodology to value a company

such as Devas that did not have any earnings history.“! The ICC Tribunal considered that

although there were exceptional cases where relying on the DCF approach would be acceptable,

that case was not one of them. It further held that there were several matters that were not clear,

such as the future prices Devas would be able to charge for its services; markets for multi-media

broadcasting services could be highly innovative and even very profitable products and services

could quickly become obsolete; there was evidence that Devas would face significant competition

for the services that it proposed to provide. As a result, the ICC Tribunal found there was

“nothing” that could give it “sufficient confidence about the cash flows that Devas would have
earned but for Antrix’s wrongful repudiation of the Devas Agreement.”

In addition, the Respondent refers also to a number of other tribunal awards which rejected the

use of the DCF approach where, among other things, a claimant had not operated for a sufficiently

long time to establish a performance record or where it had failed to make a profit.

The Respondent contends that the Tribunal should also follow certain guidelines published by the

World Bank which state, in part:

6. Without implying the exclusive validity of a single standard for the
fairness by which compensation is to be determined and as an illustration of
the reasonable determination by a State of the market value of the investment
under Section 5 above, such determination will be deemed reasonable if
conducted as follows:

(i) _ fora going concern with a proven record of profitability, on the basis
of the discounted cash flow value;

(ii) for an enterprise which, not being a proven going concern,
demonstrates lack of profitability, on the basis of the liquidation value;

(iii) for other assets, on the basis of (a) the replacement value or (b) the
book value in case such value has been recently assessed or has been
determined as of the date of the taking and can therefore be deemed to
represent a reasonable replacement value

 

For the purpose of this provision:

- a “going concern” means an enterprise consisting of income-producing
ssets which has been in operation for a sufficient period of time to generate
the data required for the calculation of future income and which could have
been expected with reasonable certainty, if the taking had not occurred, to

continue producing legitimate income over the course of its economic life in

the general circumstances following the taking by the State;“+
Most critically, throughout this case the Respondent has disputed the Claimants’ assumption that
Devas would have successfully obtained the requisite licenses from WPC and, additionally, the
assumption that Devas would not have been required to pay spectrum fees commensurate with
auction values in accordance with the Indian regulators’ level playing field policy. If either or
both of these assumptions were misplaced, India says that would have, without more, “eliminated
any value of the proposed Devas business.”
These broad objections to the Claimants’ reliance on the DCF method rest primarily on the
Respondent’s contention that in other cases where there was reason to question the reliability of
projected cash flows, especially in the case of start-ups and other businesses without a proven

track record, numerous tribunals have ruled out such a methodology.“

The Claimants’ first answer to the Respondent’s arguments is that the question of whether the
DCF method is appropriate is not one that should be determined by legal precedent. Rather, they
say, the “sole legal dictate” is that Devas should be valued according to its “fair market value” at
the valuation date. Valuation, in that setting, is an economic question, i.e. what “price” would be
paid by “a hypothetical willing and able buyer and a hypothetical willing and able seller, both

acting at arm’s-length and being reasonably well-informed.” “”

The Claimants dispute the Respondent’s reliance on various legal authorities indicating that the
DCF method is not appropriate for valuing start-up companies.“* They contend that there are
numerous authoritative economics texts finding that a DCF analysis is a valid method of valuing
a pre-operational or early-stage business that does not have a history of profits, especially when
there are pre-existing business plans and cash flow projections that can be used as part of the DCF
analysis.“° For example, they quote Professor Marboe who observed: “A number of investment

tribunals applied an income valuation approach also without a track record. This is not only true

for cases where the valuation could be based on solidly formulated long-term contracts but also
in cases where the future profitability depended on economic circumstances, such as consumers’
demand and expenditures.” The Claimants contend that a number of arbitral decisions support the

use of a DCF analysis where there is reliable business data to support the cash flow assumptions.

In particular, the Claimants point to the facts here that there was a “solidly-formulated long term
contract” in the form of the Devas Agreement, there was explosive demand in India for the data
services that Devas would provide and the Darwin model supplied a reliable source of data
concerning the future business operations of Devas’ business.°°

The Claimants dismiss India’s reliance on the “World Bank Guidelines” as “fraught with issues.”
They say there has never been any reliable sign that business people use these “guidelines” in the
“real world.” Moreover, while the guidelines purport to say that DCF is not an appropriate
methodology for valuing pre-revenue companies, because they are not “going concerns,” Devas
is a going concern since it is operating and possesses income-generating assets (even though they
may be “pre-revenue”). It was an on-going business with “income producing assets” as at the

Valuation Date and had generated the necessary data for ascertaining future income.°*!

The Claimants say that using a DCF methodology in this case is appropriate because it is based
on cash flows contained in the 2009 Darwin model, up-dated to the valuation date by Mr. Bazelon
and adjusted to account for Devas’ reduced spectrum and major risks. Mr. Sacks has noted that
the 2009 Darwin model represents a rare and unique source of evidence about Devas’ value. “It
was developed by Devas’s management and DT, a seasoned operator, well before any dispute
with India arose, and represents Devas’s actual plans for the implementation of its business.”°?
In his third report, Mr. Sacks says Devas would be subject to the same risks as a mature telecom
company once it reached maturity and characterizes Devas as “a VC-backed startup between

early- and late-stage” development.*?

In Mr. Sacks’ opinion, the Darwin model cash flow projections “are substantially more reliable
than those of a typical DCF model for a pre-revenue company.” He identified some nine different

considerations that lead him to this conclusion. In summary, they are:

(a) The Darwin model was developed in the ordinary course of business (well before a
dispute arose between the parties);

(b) The cash flow projections were initially developed at a time when DT was considering
buying a stake in Devas, following which it invested an initial USD 75 million equity

advertising and retail distribution;

(g) DT reviewed and refined the Darwin model, including the specifics of the Indian
market, the cost of building the terrestrial network, the cost of maintaining and operating

it, and bandwidth forecasts;

(h) After its buy-in, DT committed significant resources and expertise to develop the Devas
business model which is reflected in the Darwin model; and

dG

Mr. Kim Larsen, a DT employee, was directly involved in the up-dating of the Darwin
model in the summer of 2009 and in his witness statement confirmed that he had, at that
time, “closely scrutinized” the cost of building the terrestrial network, the cost of
maintaining the terrestrial network, the cost of operating the terrestrial network, and
revenue-related drivers like the penetration rate.

534. As part of their income approach to valuation, Mr. Sacks and Mr. Bazelon discounted the adjusted

and projected cash flow figures derived from the Darwin model in order to take into account

certain perceived risks. These downward adjustments to the cash flows, it was said, accounted for

Devas’ “diversifiable risks,” specifically:

(a) A reduction of USD 363 million per year for the terrestrial re-use fee;
(b) A reduction of USD 2.4 billion for the Build-Out Requirement;

(c) Elimination of all cash flows after a 24-year period when the Devas Agreement is
assumed to be terminated; and

(d) A 39% reduction in every year’s cash flows to account for start-up risk (a pre-revenue
adjustment).°*

535. Based on these discounts for the so-called diversifiable risks, the Claimants’ experts submitted

that they were able to apply a discount rate to all of Devas’ future cash flows based on a WACC

of comparable mature telecommunications companies in India as of February 17, 2011. Mr. Sacks

opined that this rate was 10.3% (or 14.3% in nominal terms).°°>

It is unnecessary for the Tribunal to refer to the full panoply of arguments advanced by Mr. Flores.
These have been fairly summarized above in the presentation of his objections on this matter. In
essence, what he objected to, as described by him various ways, was the application of what he
said were inappropriate discount rates to unproven and speculative cash flows projected for
Devas. On the other hand, as already noted, Mr. Sacks defended the use of these projected cash

flows.

First of all, the Tribunal has come to the conclusion that it is appropriate in this case to use a DCF
analysis to establish the value of the value of Devas. In addition to the cases mentioned by the
Claimants and noted above, the Tribunal has noted another recent case which supports the
conclusion that using a DCF analysis can be appropriate in the present case. The Tethyan Copper
case concerned a mine development project without any track record of operations and with
development permits still to be obtained. Nonetheless, the Tribunal concluded that “a DCF
method can be reliably used in the instant case because of the commodity nature of the product
and detailed mining cash flow analysis previously performed.” Of course, the intended product
in this case was not a commodity in the usual sense of the term; it was a service, but a service
with some commodity features (a much-in-demand service, rather standard in nature from the
point of view of users). Moreover, just as in the mining sector, there exists a tested methodology
common to all telecom service sellers applied to value their business. The Tribunal is satisfied

that such methodology has been applied in this case.

The Tribunal has carefully reviewed the greatly differing opinions of the Parties’ experts. It should
be observed that establishing a value for Devas necessarily involves certain hypothetical
assumptions concerning what might have happened “but for” the intervention of India in February

2011.

The Tribunal considers, however, that there are a number factors showing that the DCF method
is more dependable in this case than it may have been in many of the legal authorities cited by the

Respondent. Among these are the following:

(a) The DT transaction in March 2008 was an arms-length transaction entered into after
extensive due-diligence by the parties. The imputed value for Devas, based on DT
Asia’s USD 75 million investment was USD 375 million. While that figure represented
a significant discount from what the assumed cash flows at the time implied was the

value of Devas, it was undoubtedly a good indication of the minimal value of Devas

as of that date. Importantly, it showed that DT, a sophisticated, knowledgeable

international enterprise was willing to throw in its lot with and take a minority position
in Devas;

(b) The Claimants fairly demonstrated that Devas did not lose value after March 2008. On
the contrary, it is clear that upon DT Asia acquiring a significant stake in Devas, the
synergies of that development added considerable value to it. DT’s expertise, access to
technological cutting edge developments and its resources for planning and overseeing
the implementation of Devas’ business plan added a strong element of viability to its
prospects;

=

With the granting of the experimental license in 2009 and the granting of the IPTV
license, Devas’ prospects were improved even further. It is understood, of course, that
these licenses were merely stepping stones toward the ultimate licensing that Devas
would need from WPC after the satellites were launched. But, it is fair to observe that
they were a good indicator that Indian authorities were not opposed to Devas’ project;

(d) Even though WPC would need to address a form of licensing for terrestrial re-use which
until then had not been formally undertaken in India and even though India’s level
playing field policy no doubt applied to overall use of public resources, the Tribunal
agrees with Mr. Bazelon that it is probable that internationally accepted practices would
have guided Indian regulators in dealing with the hybrid circumstances that applied to
the BWA derived from Devas’ satellite sourced spectrum;

(e) Critically, Devas had a unique capacity on the expected satellites, namely its “box out”
position that meant, practically speaking, that its lease with Antrix created an
extraordinary opportunity;

(f) The Tribunal likewise agrees with Mr. Bazelon’s opinion that India’s regulators would
not have deliberately simply neutralized such a valuable and important source of
spectrum because of prior policy making in telecommunications;

(g) Devas had, by early 2011, become something more than merely a start-up company
with no prior history. It had been in existence since early 2005 and had worked
diligently with DT to develop its cash flow analysis and to plan for the eventual launch
of the satellites that would carry its S-band broadcast capacity across India. The
projected cash flows had been subjected to expert scrutiny. Notably, Devas’ business
plan was developed quite independently and well ahead of the claim that is now before
the Tribunal;

(h) During the quantum phase of this case, further information from the records of DT came
to light which included that company’s due diligence in relation to its 2008 investment.
Among other things, these materials showed that DT was aware of some of the risks on
which India relies in this case to show that Devas’ prospects had to be significantly
discounted. The Tribunal concludes, however, that those materials also demonstrate that
despite DT’s awareness of those risks, it proceeded with its investment in Devas; and

(i) DT itself when making its investment in Devas, utilized the DCF method in arriving at
values that could be used in its investment decision making. It seems highly likely to

Board.” [internal footnotes omitted]

the Tribunal that a prospective, hypothetical arms-length purchaser of Devas in

February 2011 would have employed a DCF method in determining what value to

ascribe to this business.
The Tribunal is persuaded that Devas and its significant shareholder, DT Asia, were justified in
expecting Devas was “likely to yield economic benefits.”°*” Not only was the Darwin Model a
reliable source of data, developed in the ordinary course of business, the Tribunal further finds
there was a “solidly-formulated long-term contract” in the Devas Agreement, all in the context of
explosive demand in India for the data services Devas was expecting to provide.°*
As Mr. Sacks has noted, the 2009 Darwin model represents a rare and unique source of evidence
about Devas’ value. “It was developed by Devas’s management and DT, a seasoned operator,
well before any dispute with India arose, and represents Devas’s actual plans for the
implementation of its business.”®° Accordingly, in the opinion of the Tribunal, based on projected
cash flows contained in the 2009 Darwin model, up-dated to the valuation date by Mr. Bazelon
and adjusted to account for Devas’ major risks, the underlying data derived from the Darwin
Model provides a dependable business case of what a reasonable, arms-length investor may have

considered in a hypothetical purchase of Devas in February 2011.

Beyond that preliminary determination, however, the Tribunal recognizes that the Respondent’s
expert, Mr. Flores, criticizes practically all aspects of Mr. Sacks’ DCF methodology, consistently
expressing his view that, as earlier noted, Devas had either no value or even negative value as at

the Valuation Date.

As a next step in its analysis, therefore, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to examine the
differing views of the experts on applying the DCF method in this case. The Tribunal’s objective
is to determine, as well as possible, what weight to give to these differing views and, in particular,
which approach might be relied upon in drawing conclusions as to the quantum of the damages
to be awarded in this case. In doing this, the Tribunal does not feel obliged to review in complete

detail the full debate between the experts for the parties concerning their differing opinions.

The Tribunal recognizes, however, that there are a number of basic questions arising from those

differing opinions. In its discussion, the Tribunal proposes to examine these questions:

(a) What would be an appropriate discount rate to apply to the projected cash flows of
Devas?

(b) Should the cash flows relied upon by Claimants’ experts be subject to additional
discounting for start-up risk or country risk?

(c) Is 61% a reasonable probability of success for Devas as of the Valuation date?

(d) Is a 4.5% growth rate a reasonable factor to apply to the second 12 year term for the
Devas Agreement?

(e) Is there an appropriate “reasonableness test” by which to test the results produced by

the DCF method of valuation?
The Tribunal’s objective is not necessarily to answer each of these questions definitively, as a
professional evaluator might. Rather, the Tribunal seeks to identify the strengths and weaknesses
of the experts’ opinions and, where appropriate, to draw conclusions on the extent to which it may
adopt any of those opinions. In doing this, the Tribunal intends to highlight some of the important

differences between the experts and to observe, in particular, their methodological disagreements.

After satisfactorily identifying a dependable cash flow, valuators using the DCF method must
determine the discount rate which, when applied to those cash flows, may best approximate their
present value. These are the fundamental building blocks of the DCF evaluation method. We turn
first to the discount rate advanced by Mr. Flores, the Respondent’s expert. He calculates that the
discount rate implicit in the DT transaction in March 2008 was 31.5%. He derives that figure
from the fact that DT Asia invested USD 75 million, representing 20% of the equity of Devas at
the time. DT’s initial investment was based on the cash flow projections developed in the Series

C Model.

Mr. Flores uses the information in the DT transaction to derive a discount rate for Devas in
February 2011. To do this, he initially calculates what he calls “an appropriate discount rate for
an established Indian telecommunications company as of March 2008, ultimately arriving at
15.3%” ®? Next, he subtracts the discount rate for an established Indian telecommunications
company, 15.3%, from the discount rate implicit in the DT transaction, 31.5%, resulting in a rate
of 16.2% that he says reflects the “start-up” risk implicit in the DT transaction. As he explains,

“[t]his 16.2% represents the risks specific to Devas assessed in the DT transaction, including the

additional regulatory risk faced by Devas compared to the telecommunications industry in general

and the probability of Devas’ failure.”°*

Mr. Flores then calculates what he says is the appropriate discount rate for an established Indian
telecommunications company as of February 2011, 16.2%. Finally, he adds his estimated start-
up risk of February 2011, 16.2%, to the discount rate for an established Indian
telecommunications company as of February 2011, 16.2%. This yields “‘a discount rate for Devas
as of February 2011 of 32.4%.” Mr. Flores applies this rate and certain other discounts to the
projected cash flows, leading ultimately to his conclusion that Devas had no value as of February

2011.

Mr. Flores supports his analysis by referring to the various risks that he said would have impacted
Devas’ value in February 2011. He disagrees with Brattle that Devas was by then a late stage
start-up company that had already attained significant milestones. In his view, there were a
number of reasons to assume that the start-up risk was even higher than the discount rate implicit
in the DT transaction in March 2008.°° In February 2011, there was as yet no satellite launched
and no operating licence from the WPC. There were, in addition, unresolved cost and regulatory
issues regarding the use of terrestrial spectrum. Operational and other risks included potential
reliance on a DVB-SH network that had not yet been tested commercially, a longer payback
period than DT anticipated in March 2008, possible spectrum reassignments and demand
uncertainty. Finally, there was the further fact that Devas had made only minimal capital

investments up until then.%°

Mr. Sacks rejects this entire approach, characterizing Mr. Flores’ method as “flawed,” adding that

the result was “incorrect and unreasonable.” Mr. Sacks says “the main shortcomings are:

(a) Dr. Flores again includes diversifiable risks in the discount rate;

(b) Dr. Flores undervalues Devas in 2008 by ignoring the effect of DT’s in-kind
contributions and synergies; and

(c) The resulting 31.5% discount rate is rejected by the sources Dr. Flores claims support
it."

Award on Quantum
Page 129 of 163
Mr. Sacks expanded on these summary points, pointing out that Mr. Flores’ analysis of the DT
transaction appears to assume that DT received no value or compensation for the synergies it
created and that, “all of the value brought to the enterprise by DT was captured by Devas’ existing
owners.” Mr. Sacks says Mr. Flores assumes that the value of DT Asia’s equity in March 2008
was equal to the cash it invested and nothing more. Instead, he says that the fair market value of
Devas in March 2008 was substantially more than the implied value of USD 375 million following
DT’s investment. When the synergies and in-kind contributions are considered, he says that
after DT’s investment, the value of Devas was “far above $375 million.”°”
Mr. Sacks additionally says Mr. Flores’ 31.5% or 32.4% discount rates are contradicted by the
very authority he purports to rely on, namely Professor Damodaran.®' Contrary to what Mr.
Flores claims, Mr. Sacks says he in fact relied on the wrong figures from Professor Damodaran’s
paper. Mr. Flores cites figures to show what he considered to be realistic discount rates, but Mr.
Sacks points out that those figures were taken from a table illustrating what Professor Damodaran
called “The Dark Side of Valuation,” (i.e. erroneous discount rates used by analysts by mistake
because they included “survival risks”),? compared to what he called, “The Light Side of
Valuation.”* In this regard, Mr. Sacks observes that evaluators sometimes erroneously include
“survival risks” in their discount rates instead of treating them separately, as Mr. Sacks says he

has done.°

The Tribunal has determined that it will not accept Mr. Flores’ methodology for determining the
discount rate to be applied to Devas’ projected cash flows. The 31.5% rate implicit in the DT
transaction appears to be largely affected by circumstantial considerations which do not, in the
opinion of the Tribunal, fairly reflect the fullness of the DT transaction. In particular, the Tribunal
agrees with Mr. Sacks that Mr. Flores appears to overlook the synergies and in-kind contributions
along with other non-financial contributions created by DT’s investment in Devas in 2008. These

include such things as employee expertise and experience, purchasing and procurement power,

on-going state-of-the-art research and technical expertise. All of these contributions by DT

undoubtedly added substantial value to Devas and credibility to its prospects.

Moreover, it is evident that in 2008, DT had significant bargaining power in relation to Devas.
Relatively speaking, Devas was at that point a small enterprise compared to DT, a world-wide
telecommunications giant. Devas stood to gain enormously from DT’s involvement, an advantage
that DT undoubtedly relied on when coming to agreement with Devas. Given this uneven
bargaining power, the Tribunal is not persuaded that it should rely on an implied discount rate
derived from this transaction without further refinement and adjustments. Mr. Flores’ opinion that
the implied discount rate in the DT transaction reflected a very large start-up risk factor equal to

over half of the implied rate seems unlikely to the Tribunal.

Finally, it appears that Mr. Flores did not further evaluate the data he derived from the projected
cash flows developed in the Series C Model to reflect the probability of Devas’ success or failure.
The Tribunal notes that the 31.5% implicit rate computed by Mr. Flores, being derived from
unadjusted cash-flows, cannot be applied to the probability-adjusted cash-flows relied on by the
Claimants’ experts. In any case, Mr. Sacks persuasively shows that neglecting probabilities in the
cash-flows leads to inflated discount rates, thereby skewing the results. Mr. Flores simply
attributed the difference in discount rates between the implicit rate for the DT transaction and that
of an established Indian telecommunications company to start-up risk. The Tribunal is not

persuaded that this methodology reliably sets an appropriate discount rate.

This determination still leaves open the question whether the 10.3% discount rate chosen by
Claimants’ expert is an appropriate one.°” In order to make a determination on that issue, the
Tribunal considers it necessary to review further the underlying methodology employed by the

Brattle Group.

Mr. Sacks extensively explains the basic methodology by which he and his colleague, Mr.
Bazelon, derive cash-flows and a discount rate for purposes of their DCF analysis. This
methodology is at the heart of significant disagreements between the Parties’ experts. Mr. Sacks

and Mr. Bazelon implemented their methodology as follows:

(a) The Brattle experts begin their evaluation exercise by accepting the validity of the cash
flow projections produced through the collaboration between Devas personnel and the
DT team.° The Darwin Model, described elsewhere, was the product of extensive
collaboration between Devas and DT, updated to 2009. Mr. Bazelon adjusts the ten

which he rounded to 10.3%.

years’ of cash flow projections found in the Darwin Model, to reflect “projected free
cash flows for the ten-year period following the Valuation Date.”*” This included up-
dating the Darwin Model to February 2011 to reflect additional capital expenses;

(b) Mr. Sacks and his colleague then adjust the projected cash flows in the Darwin Model
in order to take account of various risks. Mr. Sacks accepts that Devas faced several
cash flow risks that were not expressly accounted for in the Darwin Model cash flow
projections. These included the risk of a costly Build-Out Requirement being imposed
on Devas as a condition of it obtaining a terrestrial re-use license, the risk of India
imposing a Terrestrial Re-Use Fee that would have been higher than in keeping with
international norms and stated Indian policy, risks inherent in a pre-revenue company
such as Devas potentially failing for business, technical, regulatory or other reasons
before the anticipated cash flows materialized and, finally, the risk that the Indian
government would not have renewed the Devas Agreement on commercially viable
terms upon expiry of its two twelve-year terms, contrary to “international norms”
(“Renegotiation Risk”);°”

(c) Mr. Sacks says he accounts for these various risks by adjusting the projected cash flows
as opposed to attempting to reflect them in the discount rate ultimately applied to the
cash flows. Here he draws a distinction between diversifiable risks and non-
diversifiable risks. The former are risks that are specific to the company or enterprise
being evaluated whereas systemic risks or non-diversifiable risks are risks affecting
investments across a broad sector covering different markets, types of investment and
companies. In Mr. Sacks’ opinion, it is critical for evaluators to make adjustments for
diversifiable risks to cash flow projections rather than endeavoring to reflect them in
the discount rate.°” To do otherwise, as proposed by Mr. Flores, for example, would be
contrary to best practices. As Mr. Sacks states, “[i]ncluding diversifiable risks in a
discount rate is not just a violation of economic principles; it renders that discount rate
useless for valuation;’”°°

(d) Mr. Sacks’ risk adjustments include utilizing the Terrestrial Re-Use Fee of some USD
361.7 million calculated by Mr. Bazelon to reflect his view that such a licence would
have been granted, but at the high end of fees assessed in international practice.
Specifically, on counsel’s instruction, Mr. Bazelon assumes India would have imposed
the highest observable fee internationally for terrestrial re-use and, further, that India
would also have imposed a Build-Out Requirement obliging Devas to develop AV
services in areas that would not otherwise be commercially attractive;

(e

In terms of the Renegotiation Risk, Mr. Sacks says he models this risk in “the most
conservative manner possible. I assume India would demand a fee so large that either
Devas would decide not to operate, or would earn almost no profit after paying the fee.
That is, I assume no cash flows at all after the expiration of the twenty-four year
period;”*?

(f) With respect to the survival/failure risk, Mr. Sacks applies a Pre-Revenue Adjustment,
or PRA. The cash flow projections derived from the Darwin Model, as briefly described,
above, are adjusted to account for the chance of Devas’ possible failure. In order to
justify his taking account of probabilities, Mr. Sacks refers to the Venture Capital (VC)
industry in which it is common practice to factor in the probability of failure. In this
regard, Mr. Sacks says:

Devas was a venture capital-backed firm and such risks are common in the
venture capital world. To evaluate their investment opportunities, which are
necessarily immature, investment-stage firms, venture capital (*VC’) funds
have developed a standardized two-step approach for adjusting their
valuations of investment-stage firms to account for the risks posed by such
firms;

Mr. Sacks says that in order to account for the start-up nature of the business, “investors
calculate the Expected Exit value by multiplying the Exit Value by the probability of a
successful exit.”°**

(g) Having variously adjusted the cash-flows for what are, to him, specific risks, Mr. Sacks
applies to the projected (adjusted) cash flows a discount rate that takes account of non-
diversifiable risk.

(h) In determining the potential risk of failure for Devas, Mr. Sacks cites an in depth study
of over 600 Venture Capital firms, including “the frequency with which their
investments succeeded or failed.” That study also considered data provided in relation
to a Dow Jones database that tracks the performance of VC funds and their
investments. In Mr. Sacks’ opinion, by February 2011, “Devas was somewhere
between a late ‘early stage’ company and an early ‘late stage’ company. While it still
had no revenues, it had already advanced through a number of important technical and
financial milestones that place[d] it further along than a typical early-stage firm.”’
Having regard for Devas achieving these milestones, Mr. Sacks estimated Devas’
“probability of failure” was 39%.°** Although the study on which Mr. Sacks relies, led
by Professor Gompers, was based on US data, Mr. Sacks further verified his estimated
probability of success or failure for Devas by reference to Indian data;*°

684 Sacks IV 29. An examination of the Excel file provided by the Claimants (BR-286) shows that Mr. Sacks

(i) Based on his assessment of Devas’ risk of failure, Mr. Sacks makes a Pre-Revenue
Adjustment of 39%.°° In other words, he reduces the projected cash flows by this
percentage.

 

Another area where significant differences of opinion emerged concerns Mr. Sacks’ assumption
of a terminal growth rate of 4.5% for the cash flows following year ten. He assumes that free cash
flows would grow at a constant annual rate, an assumption, he observes, that “is commonly made
when using the DCF valuation technique. It implies that after the end of the explicit projection
period, the company would neither gain nor lose market share and that the industry size would
not decline relative to the overall economy.”°*!

Mr. Sacks estimates the growth rate based on long-term expectations of real GDP growth for
India. “As of 2011, the IMF was projecting that the Indian real GDP would grow at an average of

8.1% per year through 2016.”° He contends that at the same time, a mature economy like that
of the United States was expected to grow at approximately 2.5% real growth rate. While
acknowledging that this projected rate of growth for India was unlikely to be maintained, he
concludes that the Indian economy would have continued to outpace advanced economies while
undergoing a gradual convergence between its emerging economy and those of more mature ones.
“To reflect this long-run convergence, I assume an expected real GDP growth rate of 4.5%, which
is about one percent less than the mid-point of the medium-term Indian GDP expected growth
rate and the stable U.S. growth rate.”

Mr. Flores disagreed with Mr. Sacks’ analysis, claiming his use of an average of the projected
GDP growth rates through 2016 for India and the U.S. was “completely arbitrary.”°* Mr. Flores’
opinion is that the rate of population growth for India would be a better guide on the basis that
the “projected cash flows are driven by the projected growth in population,” not GDP. Mr.
Sacks rejects this criticism, remarking that all available data suggested Indian GDP would grow
faster than its population and so would firms in that economy.®® Moreover, Mr. Sacks says future
cash flows for Devas would be more influenced by such things as “the Terrestrial Re-Use fee

(large and steady outflow), the growth in Devas’s penetration rate (a slow increase), and the

timing of capital expenditure (large initial outflow and then periodic outflows), and the timing of

capital expenditure (large initial outflow and then periodic outflows).”°”

Additionally, Mr. Flores says that extending the Darwin model from 2020 to 2023 shows a 0.5%
growth rate, thereby demonstrating that the 4.5% rate estimated by Mr. Sacks was a “fudge factor”
and not reliable.®* Mr. Sacks likewise rejects this criticism, pointing out that the original Darwin
Model considers a range of terminal growth rates ranging from 4.5% to 8.5%."

The experts continued their disagreement in their next round of reports. In his third report, Mr.
Flores proposes a “correction” to the cash flow projections postulated by Mr. Bazelon and Mr.
Sacks to reflect a growth rate lower than Mr. Sacks’ figure based on an Indian GDP growth rate
of 4.5%.™ In his answer to this proposed “correction,” Mr. Sacks says, among other things, “I
assume that Devas would grow at the same rate as Indian GDP from years 11 to 24—meaning
Devas would neither gain nor lose market share and the industry size would neither grow nor
decline as a share of the economy.”””! Mr. Sacks reiterates that he only uses the terminal growth
rate for years 11 to 24 and thereafter makes what he calls “the highly conservative assumption
that Devas would have no value whatsoever (even though firms can, and do, have perpetuity
value).”77

In order to determine the proper discount rate, Mr. Sacks refers to the CAPM. This model
identifies a base rate (the so-called “risk-free rate”), to which must be added a risk premium; the
risk premium itself is a function of the systematic risk of the company (its undiversifiable risk),
and of the market risk premium. The systematic (or undiversifiable) risk of a company is
represented by what is called the Beta coefficient, a statistical measure expressing the co-
variability between the returns on a given stock and the returns on a stock market index. By the
time of Mr. Sacks’ fourth expert report, significant differences between him and Mr. Flores had

arisen about the proper methodology by which to determine the components of the discount rate.

One of the points of significant disagreement between Mr. Sacks and Mr. Flores was whether and,
if so, how to apply a discount for country risk. Mr. Sacks says that, “to calculate the discount rate,

T account for India’s country risk by using data entirely from India—Indian stocks prices, Indian

telecom companies, Indian risk measures and correlations, Indian inflation, and Indian interest
rates—and not ‘fudge factors’.””°? The latter reference is taken from a warning by the authors of
a learned study on evaluation, one that Mr. Sacks calls the “leading textbook on corporate
finance.” In their work, Principles of Corporate Finance, Professors Brealy, Myers, and Allen,
admonish valuators not to give in to the temptation to add “fudge factors to the discount rate to
offset things that could go wrong with the proposed investment. Adjust cash-flow forecasts
first.”7° With respect to country risk premiums, these authors, “warn against adding fudge factors
to discount rates for projects in developing economies. Such fudge factors are too often seen in
practice.”7°°

Mr. Sacks’ position is that the discount rate derived from Indian data is materially higher than the
discount rate observed for US wireless companies because it “includes the systemic risks present
in India but not the United States, as applicable for telecom companies.” He concludes that
adding any additional “risk premiums” to the model would be improper because, in his view, it
would result in a form of “double counting,” i.e. the same risk factors being applied twice to the

cash flows.

In this discussion, the Tribunal’s objective, as previously stated, is to weigh qualitatively the
potential appropriateness of relying on various elements highlighted in these strongly differing
opinions. Broadly speaking, the Tribunal is persuaded that the Brattle approach to DCF valuation
is appropriate and fairly reflects well-accepted valuation principles and standards. The Tribunal
accepts the suitability of the DCF valuation approach in the circumstances of this case and

determines that it may rely upon this approach even for valuing Devas as of February 2011.

The Tribunal has, however, certain reservations about some of the positions taken by Mr. Sacks
and Mr. Bazelon within their VC-inspired model. These reservations do not mean that the DCF
method for valuing Devas should be rejected. On the contrary, the Tribunal’s view, as stated
above, is that this method may be relied upon. However, in the view of the Tribunal, it is necessary

to consider certain modifications to the conclusions of Mr. Sacks and Mr. Bazelon.

With respect to Mr. Sacks’ assumption of a terminal growth rate of 4.5% for years ten and

onwards, the Tribunal appreciates that a valuator must apply judgement to such projections. In

addition, the Tribunal understands Mr. Sacks’ effort to tie this projection to the anticipated growth
in Indian GDP. That being said, the Tribunal is wary of the geometrical progression of some
fourteen years of unmitigated growth compounded between year ten and year 24. There is no
doubt that the opportunity facing Devas in February 2011 was a very significant one. And, of
course, the probability of Devas’ success or failure is something to be separately assessed.
Nevertheless, the Tribunal is uneasy with the relentless application of a terminal growth rate of
4.5% to Devas’ projected revenues after year ten. It would prefer to modify this figure by as much
as, say 0.5%, down to a 4.0% growth rate simply on general principles of being cautious about
such a longer term prediction of future events that were basically unknowable at the time of

valuation.

On a common sense basis, in fact, the Tribunal presumes that Devas’ growth rate over that
fourteen year period may have logically been expected to be higher than these rates at the earlier
stages of its existence and somewhat lower by the end of this interval. The Tribunal’s impression
is that in high tech industries, over time, even though demand for such services may continue to
grow, results for participants may tend to level off as competition intensifies. In any event, the
Tribunal remains uncomfortable with Mr. Sacks’ assumption of long term unvarying real growth.
The Tribunal therefore finds that there is some room for doubt about the constant application of

the 4.5% growth rate as Mr. Sacks has done in this case.

It is evident that in the VC Method of valuation, the valuator’s analysis of the probability of
success or failure is a very significant factor that may greatly influence the ultimate outcome of
the valuation. In addition to factoring in the burdens of the Build-Out requirement and a relatively
expensive Re-Use Fee and additionally projecting no value for Devas at the end of the second 12
year term, as we have earlier noted, Mr. Sacks makes a 39% PRA or pre-revenue adjustment to
the projected cash flows in his model. The Tribunal accepts that Mr. Sacks followed accepted
practice, even best practice, in making such an adjustment to cash flow as opposed to attempting
to make any additional adjustment to the discount rate itself. The Tribunal resists, however, fully

accepting Mr. Sacks’ opinion on the amount of pre-revenue adjustment he makes.

Mr. Flores challenges Mr. Sacks’ opinion on the probability of success for Devas and how to
apply it. Citing Business Employment Dynamics data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
(“BLS”), he claims Mr. Sacks’ 39% failure rate is very low compared with established firms.”

In defence of his position, Mr. Sacks, among other things, points out that he takes into account

that by February 2011, Devas had existed for six years.” In footnote 126 in his Second Report,
Mr. Sacks says, “Mr. Viswanathan became the CEO of Devas in January 2005.”7"° Therefore,
based on the date of first employment, Devas was six years old as of February 2011.” Mr. Sacks
asserts that in every industry, establishments exhibit declining annual failure rates as they age.
Thus, the presumed age of Devas for purposes of possibly placing it properly in the context of the
Bureau of Labor Statistics referred to by Mr. Flores has significance. In the opinion of the
Tribunal, in terms of actual operational existence, it would seem more accurate to treat Devas as,
say, a four year old company rather than a six year old company. No doubt, Mr. Viswanathan was
employed as early as the beginning of 2005, but the real business of operating as a company seems
only to have occurred quite gradually over the next couple of years. The Tribunal accepts Mr.
Sacks’ view that, “[o]nly the difference between the heightened start-up risk and the mature risk
should be adjusted for.” 7!' Even so, the Tribunal has some reservation as to Mr. Sacks’ evaluation

of the risks of success or failure of Devas as at the date of valuation.

As briefly described earlier, Mr. Sacks concludes that by February 2011, Devas was “somewhere
between a late ‘early stage’ company and early ‘late stage’ company.””!? The Tribunal generally
agrees with that characterization and accepts that Mr. Sacks has fairly acknowledged Devas’
achievement of specific milestones and four rounds of financing, including funding from an
important strategic partner. However, the Tribunal views those accomplishments in the context
that real, practical operational activity had not yet begun. True, the experimental licenses had been
obtained and operated and the ISP license had also been obtained, but the WPC licence had not
yet been issued and no on-the-ground activity had as yet taken place. The Tribunal does not agree

e713

with Mr. Flores that Devas was, by February 2011, still “just an idea. Tt was more than that,

but likely not quite as far advanced as Mr. Sacks considered it to be.

The Tribunal acknowledges the difficulty a valuator has in determining a success/failure
probability: available statistics are sample dependent, vary from one industry to the next and show
that the probability of success is often not stable, but increases over time for survivors. Ideally,
the PRA should be made time-dependent, but the Tribunal must content itself with a single
probability to be applied to the entire series of projected cash-flows; this probability should be

representative of the average probability of success/failure of Devas given the stage at which it

found itself in February 2011. The Tribunal accepts that Devas was still at the pre-revenue stage
of its existence. It had tremendous prospects, but it was a young and somewhat untried company.
Its earlier successes at raising capital and attracting a major strategic partner should not obscure
the fact that it also faced significant technical, regulatory and commercial challenges as of
February 2011. Accordingly, the Tribunal remains uneasy with a 61% probability of success (the
converse of Mr. Sacks’ estimate of the probability of failure). That figure seems somewhat
optimistic in the full circumstances prevailing at the time. At the same time, the Tribunal is not
comfortable with the classification of Devas as an early-stage start-up. The Tribunal agrees with
Mr. Sacks’ opinion that by the Valuation date in February 2011, Devas was somewhere between
a late “early stage” company and an early “late stage” company.”* Relying on Professor
Gompers’ study, Mr. Sacks observes, “[u]sing VentureSource data, the failure rate for late-stage
firms is 39% while for early-stage firms, it is 49%.”’!> Logically, and having regard for these
ranges, the Tribunal finds that an intermediate probability of success of around 58% (failure rate
of about 42%) seems more appropriate than Mr. Sacks’ opinion of 61% probability of success

(failure rate of 39%).

The Tribunal next considers the question of whether it is good valuation practice to discount some
or all of the negative cash flows occurring in the early years of Devas’ development. In his written

reports7!®

and during his testimony at the Hearing on Quantum, Mr. Flores argued that negative
cash-flows should not be adjusted for the probability of success or failure because, regardless of
its success or failure, Devas would have made these early expenditures in order to determine
whether or not it was worth continuing the business. In other words, until Devas had a “proven
product” and was actually selling services to urban customers, the negative cash flows should not

have been probability-adjusted.

The Claimants’ expert disagreed. Mr. Sacks stated, “[a]lthough this criticism may be correct in
principle in other situations, it is inapplicable to Devas.”’'7 He offered two reasons for this
position. First, he asserted that Devas had access to interest-free vendor financing due to DT’s
help and that negative cash flows in that setting represented the accumulation of accounts payable
that would only be payable if in fact Devas was successful. In other words, the needed cash would

come from lenders and would not be repaid if Devas failed. The second explanation for Mr. Sacks’

position is that most of the negative cash flow in the early years was attributable to the projected
long-term Terrestrial Re-Use Fee payments.”'* The Tribunal is inclined to accept Mr. Flores’ view
that expenditures that were 100% certain to be made should not be probability-adjusted. The
Tribunal also has difficulty with Mr. Sacks’ explanations for his position. It appears that Mr.
Sacks’ computations are based on a DCF approach whereby future cash-flows are not apportioned
between equity holders and lenders, but rather considered in their entirety. In other words,
negative cash-flows are not split into negative cash-flows financed by lenders and negative cash-
flows financed by equity holders, nor are positive cash-flows split into cash-flows to lenders and
cash-flows to equity holders. All the cash-flows are “to the firm,” irrespective of financing
sources. Internal consistency requires that this same approach be maintained and that who ends
up paying for what should not play a role in the attribution of a probability to a given cash-flow.
Second, the idea that lenders (or vendors) would be potentially left with losses in case of default
does not seem to bear on value. It seems much more probable that if Devas had indeed decided
to borrow some time after February 2011, its lenders would have adjusted their lending conditions

to reflect possible default.

However, the Tribunal disagrees with Mr. Flores on the length of time during which Devas would
not have had any other choice than spending money. During the Hearing on Quantum,”"” he stated
that, because there would have been major capital expenditures at least over seven years, these
seven years of negative cash-flows should not have been probability-adjusted. The Tribunal does
not accept this view. In the Tribunal’s opinion, it is most likely that Devas would not have felt
under any obligation to go on spending if evidence had emerged that it could not expect to
succeed. The Tribunal finds that the first two years or so would have given Devas sufficient
information on which to decide whether to fold or not. Thus, the Tribunal finds that it would be
inappropriate to make probability adjustments on the first two years of negative cash flows, but it

would be appropriate to make probability adjustments on the negative cash flows thereafter.

In relation to the discount rate to be applied to the adjusted projected cash flows, the Tribunal
notes that Mr. Sacks determined his discount rate by calculating Devas’ weighted average cost of
capital (WACC). As Mr. Sacks stated, “[t]he WACC is equal to the weighted average of the after-
tax cost of debt (i.e., the interest rate on debt), and the cost of equity (i.e., the expected return on
equity).” He assumed that Devas would take on debt in the future, which would allow it to benefit
from the tax deductibility of interest and, therefore, lower the overall cost of capital. In order to

estimate the WACC, Mr. Sacks, in his first report, endeavoured to compute the levered cost of

Page 140 of 163

equity (it increases when the proportion of debt in the capital structure increases) and the cost of
debt. For this purpose, he assumed a target debt ratio, un-levered the average Beta of existing
companies of the relevant industry, re-levered the unlevered Beta according to the target debt
ratio and, finally, estimated the cost of debt for that target debt ratio in India. The Respondent’s
expert, Mr. Flores, objected to this recourse to a weighted average cost of capital. Because Devas
was not expected to become taxable before 2019 or later; the debt tax shield advantage would not
exist for a long time. Another objection was that Mr. Sacks assumed that Devas would be able to
borrow at the same rate as established companies in the sector. Even though, as Mr. Sacks
answered, business losses might ultimately be used to offset future taxable profits, the Tribunal
finds that the present value of this tax advantage was very low and uncertain in 201 1. Further, the
Tribunal is not persuaded by the assumption of a specific debt ratio and a specific cost of debt
since, as of February 2011, Devas’ financing strategy remained rather vague. With these
considerations in mind, the Tribunal would prefer, as the proper discount rate, an unlevered cost
of equity rather than a WACC based rate. The ingredients of the cost of equity (such as an
unlevered Beta, the risk-free rate and the equity risk-premium) were provided by both sets of

experts, albeit with some disagreements.

The Tribunal has some reservation in relation to the manner in which Mr. Sacks treats country
risk. His opinion is that he has fully accounted for country risk by using all-Indian data including
Indian stock prices, Indian risk measures and correlations, Indian inflation and Indian interest
rates, among other items. While that approach is completely persuasive in relation to what it deals
with, the Tribunal is not satisfied that it fully accounts for country risk for a foreign investor. It
seems to imply, for example, that there would be no risk of being forbidden to repatriate dividends
or profits and that there would be no currency risks associated with such actions. In the Tribunal’s
opinion, these considerations alone should have encouraged Mr. Sacks to look beyond the all-
Indian data on which he relied. If Devas was considered to be only a domestic firm, then Mr.
Sacks’ approach would be quite acceptable. But, obviously, it was not simply a domestic firm. It
was a foreign investor and was accordingly subject to a certain degree of vulnerability to

conditions that might uniquely affect such an investor.

Nevertheless, the Tribunal notes that, despite rejecting the idea of a country-risk premium, Mr.
Sacks appears to have included one in his computations. According to the CAPM, the base rate
included in the discount rate should be a “risk-free” rate, meaning a rate applicable to a first-class
issuer certain not to default. The Tribunal understands that normal practice for determining a risk
free rate is to use the current rate on a long-term bond rated at least AAA. In the United States,
the Tribunal understands analysts would commonly choose a Federal Treasury bond for this

purpose. In this case, Mr. Sacks chose the rate on a 14-year Indian Government bond rated Baa3,

Page 141 of 163

which is a far cry from a bond rated AAA. This is emphasized in a document by Professor
Damodaran produced by the Respondent in which one can read on page 23 that “As table 2 shows,
India’s local currency rating of Baa3 suggests that there is default risk in the Indian rupee bond,
and that some of the observed interest rate can be attributed to this risk.””° The Tribunal
understands that it is current practice in the international bond market to consider that some
governmental issuers do deserve a country-risk “penalty,” that is a rate higher than the rate on a
U.S. Treasury bond. The Tribunal concludes that Mr. Sacks’ risk-free rate is in fact comprised of
a true risk-free rate and of a country-risk premium. Therefore, no additional adjustment for a
country-risk premium seems warranted, although it is understood that the country-risk premium
would usually be included with the risk premium rather than with the risk-free rate when valuing
equity. For these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the rate on a 30-year Indian Government
bond, equal to 8.56%,’?! must be considered as including both the risk-free nominal rate and the
country-risk premium for India. Thus no further adjustment for country risk is required in relation

to Mr. Sacks’ opinion.

Regarding the systematic risk measure, the Beta co-efficient, the Tribunal notes that both Parties
agree on the appropriate value for an established publicly traded company of that industry, namely
0.67-0.68.’” Mr. Flores, argues that as a non-publicly traded start-up, Devas had a higher Beta
due to risks that would have been diversifiable for an established company but were not
diversifiable for Devas at the time, such as regulatory risk and technical risk.” Without choosing
expressly a particular “total Beta” inclusive of these start-up risks, Dr. Flores alludes to a Beta of
more than 2 corresponding to the situation in which none of the risks faced by Devas would be
diversifiable.”4 Mr. Sacks, for his part, while maintaining that Devas’ Beta should be equivalent
to the Beta of an established company, nevertheless decided, in order to obtain a conservative
value, not to rely on the average Beta of 0.68 that he had computed, but rather averaged the 2
highest Betas he had observed in the industry, resulting in a Beta of 0.99.” Given the progress
made by Devas between 2005 and 2011, the Tribunal would not be prepared to endorse the
maximum Beta of 2 as a fair representation of Devas’ risk in February 2011. A more moderate

assessment would be preferred. Having chosen a “conservative Beta,” Mr. Sacks argues that no

Page 142 of 163

further upward adjustment of Beta is needed because the risk of failure is already taken into
account with the PRA. The Tribunal observes that the risk of failure was not the only risk Devas
was facing in 2011; it was also facing uncertainty regarding regulatory decisions and technical
developments that might affect its profitability; there were also commercial uncertainties
regarding, for example, the speed of acceptance of the new service. However, the Tribunal
acknowledges that, even if Devas was facing some particular regulatory and technical risks in
February 2011, most of these risks would have dissipated over time, conditional on its survival,
of course. It seems likely that, if Devas had survived, at the time of first renewal of its lease it
would have faced about the same risk as publicly transacted and established companies in the
industry. As a consequence, the Tribunal determines that it would be reasonable to consider a
Beta moving from about 1.2 in February 2011 to 0.67 towards the end of the first lease. These
Betas, according to the CAPM, must be multiplied by the market equity risk-premium (“ERP”),
established by Mr. Flores as equal to 6.7%7”° and by Mr. Sacks at approximately 7.75%.’”’ The

Tribunal concludes that it would be reasonable to work from a middle estimate, namely 7%.

In Mr. Flores’ opinion, a premium for lack of liquidity should be added to the usual risk-premium.
Mr. Flores says, “Prof. Damodaran also acknowledges that an illiquidity discount is appropriate
for private firms. He points out that, ‘private businesses will generally have much higher costs of
equity than their publicly traded counterparts, with diversified investors’ and advocates for an
adjustment for liquidity in his paper on valuing young start-ups.” (internal footnotes omitted).
Further relying on Professor Damodaran, Mr. Flores asserts that Professor Damodaran’s “paper,
suggests applying a 22.55% to 27.00% discount to the final NPV value or a 2% increase in the
discount rate.”””° Mr. Sacks rejects the need for an illiquidity premium on several bases, including
the fact that a potential buyer would not suffer from a lack of reliable information given all the
documents produced by Devas and DT. In addition, he quotes several academic research papers
that have refuted the research papers quoted by Mr. Flores.”° Faced with these conflicting
opinions, the Tribunal would cautiously consider an illiquidity premium of no more than 2% in
the first years following February 2011. The Tribunal expects, however, that any illiquidity should
have disappeared completely over time as new investors became interested in Devas and Devas

eventually became publicly traded.

Recognizing that the risk profile of start-ups evolves through time in a more striking fashion than
the risk profile of an established company, the Tribunal is persuaded that focusing on a single
discount rate is not the best way to value Devas. It has therefore chosen to consider a higher cost
of equity that would be applicable to the first years of the period considered, and a lower cost of
equity applicable to the later, more established and stable period. The discount rate to be applied
should lie between these two differing scenarios. The highest nominal cost of equity considered
by the Tribunal is equal to 19% (8.56% + 1.2*7% + 2%), or 15% in real terms (after subtracting
the 4% Indian rate of inflation). The lowest one is equal to 13.25% (8.56% + 0.67*7%) or 9.25%
in real terms. In the end, the real discount rate chosen by the Tribunal is equal to about 11%,
taking into account that the lowest rate would apply for a longer period than the highest one which,

in any case, would decrease gradually towards the lowest one.

With these observations and determinations in mind, the Tribunal has asked itself whether there
is some sort of reasonableness information by which to further weigh and potentially test the
opinions of the experts in this case. The Tribunal is well aware, for example, of the opinion of the
tribunal in the ICC Arbitration that valued Devas at USD 562.5 million as of February 17, 2011.7!
The Tribunal is likewise aware of the contents of the expert report prepared by Mr. Kaczmarek in

support of the claims made by Devas in that ICC Arbitration.”

Through the debate over whether
the Darwin Model was prepared on a real or nominal basis, the Tribunal also became aware of

the expert report of Mr. Harman, FTI Consulting, dated 4 May 2018.77

In his DCF valuation of Devas, Mr. Kaczmarek concluded that as at the valuation date, Devas had
an “enterprise value” of USD 1,641,679,000.™ He slightly modified this figure after further
looking at what he considered comparable publicly traded companies and comparable

735

transactions.”*° His final, adjusted opinion of value was set at USD 1,607 million.” The tribunal

in that case did not agree. Taking into account the “implied value” of Devas based on the DT

transaction in March 2008, the tribunal in the ICC Arbitration concluded ultimately that by
February 2011, Devas had a value of USD 562.5 million.””

Mr. Harman, who appeared as an expert for Deutsche Telekom in support of its investor-state
claim against India in the DT Arbitration, adopted the DCF methodology as his “primary approach
to calculating DT’s damages at the Valuation Date.””** Based on his DCF analysis, Mr. Harman
concluded, “Devas’ expected value was USD 1,618m at the Valuation Date based on the three
equally weighted terrestrial re-use licence fee scenarios I have modelled.””*”

In his report, Mr. Harman pursued further analysis of the DT transaction and the apparent
reasoning of the tribunal in the ICC Arbitration. In this analysis, which he calls the “Investment
Plus” approach, Mr. Harman develops his opinion of the value of Devas based on his perception
that the ICC Tribunal drew its conclusion as if the implied value of the 2008 DT transaction was
a fair market value (“FMV”).”° Mr. Harman says that he adopts the ICC Tribunal’s general
approach, but makes FMV adjustments. He bases these adjustments on DT’s in-kind contribution
and on DT’s negotiating power in relation to Devas.” In addition, he takes into account specific
risks associated with Devas as well as a minority discount. In his opinion, on this analysis, the
FMV of Devas in 2008 was USD 966 million. He brings that value forward to 2011 by increasing,
as the ICC Tribunal did, his valuation by 50% and accounting for the lowering of risk up to the
Valuation Date. As stated in his opinion, “[t]his gives a FMV of Devas of USD 1,449m at the
Valuation Date.”

The Tribunal is mindful that it should be particularly cautious about relying on either the
conclusions of the tribunal in the ICC Arbitration or Mr. Kaczmarek’s opinion or Mr. Harman’s
opinion, especially since neither of these experts has been a witness in this arbitration.
Nonetheless, it must be noted that the order of magnitude of their opinions about the value of

Devas is at least in the range of the value placed on Devas by Mr. Sacks and Mr. Bazelon.

When the Tribunal takes into account the conclusion reached in the ICC Arbitration as well as the
opinions of Mr. Kaczmarek and Mr. Harman, it observes that there is a fairly wide range of

opinions concerning the value of Devas either in 2008 or 2011. At the same time, however, what

is common to these approaches is that they all conclude that Devas was much more valuable in
2011 than it was in 2008. Mr. Sacks in this case along with Mr. Harman in the DT Arbitration
and Mr. Kaczmarek in the ICC Arbitration all perceived that in relation to the 2008 DT
transaction, Devas was worth a great deal more than the simplistic “implied value” of USD 375
million. The Tribunal generally agrees with those views. It does seem highly likely that the DT
transaction resulted in Devas’ value being well beyond the arithmetic calculation of a 20% interest
for USD 75 million. In other words, as a result of the DT transaction, much more than USD 75

million was added to Devas’ value in March 2008.

The Tribunal is of the view that the sum of USD 75 million invested in Devas by DT Asia in 2008
and 2009 for a 20% minority interest in Devas does not represent the real value of Devas at that
time. One should add to this amount the value of the important technical and commercial

contributions brought to Devas by DT as described above.

First, it is interesting to note that DT’s two internal valuations of Devas in 2008 and 2009 (which
were not shared with Devas and do not appear to have been part of the evidence submitted to the
ICC tribunal) arrived at much higher figures than the total value of USD 375 million mentioned
in the 2008 agreement between DT Asia and Devas. These reports were produced by Mr. Axel
Scheuermann, Head of Corporate Finance within Mergers and Acquisitions at DT. The first
valuation of Devas in February 2008 concluded an enterprise value at USD 1.78 billion.” In a
second valuation carried in June 2009, Mr. Scheuermann concluded that, in the context of the
economic crisis at the time, a number of adjustments of the previous valuation should be made

and that Devas’ enterprise value should be reduced to USD 1.15 billion.”*#

In 2008, DT was in a particularly strong position of leverage and power which would not apply
to the situation of a willing buyer and willing seller (no compulsion to sell or buy). Devas in 2008
was in situation where it needed a substantial injection of cash to meet its obligations under the
Devas Agreement and wished to avoid the potential delays and risks involved in a lack of financial

liquidity.

In addition, when DT made its investment in Devas, it was fully aware that Devas, a small
enterprise, needed a major partner to ease its development. Devas was short not only of technical
expertise and research capability, but also of negotiating power with suppliers and access to

international markets. DT being a major player worldwide in the field of telecommunications was

in a strong position to extract from Devas a relatively low share purchase price. For Devas, DT’s
expertise in the telecommunications which it could call upon and its strong negotiating power
with international suppliers had very significant value. The Tribunal received clear evidence to

that effect from the history of the negotiations between DT and Devas.

Mr Larsen, in his witness statement, stated that he “led a worldwide team of DT senior
engineering experts to further develop Devas’s network roll out plan.””45 He added that over
approximately twelve months, around 20-25 DT senior engineers and other procurement
specialists worked with him and Devas personnel to plan and implement Devas’ terrestrial
network. In addition, in 2010, one of these specialists was stationed permanently in Devas’ office
in Bangalore to build, lead and train a terrestrial radio access network planning and deployment

team in India.“

Moreover, because of DT’s strong purchasing power and its extensive relationship with
telecommunications industry suppliers, “Devas’s Telecom infrastructure costs would have been
substantially lower than those of incumbents in the market at like-for-like benchmarks.”"7 Mr.
Larsen was of the view that “Devas would likely have benefited from an advantage on telecom

unit pricing of at least 50%.”7*

Mr. Larsen’s statements on the above issues were unchallenged.

It is clear to the Tribunal that DT’s contribution in-kind (technical support, international network
and purchasing power) added a significant value to Devas which was not represented in the USD

375 million value arrived at between DT Asia and Devas in 2008.

A willing buyer of the Claimants’ shares in 2011 would certainly have factored this contribution

into the price he would have been willing to pay.

In the Tribunal’s opinion, a fair analysis of the in-kind investments of DT in Devas would have
added a significant amount to the cash value paid by DT Asia for its shares in 2008 and 2009.
Adding the increased value gained by Devas between 2008 and February 2011 as described in
this Award and in the award in the ICC Arbitration as well as the increased value for a willing

buyer of the Claimants’ shares resulting from the presence of DT as a powerful shareholder would

bring the damages to which the Claimants would be entitled at least to the level of those arrived

at under the DCF formula retained in this case.

When considering the potential weight to be given to the opinions of Mr. Sacks and Mr. Bazelon
on their determination of value based on the DCF method, the Tribunal acknowledges that,
independently of the DCF method, Mr. Bazelon also provided an opinion of value for Devas based
on what he considered to be a suitable comparable derived from the Indian BWA Auction
conducted in June 2010. At that time, the Indian government auctioned two 20 MHz blocks of
unpaired spectra in the 2.3 GHz band in each of the 22 telecom circles in India.” At the heart of
Mr. Bazelon’s analysis, he states, “[o]nly one bidder—Infotel—obtained a national license
footprint made up of one spectrum block in each of the 22 telecom circles. For the 22 licenses,
Infotel paid a total $2.74 billion, or 0.11 $/MHz-pop. This is the same total amount paid by the
other five bidders for the other 22 licenses that collectively also covered all of India.””*° Based
on his analysis of this BWA auction and the resulting licenses, Mr. Bazelon concludes, “[t]he 2.3
GHz Indian BWA auction represents a reasonable comparable for the spectrum allocated to Devas
(which it intended to use terrestrially to provide BSA services).””*!

Subject to certain adjustments to this comparable, Mr. Bazelon concludes that, “[b]ased on the
2010 Indian spectrum auction results, I calculate the FMV of Devas’s BWA segment to be
approximately $1.7 billion.”’ In Brattle’s ultimate opinion of value for Devas in February 2011,
Mr. Sacks averages his DCF determination of value with that of Mr. Bazelon’s market comparable
approach. Observing that his Income Approach and the Market Approach of Mr. Bazelon yielded
values for the BWA segment that were “reasonably close,” Mr. Sacks accepted the average of
those two results to arrive at a value for Devas’s BWA business. This opinion, set out in Table 21
of Mr. Sacks’ First Report, shows a value of USD 1,375 million based on the Income Approach
and a value of 1,705 million based on the Market Approach. The average of the two is USD 1,540

million.”

The Respondent took issue with Brattle’s Market Approach primarily on the basis that, “[i]t
assumed that Devas had the right to use the satellite spectrum terrestrially at an annual fee based

on what the Slovenian regulators would have charged that would have given Devas a huge

advantage over its competitors, rather than at the upfront spectrum fee commensurate with the
price paid by those competitors at the 2010 BWA Auction.” The Tribunal concludes elsewhere
that it does not agree with the Respondent’s submission that India would have acted contrary to
the general policy of fully exploiting the valuable S-band spectrum or that India would have

charged rates in the same order of magnitude as the prices paid for the BWA auction in 2010.

Nevertheless, the Tribunal has determined that it cannot accept Mr. Bazelon’s opinion that the
prices paid for BWA spectrum in June 2010 represented a reasonable comparable for the value of
Devas’ spectrum under the Devas Agreement. Even with Mr. Bazelon’s adjustments, the Tribunal
is not persuaded that the cumulative auction price of some 22 segments of BWA access reasonably
equates to the value of the S-band spectrum held by Devas under its agreement. It is true that
cumulatively, these 22 segments gave Infotel national coverage which, without more, might be
said to be geographically equivalent to the S-band spectrum to which Devas was entitled. The
Tribunal doubts, however, the quality of the comparison between these two types of businesses.
The potential exploitation of the S-band spectrum was going to be a significantly different model
from the business and technical model being created by Infotel. For example, the total spectrum
available to Devas in the S-band was approximately one and a half times larger than the total
spectrum acquired by Infotel. In addition, Infotel was not going to operate an AV system. These
differences alone are significant indicators that direct comparisons between the two types of

businesses should likely be avoided.

Even if the Tribunal’s doubts on the comparability of the BWA access acquired by Infotel and
the S-band access to which Devas was entitled could be otherwise reconciled, the Tribunal does
not consider the methodology of averaging the Market Approach with the Income Approach to
be an acceptable methodology. In this instance, such an averaging exercise would putatively add
approximately USD 200 million to the value otherwise shown by the Income Approach. The
Tribunal finds that arithmetic result to be arbitrary and undependable. The Tribunal concludes,
therefore, that for purposes of determining the value of Devas in February 2011, it will rely on

the DCF approach, but will not rely on Mr. Bazelon’s market comparable opinion.

The Tribunal accordingly returns to the question whether it should accept the opinions of Mr.
Sacks and Mr. Bazelon based on their DCF calculation of value? The Tribunal agrees generally
with their methodology in relation to the DCF approach and therefore accepts the model relied
upon by Mr. Sacks and Mr. Bazelon. At the same time, the Tribunal continues to have certain

reservations and concerns as already outlined, above, in relation to some of the inputs relied upon

by Brattle in its model. Based on these reservations, for the reasons already expressed, the
Tribunal has determined that it should modify some of the figures used by these experts in order
to arrive at a value for Devas that would better fit with the Tribunal’s perception of that company’s

worth in February 2011.

The Tribunal finds that it should modify at least three inputs in the Sacks/Bazelon DCF model,
namely the estimated risk of failure on which the PRA is based, the discount rate to be applied to
future cash flows and the terminal growth rate for the last 12 years of the Devas Agreement. In
lieu of the risk of failure rate and corresponding PRA adjustment of 39%, selected by Mr. Sacks,
the Tribunal has concluded that this figure should be adjusted slightly to approximately 42%. In
addition, the Tribunal finds that Devas’ very first unavoidable expenditures, for a period of about
2 years, should not be probability-adjusted. With respect to the discount rate Mr. Sacks has
determined, the Tribunal concludes that it is a little too optimistic to reflect fully the circumstances
of Devas in early 2011. Rather than a discount rate of 10.43% (in real terms), the Tribunal
concludes the figure should be approximately 11.0%. Finally, in order to account for its concerns
in relation to the terminal growth rate, the Tribunal concludes that the figure of 4.5% is too robust
and would substitute a figure of 3.5%. These adjustments are significant. They are intended,
however, to produce a likely value that more accurately equates with that of Devas at the
Valuation Date. The mathematical application of these adjustments to Mr. Sacks’ inputs, using
the Brattle model, suggests the value of Devas at the Valuation Date was in the range of
approximately USD 700 million to USD 775 million, with a mid-range of approximately USD
740 million.

Having regard for the evidence in this case and the reservations and concerns the Tribunal has
identified, the Tribunal finds that by February 17, 2011, Devas’ value was USD 740 million. This
conclusion reflects the Tribunal’s opinion that there had been a significant increase in the value

of Devas after 2008. Devas’ 1 i and its achi of mil such as

 

acquiring the ISP license and its successful conduct pursuant to its experimental license, when
viewed together with the fullness of the significant synergies arising from the strategic
engagement of DT in Devas’ affairs all contributed to this increased value. The Tribunal has also
weighed, however, the concerns it has expressed in this decision. Those concerns have caused the
Tribunal to modify the magnitude of Brattle’s opinion of Devas’ value. Subject to these
modifications as described by the Tribunal, the DCF method provides, in the Tribunal’s opinion,
a reliable indicator of the value of Devas in this case. The Tribunal therefore determines that the

value of Devas as of February 17, 2011 was USD 740 million.

This being said, the Tribunal wishes to add that, even if it had dismissed the application of the
DCF valuation method in this case and had applied an analysis analogous to the one followed by
the ICC Tribunal in the ICC Arbitration, it would have arrived at a value that would be no less

than the one it established under a DCF valuation.

3. Compensation Due to the Claimants

As explained in the previous section, the Tribunal has determined that the value of Devas as of
February 17, 2011 was USD 740 million. The Tribunal recalls its decision in the operative
paragraph of the Award on Jurisdiction and Merits whereby it held:
By majority, that the protection of essential security interests accounts for 60% of the
Respondent's decision to annul the Devas Agreement, and that the compensation owed by

the Respondent to the Claimants for the expropriation of their investment shall therefore be
limited to 40% of the value of that investment; ">>

Pursuant to the Tribunal’s above-quoted finding, compensation owed by the Respondent to the
Claimants is limited to 40% of the value of their respective investments in Devas as of February

17, 2011.

In order to establish the amount of compensation owed by the Respondent to each of the
Claimants, the Tribunal multiplies the percentage of the Claimants’ respective shareholdings in
Devas by USD 740 million, and multiplies that amount by 0.4 (or 40%). The Tribunal recalls in
this regard that CC/Devas and Telcom Devas respectively hold 17.06% of the issued share capital
of Devas, and DEMPL holds 3.48% of the issued share capital of Devas.”*°

Accordingly, CC/Devas and Telcom Devas are each entitled to compensation in an amount of

USD 50,497,600; and DEMPL is entitled to compensation in an amount of USD 10,300, 800.

INTEREST

The Tribunal shall finally address the question as to the suitable interest rate and how such interest

rate should be applied to the amount of compensation quantified in the preceding section.

THE CLAIMANTS’ POSITION

The Claimants seek an award of pre-award interest calculated at LIBOR plus 4% from the

valuation date to the date of the Award.”*7

The Claimants argue that such a rate that has been commonly used in recent treaty cases and is
“the best proxy for the time value of money wrongfully withheld from the Claimants since the

Valuation Date.””**

The Claimants also seek post-award interest at the same rate until the date of full payment.’°

The Claimants dispute the appropriateness of the Respondent’s advocated interest rate (based on
six-month or one-year U.S. Treasury rate) by pointing out that “as past Tribunals have noted,
“short-term U.S. Treasury bills (...) practically offer no return.”” They rely on the finding by
the Rusoro Mining tribunal to the effect that “the best approach for establishing ‘a normal
commercial rate’ is to select LIBOR plus an appropriate margin (...) [in the] market situation of

ultra-low interest rates, (...) a margin of 4% is appropriate.”7!

The Claimants also argue that in accordance with Article 38(1) of the ILC Articles and the
judgment in the Chorzéw Factory case, the interest rate must be sufficient to ensure “full
reparation” for Claimants’ “injury” which includes the failure by the Respondent to pay interest
at commercial market rates as provided by Articles 4 (most favoured nation or “MFN”) and 6
(expropriation) of the Treaty. This injury can only be repaired with the payment of interest at a
commercial rate.” Similarly, the Tribunal in the Murphy case held that a rate of LIBOR plus 4%
was appropriate to restore Claimant to the position it would have enjoyed absent the breach as
“the best approximate rate that Claimant would have had to pay if it had been obligated to borrow

the money.”7

The Claimants ask that the Tribunal’s Award be made in US dollars and that it be net of Indian

taxes.7°*

THE RESPONDENT’S POSITION

The Respondent considers that the issue of interest should be moot in this case.”°°

In any event, it
considers that the Claimants’ argument on interest is unsupported by any rationale, other than the
fact that some tribunals have awarded a rate consistent with their choice. However, the
Respondent points out that tribunals have also awarded lower rates, which are supported by
economic theory to the effect that once a claimant has been expropriated, it has been relieved of
the risks of the project and, therefore, a fair and equitable rate would be the risk-free rate, which
compensates the claimant for the time value of its money pending payment of what is otherwise

a sum certain once determined by the tribunal.”

In support, the Respondent cites several authorities, including Vestey v. Venezuela where the
Tribunal recognised the proposition and awarded interest on the basis of the 6-month Treasury
bill as it considered that “[t]he function of reparation is to compensate the victim for its actual
losses. It is not to reward it for risks which it does not bear.””* In that case the Claimants requested

arate of LIBOR plus 2%, but the Tribunal held that

[t]his could indeed be an appropriate rate if the Claimant had to borrow funds because it did
not receive the expropriation indemnity on time (...) there is no indication in the record to
this effect.”

The Respondent adds that, in this case, the interest rate requested does not respond to the rate they
may have incurred in connection with any borrowings resulting from the lack of payment of
compensation but rather on counsel’s views as to what would be an appropriate rate on the basis

of a few tribunals’ decisions.””

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

The Parties have summarized the diverging conclusions previously reached by various tribunals
concerning the rate of interest which should apply in cases where the respondent is found liable

to pay damages and the Tribunal sees no need to expand on the matter.

Upon review of the previous arbitral decisions cited by the Parties and their arguments in this
regard, the Tribunal concludes that a rate of LIBOR + 2 percentage points is appropriate in the

present case.

Consequently, the Respondent shall pay to the Claimants interest calculated at the six-month term
LIBOR rate for U.S. dollar deposits published by the Wall Street Journal, plus two (2) percentage

points, compounded semi-annually, from February 17, 2011 to the date of full payment.

In the event that LIBOR is discontinued while any amount remains outstanding under this Award,
the Tribunal considers it appropriate to adopt an alternative reference interest rate. The Tribunal
accordingly determines that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) shall be used to
calculate the interest due from the date LIBOR is discontinued. In such case, the rate of SOFR

+ 2 percentage points shall apply.

COSTS

Finally, the Tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration and determine the allocation of those costs.

COSTS OF ARBITRATION

Pursuant to Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal fixes the costs of arbitration as

follows.

The members of the Tribunal have incurred in the following fees:

services, hearing facilities and IT/AV support, travel, accommodation, catering, courier, and

telephone charges amount to EUR 275,771.94.
The Registry fees of the PCA amount to EUR 288,981.50.

Therefore, the total costs of arbitration pursuant to Article 38(a), (b) and (c) of the UNCITRAL
Rules amount to a total of EUR 2,511,479.94. During this arbitration, each side paid advances in
equal shares to the deposit held by the PCA, resulting in a total deposit of EUR 2,513,776.26.

The PCA shall return any remaining amounts on deposit to both sides in equal shares. The amount
remaining on deposit is EUR 2,296.32. Thus, the balance to be returned to each side amounts to

EUR 1,148.16.

to Article 38(e) of the UNCITRAL Rules amounting to USD 19,754,365.43, incurred as follows:
USD 7,860,527.45 for the jurisdiction and merits phase, and USD 11,893,837.98 for the quantum
phase.’ It is the Claimants’ submission that their costs are reasonable in amount and “reflect
(...) the legal and technical complexity of the case.”””°
The Claimants assert that UNCITRAL tribunals hearing investor-State cases have long exercised
their authority to award costs in favour of the prevailing party.” The Claimants argue that they
prevailed on jurisdiction and that the Tribunal also unanimously found that the Respondent
breached its FET obligation and expropriated the Claimants’ investments.”” Furthermore, the
Claimants contend that the Respondent’s positions on quantum “are objectively unsustainable, as
well as contrary to the specific findings of the Merits Award” and assert that, if the Tribunal
awards damages to the Claimants, they should also be regarded as the successful party in the

quantum phase.’

Furthermore, according to the Claimants, recovery of legal expenses caused by a treaty breach is
necessary in order to ensure “full reparation” for the injured party, as required by Chorzéw

Factory.””

The Claimants also affirm that tribunals have held that conduct by a respondent which exacerbates
a Treaty breach may further support granting a cost award.” In this regard, they recall the

Tribunal’s findings in the Merits Award that the Respondent did not pay any compensation

whatsoever to the Claimants when expropriating their investment for purposes other than its

essential security interests. In the Claimants’ view, such conduct evinced a lack of good faith.”*!

Likewise, the Claimants argue that the Respondent engaged in “serious misconduct” during this
arbitration, including through the submission of “deceptive testimony,” “disregard for the

Tribunal’s disclosure orders,” “inaccurate description of the redactions it made to documents,”

99782

“creation of post-hoc documents” and the “unnecessary enlargement of the dispute.” ** Hence, in

the Claimants’ submission, the Respondent is not entitled to an award of any costs or fees.’*3

Furthermore, the Claimants criticize that the Respondent did not provide any narrative detail of
its costs claim, which prevents them from providing any comments on how such amount has been
compiled.” In any event, the Claimants consider that the difference in the amount of costs
claimed by the Parties is not surprising because the Claimants bear the burden of proof and

because a private claimant’s legal representation is structured differently from a government’ s.”*°

The Respondent affirms that it incurred USD 3,583,465.51 during the jurisdiction and merits

Therefore, the Respondent’s total costs in this arbitration amount to USD 9,712,218.72.

According to the Respondent, its costs “are well within the range of reasonableness,” as is
evidenced by the fact that they are 38% of the overall amount claimed by the Claimants.””°

The Respondent criticizes the Claimants’ extensive argument presented in their costs submission

despite agreement by counsel of the Parties to follow the format used in the ICC Arbitration,

namely, a table with a short cover letter.”!

Moreover, the Respondent also criticizes the amount of costs claimed by the Claimants in this
arbitration.” The Respondent refers to a study on costs in investment treaty arbitration during
the period 2013-2017; noting that the Claimants’ costs are more than three times the average and

five times the median, the Respondent submits that the Claimants’ costs are “indefensible.”

The Respondent requests that the costs of this case should be assessed against the Claimants.”
In the Respondent’s view, if costs are to be allocated regarding the jurisdiction and merits phase
of this proceeding, the Claimants should be required to pay 60% of the Respondent’s costs
incurred during such phase (including legal fees and related costs) in line with the Tribunal’s
decision to dismiss 60% of their claim on the basis of essential security interests.”°

With regard to the quantum phase, the Respondent considers that the Claimants adopted “wholly
indefensible positions,” including with regard to the appropriate discount rate and cash flows.”°
Therefore, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to order the Claimants bear all of the costs

incurred in the quantum phase, including the Respondent’s legal fees and related costs.”

3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

When fixing costs in this case, the Tribunal is required to apply the principles described in

Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules:

1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by
the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs
between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the
circumstances of the case.

2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in article 38,
paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the case, shall be
free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the
parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.

The guidance provided in this rule includes not only the general principle that costs should follow
the event but also a broad discretion for the Tribunal to take into account the circumstances of

this case.

The Claimant argues that it was the successful party on what it calls the core issues in this
arbitration. It says that in the Jurisdiction and Merits Award, the Tribunal unanimously found that
the Claimants prevailed in their jurisdictional claim that their investments were protected under
the Treaty. Likewise, the Tribunal unanimously found that the Respondent breached its obligation
to accord fair and equitable treatment to the Claimants under the Treaty and expropriated the
Claimants’ investments. The Tribunal accepts these submissions, but must observe that
significantly, the Claimants’ success was not unmitigated since, by majority, the Tribunal also
determined that the protection of essential security interests accounted for 60% of the
Respondent’s decision to annul the Devas Agreement in 2011. As a result, the Claimants’ right
to recover damages was reduced to 40% of what was said to have been the quantum to which it

was entitled.

In the quantum phase of this case, the Claimants have succeeded, by majority, in an award of
significant damages, but in an amount that is considerably less than the amount sought. The
Tribunal notes, of course, that this award of damages far exceeds the position taken by the
Respondent which submitted that there was no loss, arguing that Devas itself had either a huge

negative value or, at best, a minimal value in February 2011.

The Claimants have also argued that there are other circumstances that the Tribunal should take
into account when exercising its discretion in fixing costs. The Tribunal notes two of those, in
particular. The first concerns the Respondent's reliance on certain minutes of a December 15,

2009 meeting between ISRO and defence officials. The Respondent submitted a redacted version

PCA 277511

654.

655.

Case 1:21-cv-00106 Document 1-4 Filed 01/13/21 Page 172 of 176

Page 159 of 163

of these minutes as Exhibit VA-10, urging that the un-redacted language demonstrated the
“needs” of the Indian military as they were said to have crystalized at the time. The Respondent
also submitted a privilege log which purported to describe the redacted portions of Exhibit VA-
10. The Tribunal relied on this exhibit and the testimony of Mr. A. Vijay Anand, in the Jurisdiction
and Merits Award. Subsequently, in 2018, during the quantum phase of this case, an un-redacted
version of Exhibit VA-10 became available as a result of its production in the DT Arbitration,
another investor-state claim against India in relation to these events. The un-redacted minutes
were expressly relied upon in the DT Arbitration case where the tribunal rejected India's defence

based on essential security.

A second circumstance which the Claimants urge the Tribunal to consider in the exercise of its
discretion when fixing costs, arises from certain evidence presented in relation to the licensing
issue. This was a document entitled, “Technical Statement”, dated November 24, 2014, and
purportedly issued by the DOT Joint Wireless Advisor as a policy statement. In cross-
examination, Mr. Anand admitted he had authored the statement so that it could be deployed in

arbitration. In the event, the Tribunal did not in fact rely on this document.

Under Article 38(e) of the UNCITRAL Rules, where the Tribunal may award costs for legal
representation and assistance, there are two further considerations, namely, that the “successful
party” claimed such costs during the arbitral proceedings and then, “only to the extent that the
arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable.” The Tribunal
acknowledges that the Claimants have claimed their costs throughout these arbitration

proceedings.

The total amount claimed by the Claimants for their costs totals USD 25,233,325.93
(USD 8,958,671.90 for the merits and jurisdiction phase and USD 16,274,654.03 for the quantum
phase). Within these figures, the total amount claimed for legal fees as contemplated in
Article 38(e), is USD 19,754,365.43. The Claimants’ other claimed costs and disbursements total
USD 5,478,960.50.

By comparison, the Respondent’s total claimed costs were USD 3,583,464.51 for the jurisdiction
and merits phase and USD 6,103,273.25 for the quantum phase (both sets of figures including the
arbitrators’ fees and expenses and PCA administrative costs) for an overall total of

USD 9,686,738.76.

The Tribunal is conscious that this dispute led the Parties to incur significant costs and to deploy
skilful and experienced legal advisors and valuation experts in order to present their respective

positions. Nonetheless, the Tribunal observes that the costs incurred by the Claimants are

PCA Case No. 2013-09

Award on Quantum

Page 160 of 163

exceptionally large and the Tribunal further notes the significant disparity in the overall costs

incurred by each of the Parties.

The Claimants may rightfully say that without incurring such expense, they would not have been
able to obtain the results of this award. In general terms, the Claimants have been successful, even
though they were only partially successful on liability. With respect to quantum, the Claimants
have succeeded on what was undoubtedly a complex damages case, but again to a lesser extent
than claimed. The Respondent can also say that it was required to defend itself against these
claims and has to some extent succeeded in its defence. With respect to the exercise of its
discretion, the Tribunal is bound to express its grave concern in relation to the redacted document,
Exhibit VA-10. International arbitration proceedings such as this depend for their fairness and

efficiency on a proper regard for trustworthy conduct and candour by parties and their counsel.

Having regard to all the factors described above, including the submissions of the Parties and the
full circumstances of this case, and in the exercise of its discretion under the UNCITRAL Rules,
the Tribunal fixes the costs in favour of the Claimants, payable by the Respondent, in the total
amount of USD 10 million, which amount includes the Claimants’ reasonable costs for legal
representation and assistance, travel and other expenses incurred by witnesses, costs of expert

advice and other assistance.

With respect to the fees and expenses of the arbitral tribunal, including travel and other expenses
incurred by the arbitrators and the cost of expert advice to the Tribunal, as well as the fees and
expenses of the PCA at The Hague for the administration of this arbitration, the Tribunal directs

that those costs shall be borne equally between the Parties.

With regard to the fees and expenses of the appointing authority pursuant to Article 38(f) of the
UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal determines that each side shall bear the fees and expenses of the

appointing authority which it has expended.

DISPOSITIF
For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal, by majority, decides as follows:
(a) The total value of Devas on February 17, 2011 is USD 740 million.

(b) Each Claimant is entitled to compensation pursuant to the Award on Jurisdiction and
Merits dated July 25, 2016 in an amount corresponding to 40% of USD 740 million,
multiplied by the percentage of its shareholding.

The Respondent shall accordingly pay compensation to the Claimants in the following

amounts:

- CC Devas (holding 17.06% of the issued share capital of Devas):
USD 50,497,600;

- Telcom Devas (holding 17.06% of the issued share capital of Devas):
USD 50,497,600; and

- DEMPL (holding 3.48% of the issued share capital of Devas): USD 10,300,800.

The Respondent shall pay interest on the amounts stated in paragraph (c) at a rate of
the six-month USD LIBOR + 2 percentage points, compounded semi-annually from

February 17, 2011 until the date of full payment.

The Claimants and the Respondent shall share equally the Tribunal’s costs and fees
pursuant to Article 38(a), (b) and (c) of the UNCITRAL Rules, including the cost of
expert advice and the administration of this arbitration by the PCA. Each side shall
bear the fees and expenses of the appointing authority that it has expended pursuant

to Article 38(f) of the UNCITRAL Rules.

The Respondent shall pay the Claimants pursuant to Article 38(c), (d), and (e) of the
UNCITRAL Rules the amount of USD 10,000,000.

The Respondent shall pay post-award interest at a rate of the six-month USD LIBOR
+2 percentage points on the amount due pursuant to paragraph (f) compounded semi-

annually from the date of this Award until the date of full payment.

In the event that LIBOR were to be discontinued while any amounts pursuant to
paragraphs (c) and (f) remain outstanding, the interest due shall, from that date

onward, be calculated on the basis of SOFR + 2 percentage points.

The Respondent may not withhold or offset payment of any portion of the award

based on a claim that such amount is subject to taxation or other deductions.

The Respondent shall indemnify the Claimants with respect to any Indian taxes,

charges, or other set-offs imposed on the compensation awarded.

Prior to payment of any amounts awarded in paragraphs (c), (d), (f) and (g), the

Claimants shall provide an undertaking that they will not seek double recovery in
