B Claimant's Summarized Chronology of the Circumstances
Underlying the Present Dispute

15 This Arbitration involves certain claims by Claimant Mr Sax (as assignee and
successor-in-interest of PSP and SPH, according to a Purchase Agreement
dated 17 December 2002, CX-66, and a Bill of Sale, CX-59), against the Res-
pondents, for breach of various agreements relating to the development of a
New International Passenger Terminal (“NIPT”) at the St. Petersburg's “Pul-
kovo" International Airport.

16 The following paragraphs summarize the history largely on the basis of Clai-
mant's Submissions and from Claimant's point of view. Several elements of
Claimant’s chronology and characterizations - as hereinafter reflected -
have been disputed by Respondents and, to the extent necessary for the Tri-
bunal's decisions, are discussed in further parts of this Award. Moreover, the
following account only references some - but by no means all - of the
steps, letters, contracts, meetings, or other milestones in the history of the
relationship between the Parties,

17 As will be further noted within the chronology of the proceedings, Claimant -
at the Stockholm Liability Hearing 18 to 21 October 2011 - submitted two
graphic time-line charts reflecting the steps which Claimant referred to in
numerous written submissions filed in this arbitration; these two charts pro-
vide a good overview of Claimant's case and, therefore, are incorporated in
this Award as a part of the chronological development of the Investment
Project, without such incorperation amounting to an acceptance, by the Tri-
bunal, of the allegations made by Claimant in connection with the steps re-
flected in the time-line of the charts. See the following two pages.

In December 1991, Claimant Mr Carl A. Sax, as he explained, travelled to St.
Petersburg in order to discuss the lease of aircraft, In the discussions with
representatives of the Office of the Mayor and the St, Petersburg City Coun-
cil, Claimant, as he explained, was asked to form and invite a consortium of
Western companies for exploring the redevelopment of Pulkovo Airport and,
in particular, for the development of a New International Passenger Terminal
which later became known as Pulkovo-3.

Mr Sax states that, in January 1992, he had received a “mandate letter” from
the City of St. Petersburg authorizing him to form and invite a consortium of
Western companies for the purpose of exploring the development of an in-
ternational passenger terminal for the Pulkovo airport. The mandate letter
was not filed; upon inquiry of the Tribunal, Claimant replied at the Stockholm
Hearings that he had been unable to trace that letter,’

Based on such mandate, Mr Sax, in 1992/1993, stated to have met with rep-
resentatives of the City of St. Petersburg and representatives of several
Western companies, including American International Group, Aéroports de
Paris, STV Group, Inc., Butler Aviation, Morgan Grenfell & Co., Ltd. in several
cities including St. Petersburg, Paris, London, Washington and New York, for
the purpose of discussing the development of Pulkovo-3.

During those meetings (which took place with, among others, Vladimir Vv,
Putin, who at the time was the Vice Mayor of the City of St. Petersburg, and
the acting Mayor Anatoly A. Sobchak), the request earlier addressed to Mr
Sax to form a consortium of Western companies was renewed on behalf of
the City of St. Petersburg.

On 16 March 1994, Strategic Partners, Inc., USA, (“SP”) represented by Mr
Sax as its Senior Vice President, SPBD, Inc. represented by it President Mark
A. Zilberquit, the Office of the Mayor of St. Petersburg (represented by Vice

Mayor and Chairman of the External Affairs Committee, Viadimir V. Putin),
the Department of Aviation of the Ministry of Transportation of the Russian
Federation, jointly represented by Yuri I. Baranoy (Chief of Infrastructure
Development Division of the Department of Aviation, Moscow) and by Yuri A.
Balakin (General Director of Northwestern Directorate of Civil Aviation, St.
Petersburg), and the Air Enterprise Pulkovo {represented by Boris G. Dem-
chenko, General Director), entered inte an Agreement (the "Protocol of
Agreement", CX-2) under which the Parties agreed to jointly redevelop the
St. Petersburg's Pulkove International Airport, by developing Pulkovo-3. - To
the extent necessary, further details regarding this Protocol of Agreement
shall be referred to in a further Chapter of this Award,

On 19 March 1995, (i) the City of St. Petersburg (represented by the Proper-
ty Management Committee, the latter represented by M.B. Manevitch, Com-
mittee Chairman and A.V, Vorontsov, Chief of Agency), (ii) the State Enter-
prise Pulkovo (represented by B.G. Demchenko, Director General, and G.S.
Naprienko Deputy Director General) and (iii) PSP (represented by Mr Sax,
Executive Vice President}, entered into a Founders' Agreement (CX-6) for
the purpose creating a special purpose company - IAT Pulkovo ~ for jointly
developing the New International Passenger Terminal {"NIPT"), and by sign-
ing the Charter of IAT Pulkovo (CX-5).

On 1 May 1996, IAT Pulkovo (represented by Boris G. Demchenko, Mr Sax
(of PSP) and the City of St, Petersburg (represented by the Property Man-
agement Committee, the latter represented by V.M. Urkovits, the head of the
Real Estate Transaction Execution Department) entered into the Ground
Lease, thereby leasing the land plot on which the New International Passen-
ger Terminal was to be developed (CX-17). The Ground Lease provided, in
part, for a term of 45 years and an option to renew the Lease for an addi-
tional 45 years.

From 1995 through 1997, Claimant, through the offices of STV Group, Inc.,
in conjunction with other providers, prepared studies for the conceptual de-
sign drawings for the New International Passenger Terminal,

Moreover, during that period, Claimant retained various consultants including
The MDA Group {U.K), Alan Stratford & Associates Air Transport Planning
Consultants Ltd., Techecon Ltd. and Sir William Hacrow & Partners Ltd., for
providing consulting services to review the design of the project structure,
the project costs and the financing for the New International Passenger Ter-
minal, These consultants were retained in order to obtain funding for the
project which, initially, was sought fromm Overseas Private Investment Corpo-
ration (OPIC) and Deutsche Morgan Grenfell & Co, (DMG), and thereafter
from the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD}.

It is Claimant’s case in these proceedings that all of these steps, including
the mandating of numerous third party providers, were undertaken for and
on behalf of IAT Pulkovo,

Moreover, according to Claimant, the working on the Pulkovo project in-
cluded the approval, in May 1995, of the design and the financing structure
for the New International Passenger Terminal by Alan Stratford & Associates
Air Transport Planning Consultants Ltd., followed, in August 1995, by letters
of the Lenaeroprojekt Institute regarding required governmental consents
(CX-10), and a fetter by Oleg Kharchenko (Chief Architect of the City of St.
Petersburg) consenting to the location and design of the New International
Passenger Terminal (CX-9).

Furthermore, Claimant explains that 25 agencies of the City of St. Petersburg
also approved the location and design of the New International Passenger
Terminal (CX-20, 21 and 22).

On 13 December 1995, Avia Invest, on behalf of the Department of Aviation
of the Ministry of Transportation of the Russian Federation, also delivered a
letter to IAT Pulkovo, preliminarily approving the design of the New Interna-
tional Passenger Terminal (CX-8).

On 13 February 1996, Aéroports de Paris, at the request of the EBRD, ap-
proved the design (CX-11),

On 1 March 1996, IAT Pulkovo requested that the International Air Transport
Association (IATA) approve the design, rates and charges of the New Inter-
national Passenger Terminal. The 1996 LAT Pulkovo presentation to IATA in-
cluded a reference to the development fee as an expense factor of the
project costs (CX-18).

On 10 April 1996, Coopers & Lybrand prepared a Valuation Analysis for the
EBRD and DMG (CX-12).

On 2 May 1996, according to Claimant, EBRD delivered its financing letter to
IAT Pulkovo regarding the provision of senior debt financing required for the
development of the New International Passenger Terminal.*

On 8 May 1996, DMG delivered its financing letter to IAT Pulkovo, agreeing
to underwrite that portion of the senior debt financing which was not pro-
vided by EBRD (CX-19).

On 11 June 1996, DMG delivered its financing letter to IAT Pulkovo, agreeing
to underwrite the subordinated financing.”

On 26 June 1996, Strategic Partners advised the State Enterprise Pulkovo
that IATA had agreed to the Rates and Charges for the New International
Passenger Terminal (CX-13).

On 3 July and 26 August 1996, OPIC delivered its financing letters to IAT
Pulkove regarding its participation with the EBRD for the purpose of providing
a senior debt financing for the development of the New International Passen-
ger Terminal.°

In September 1996, IAT Pulkovo delivered to its participants and lenders the
final revised conceptual plans for the New International Passenger Terminal
(CX-16).

On 27 September 1996, the Federal Aviation Service of the Russian Federa-
tion advised the EBRD that State Enterprise Pulkovo would be able to comply
with certain of its obligations to permit the development of the New Interna-
tional Passenger Terminal.’ A similar letter was addressed on 4 October 1996
by JSC "Pulkovo Aerodromstro".

On 10 October 1996, the State Enterprise Pulkovo advised EBRD that it
would be able to comply with certain of its obligations to permit the devel-
opment of the New International Passenger Terminal.®

Qn 15 October 1996, according to Claimant, the Board of Directors of IAT
Pulkovo approved, in principle, the EBRD, OPIC and DMG financing offers,
and ~ in Claimant’s words - authorized and empowered Claimant Mr Carl
Sax to negotiate, in the name of [AT Pulkovo’, definitive documents with the
£BRD, OPIC, DMG and other parties, and to execute and deliver these docu-
ments together with Boris G. Demchenko (Chairman of IAT Pulkovo), (CX-
14).

In 1997, EBRD delivered its [nternational Airport Terminal Pulkovo Cpera-
tions Committee Final Review. CX-23. As stated by Claimant, this Review /n-
ter alia referenced a development fee as well as pre-closing services as a
shareholder contribution to capital. Furthermore, it referenced the Pre-
Development Advance, a portion of which was to be rolled-over into a US$ 5
million PSP Standby Loan, The 1997 EBRD Review also referenced the

In these proceedings, the alleged existence of an authorization as such, as well as Mr Sax’

claim ta have been empowered to act on behalf of IAT Pulkovo, were cantested by Res-

pondents. The matter will be further addressed herein below.

The Extract CX-14 in fact provides for the negotiation authority of Mr Demchenko and Mr

Sax, with the definitive documents to be submitted for approval by the Board of Directors,
whereupon Mr Demchenko and Mr Sax would be authorized to sign the decuments on
behalf of Closed JSC IAT Pulkovo, with the requirement that all documents “shall be coun-

the Charter and the Founders’ Agreement, and that all outstanding issues
would be resolved by Claimant and Respondents so as to expedite the finan-
cial closing (CX-31).

sian Federation.

. The third issue related to customs duties and VAT deferrals for the con-
struction period and its inclusion within any Ministry of Finance Guaran-
tee (CX-25).

On 7 May 1997, Claimant advised Alexei L. Kudrin (Vice Minister, Ministry of
Finance) by letter that there were three issues to be addressed for complet-
ing the financing (CX-33}. Mr Kudrin was further updated by a letter dated
29 May 1997 (CX-34),

Complying with the requirement for the financing to be provided by EBRD
and DMG, the City of St. Petersburg agreed to finance the construction of
access roadways and utilities, and State Enterprise Pulkovo agreed to finance
the construction of an apron.

In June 1997, the MDA Group performed a satisfactory risk assessment for
the construction of the New International Passenger Terminal (CX-35).

On 25 July 1997, EBRD advised Mr Sax that the EBRD's Operation Committee
had given its approval, and that tha EBRD believed that financial closing
could take place by year-end (CX-28).

On the same day, 25 July 1997, the President of EBRD advised Governor Ya-
kovlev that the EBRD's Operation Committee had given its approval (CX-29).

On 28 August 1997, EBRD, in a letter addressed to Claimant, informed him
that the Bank's Board of Directors had approved the Project on 27 August
1997, indicating further that “the parties to the Project must now finalize the
negotiations, placement of debt and the Project Documentation, following
which it will be possible to sign the loan". A time-limit as such was not given;
the letter said that the Bank hopes “to complete this work by year end".
Claimant was further advised that all aspects of the Project “must remain
substantially in line with what has been presented to the Bank's Board of Di-
rectors” (CX-27).

On 15 January 1998, DMG delivered its IAT Pulkovo Financial Model to the

The Minutes of that Seminar were mentioned by Mr Karpov in his examinations on 20

On 20 February 1998, SP delivered its [AT Pulkovo Business Plan to the par-
ticipants and lenders of IAT Pulkovo (CX-41}.

On 8 June 1998, the EBRD established an internal Memorandum which indi-
cates that the Board basically approved the BOT-Project with project costs of
US$ 187 million and an EBRD loan of US$ 120 million, indicating further that
negotiations of the technical agreements with the Western parties are sub-
stantially complete, but that progress towards a closing of the operation is
hampered by a number of elements, one being the sporadic presence af SP
in Russia, another being the slow review process of the documentation by the
City of St. Petersburg and the Airport, and the third being the fact that the
Ministry of Finance had indicated that the Project Company would have to
apply for the Specified Events Guarantee through the channels that are used
for full sovereign guarantees, a process which might take 6 months+ (CX-
36).

On 8 July 1998, SP submitted a draft Independent Accountants’ Report (CX-
44) to Mr Sax.

On 15 July 1998, Strategic Partners advised the Governor Vladimir A. Yakov-
lev that EBRD had approved the financing already on 25 August 1997, that
since then various parties had been working towards financial closing, that
basically a new version of the Charter had been drafted, subject to the final
agreement of the City of St. Petersburg, and that various participants, includ-
ing the EBRD and DMG, had become concerned that the City of St, Peters-
burg had not taken all steps required to close the financing on an expedited
basis, and that in fact the City of St. Petersburg was delaying the closing as a
result of certain unspecified considerations (CX-43).

On 16 July 1998, on proposal of Mr Sax, a seminar preceding the sharehold-
ers meeting took place at which the EBRD proposal was discussed. RX-54."'

61 On 17 July 1998, SP commented on a Report regarding the separation of
Pulkovo-3 as an independent enterprise (CX-38). In its Memorandum, SP
suggested a revision of the Report in several respects.

62 In August 1998, according to Claimant, the financing proposal required to
permit the construction of the New International Passenger Terminal _failed to
close “as a result of the delay of the City of St. Petersburg and State Enter-
prise Pulkovo in approving and executing the required documentation before
the August 1998 Financial Crisis” (CM-2, para. 63). In this context, Clai-
mant repeated earlier allegations that the City of St. Petersburg and State
Enterprise Pulkovo were unable to pay for the construction of the access
roadways, the utilities and the apron.'”

63 According to Claimant, on 17 February 1999, the Board of Directors of IAT
Pulkovo approved the creation of a Working Commission to address the mat-
ters required to recommence the stalled development of the New Interna-
tional Passenger Terminal (CX-46).

64 In July 1999, the Working Commission agreed to finalize negotiations for the
development of the New International Passenger Terminal (CX-47).

65 In the further course of 1999, SP, PSP and inter alia, Skanska BOT AB en-
tered into a Development Agreement for the purpose of restructuring certain
financial and technical aspects (CX-48).

66 On 13 October 1999, Claimant informed the IATA of the intention to reani-
mate the Pulkovo-3 Project, raising questions as to the level of charges for
international passengers. His query was answered by a fax of IATA dated 14
October 1999 (CX-45).

67 On 16 February 2000, the recently formed Consortium with Skanska BOT et
al wrote a letter to Mr Sax withdrawing from the Consortium and Develop-

ment Agreement, since it had not been possible “to produce a bankable De-
velopment Plan for the Project" (CX-51, without signatures).

68 On 29 February 2000, Clairnant advised State Enterprise Pulkovo that the

proposed gallery extension to Pulkovo-2 (i.e, the then existing international
passenger Terminal) might be adverse to the interests of [AT Pulkovo and its
shareholders, but that he might be inclined to favourably consider entering
into a sub-lease for the requested land at an acceptable rental rate, and if
the construction of the proposed gallery was structured as the initial phase of
Pulkovo-3 (CX-49).

69 On 15 November 2000, SP addressed a letter to Mr Anatoly A, Aleksashin,

70

Vice Governor of the City of St. Petersburg, describing the services which
Strategic Partners had performed in respect of the Pulkovo-3 Project, stating
therein that “unfortunately, final negotiations to permit approval of financing
for Pufkovo-3 by IAT Pulkovo were interrupted by the August 1998 Russia
Federation Financia! Crisis”, The letter further expressed the firm belief in the
viability of Pulkovo-3 and, in order to reactivate the Project, Strategic Part-
ners submitted a draft Protocol of Agreement regarding the development, fi-
nancing and operating of Pulkovo-3 and the acquisition, financing and opera-
tion of Pulkovo-2, with the hope that the City of St. Petersburg and the Rus-
sian Federation would confirm their interest in concluding the negotiations
regarding Pulkovo-2 and Pulkovo-3 (CX-54, with Protocol of Agreement Cx-
55 and Protoccol Agreement among Shareholders, CX-56).

On 6 December 2000, the letter was acknowledged by Mr A.A. Mercianov,
Vice Chairman of the Committee for Economic and Industrial Policy of the
City of St. irg, I 1g for the p inr g the previously
achieved agreements and understandings which were caused by the Financial

 

Crisis of 1998, and requesting Claimant to provide a working proposal for
realizing the Project considering the new financial, economic and political sit-
uation in the Russian Federation (CX-53).4

The letter was followed up by a further letter addressed to Mr Sax dated 28
December 2000, acknowledging receipt of the letter of 15 November 2000
and the draft Memorandum and Agreement, and the readiness was ex-
pressed to recommend to the other shareholders to sign the Memorandum,
and proposing to hold a meeting “in the second half of the year of 2001"
{CX-52).

On 21 June 2001, Mr N. Karpov on behalf of Pulkovo Aviation Enterprise ad-
dressed a letter to Mr Sax enclosing a copy of the letter from Mr Trubin
(Chief of the Department of the Investment Projects of KUGI) which indicated
that IAT Pulkovo “Jost the right for this fend (sic!) long ago”. Mr Karpov re-
quested an answer to the question whether Mr Sax agreed to discontinue the
activity of the Stack Company IAT “Pulkovo" “on the voluntary basis as it is
determined in Article 17.1a of the Charter of the Closed Stock Company "IAT
Pulkovo" dated 29.05.1995" (CX-58),

On 26 June 2001, Claimant Mr Sax replied: “Contrary to your assertion, IAT
Pulkovo has not fost the right for this lease long ago. In fact, we wilf be wire-
transferring the required lease payment tater this waek. Accordingly, we do
not agree to discontinue the activity of IAT Pulkovo on a voluntary basis, In
addition, we witi strenuously contest any effort to either discontinue the ac-
tivities of IAT Pulkovo or terminate the Lease Agreement for the land under
Pulkovo-3." {CX-57).

In a "To Whom It May Concern" dated 27 June 2002, SP state that it had
recently come to its attention that the State Unitary Enterprise Pulkovo and
perhaps the City of St. Petersburg had undertaken the expansion of the ex-
isting international terminal (Pulkovo-2) in contravention of the current Lease
Agreement for Pulkovo-3 and without regard to our many years of effort and
multi-million Dollar investment, suggesting that a meeting should take place
to discuss possible remedies, It is unclear to whom this document was in fact
sant (CX-64).

On 21 August 2002, Mr Michael Karpov addressed a fax to SP with a letter
from Mr Romanenko of KUGI, alleging overdue payments and fines in an

amount of 483'592.92 Rubles. The letter was answered by SP on 2 Septern-
ber 2002 {CX-65).

Further correspondence was exchanged on 18 October 2002, 4 November
2002, 19 November 2002 and 21 November 2002 (CX-61, CX-62, CX-63,
CX-60).

On 17 December 2002, Mr Sax became the successor-in-interest to Strategic
Partners and PSP's 29.7% stock-interest in IAT Pulkovo, the Pre-
Development Advance and, as a developer of the New International Passen-
ger Terminal, the Development Fee, by execution of a Purchase Agreement
and delivery of a Bill of Sale (CX-66 and CX-59).

On 4 February 2003, the Arbitrazh Court of the City of St. Petersburg de-
clined the Property Management Committee's claim for the dissolution of the
Ground Lease. CX-72.

On 8 March 2003, a proposal for the development of Pulkovo-3 was put to-
gether (CX-74), It is not apparent from this document to whom this presen-
tation was made. Claimant explained, however, that the presentation was
made to the Presidential Administration of the City of St. Petersburg.

On 16 April 2003, State Enterprise Pulkovo, by letter of Mr M Karpov, con-
firmed that the Arbitrazh Court of St. Petersburg declined the Property Man-
agement Committee's claim for dissolution of the Ground Lease Agreement,
“and implicitly requested that SP agree to a voluntary dissolution of IAT Pul-
kovo”.'* Mr Sax was also informed by Mr Karpov that it was necessary to
come to a final decision regarding the further operation of IAT Pulkovo, indi-
cating further that three shareholders ("FSUAE Pulkovo, KUGI and Grassi")
agreed to discontinue the activity of the Stack Company IAT "Pulkovo" on a
voluntary basis (CX-69).

81 In May 2003, SP addressed a letter to Michael Karpov, advising /nter afia that
the shareholders of IAT Pulkovo must vote for voluntary termination and that
State Enterprise Pulkovo, as a result of the expansion of Pulkovo-2, was in
breach of the Founders' Agreement, the Charter and the Ground Lease (CX-
71).

82 On 21 November 2003, the State Enterprise Pulkovo advised Claimant of
KUGI's request {addressed to Mr Sax and Mr Demchenko) that payment must
be made in respect of the Ground Lease, failing which KUGI would initiate
court proceedings for collecting the payment and would initiate “the dissofu-
tion procedure of the Lend (sic!) lease Agreement to the court". (CX-70).

83 On 8 June 2004, the Federa| Arbitrazh Court dismissed the appeal of the
Property Management Committee (Respondent 2), and refused to terminate
the Ground Lease (CX-76),

84 On 30 September 2005, Pulkovo Airport and Pulkovo Airlines were divided
into two separate entities (CX-83).

85 On 9 October 2006, the Federal State Unitary Enterprise State Transport
Company Russia was registered in St. Petersburg, as the successor of Pulko-
vo Airlines, and on 29 October 2006, the latter and STC Russia started to fly
under a common flag and under the name of the merged entitiy, |. The
State Transportation Airline “Rossiya” (Respondent 4), CM-2 para. 108.

86 On 1 March 2007, Pulkovo Airport was converted into a joint-stock company
named OJSC Airport Pulkovo, and the Russian Federation became the owner
of Pulkovo Airport.

87 On 14 September 2007, Grimshaw & Partners, Ltd. won the New Interna-
tional Passenger Terminal design competition (CX-98).

88 On 25 September 2007, President V.V. Putin, by Presidential Decree, autho-
rized the transfer of Pulkovo Airport to the City of St. Petersburg as the sole
shareholder of Airport Pulkovo, OJSC, effective 29 December 2007 (CX-83).

transfer of Pulkovo Airport to the City of St. Petersburg, which became the
sole shareholder of Airport Pulkovo, effective 29 December 2007.

On 2 October 2007, Respondents, through Governor Matvienko and Dr Zil-
berquit, advised Claimant Mr Sax that the City of St. Petersburg intended to
develop the New International Passenger Terminal without Claimant's partici-
pation (CM-2, para, 113),

On 3 October 2007, Respondent 1 - by Governmental Decree No, 1265 -
authorized a strategic investment project for developing the Pulkovo Airport
and an action plan for the construction of an alternative international pas-
senger terminal, CX-151.

On 16 October 2007, the shares of Airport Pulkovo OJSC were transferred to
the City of St. Petersburg, by Governmental Decree No. 1432-IR.

On 14 January 2008, Paul A. Curran of Kaye Scholer LLP addressed a letter
to Open Stock Company Airport “Pulkovo", attn Director General Murov, ad-
vising that Claimant Mr Sax is the owner of a 29.7% interest in International
Airport Terminal “Pulkovo” (a Russian joint stock company) and moreover
that Mr Sax

“is also the holder of a 1998 US$ 20 million reccivable incurred in connection
with the development of a new international airport terminal in St. Peters-
burg’s Pulkovo International Airport, known as Pulkovo-3, presently valued in
excess of USS 50 million, and demanding on behalf of Mr Sax the reinstate-
ment of his 29.7% interest, or Lhe anticipated value, upon completion of Pul-
kavo-3, of a 29.7% interest in that entity, and the reimbursement of the US$
20 million resp, US$ 50 million pre-development cxpenses incurred by Mr
Sax." CX-84.

The letter closed with a paragraph inviting open bona fide negotiations, and
mentioning the intention to bring arbitration proceedings under the terms of
the Founders' Agreement and the Charter, both dated 19 May 1996 (CX-84),

94 On 24 January 2008, Claimant filed the Request for Arbitration, initiating the
present arbitral proceedings.

95 On 21 April 2008, about three months after the present proceedings were
initiated, Respondents published a Tender Notice for a USD 1,5 billion tender
for a 30-year concession to rebuild, expand and operate Pulkovo Airport,
which included the construction of the Alternative International Passenger
Terminal. CM-49, para. 76, CX-81, 95, 100, 101.

6 Around the same time, IAT Pulkovo, which was meant to be the investment
vehicle under the Investment Contract, was liquidated, In Claimant’s view

"Respondents maliciously liquidated the carporate vehicle for Claimant's in-
vestment in order to: (a) assert a defense, (b) deprive Claimant of a corpo-
rate vehicle, in an attempt to prevent reinstatement, and (c) deny claimant
justice both within the Russian judicial system and within this Arbitral Pro~
ceeding.” (CM-49, para. 102).

7 According to Claimant, the liquidation was done in an extraordinary summary
procedure, without a judicia| authorization as per Article 61 of the Russian
Civil Code, adopting a procedure exclusively applicable to abandoned compa-
nies (CM-3 paras 79-109; CM-49, paras. 87-97), without proper notice to the
public, and therefore without providing an opportunity to the public to assert
claims (with reference to the 2008 Gazette of State Registration, CX-160).
Moreover, Claimant also refers to Section 17.1 and 18.1 of the 1995 Charter
which, for a termination or liquidation, requires a unanimous vote at a
Stockholders’ Meeting, and a ruling to terminate the Company by a compe-
tent court. CM-49, para. 109,

98 The liquidation, in Claimant’s view, therefore constitutes a violation of cus-
tomary international law as well as a violation of Russian and St. Petersburg
Investor Protection Laws {CM-49, paras. 111 ~- 130), entitling Claimant to
damages (CM-49, paras. 131-159).

‘5 In this respect, Claimant filed an expert opinion by Professor Tal-Heng Chen, CWS-7,
regarding the alleged violation of customary internatianal law on expropriation which, the-
reby, also violated principles of good faith and nan-abuse of rights. Moreover, Professor Dr

On 29 September 2008, Claimant filed a Request for Injunctive Relief with
the St. Petersburg Arbitrazh Court, seeking injunctive relief to enjoin Res-
pondents from continuing with the Tender for the reconstruction of Pulkavo
Airport, or any actions designed to advance the Tender, until Clairnant's con-
tractual right to participate in the development of the New Internationa! Pas-
senger Terminal is adjudicated through the arbitral proceedings (CX~91).

On 3 October 2008, the St. Petersburg Arbitrazh Court denied Claimant's
request for injunctive relief for procedural reasons, explaining that an appli-
cation for injunctive relief must be filed together with the claim, or during the
proceedings. However, as at that moment, as the Court stated, no arbitral
proceedings were in place, Claimant's application was dismissed.

On 31 October 2008, Claimant appealed the decision (CX-78).
On 10 December 2008, the Appellate Court issued an interim order (CX-88).

On 10 February 2009, the Appellate Court denied Claimant's request for in-
junctive relief (CX-93).

Regarding the applicable law, Chapter 21.1 of the Charter provides as fol-
lows:

*This Charter shall be governed by appropriate Russian law, treaties and in-
ternational law.”

Claimant argues that, due to the connexity, the choice of law provision of
Chapter 21.1. of the Charter should also be deemed applicable for the
Founders’ Agreement.

Claimant's Requests

Claimant, in his Request for Arbitration dated 24 January 2008 (CM-1),
stated his claim as follows:

"Claimant has been damaged in an amount to be proved at the Hearing of
this matter but believed to be in excess of USD 50 million. In addition, in the
event that Claimant's 29.7% interest in IAT “Pulkovo" is not reinstated in the
entity which will develop "Pulkovo"-3, Claimant is entitled to recover, and
seeks an award of, the anticipated value, upon completion of "Pulkovo"-3, of
@ 29.7% interest in that entity. Finally, Claimant respectfully requests that
the Arbitrators award to him his attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses .,, .”

Claimant, in his Statement of Dispute and Claims filed on 22 June 2009, CM-
2, para. 162, enlarged his claim to reach a monetary value of US$

212'500'000, plus a clairn for reinstatement as the project developer for the

Alternative/New International Passenger Terminal at Pukovo Airport.

In CM-49, filed by Claimant on 15 October 2010, the prayers for relief were
further restated and expanded as follows:

"Claimant, as successor-in-interest to Strategic Partners and PSP, demands pay-
ment, by Respondents, jointly and severally, of USS 212,500,000, as follows:

(a)

(b)

The Pre-Development Advance Claim:

The US$ 19,772,277 Pre-Development Advance, which, as of April 30, 2009,
together with interest at LIBOR +2%, aggregates US$ 36,715,527, which
will, on the anticipated date of the arbitral award, towards the end of 2010
{the "Anticipated Date of the Arbitral Award"), be no less than USS

The anticipated value, upon completion, of a 29.7% Interest in the Alterna-
tive International Passenger Terminal, which will, on the Anticipated Date of
the Arbitral Award, in Claimant's opinion, based on the 6.5% capitalized val-
ue of the second year's cash flow fram operations (before debt service) of the
Alternative International Passenger Terminal (to be determined with specifici-
ty during the Arbitral Proceeding), be no less than US$ 150,000,000.

{c) The Development Fee Claim:

The 4.5% Development Fee due Claimant, which, according to Respondents’
estimate of the 2006 development cost far the Alternative International Pas-
senger Terminal, is US$ 21,832,681, which will, on the Anticipated Date of
the Arbitral Award, in Claimant's opinion, based on the 2010 estimated ag-
gregate development cost of the Alternative International Passenger Terminal
(to be determined with specificity during the Arbitral Proceeding), be no less
than USs 25,000,000.

{d) Expenses (including Legal Fees) of the Arhitral Proceeding:

Expenses (including legal fees) of the Arbitral Procceding should be
awarded/allocated amongst Claimant and Respondents, 29.7% and 70.3%,
respectively, according to their interests in IAT Pulkovo, as more particularly
discussed below.

(e) Non-Waiver of Claim for Reinstatement; Claim for Specific Performance

i Claimant, by monetizing the 29.7% Interest Claim as one for not less
than US$ 150,000,000, does not waive his claim, as sct forth in the
Request for Arbitration, for rcinstatement (the "Claim for Reinstate-
ment") of his 29.7% interest (on a fully diluted basis), as project de-
veloper, in the entity which will devclop either the New International
Passenger Terminal or that portion of the alternative terminal (the
“AT") proposed in the Public Private Partnership ("PPP") entered into
by some or all of Respondents with Northern Capital Gateway Con-
sortium designed to service international flights, as defined in Section
8.5 of the Founders Agreement (“International Flights"), However,
Claimant conditions his Claim for Reinstatement on the Arbitration
Tribunal's imposition on Respondents of conditions precedent and

subsequent, acceptable to Claimant, to avoid an illusory award of
reinstatement,

ii. Claimant is entitled to an award of reinstatement requiring Respon-
dents to restructure the PPP to grant Claimant the benefit of the
terms of the agreements belween Claimant and Respondents, as fol-
fows:

a. partition the physical facilities in the AT used to service Interna-
tional Flights from the physical facilities in the AT used to service
all other flights;

b. segregate all passengers arriving and/or departing on Interna-
tional Flights from all other arriving and/or departing passengers;

¢, segregate all accounting mechanisms for the AT related to that
part of the AT used to service International Flights, including ex-
penses for development and construction and revenues and ex-
penses for operation of International Flights;

d. retain Claimant as the developer of that portion of the AT used to
service International Flights; and

e. restructure the PPP for that pertion of the AT used to service In-
ternational Flights to;

1) eliminate the revenue charge of Respondents,

2) grant Claimant a 29.7% interest in that portion of the AT
used to service International Flights,

3) extend the lease for the AT to two terms of 49 years each,
and impose controls to protect Claimant's rights as a minority
shareholder."

In his Memorial CM-66, para. 120, Claimant increased the value of his mone-
tary claim (total of principal amount claimed) to an ammount between USS
350'485'672 and US$ 459'653’668, plus Interest and legal expenses, arbitra-
tion costs; literally (in CM-66, para. 120), Claimant claims:

"the pre-development advance claim which Is calculated to range between

18,800,000, plus the vaiue of Claimant's 29.7% interest in IAT Pulkovo which
has been calculated at US$ 294’500'000, plus interest to be calculated, plus
all legal expenses and other expenses related to this Arbitration.”

On 22 April 2011, in CM-68, para, 2, Claimant further amended his claims as
follows:

. Total claim US$ 459'700'000:

. a) Pre-development Advance Claim, with interest at the contractual rate of
15.5%: US$ 146'400'000 as of 31 December 2011

* b) The 29.7% Interast Claim upon completion af the Alternative International
Passenger Terminal; US$ 294'500'000

. ¢) The 4.5% Development Fee Claim (based on the cost of the Alternative In-
ternatianal Passenger Terminal: US$ 18’800'000

. d) Expenses {including legal fees) of the Arbitral Tribunal, to be
awarded/allocated amongst Claimant and Respondents in the ratio 29.7% and
70.3%, and

« e) Reinstatement of Claimant of his 29.7% interest as project developer, in the
entity which will develop the NIPT or the Alternative International Passenger
Terminal, conditioned on the Tribunal’s imposition on Respondents of condi-
tions precedent and subsequent, acceptable to Claimant, to avoid an Illusory
award of reinstatement,

In Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief filed on 20 January 2012, Claimant stated
that he no longer seeks specific performance of PSP's right to be the devel-
oper of the alternative international passenger terminal (AIPT), but maintains
the claim for his entitlement to be paid a developer fee, which claim had
been transferred to Claimant on the basis of the Purchase Agreement and Bill
of Sale.

In a further paragraph, Claimant stated that he seeks specific performance
only insofar as to grant him an equity position in the ALPT that is financially

equivalent to PSP's 29.7% interest in IAT Pulkovo; alternatively, he seeks the
monetized value in damages of that interest. '*

The Tribunal notes that CM-85 does not contain any further discussion on the
development expenses and some further aspects which were extensively re-
viewed during the Hearings. The Tribunal, however, understood from the
opening paragraphs of the PH-Brief that all earlier factual and legal argu-
ments are to be considered incorporated by reference into the PH-Brief, and
that the silence to discuss some further aspects cannot be taken as a waiver
or an admission.

The Tribunal's Classification of Claimant's Claims

The several claims, as had been submitted by Claimant in these proceedings,
in particular in CM-68 and CM-85, may be classified as follows:

. The claim under (a) basically stands for the Pre-development Costs in-
curred by the Foreign Parties, essentially in the 1990s;

. the claims under (b), (c) and (e) are claims connected to the frustrated
Participation as investor and developer in the new project vehicle for
constructing and developing the Alternative [nternational Passenger
Terminal, whereby the reinstatement claim is a claim which first was
submitted as a claim for specific performance, and was then re-phrased
as a claim alternatively for specific performance or for a the monetized
value respectively a damage claim;

. claim (d) deals with the allacation of arbitration costs.

For the purpose of the further review and discussion in the present Award,
the Tribunal distinguishes four categories of claims:

. First, Claimant's monetary claim as a creditor for reimbursement of
pre-development expenditures incurred (essentially in the 1990s),
plus the related interest claim;

. Second, Clairnant’s monetary claim for a 4.5% developer fee;

. Third, Claimant's investor-claim for the (new) Alternative Interna-
tional Passenger Terminal, or the monetary value ascribed thereto;

« Fourth, Claimant's claim for recovering arbitration costs.

The Tribunal observes that the first three categories of claims above are de-
rived from, and are based, on the ground of the Parties investment relation-
ships and the bundle of obligations resulting therefrom, The overall legal re-
lationships consists of multifold aspects grounding in norms of civil law, con-
tract law, matters governing joint ventures, corporate governance, and secu-
rity laws. All of them are closely interlinked and can hardly be separated onc
from the other without detriment to the essence of the relationships among
the Parties and the their primary interest, which was the cooperation for mu-
tual benefits in their investment activity. In this respect the Tribunal looked
into the dispute from the investment law perspective.

Respondents’ Requests

Respondents 1 and 2, in their Staternent of Defense filed on 20 September
2009, deny all of the claims in full; literally on page 5;

“The Respondents deny, in full, all claims made by the Claimant (para. 162 a-
d of the Statement of Claims) and requests that the Tribunal shall reject
those claims.

The City requests that the Tribunal shall reject those claims, inter alia for the
follawing reasons:

(i) Claims have not been proven, since the documents presented in confirmation
of such claims cannot serve as acceptable evidence,

(ii) Claims are groundless and do not have clear subject, i.e. are objectless.

{iil} Claims are not based on provisions of applicable law and are in contradiction
with such provisions.

(iv) The Claimant has failed to prove succession of rights to the shares of [AT
Pulkovo and therefore he is not in the position to file claims under the State-
ment of Claims,

(¥) Claims should be addressed to IAT Pulkovo rather than the City and the City
is undue respondent to such claims.

{vi) The statute of limitatians applicable to the claims under the Statement of
Claims has already expired.

(vil) As of today the project on development of the Terminal has already termi-
nated.

(vill) Claims do not meet criteria of reasonableness, justifiability and commensura-
bility.

(ix) Expenses of the Claimant have not been confirmed, and the calculatlans of
the relief sought are wrong.

Above reasons and many other reasons for rejecting the claims of the Clai-
mant are set aut in more detail in this Statement of Defense."

122 In their Rejoinder, as well as in subsequent submissions and the PH-Brief
filed on 20 January 2012 (1-RM-37/2-RM-43), Respondents 1 and 2 reite-
rated their requests.

123 Respondents 3, 4 and 5 did not present substantiated submissions or denials
in respect of Claimant's substantive claims, it being however noted that there
are a few letters/emails on file, essentially In regard to the nomination of
Respondents' Arbitrator, The Tribunal has reasons to believe that none of the
Respondents agrees with the claim; Respondents’ silence — indeed in con-

were delivered to them by international courier service; moreover, the Tri-
bunal’s numerous emails were properly received. Prior to the Hearings, the
Tribunal particularly invited Respondents 3 to 5 to take part in the Hearings,
be it only by delegating a "silent listener” for observing the regularity of the
process.

On 29 September 2010, the Tribunal Issued its 19"" Order dealing with mat-
ters of valid representation and setting further time-limits.

On 19 October 2010, the Chairman invited Claimant's counsel to comply with
the Tribunal's suggestions, contained in the 1% Order of 28 August 2008, re-
garding the consecutive numbering of Claimant's Memorials/ Submis-
sions/letters {to be marked as "CM-__}, and the consecutive numbering of
Claimant's Exhibits with "CX- _" and Witness Statements/Expert Reports, to
be numbered "CWS-__".

On 5 November 2010, the Tribunal issued its 20"’ Order, addressing numer-
ous submissions filed by the Parties in October 2010, It deait with the proper
standing of Respondents and their representation by counsel, Furthermore,
the Tribunal rejected Claimant's request submitted by CM-48 (para. 28),
wherein Claimant urged the Tribunal that it should deem “all of Claimant's al-
fegations against Respondents 3, 4 and 5° as having been admitted, and
precluding them from presenting any further evidence before this Tribunal.
The Tribunal stated that such a deemed admission (|) disregards the deeply-
reoted practice in international arbitration, (ii) is contrary to the Swedish Ar-
bitration Act and some 60 or more arbitration acts following the UNCITRAL
Mode} Law, and (ili) not reflected in any of the arbitration rules of the major
arbitral institutions, nor (iv) compatible with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules
governing the present proceedings.

Regarding the nomination of Professor Bushev, the Tribunal noted that he
had been validly nominated by Respondents 1, 2, 4 and 5, concluding that,
since Respondent 3 no longer appears to be a Party, any doubts as to the
proper composition of the Tribunal appear to be removed. The Order further
addressed the mode of communications from the Tribunal to the Parties and
addressed numerous matters in preparation for the Hearing on interim
measures, documentary matters and procedure, fixed to take place in Ziirich
on 16 and 17 December 2010.

On 19 November 2010, the Chairman issued an e-mail requesting clarifica-
tion regarding Claimant's requests and prayers for relief. Moreover, in re-

pondents’ Submission of 8 November 2010, Claimant's Submission of 15 No-

On the same date, 29 November 2010, the Tribunal issued its 22" Order
which contained a detailed shortlist of topics for discussion, examinations and
pleadings at the occasion of the Hearing on interim relief scheduled to take
place on 16/17 December 2010.

The list contained the following 30 issues:
"Locus standi, Jurisdiction, Valid Representation

1 Claimants focus stand/ as a sharehalder of IAT Pulkovo (validity of CX-66 and CX
59}{considering Respondents comments regarding the non-issuance of the
shares).

2 Clairnant's focus standi to make claims as an Investor under the Investment Con-

8 What was the significance of the tlme-window for coming up with the financing?

9 What is the significance of the continued efforts of the parties beyond the time-

window?

10-Did the project "fail", as Respondents argue, due to shoricaming of Claimant re-
spectively Strategic Partners/PSP?

Did Respondents breach their obligatians?
Were PSP and /or the Claimant ever granted exclusivity?

Would exclusivity violate Russian antitrust laws? In 1995/96? In 2007? Under Ar-
ticle 7 of the 1991-Law? Article 15 of the 2006 Law?

Was the project “up and alive" even during the ycars of the tate 1990s to 2007,
or was it conclusively/tacitly (although not through formal notice) abandoned?
Was - at some stage - the momentum lost for realizing the intial project?

Hence: Did the corporate and contractual relationship come to an end at some
stage, tacitly, by conclusive behavior or otherwise?

Time-Bar?

16 Impact of any statute of limitations on (i) the position as investor, and (ii) the
position as a creditor for monctary claims for expenditures and damages? Are
contractual or corporate actions time-barred?

penditures incurred in 1995 onwards) earlier, for instance in 1998, or at least in
subsequent years?

The Alternative Terminal
18 Why was PSP not invited to tender for the Alternative Terminal?

19 Could Claimant have satisfied the pre-qualification requirements for the tender
for the AT?

20 Comparing the initial project with the new project (AT): is the AT the kind of
project which had been envisaged in 1995/1996, or is it an “afiuo” (a Latin term)

What is the status of the AT development?

months would be imposed?

24 What would be (i) the practicality and (ii) the proportionality of the requested
measure, having regard to the actual situation and the merits of the case?

25 Would the requested measure - re-instating Claimant as the investor - be realis-
tically possible?

26 How could Claimant satisfy the normal pre-qualifying means-test?

27 Does the project objectively require that the investor/develaper must mect cer-
tain credentials, and are Claimant's actual credentials as a developer for such an
airport project sufficient, based on what is mentioned in Mr Sax' witness state-
ment?

Claimant's Requests ("Interim Requests")

Although the present arbitration had been Initiated by a letter of Claimant's
then counsel Paul A. Curren dated 14 January 2008, followed by the Request
for Arbitration dated 24 January 2008 {CM-1), Claimant only submitted a de-
tailed request for interim measures in January 2010,

An immediate in-depth examination of Claimant's requests, however, had to
be deferred due to Claimant's challenges to Respondents’ nominated Arbitra-
tor, since the Tribunal considered it inappropriate to render decisions on inte-
rim relief unless and until its proper constitution has been established.

After the decision made by the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce under the
date of 16 September 2010 regarding dismissal of the challenge against Pro-
fessor Bushey, the Tribunal, in its 18” Order of 17 September 2010, sug-
gested that Claimant may update and consolidate his Requests for Interim
Rellef, facilitating an in-depth review at the Hearing in Zurich, schedules to
take place on 16/17 December 2010.

Claimant did so by filing CM-45 titled "Claimant's Consolidated Request for
Interim Measures of Protection" dated 22 September 2010 and in its further
Submission CM-50, filed on 15 October 2010 in response to comments sub-
mitted by Respondents 1 and 2.

Claimant's requests ("Interim Request") as per para. 11 of CM-50 read as
follows:

"(a) An injunction precluding Respondents from facilitating the construction or fi-
nancing of that portian of the AT used to service International Flights, including but
not limited to:

by the EBRD, the IFC and/or any other entity for that portion of the AT used

(b) An order requiring Respondents to take such actions as are necessary to
cause No/thern Capital to refrain from:

by the EBRD, the IFC and/or any other entity which would be used to finance
the construction of, or which would encumber the facility of revenucs of, that
portion of the AT used to service International Flights;

ii. participating in any act to facilitate the construction of that portion of the AT
used to service International Flights.

{c) An order requiring Respondents to notify Northern Capital, Fraport AG and
any and all financiers of the AT (referred to collectively here as the "Third Par-
ties") of the pendency of this Arbitral Proceeding and of Claimant's Claim for
specific performance herein.

{d) Alternatively, if for some reason the Arbitration Tribunal does not consider it
appropriate to grant the above requests, Claimant requests that the Arbitral

performance in the Arbitral Proceeding, and strike paragraphs 378-384 of
Respondents’ Statement of Defense.

dents" failure to inform Claimant and the Arbitration Tribunal of Respondents’
ongoing efforts to aggravate the current dispute by proceeding speedily with
the construction of the AT, which is clearly incompatible with the pendency of
this Arbitral Proceeding.”

With a view to providing same guidance to counsel of both sides as to the
main areas which the Tribunal would wish to review together with the Parties
at the Zirich-Hearing, the Tribunal prepared a short-list of 30 issues to be
discussed in the context of properly analyzing his requests for interim meas-

ures. This short-list was contained in the Tribunals 22" Order, issued on 29
November 2010. The short-list has been reflected above in Chapter E of this
Award.

Claimant argued his case regarding his Interim Requests in further written
Submissions, and extensively argued his case orally at the occasion of the
Hearing in Zurich held on 16/17 December 2010.

Respondents’ Denial Regarding Interim Relief
Respondents 1 and 2 denied all of the requests.

In respect of Respondents 3, 4 and 5, the Tribunal has not seen any com-
ments in respect of the Interim Requests, The Tribunal takes them as being
denied by all Respondents.

The Tribunal's Procedural Decision as per the 24" Order of 8 Febru-
ary 2014

In its 24" Order, para. 130, the Tribunal ruled as follows:

"The Tribunal concludes, for the purpose of the present decision on the grant-
ing of interim relief referring to Claimant's reinstaternent as an investor, that
the Interim Requests - absent a showing of proper focus stand of the Clal-
mant - must be denied,

This conclusion, however, only applies to Mr Sax’ reinstatement claim, but
does not as such apply to purely monetary interests/claims which might have
been validly assigned to him by PSP on the basis of the assignment filed as
CX-66, This, however, is not to be reviewed in tha present Order.”

The Tribunal - in reaching its aforementioned conclusion - considered the
following aspects - which are literally incorporated herein - regarding
Claimant's focus stand/:

“Essentially, Claimant's substantive claims submitted in the framework of the present
Arbitration stand on two different legs, one being for some monetary compensa-
tion/damages, and the second being his claim for specific performance, in the sense
that he should be reinstated as the investor for the Pulkovo Airpart Project (the latter
coupled with a number of conditions precedent and subsequent and acceptable to
Claimant (sce hereta Claimant's requests in Chapter B above).

Claimant's interim requests {as recited in Chapter C above) all refer to Claimant's
reinstatement claim,

The distinction between the two legs of Claimant's claim is important and triggers
significantly differont legal issues. In fact: While a claim for some reimbursement of
expenditures and a claim for darnages may well have arisen (or may validly have
been assigned to Claimant by Pulkovo (Strategic Partners) Ltd., (Cyprus) as the party
to the Founders’ Agreament and the Charter, which matter however does not need to
be discussed or decided herein, it Is a fundamentally different matter whether Clai-
mant, as an individual, could validly “stand into the shoes” of the initial party to the
underlying contracts (respectively the Investment Contract, as the Claimant characte-
rizes the contracts), and thereby claim to be given the position as a succeeding inves-
tor, succeeding to Strategic Partners,

The Tribunal will, therefore, have to analyse whether Pulkovo (Strategic Partners) Ltd.
could, with valid effects vis-a-vis the other parties of the Founders’ Agreement and
the Charter, assign and transfer its position as an investor to Mr Carl A. Sax as an in-
dividual, It is noted that the sale and transfer was made pursuant to a tripartite Sales
Agreement, CX-66, dated i7 December 2002, signed by Mr Cari A Sax on behalf of
Pulkovo {Strategic Partners} Ltd., further signed by Mr Carl A Sax on behalf of Stra-
tegic Partners (Holdings) Ltd. and signed by Mr Carl A Sax in his personal name, re-
lating to the sale of a 29.7% stock interest in IAT Pulkovo, and the assignment of a
"$20+-million pre-devclopment expense receivable". The sale is further evidenced by
a Bill of Sale, signed by the sellers/assignors Pulkovo (Strategic Partners) Ltd, and
Strategic partners (Holdings) Ltd, signed under the same date by Mr Carl A Sax, sign-
ing for both {CX-59),

The Tribunal had specifically raised this rather obvious intuitu personae — issue in its
communications to counsel for their preparations for the December 2010 — Hearings.

portionality, the general requirement for posting security and the requesting party's
ligdility for damages, - The text horeinatter reflected deals with the most significant is-
sue of Claimant! locus standi,]

The issue of Claimant's focus standi is the single most important and most critical
element to he considered here and this most critical element, therefore, had been
clearly flagged out to the Parties and their counsel prior to the Hearings. In succinct
form, the most relevant aspects are as follows:

In January 1992, Mr Sax, as per his allegatians in CM-2, para. 3 ss., received a
“mandate letter" inviting him to form a consortium of Western companies for the pur-
pose of discussing the development of the Pulkovo Airport.

Based on such mandate, Claimant, in 1992/93, together with a number of Western
companies, met with representatives of tho City of St. Petersburg for the purpose of
discussing the development of the Pulkovo Airport.

During those meetings with representatives of the City of St. Petersburg (Vladimir V.
Putin, at that time Vice-Mayor of the City, and Mayor Anatoly A. Sabchak), the City of
St, Petersburg requested Mr Sax to form a consortium of Western companies far the
purpose of developing Pulkovo-3.

Thereupon, on 16 March 1994, the company named "Strategic Partners, Incorpo-
rated, USA", represented by Claimant Mr Sax, entered into an Agreement (which in
these proceedings was referred to as the "Protocol of Agreement"} under which the
Parties agreed to jointly redevelop the St. Petersburg Pulkovo International Airport,
by developing Pulkovo-3 (CX-2), The Agreement was signed by Vladimir V. Putin in
his (then) capacity as the Vice-Mayor of the City of St. Petersburg.

The Protocol of Agreement relates to the financing and construction of Pulkovo airport
facilities and provided for the establishment of a joint stock company.

While the Protocol of Agreement was entered into in the name of a US company
("Strategic Partners, Incorporated, USA"), Claimant - according to his witness state-
ment CWS-1 of 15 October 2010, para. 11 - formed a Cayman Island company bear-
ing the same name, i.e. Strategic Partners (Holdings) Limited ("SPHL"), in which
Claimant - according to his statement - at all material times held a minimum of 25%
of the shares, and In which he served as Vice Chairman and Director.

Claimant Mr Sax, in 1995,

 

“assembled one of the first consortia to offer airport terminal devclopment,
construction, reparation, financing and management services through a con-
sortium of ft ies, KNOWN as Partners
€ ings) Limited { Partners"). gic Partners’

and/or participants included American International Group, American Interna-
tional Underwriters Overseas, Ltd, a/k/a, AIG; Deutsche Bank ft/k/a,
Deutsche Morgan Grenfell f/k/a, Morgan Grenfell & Co., Ltd.; STV Group, In-
corporated; AvFuel Incorporated; VINCI f/k/a, Group GTi4; Aeroports de Par-
is; SKANSKA and others."

 

 

 

 

206 In parallel, or about the same time, SPHL (Strategic Partners (Holdings) Limited),
which Mr Sax described as a consortium, formed - for the purpose of implementing
the Pulkovo project - a wholly-awned subsidiary, i.e. Pulkovo {Strategic Partners) Li-
mited, Cyprus (CM-2 para. 12).

207 Subsequently, PSP (represented by Mr Carl A. Sax as Executive Vice-President and
General Counsel) together with four further parties, entered into the Founders’
Agreement (CX-6) dated 19 May 1995, and JSC International Airport "Pulkovo"” was
formed (by the Parties referred to as "IAT Pulkovo").

208 Likewise, the Charter of ISC International Airport “Pulkovo", equally dated 19 May
1995, was signed by the five founders, among them PSP, again represented by Carl
A, Sax as Executive Vice-President.

209 Claimant refers to the Founders’ Agreement and the Charter for creating IAT Pulkovo
(as the corporate vehicle) as the “Investment Cantract" (CM-49, para. 34).

210 The investor, therefore, as regards the project lined up in 1994/95 was the Cypriot
subsidiary of Strategie Partners whose shareholders and/or participants included the
companies as referred to by Mr Carl Sax in his witness statement {sce above), all of
them known as significant players.

211 The significance of SPHL's then held position as a major player for airport develop-
ments was further emphasized by Claimant, by referring to an impressive list of
SPHL's then (1996 to 1999) involvements in the development of numerous intarna-
tional airports and airport terminals, including projects in Russia for (i} Moscow's Se-

temala, (vi) Congo, {vii} Ecuador, (viii) Indonesia, (ix) Honduras, (x) Pakistan, (xi)
Armenia, (xii) Jamaica and (xiii) Uruguay.

The more precise involvements in these projects mentioned in CWS-1, however, have
not been ascertained in the present proceedings’, and the Tribunal was not made
aware of, for instance, current projects where SPHL (or Claimant personally) plays a
significant role as an airport developer, Claimant, at the December 2010 Hearings,
simply mentioned that he, when rcinstated as an investor, would without difficulty be
able to put together a new and significant international consortium for realizing the
Pulkovo project.

The above are some of the parameters which the Tribunal has to consider in respect
of its reflections on Claimant's focus standi. The Tribunal's reflections are as follows,

It is within the nature of such an investment contract that the contract is concluded
with each one of the parties having regard to the parties’ individual standing, abilities,

or The ip, thus, is formed intuitu perso-
nae (for using this Latin term of art).

 

A natural consequence of this understanding of the contractual relationship is that the
individual party as such is not exchangeable or interchangeable, unless all other par-
tics would agree; more particularly, obligations assumed by one party cannot, without
the agreement of all other parties, be "assigned" to a new party,

While the above certainly holds true as a general conclusion, quite irrespective of any
legal system applicable, this understanding - in the present case - is moreover
clearly apparent from, and reflected in, the Charter (CX-5), Chapter 16, and in the
Founders’ Agreement, Article XI (CX-6),

Chapter 16 of the Charter and Article XI of the Founders' Agreement reflect the /ntul-
tu personae notion under the title “Transfer of Shares”. According to thase provisions,
it is dear that the right to transfer shares is restricted in very explicit terms and pro-

>»? At the Hearing of 16 December 2010, Mr Sax, questioned about the then current airport
(re-)development projects, specifically referred to the project in Ho Chi Minh City, which
project was worked on by strategic Partners together with AIG, Deutsche Bank, Raytheon
and Nissho Iwai. On question of the Chairman whether any of these projects materialized,
Mr Sax answered by a "no". Transcript 16dec10, page 93.

visions and, inter alia, requires an “acquisition proposal", with an offering procedure
which is in detail laid down in Clause 16.4, ‘The provisions are very detailed and run
over some 5 pages, all of which indicate the importance which the Parties attributed
to the matter. Absent a compliance, it would seem clear that a valid transfer of the
position as a shareholder and investor could not take place.

Thus, PSP - absent compliance with Chapter 16 of the Charter and Article XI of the
Founders’ Agreement ~- was precluded from transferring its shareholding to Claimant
Mr Sax, An effective trarisfer was morcover not possible, because the shares in IAT
Pulkovo were never formally issued, and thus could not be validly registered in the
personal name of Mr Carl A Sax.

Claimant - in the framework of the present Arbitration - described himself as being
the “successor-in-interest" of PSP, based on the assignment between PSP and Mr Sax
of 17 December 2002. The relevant document was submitted as CX-66, as referred to
above. Respondents 1 and 2 dispute the validity of such an assignment as regards the
position as a shareholder or investor, emphasizing that the shares of IAT Pulkovo had
never been issued and, thercfore, could not validly be transferred.

The above situation leads to a rather obvious conclusion in the sense that - absent a
formal approval by all Partics of the Charter and the Founders' Agreement - PSP
could not validly transfer its position as an investor in IAT Pulkovo, and Claimant Mr
Sax could not validly assume and take over the function from PSP as a party to the
cantractual relatianship formed in 1994/1995, Such approval, however, did not occur.

Therefore, as regards the position as an investor/sharcholder, the Assignment as per
€X-66 can not produce a valid effect recognizable under the applicable Russian Law.
Only purely manetary interests or claims may be considered assignable without con-
sent of the other investors/shareholders,

Under the intuitu personae nation, one may also say that it was

. one thing to deal with Strategic Partners in 1994 and thereafter with the - at
that time - impressing business partners lined up and associated with Strategic
Partners at that time {as described by Mr Sax in his witness statement, CWS-5,
pages 3/4, specifically referred to above}, and the numerous projects then
worked on (also referred to above, projects numbered (i) to (xlii),

° and another thing to see and accept Mr Sax re-instated as an investor, in his
personal capacity, with no established record whether or net he had kept any
personal activity in airport development since the later 1990s, and without the
support he had indicated standing behind Strategic Partners in the 1990s,
simply with the proposition that - as he affirmed during the Hearings (soc the
passages quoted abave} ~ still today he would casily be in a position to put to-
gether a consortium which would match any required standard for a requisite
qualification to realize the Alternative Terminal Project.

Hence, the Contract-party which had been accepted to became an investors in the
1990s, |.e. Strategic Partner respectively PSP, on the one side, and Claimant as an
individual entrepreneur on the other side, are different “pairs of shoes".

At the Hearing, Claimant, in his impressive enlhusiasm (greatly respected by the Tri-
bunal), affirmed that in 2007 - had his continued right to be the investor for a new
Airport Terminal been respected - he would, within weeks, have been able to put to-
gether a new and strong consortium (possibly better than Northern Capital Gateway);
sce the excerpted dialogue above.

Yet, such an affirmation, impressive as it is, can hardly be sufficient for the Russian
Parties to rely on,

More significantly, Claimant had made no tangible steps to take part in the 2007 ten-
der, nor has he put together such a consortium which could have fulfilled the pre-
tendering qualifications.

Toa summarize the Tribunal's reflections: For two essential reasons, the Tribunal has
significant difficulty to affirm Claimant's /ocus standi as an investor:

. First, the shareholder's position of the investor PSP was clearly ad personam,
and was transferable only upon a prior offering of shares to the other parties,
and thereafter by complying with all further transfer restrictions; nothing of
this was done; and it could not even be done, since the IAT Pulkovo shares had
never been issued; consequently, Claimant (quite correctly) only describes
himself as a “successor-in-interest", and not, legally, as a successor.

. Second, under the circumstances, the Russian Parties, in 2007, could not rea-
sonably be expected to accept Mr Carl A Sax as the individual investor, not
even on the basis of a promise - which had not even been made - to put to-

gether a strang consortium, 13 years after the discussions regarding the Prato-
cal in 1994, During those years, the momentum got lost, and the “world”
changed, possibly in Russia even faster than elsewhere,

Between 1994/95 and 2007, the "world" has changed - this Lrifle statement raises a
legal question not argued by the Parties, but nevertheless worth mentioning as an ob-
iter dictum:

Claimant, in his testimony on 16 December 2010 at the Hearing, mentioned that he
(respectively Strategic Partners), in 1994/1995, were accepted without a tendering
procedure, and he stated that - when planning for the Alternative Terminal in 2007
- the Russian Parties should simply have called him, and should have accepted him
without submitting the project to a public tender, arguing implicitly that legal-
ly/contractually the Russian Parties were still bound by the inilial agreement reached
in 1995.

This raises an interesting issue:

. During this period of time, relevant Russian law changed or may have changed.
In particular, Russian anti-trust law changed, and possibly new procurement
laws and requirements were enacted or became more closely observed or en-
forced than, for Instance, in 1994/1995,

- If this, as a legal hypothesis, is correct, and if in 2007 new public procurement
rules and tendering requirements were applied, the question is whether, in the
framework of a contractual relationship, a party has an Implied or vested right
that, during the term of the contractual relationship, changes in the legislative
framework would not apply to such existing relationships.

. This issue is normally answered in the negative, i.e. in the sense that a con-
tractual party (such as PSP respectively Mr Sax) has no protected or vested
right, absent very particular assurances or particular stabilization-of-law claus-
es (as controversial as they are), that the applicable laws remain unchanged
during the contract period, or even during an unlimited period of time.

. Hence, it is not an exception, but rather a normal situation, that laws are
changing, in some countries more often and more rapidly than in others, and in
specific arcas of business more rapidly than In others,

. For instance, changed financial and economic situations have given rise to new

urgent measures and regulations, and - absent very specific guarantees -
parties have no choice but to adapt to changed legal parameters, possibly after
@ certain transitory period, and in exceptional circumstances, new regulations
even purport to take a retroactive effect.!*

231 This obiter dictum supports the Tribunal's conclusion that Claimant's daim — in the
sense that he was contractually and legally entitled to be the fareign investor in con-
nection with the 2007 Alternative Terminal, without subjecting himsclf ta a tendering
procedure - is unconvincing.

232 To sum up: The Tribunal concludes, for the purpose of the prescnt decision on the
granting of interim relief referring to Claimant's reinstatement as an investor, that the
Interim Requests - absent a showing of proper focus stand/ of the Claimant - must
be denied.

233 This conciusion, however, only applies to Mr Sax' reinstatement claim, but does not
as such apply to purely monetary interests/claims which might have been validly as-

During the deliberations of the present Award, the Tribunal was made aware of Article 422
of the Russian CC which addresses this issue. Accordingly, a contract must comply with
the rules mandatory for the parties established by law as well as by other legal acts {im-
perative norms) which are in effect at the time of its conclusion, If, after the conclusion of
a contract, a law is adopted which establishes rules that are mandatory for the parties and
are different from those which were in effect at the time the contract was concluded, the
contract shall remain in force, except for cases where the law specifically provides for a
retroactive cffect.

In many cases a new law may impose on the parties additional obligations or even restric-
tions. Where such provisions relate to, so called, vertical relationships, i.e. the relation-
ships between a party to the contract and the public authority (c.g. for the payment of
taxes, customs duties, compliance with reporting requirements, licensing and the like),
which become obligatory for such a party, and where - as a result of the issuance of such
act of state - the performance of the obligation becomes impossible in full or in part, the
obligation is terminated in full, or in the respective part (Article 471.1 Russian CC). It is
therefore clear that each party bears a risk of the changing of the relevant legislation, [To
note: This fn is added by the Tribunal for the purpose of this Award and was not contained
in the text of the 24" Order.]

234 It is clear that the above decision only reflected the Tribunal's provisional
view for the purpose of an interim procedural decision, and that therefore the
focus standi of Claimant as regards his reinstatement claim remained open
for further and better submissions by the Parties and reconsideration by the
Tribunal, and in fact was further reviewed at the Stockholm Hearings.

235 Claimant, in his PH-Brief filed on 20 January 2012, recognized the Tribunal’s
concern regarding the reinstatement claim, by amending his request to a
purely monetary claim.

a)

In a second part of the 24% Order, the Tribunal listed Claimant's extensive
documentary requests, noting that they go far beyond the standards of the
1999 IBA Rules (and the 2010 IBA Rules) on the Taking of Evidence in Inter-
national Commercial Arbitration. -- Hence, all requests were, for the time
being, denied,

In further parts of the 24'" Order, the Tribunal dealt with several further mat-
ters including the applicability of the Tribunal's determination to the remain-
ing Respondents, the cost implications (to be decided in the Final Award),
and the organization of the further proceedings.

In the latter respect, the Tribunal suggested a bifurcation in the sense that,
first, the issues on liability would be considered, in which context the Tribunal
identified eight main issues - quite in the sense of a “road-map” - which
should be addressed by counsel in up-coming written and oral proceedings,
and in respect of which detailed liability Hearings need to be scheduled.

This "road-map" listed the following issues:

quote

Issue 1: Did Strategic Partners/PSP fulfill its promised tasks correctly, by providing
the financing as contemplated, (i) timely, or within a conceded stretch of the time-
window? And (li) in a manner which should have been accepted by Respondents and

IAT Pulkovo?

If yes: what are the consequences?

b) If no: what are the consequences? Did the Project — as Respondents allege - fail
due to shortcoming of Strategic Partners/PSP? Would this bar any and all of Clai-
mant's claims?

241 Issue 2: Did the Protocol, the Founders’ Agreement and the Charter at all Impose
binding obligations?

242 Issue 3: Was the Project not realized in the 1990s
a) due to shortcomings of Respondents?

b) Were they committed in a binding manner, and if so, did they breach their contrac-
tual obligations?

243 Issue 4: Was the Project still-born after 1997 or any time thereafter, or tacitly aban-
doned?

a) And was thereby the contractual relationship terminated?
b) If so: at what moment in time?

c) And what would be the effect of such a determination on the dies a quo regarding
the running of any statute of limitations?

244 Issue 5: If the answers to the two above questions is yes: what are the conse-
quences?

a) Does this trigger a fiability in principle vis-a-vis Claimant? Of which Parties?
b) Is liability excluded due to Section 8.4 of the Founders’ Agreement?'?

c) If not: liability for disbursements only, or disbursements and loss of expected prof-
its?

The Founders’ Agreement (CX-6) in Section 8.4, contains an explicit provision dealing with
the situation that the project may not proceed as intended, and the Founders have agreed
that each of thern shall absorb any resulting damagas themselves “and shail not transfer
responsibility for them to other Founders",

Issue 6: If no: consequences? Would Claimant still have a valid claim in principle for

and would not be cut by Section 8.4:

Should Strategic Partners, or PSP, or Claimant have voiced claims carlier? And why
was this not done?

Are any and all claims time-barred?
If not: against which Parties can claims be directed?

What is the scope of Claimant's claim? Recovery of pre-development expenditures?
Other cost or damage items? Lucrum cessans?

Issue 8: Were Respondents committed to exclusively deal with Strategic Part-
ners/PSP, and was there a commitment - c.g. still valid in 2007 - that the Alternative
Terminal must be realized wilh them, and not with any third party?

Would exclusivity, as it was required by Claimant, violate Russian antitrust
laws/procurement laws? In 1994/95/96? In 2007?

Should Strategic Partners/PSP have been spccifically invited to take part in the ten-
dering process?

Should Strategic Partners/PSP or Claimant sua sponte have participated in the ten-
dering process?

Could Claimant thereby, or through other precautions, have mitigated his losses?

Further, the 24" Order indicated that, in the case liability would have to be
affirmed by this Tribunal, the Tribunal would open the quantum phase in
which

. Claimant would be given the possibility to (in detail) quantify his mone-
tary claims, and

. would have to furnish evidence regarding the pre-development costs
and other costs or damages for which he seeks a reimbursement;

. moreover, currency issues and matters of interest would have to be
addressed (dies a quo and ad quem, applicable interest rates, simple
interest, compound interest and, if compounded, on what basis),

The Order, finally, addressed the further procedure up to a liability Hearing,
and invited comments from counsel on the further procedure as proposed by
the Tribunal,

In a joint Submission dated 4 March 2011, counsel to both sides basically
agreed to the Tribunal's proposals regarding the further proceedings, with a
primary focus on liability issues to be cleared first, thereafter - if necessary -
followed by a quantum phase.

On 18 March 2014, the Tribunal issued its 25"" Order essentially dealing with
Claimant's CM-63/64 in which the Claimant voiced concerns regarding the
enforceability of this Tribunal’s Final Award in case one of the Respondent
Parties would raise an objection in the sense that it had not been properly
notified of the present arbitral proceedings, or that it had not validly been
represented,

On 28 March 2013, the Tribunal issued its 26 Order indicating the dates and
venue and practical matters for the liability Hearings scheduled to take place
on 18-21 October 2011 in Stockholm.

On 22 April 2011, Claimant filed its Memorials CM-65, CM-66 (hereinafter
sometimes referred to as the “C- Liability Brief"), CM-67 and CM-68, fol-
lowed by CM-69 on 27 April 2011, including Mr Sax’ witness statement CWS-
6 and four expert opinions. In CM-69, Claimant requested assistance from
the Tribunal by issuing an Order that Respondent 1 provide the official ad-
dress of Respondent 4.

On 2 July 2011, Respondents 1 and 2 filed their written Submission on Liabil-
ity (“R-Liability Brief”), including Mr Karpov’s witness statement and four
expert opinions

On 21 July 2011, the Tribunal issued its 27 Order, providing proposals and
directions for the Liability Hearing in Stockholm, and proposing a further tel-
ephone conference, after having received the joint proposals of the Parties
regarding the schedule/structuring of the Liability Hearings.

The Order also addressed the financial status of the advances and interim
payments, and included an estimated budget for the further work likely to be
necessary for the further steps in this arbitration, followed by a request for
further deposits payable by each side,

Qn 5 August 2011, Claimant filed CM-70, requesting leave to address a
comment in Andrew Fletcher’s opinion according which, under English law,
the Purchase Agreement {CX-66) does not transfer to Claimant any rights to
profits from the Investment Project,

Qn 9 August 2011, issued its 28 Order, noting the availabilities of the wit-
nesses and the experts at the upcoming Liability Hearing, noting the likely
prevention of Professor Sukhanov, yet requesting further particulars as to the
reasons for his alleged unavailability prior to making a decision whether or
not his expert opinion should be disregarded. The Tribunal also granted a 30
day time-limit for Claimant to address the conclusion in Andrew Fletcher's
opinion, In the same Order, the Tribunal denied Claimant's request contained
in CM-69, and dealt with CM-71 which was filed on the same day.

On 16 August 2011, Claimant filed CM-72, applying for an extension of time
until 16 September 2011 to address the opinion of Andrew Fletcher QC; fur-
thermore, in CM-73, Claimant requested to disallow Professor E.A. Shuka-
nov's Opinion (RWS-5).

On 19 August 2011, the Tribunal issued its 29'° Order, granting the time ex-
tension requested by Claimant, and on the other hand indicating that Profes-
sor Shukanov's Opinion, filed by Respondents, would have to be disregarded,
if he would not be available for oral examination at the October-Hearings,
since the allaged importance and eminence of Professor Sukhanov cannot be
accepted as a “valid reason” for exceptionally accepting his expert opinion on
the record.

On 25 August 2011, Claimant's counsel filed CM-74, requesting the produc-
tion of Respondents' counsel's instruction letter to Andrew Fletcher QC, as re-
ferred to in the latter's expert opinion RWS-4.

On 24 August 2011, Claimant filed CM-75, with a renewed motion that the
Tribunal requests Respondents 1 and 2 “to confirm DLA Piper's continued au-
thority to act on their behaif". - The Tribunal reverted to the request in its
31% Order, paras. 26 and 27.

On 26 August 2011, the Tribunal issued its 30th Order.

Qn 30 August 2011, Claimant’s counsel transmitted the email correspon-
dence between counsel regarding the Hearing Schedule for the Stockholm
Hearings In respect of matters on which they could not agree.

In reaction thereto, the Chairman circulated an email reflecting his own pro-
posal for the structuring of the Hearing.

In the afternoon of the same day, the telephone conference took place, deal-
ing with Respondents’ application for extending the time-limit regarding the
additional advance, and thereafter dealing with the Parties’ desiderata re-
garding the Hearings in Stockholm and further practical aspects. Essentially,
both sides agreed to the Hearing Schedule as it had been proposed by the
Chairman. Respondents’ counsel Josh Wong inquired whether the Tribunal
will once again submit a list of issues to be addressed during the Stockholm
Hearings.

The essentials of the discussion are reflected in the Tribunal’s 31" Order of
31 August 2011, transmitted to the Parties on 2 September 2011. The Order
also dealt with Claimant's CM-74 and CM-75. At the same time, the Tribunal
condensed its preparatory work by reflecting on, and putting together, a
short-list of key-issues, including a series of more particular questions.

On 2 September 2011, the Tribunal ~ having condensed the numerous ques-
tions In a Questionnaire with 53 questions, grouped under 8 Kay-Issues
— communicated its 32% Order, accompanied by a caveat that the Question-

naire did not claim to be complete, and that more and other factual elements
and legal issues might have to be addressed during the Hearings. The Ques-
tionnaire is reproduced herein below; it will also serve as the topical list of
matters which this Tribunal - for the purpose of reaching its decisions - had
to consider.

Issue 1: Proper Performance by Claimant and the EBRD Offer

1 Regarding the EBRD offer: is there a significant discrepancy between basic
terms of the Founders’ Agreement ("FA"), and the EBRD offer?

2 What about, for instance,
(i) the increased amount of the loan,
{ii) the interest terms,

(li) the removal of majority for the Russian Parties of 63.4% to a majority
of the Foreign Parties/EBRD, by the required transfers of 21.5%

(iv) pledging of the shares in favour of EBRD,
{v) transfer of management functions to Aeraports de Paris?

3 Hence: Have the Foreign Parties properly fulfilled their “primary oblige
tion”, by providing the EBRD offer as it was made?

4 Were the Russian Parties bound to accept whatever financing offer would
be presented? Or were they free to reject it, or lot it lapse time-wise?

Issue 2: What if the EBRD-Offer, For Good Reasons, Had to be Consi-
dered Unacceptable for the Russian Parties?

5S Were the Russian Parties still bound to the FA, even though the Forcign
Parties could not - according to the Russian Parties’ arguments - present
an acceptable financing commitment?

6 In this context; can the Russian Parties invoke the exceptio non (rite)
adimpleti contractus? Is this defence, in Russian baw, also available in the

ambit of corporate law (as opposed ta the “traditional” ambit of this Roman
Jaw maxim in contract law)?

7 If indeed the Russian Parties were well-founded not to take the EBRD-offer
further; Could the Foreign Parties continue to claim to be part of the In-
vestment Project, and derive benefits there under (for instance based on
the 29.7% equity share and profit share}, even though, possibly and even-
tually, the Russian Parties would have had to find financing through entire-
ly different sources, without the Foreign Parties’ or Mr Sax assistance, or
ultimately through the City’s ar the State budget?

In other words: Was the FA still binding on them, ar could they repudiate
the Investment Contract altogether?

8 If the Investment Contract remained to be binding: to what extent did the
FA contain further binding provisions?

9 If not: Did Respondents’ have the right to repudiate the Investment Con-
tract, or to tacitly terminate it, respectively to terminate it trough inactivity
of the Parties?

= — And did they do so?

10 At what moment in time should Claimant have realized the disinterest of
the Russian Parties, or a unilateral refusal to further support the project?

re

Claimant, after 1999, tried to keep the project on track, or ta revitalize is,
but no fresh momentum could be faund; was the FA terminated already in
the first half of 1999, as discussed by Professor Belov?

12 What is the effect of Mr Karpov's letter of 16 April 2003 (CX-69)?

Issue 3; Claim for Reimb t of Pi

13° SPH and/or Claimant went to very considerable expense for the planning of
the NIPT, lined up consultants, prepared numerous documents, for which
Claimant now seeks reimbursement - and Mr Rowson stated in para 26

that he was advised that the expenditures “are reimbursable under various
agreements prepared by the Parties ...*.

What is the documentary basis for this statement, in Claimant‘s view?

14 In 1995 and beyond; was it discussed among the shareholders that such
expenditures would be Incurred for and_ on behalf_of IAT Pulkovo {or its
shareholders), and not. only on bohalf of the Foreign Parties or Mr Sax per-
sonally?

15 And if this was discussed: Was there ever an agrecment - at the time
when entering into the Founders’ Agreement ("FA"), or any time thereafter
- that these costs are reimbursable to the Foreign Parties/Claimant, either
through IAT Pulkovo or otherwise through the other Founders?

16 How do we have to understand that the Foreign Parties agreed to FA 6.3,
on the face of that provision waiving costs before entering into the FA,
when on the other hand - as per Mr Rowson’s report - already prior to
December 1994 very significant casts exceeding USS 3,3 million seem to
have been incurred which, despite the terms of FA 6.3, are now claimed as
part of Claimant's pre-development advance claim?

N

Following up from Q 14 above: In the framework of negotiations leading
the conclusion of the FA, did the Foreign Parties and/or Claimant indicate
the fact (and magnitude) of the expenditures already incurred and likely or
expected te be incurred in the time to come, particularly in connection with
the securing of a financing commitment?

18 More particularly, after the conclusion of the FA, and during the further
“life” under the FA and as shareholders in IAT Pulkovo:

Was the nature and magnitude of further spending during 1995 to 1998
ever discussed with the Russian Parties and the Board of IAT Pulkovo, and
was it approved?

19 For instance, were all Parties to the FA and shareholders of IAT Pulkovo,
and IAT Pulkovo itself as the corporate entity, made aware of the charging
(or ultimately intended charging) by the Foreign Parties/Claimant) for the
following costs and expenditures incurred by the Foreign Parties:

(i) the charging of several millions for cansultants,

(iii) the charging of approx. US$ 2 million for salaries to employees of

(iv) the charging of the salary for Mr Carl A Sax of aver USS 1 million,
(v) the charging for Claimant's and STV's office overheads,
{vi) the charging of US$ 1 million for design and engineering, and

(vii) the charging of over US$ 4 million for "transfer agreements", for
transferring interests of individual shareholders to Strategic Part-
ners.

If not: why was this not disclosed, discussed upfront, with the vicw to-
wards seeking an agreement how to deal with such casts?

In the framework of the liability decisian to be made by the Tribunal; how
should the Tribunal decide liability and recoverability in principle for any
one/each one of the items as per Q 19 (i) to (vii) now claimed in this arbi-
tration?

When incurring those pre-development expenses: Could the Foreign Par-
ties ar Sax act on behalf of IAT Pulkave, and bind IAT Pulkovo thereby, as
Claimant asserts?

Did Mr Sax have @ proper corporate authority to act for IAT Pulkovo, or @
mandate ?

Or could Mr Sax only act on behalf of the Foreign Parties respectively him-
self, absent the required unanimous decision under FA Chapter 12.7, as
this was argued by Respondents?

In this context; Was Mr Sax ever correctly appointed as Vice President of
IAT Pulkovo, and registered as such, as he claims, and as this had been fo-
resecn in FA 13.3?

25 How did the Foreign Parties and/or Mr Sax commercially assess their con-

easy exit clause according to FA 8.4?

26 Is FA 8.4 applicable in our context, as Respondents’ maintain, or inapplica-
ble, as Claimant maintains?

27 If there had been no agreement that these pre-devclopment costs should
ultimately be borne by IAT Pulkovo or Respondents, on what basis could
those costs find their way into the EBRD financing offer, as part of the

loan?

And on what basis could the Foreign Parties expect that this will be accept-
able to the Russian Parties?

Has this been discussed, agreed?

34 How can we understand Claimant's rationale far not submitting the pre-
development expense claim forthwith or rather promptly, as expenditures
were being incurred, or in any event immediately when the EBRD offer
lapsed in 1998, if there had been an agreement that they are reimbursa-
ble?

35 Would it be unreasonable to think that Claimant, a very well experienced
lawyer, must have been aware of the statute of limitation, and a 3 year
statute arguably must have been familiar to him, since this is the statute
of limitation according to many if not most US State law legislations.

36 Regarding Claimants monetary claims: when did a violation of rights occur,
falling under Article 200.1 Russian CC?

37 Respectively, when could or should Claimant have presented his claims for
pre-devclopment expenses, under Article 200.2 Russian CC?

38 Are some or all of Claimant's monetary claims for pre-development cx-
penses time-barred?

39 If not: on what basis does Claimant have a valid claim in principle (subject
to the analysis of the quantum in a final stage of this arbitration)?

40 And how to deal with interest (which may be more significant than the
capital amount), interest rate, simple, compound (and compounding ba-
sis)?

Issue 7: Claim for Re-instatement as an Investor

41 Does Claimant have standing on the basis of CX-66, for claiming that he
should have becn selected as the developer for the AT in 20077

42 What was transferred/assigned to Claimant under CX-66, having regard to
(the probably universal, but 2'000 year old Roman notion of) "nemo plus
juris transferre potest quam ipse habet"?

43 The issue might not really be answered by English law (governing CX-66},
but by Russian law, since the transferfassignment would have to deploy
certain effects for IAT Pulkovo. Views/comments?

On the same issue: what could be transferred as a stock interest, having
regard to the strict Transfer restrictions as per the Charter and the FA?

Rethinking the Tribunal's earlier preliminary decision as per the 24" Or-
der: Can Mr Sax stand “into the shoes" of the initial Party?

Or was the Tribunal's intwitu personae reflection correct, in the sense
that the participation in the project as an investor and developer is not “in-
ter-changcable” or transferable from SPH/PSP to an individual (Mr Sax),
even though at the time Mid-1990s Mr Sax might have been the driving
force behind SPH/PSP?

Regarding Mr Sax' claim that, in 2007, he should have been elected as the
developer/investor for the Alternative Terminal;

. Is it of significance that - during the 1990s, SPH and Mr Sax were
apparently significantly engaged in numcrous airport developments,
and were active around the globe (as can be seen from Mr Sax first
witness statement, CWS-1, identifying numerous airport develop-
ment projects in which Strategic Partners were involved, such as in
Moscow/Scremetjevo, Vietnam, Gibraltar, Senegal, the Philippines,
Guatemala,, Congo, Ecuador, Indonesia, Honduras, Pakistan, Arme-
nia, Jamaica and Uruguay - none of which however materialized,
see Transcript of 16 December 201.1, p. 93),

. whereas there seems ta be no further record of Mr Sax involvement
since 1998 to date (but for Mr Sax to correct if this is wrong).

Why did Mr Sax not participate in the tender process for the Alternative
Terminal?

How could Mr Sax have fulfilled the (very heavy) pre-qualification criteria?
Was Mr Sax aware that procurement laws in Russia changed?

Was he entitled to expect that laws in Russia would not be changed, and
would remain stabilized on the basis as they were in 1995?

And would a claim for exclusivity, as requested by Claimant, be contrary to
Russian antitrust law?

Issue 8; Cost Decision
Introduction:

The Tribunal may be minded to make a cost decision within its determination
on liability, irrespective of whether or not the case will proceed to a final Quan-
tum Stage,

For that purpose, the Tribunal is likely to request the Partics to file their cost
submissions within about 2 weeks after the Stockholm Hearings, respectively
within 2 weeks after the exchange of any post-hearing briefs (if any; for discus-
sion).

The format and level of detail of the cost submissions must be discussed basi-
cally at the Hearing, as we want to avoid to receive a one-sheet summary of
costs from one side, and a full leaver-arch file of detailed invaices etc from the
other side.

In this context, however, some issues arise which may also be discussed at the
Hearing:

50 Is Charter Section 20,10 applicable, as Claimant asserts, or inapplicable,
as Respondents assert?

51 Does it derogate the Tribunal's authority and level of appreciation under
the UNCITRAL Rules?

52. If Section 20.10 is applicable: how to understand better the provision on
costs in Charter Section 20.10, referring to an arbitration “in accordance
with this Chapter 19"?

53 What would be the yardstick for measuring bad faith or gross negligence or
willful misconduct, in connection with a claim for costs?”

On 17 September 2011, Claimant's counsel filed CM-76, a brief responding to
issues arising out of the expert witness statement of Andrew Fletcher QC,
supported by CX- 256 and an expert opinion on English Law prepared by
Romie Tager QC (CWS-10), dated 14 September 2011, and a supplemental
witness statement of Mr Carl A Sax (CWS-11), dated 16 September 2011.

On 20 September 2011, Respondents filed 1-RM-33/2-RM-39, requesting the
Tribunal to disregard the Claimant's CM-76 and the supplemental witness
statement of Mr Sax as having been filed without first having obtained leave
from the Tribunal.

On 18 September 2011, Claimant filed CM-77, a renewed motion for a juris-
dictional ruling as te Respondents 3, 4 and 5, referring to the Tribunal’s Or-
ders No, 25 paras, 36-39 and No. 28 para. 9, to which no suit was given by
Resp Claimant the Tribunal to rule that Respond had
“full opportunity to present their case to the Arbitral Tribunal”.

On 22 September 2011, by CM-78, Claimant commented on Respondents
request to exclude CM-76 and CWS-11, maintaining that Claimant's res-
ponses were proper and did not constitute a bad faith conduct and that, on
the contrary, the Fletcher Opinion should be excluded frorn the files in its en-
tirety.

On 28 September 2011, the Chairman sent out an email explaining his views
regarding the admissibility of CM-76 and CWS-11, concluding that — although
these filings had not had the prior authorization of the Tribunal - they should
nevertheless not be struck from the files, and that they might be discussed
at the Hearings, to the extent necessary, The same should apply to the legal
opinion filed by Andrew Fletcher QC.

In the Chairman's view, as explained in the email, it would be procedurally
unwise to discard these filings (while the Tribunal's earlier decision not to
consider the legal expert report prepared by Professor E.A. Sukhanov filed by
Respondents if Professor Sukhanov without good cause did not present him-
self at the Hearings for cross-examination — when cross-examination of him
had been requested by Claimant's counsel - was a "clear-cut" and rather ob-
vious decision, mandated by deeply rooted notions of due process; the two
situations, therefore, could not be seen as being of a similar nature and pro-
cedural impact/relevance).

On 29 September 2011, Respondents' counsel requested leave from the Tri-
bunal to submit short written comments in response to CM-76, CWS-10 and
CWS-11 in advance of the Hearings.

On the same day, Claimant's counsel agreed to Mr Kropotov's request, pro-
posing however that, prior to the Hearings, any written submission be filed
no later than by 13 October 2011.

On 30 September 2011, the Tribunal confirmed its agreement to the fore-
going by email.

On 5 October 2011, Respondents filed 1-RM-34/2-RM-40, with brief com-
ments regarding Claimant Mr Sax’s witness statement (C-WS-11), and ques-
tioning its credibility.

On 6 October 2011, Claimant filed CM-79, addressing matters of Mr Sax’ tes-
timony.

On 10 October 2011, Claimant filed CM-80, suggesting an expert conferenc-
ing with the two English law experts, and opposing Respondents’ intention to
file a further opinion addressing Mr Tager's opinion.

On 10 October 2011, the Tribunal issued its 33™ Order, addressing the mat-
ters raised in CM-80, suggesting the preparation of a joint report of the ex-
perts on points of agreement and disagreement or, alternatively, the filing of
a short rebuttal opinion by Andrew Fletcher QC; the Tribunal also suggested
that the experts might meet in Stockholm just prior to their joint examina-

tion.

On 12 October 2011, Respondents filed 1-RM-35/2-RM-41 regarding “without
prejudice” meetings of the two English law experts Andrew Fletcher QC and
Romie Tager QC.

On 13 October 2011, Claimant filed a Pre-Hearing Brief elaborating on further
aspects of the Investment Contract, the alleged illegal expropriation, and
commenting on Respondents arguments, CM-84.

pended hereto as Appendices 1 and 2. The entire rest of the day was
devoted to direct examination and cross-examination of Mr Carl A Sax.
The examination of Mr Karpov as well as the examination of Claimant’s
economic experts Peter Forbes and Jan Rowson {initially planned to be
heard on the first day), had to be postponed,

° Second Day, Wednesday 19 Oct 2011: Peter Forbes and Ian Row-

. Fourth Day, Friday 21 October 2011: Opening address by Maria
Smirnova, delegate of Respondent 2, follawed by continuation of the
examination of Mr Karpov. Further statements and examination of Mr
Sax; in addition, Mr Sax extensively discussed the Minutes referred to
by Mr Karpov (RX-55); by agreement, and due to lack of further time,
counsel preferred not to deliver oral closing arguments; closing of the
Hearings in the afternoon of 21 October 2012.

On the last day, 21 October 2011, the Parties and their counsel, with words
of thanks, affirmed the correctness of the proceedings, and voiced no criti-
cism regarding due process, fairness of the procedure, thair right to be heard
and equal treatment. The staternents were recorded as follows:

The Chairman: The Chairman; Now, for the record, a very important and se-
rious question, You know this Tribunal has a prime duty; the prime duty is to
treat the parties equally, with equality, and to give each party a sufficient
time and opportunity to be heard, These are the twa prime duties of this Ar-
bitral Tribunal. I now would like to ask, Claimant first and then Respondents,
whether at least on the two prime duties there are any complaints to the pro-
ceedings we had or complaints regarding this Arbitral Tribunal. Can I ask
you, any complaint, Andrew?

Mr Durkovic: No complaint at all, and we express our appreciation to all three
arbitrators for their fine work and for their patience and for listening to things
that perhaps they already understand and putting up with the repetition
sometimes and the length of things. Very, very well done. It Is actually quite
an honor to be here with such distinguished arbitrators on the panel. Also our
appreciation to the other sido. It has been very cordial, thank you; it has
been a pleasure working on the other side of the case.

The Chairman: Thank you so much.

Mr Kropotov; No complaints. Thank you to the Tribunal, and we can support
what Andrew said in that respect and in respect of the Tribunal.

Moreover, on the last day, the further procedure and time-table was dis-
cussed, in particular the size of Post-Hearing Briefs and the level of detail for
the cost submissions, coupled with the suggestion that counsel may wish to
come up with a joint proposal. The following steps were thereupon agreed:

. within 14 days: joint proposals of counsel regarding (i) the size of con-
temporaneous Post-Hearing Briefs and (ii) the format/level of detail of
the subsequent contemporaneous cost submissions;

. by Friday 20 January 2012, filing of contemporaneous Post-Hearing
Briefs;

. by Monday 20 February 2012, filing of contemporaneous cost submis-

sions.
The Tribunal indicated its intention to notify its Award within March 2012.

On 10 November 2011, Susan Mcintyre delivered the verbatim transcripts to
the Members of the Arbitral Tribunal and the Counsel who attended the
Stockholm Hearings; in total 904 pages plus 107 pages of indices.

On the same day, the Chairman forwarded the transcripts to all other reci-
pients of the Tribunal’s communications, in particular to Respondents 4 and
5.

On 16 November 2011, the Tribunal issued its 34" Order, reflecting the se-
quence of examinations at the Stockholm Hearings. Furthermore, the 34"
Order confirmed the further procedural milestones as they had been agreed
in Stockholm, i.e. 20 January 2012 for the simultaneous filing of Post Hearing
Memorials and 20 February 2012 for the simultaneous filing of Cost Submis-
sions, whereupon the present arbitral proceedings, as far as relating to lia-

bility, will be considered closed, with no further filings being admitted into
the record except upon specific leave by the Tribunal.

In connection with these two further filings due 20 January 2012 and 20 Feb-
ruary 2012, the Tribunal invited counsel to communicate internally in respect
of (i} the length of the Post Hearing Memorials and (ii) the format and level
of detail and further issues (compensability of Party costs, interest, currency,
payment terms) for the preparation of the Cost Subrnissions.

The 34" Order also informed the Parties of a further draw-down from the
deposit in the total amount of EUR 202'860.--, covering interim fees of the
Arbitrators on time-spent basis, travel disbursements, Conference Center
charges and charges of the verbatim reporter.

On 12 December 2011, Respondents’ counsel transferred the further advance
of EUR 100’000.-- to the Tribunal’s separate account.

On 20 January 2012, Claimant filed the Post-Hearing Brief CM-85, together
with an updated index of Claimant’s Subrnissions CM-1 to CM-85, and an up-
dated index of Claimant's exhibits CX-1 to CX-262. Claimant's PH-Brief es-
sentially focuses on the validity of the Investment Contract, its breach by
Respondents under the standards of Russian and international law amounting
to an unlawful expropriation and, consequently, the liability for the full quan-
tum of damages, including interest and sanctions,

On the same day, also Respondents 1 and 2 filed their Post-Hearing Brief 1-
RM-37/2-RM-43.

On 30 January 2012, Claimant filed CM-86 which discussed a number of is-
sues which counsel to both sides had not been able to solve in respect of the
format and contents of their cost submissions due to be filed in February
2012.

Qn 31 January 2012, the Tribunal issued its 35 Order, suggesting to organ-
ize a telephone conference on either 6, 7 or 8 February 2012. After review of

counsel's availability, the telephone conference was fixed to take place on
Tuesday 7 February 2012, at 1530 Ziirich time,

On 7 February 2012, a telephone conference took place attended by Clai-
mant's counsel Andrew Durkovic (partly), Vladimir Gladyshev and Respon-
dents' counsel Leonid Kropotov and the members of the Tribunal for discuss-
ing the different views reflected in CM-86 in respect of cost-related issues.

Inter alia, the Tribunal discussed the time for payment and any post-award
interest which might be due and payable in respect of the Tribunal’s cost de-
cisions. Regarding payment terms, Mr Leonid Kropotov on behalf of Respon-
dents urged that any payment should only become due after 1 January 2013,
because — as he explained — there is no allowance in the City's budget for the
current year; Mr Durkovic on behalf of Claimant disagreed and stressed that
a payment for reimbursement of Party costs will be due as of the day of noti-
fication of the Arbitral Award.

On this query, the Tribunal indicated that it could be minded to grant a grace
period of 30 days for a party to reimburse arbitration costs to the other par-
ty, but that - certainly — the Tribunal could not endorse Mr Kropotov's pro-
posal. Applying a 30-day grace period would mean that default interest on
the outstanding payment would only start to run as from the 31% day on-
wards on a simple (not compounded) interest basis, 1t may be noted that
Claimant‘s counsel, in CM-87 para. 7, agreed to the application of such a
grace period.

As for the interest rate, there was discussion whether it should be deter-
mined by tooking at the /ex causae, or whether some other basis would be
more appropriate.

On 20 February 2012, Respondents filed the Cast Submissions 1-RM-38/2-
RM-44.

On the same day, also Claimant filed the cost submission, CM-87, together
with a spread-sheet and the updated Indices of CMs and Cxs. As far as the
interest rate is concerned, Claimant’s counsel requests that any sum

awarded to Claimant but unpaid during the grace period shall bear interest at

Ciaimant’s submission inter alia also contains the Engagement Letter signed
between Amsterdam & Peroff and Claimant Mr Sax, providing for stage pay-
ments and a 10% success fee. CX-265 and Exhibits.

The discussion of these cost-filings will follow in the Cost Section at the end
of this Award.

On 2) February 2012, the Tribunal asked Respondents’ counsel for clarifica-
tion of the claim for recovery of counsel fees, which was answered by return
mail of Mr Kropotov.

On_22 February 2012, the Tribunal issued its 36™ Order, granting each side
an opportunity to comment on the other side’s cost submissions by 27 Feb-
ruary 2012, and inviting further comments from Respondents "in case this
Tribunal was to decide an some reimbursement of costs to Respondents”, in
particular

. to also state their views with regard to a grace period of 30 days after
notification of the Award, and

. to make their views known as to the rate of simple or compounded
post-award default interest.

Thereafter, as stated in the Order, the proceedings - as far as they relate to
the liability phase - would be closed.

On 27 February 2012, Respondents replied by 1-RM-39/2-RM-45 regarding
reimbursement to Claimant, proposing "to set the term fer cost-
reimbursement as one year after the communication of the Award; the rea-
son for such a fong term is that St. Petersburg City is a public subject with
rigid and long-lasting planning procedures ...” and further stated that they
would agree to apply the LIBOR rate for 3 months deposits, as a rate which
would not depend on the winning party. Respandents "see no grounds to ap-

ply interest rate for personal loans in the State of Florida and any further "in-

In addition, Respondents commented on Claimants cost statement by re-
marking that only some general indications are given regarding the Swedish
and Russian counsel, but "no words about the services", further remarking
that travel expenditures to Madrid, Valencia, Portofino etc. are included with
no evident relation to this Arbitration, and the same would apply to the fees
and expenses of several experts from whom no expert reports had been re-
ceived.

The Arbitrators deliberated the issues throughout the proceedings and met
again in Stockholm during the week of 5 March 2012 for oral deliberation
sessions,

Locus standi, Jurisdiction and Valid Representation

Arbitrability

The present investment dispute is governed by an undisputedly valid arbitra-
tion agreement reflected in Chapter C above. In these proceedings, neither
Party has ever raised a concern or a plea that a State court rather than the
present Arbitral Tribunal should exercise jurisdiction to hear the claims and
to adjudicate the present dispute, and both, Claimant as well as the Respon-
dents 1 and 2, have actively participated in these proceedings.

The Tribunal reiterates that in the case at hand the Parties relationship is
that of an investment, and is based on a complex mix of numerous legal
norms, none of which prevails, and which must be analyzed in a close link
with others. Thus the position of the investor and stockholder is to be consi-
dered along with, and in context of, the rights and obligations arising under
the Investment Contract as a whole.

The Tribunal, therefore, affirms its subject-matter jurisdiction.

Claimant's focus standi - The Parties’ Arguments

Pursuant to a Purchase Agreement dated 17 December 2002, filed as CX-66,
and pursuant to a Bill of Sale of even date (CX-59), Claimant Mr Sax as buy-
er in his own name acquired from PSP (also represented by Mr Sax) and SP
(also represented by Mr Sax) as sellers, a 29.7% "stock interest” in IAT Pul-
kovo, as well as a US$ 20+ million pre-development expense receivable fram
IAT Pulkovo.

According to Article 14 of the Purchase Agreement, a registration of the
transfer of the stock-interest was envisaged, but never took place.

The Agreement is governed by, and to be interpreted and enforced with, the
laws of England and Wales.

The validity and legal effects of CX-66/CX-59 are disputed by Respondents,
particularly in respect of the effects or meaning of the transfer of the "stock-
interest”. Respondents maintain that no assets other than receivables were
transferred, but not the rights and obligations under the Founders’ Agree-
ment, Therefore, Respondents argue, Claimant neither became a party to the
Founders Agreement, nor did he become entitled to any profits there under.
R-Liab Brief para 54/55, Fletcher Opinion RWS-4 paras 73-82.

Respondents further recall that in any event PSP was not entitled to sell its
shares without prior approval from all other parties, nor could they be sold,
since they had never formally been issued. Claimant, therefore, never be-
came a party to the Investment Project, and thus is "definitely not entitled to
file the 29.7% Interest Claim, Development Fee Claim ... and Claim for Reins-
tatement”, 1-RM-32/2-RM-38 para. 62.

Claimant's expert, Romie Tager QC, disagreed with several conclusions;
CWS-10,

Prior to the Stockholm Hearings, the two English law experts Andrew Fletcher
QC (expert for Respondents) and Romie Tager QC (for Claimant) rendered
highly detailed expert opinions on the meaning to be given to the term
“stockinterest”, which — both experts agreed - is not a recognized term of
art.

Prior to the Hearings, the two experts met on 17 October 2011 and, thereu-
pon, filed a joint opinion on points of their mutual agreement, and points on
which they disagree. They constituted a file containing the Minutes of their
Joint Meeting as well as copies of the leading authorities/court cases on
which they relied.

324 Both experts, Fletcher and Tamie, were examined at the Stockholm Hearing,
first through examinations by counsel, and subsequently through questions
put to them by the Arbitral Tribunal in an expert conferencing mode.

325 Under a strict view, Mr Fletcher explained (and taking guidance from the Lord
Hoffmann interpretation principles as reflected in the leading English-law
case on contract interpretation, i.e. the Chartbrook Case™, Claimant — for
lack of a recognized title — acquired nothing.

326 Mr Tager, while ag g that “Chart is p ly the most imp
case", disagreed.

 

327 In the PH-Brief, Claimant further addressed the issue in some more detail,
inter alia referring to Article 7 of the Russian Foreign Investor Law of 9 July
1999 which deats with an investor's right “in accordance with an agreement”
to “transfer rights and obligations ... to another person in accordance with the
civil fegislation of the Russian Federation” ”*, Hence, Claimant arques, the
Purchase Agreement and Bill of Sale in conjunction with the guarantees re-
flected in Article 5 of Russia's Foreign Investment Law gave Claimant the
right to obtain damages equal to the pre-development advances plus inter-
est, damages connected to the developer fee and an equity participation
equivalent to PSP’s 29.7% interest in IAT Pulkovo.**

328 Respondents, in thelr PH-Brief, again denied the validity of the assignment.

TIE Claimant's focus standi - The Tribunal’s Determination

329 =‘ The Tribunal was not convinced by the rather legalistic approach of the Eng-

lish law experts and the real significance of the chosen English law and, in
conducting the expert conferencing, indicated - on a preliminary basis - that
the Tribunal would

. rather be minded to look at the quite apparent intentions evidenced by
the wording of CX-66, in the sense that, short of being able to transfer
the shares as such’’, the parties quite obviously intended to provide
that Claimant Mr Sax can, to the greatest extent legally/contractually
possible, “stand into the shoes of SPS/SP” (term as used by the Tri-
bunal in the examination)”, and further:

. that - with such basic understanding of the intention evidenced by the
text — the decisive question would only be to explore to what extent
such agreement (made under English law) would deploy valid effects in
Russia, i.e. vis-a-vis IAT Pulkovo and its other stockholders,

The stock certificates had not been issued; moreover, for an effective transfer, transfer
restrictions as per the Charter and the founders’ Agreement in the sense of pre-emptive
rights would have had to be complied with prior to any such sale or transfer.

Literally: "The Chairman: Look, ] make it simple - maybe incredibly simple. It's a complex
agreement, many pages, but the intention {s clear to me. Mr Sax wanted to stand into the
shoes of Strategic Partners. It's as simple as that. Strategic Partners shoutd, if possible, go
out of the way and he is there. That's it. There's nothing missing. Maybe you can add ten
pages, you can reduce it to two lines, it is all the same. I read this as the intention, and
the intention is not contested by Mr Sax wearing the Strategic Partners’ hat nor Mr Sax
wearing any other hat. So who is going to contest in between the three parties all
represented by Mr Sax?" Transcript 200ct11 page 521.

Compare also Transcript 200ct/.1 page 511, 540. On page 556: Chairman: “Of course it is
not the transfer of shares, but it is probably the transfer of everything else that, except for
the shares, could be transferred.”

. which question makes It abundantly clear that the latter issues will - to
the largest extent - be governed by Russian law, and not by English
law,7*

It is clear that the position as a stockholder may comprise a whole bundle of

rights, such as e.g. contractual rights and, foremost, corporate rights (and

obligations), including for instance:

. the right to be compensated for expenditures properly incurred for and
on behalf of the company (if any),

. the right to cash receivables sold to the stockholder,

. the right as a stockholder to exercise voting rights,

« the right to receive corporate information,

. the right to take part in stockholders meetings,

. the right to be paid dividends if and when declared, and

. ultimately the right to receive the liquidation proceeds or the liquida-
tion surplus (if any) upon winding up of the company.

Since the stockholding as such could not be transferred, failing compliance
with the statutory procedure for validly transferring the stock in accordance
with the Charter and the Founders’ Agreement, it is however clear that mere-
ly contractual claims of SPC/SP (referred to as the “rece/vables”} could be
transferred (and indeed, for the purpose of this arbitration, the transfer of
contractual claims is particularly relevant), but not, for instance, the exercis-
ing of voting rights.

 

Compare the Tribunal’s remarks at the Hearing, for instance the Chairman, Transcript

page 513: "... the test of this agreement is whether and to what extent it is effective in
Russia under Russian /aw, ie. where the agreement should produce some effects.”

332 Hence, the validity of the assignment in respect of the pre-development ex-

pense claim (explicitly mentioned In CX-66), cannot reasonably be doubted,”*
Likewise, it cannot be doubted that the arbitration clause is transferred to-
gether with any such claims, as an ancillary right attaching to such claim
“like a shadow".”

333 On the other hand, a stockholder may also have assumed particular obliga-

tions vis-a-vis the company, such as financing obligations, or may have ac-
quired a particular position such as ~ as will have to be further discussed in
the framework of this Award — the position (claimed by Mr Sax) to be chosen
as a developer of a project and to assume the function of an investor.

334 It is in this respect that concerns arose: It is quite obvious that the transfer

of the position to be chosen as a developer and investor of the Project is
more problematic, Although it remained unclear in this arbitration what ex-
actly such position would comprise, it nevertheless appears obvious that, for
instance, the position as a developer would not only consist of the right to
claim a 4.5% fee, but most likely would also involve some kind of obliga-
tions, i.e. obligations to function as a developer/coordinator, and no further
explanations are necessary to state that the position of a developer and in-
vestor in such a project does not simply consist of earning revenue; profits
first of all will have to be earned, and this may involve a plethora of tasks
over years or even decades,”
Mr Fletcher mentioned that under English law the fact that Mr Sax signed in three different
capacities could make the agreement null and void, because 8 conflict of interests cannot
be excluded. Mr Tager - correctiy so — disagreed by stating that the acting in a double or
triple capacity dees not entail nullity, but may only make the cantract voidable. - The
latter, in the Tribunal's view, is definitely the correct view; and the fact is that na one In-
voked the nullity of CX-66/CX-59.

335 The obvious problem then is that - according to a quite universal legal no-

tion, including English law** and Russian law {see Article 391 Russian CC) -
obligations (as opposed to simple monetary claims) can only be transferred
or “assigned” to another person with the consent of the creditor (the creditor
in the Instant case being IAT Pulkovo and/or arguably Respondents).

336 Regarding the claimed 4.5% developer fee (if indeed It had been agreed -

which is an issue addressed below), it is clear that such fee had not already
been “earned”, but yet would have had to be earned on the basis of - prob-

 

ger Terminal, in 2007 and beyond he should be recognized as the developer, then there is
a bigger question mark whether that is transferable because that would probably not only
mean that Cari Sax can cash the 4,5 percent and run away, but probably he would have to
do something for that.

And if you have to do something, then probably you cannot simply assign or transfer such
@ task without the agreement of the creditor. So here we probably have an area we might
need to discuss.”

Yesterday we touched on some other aspects of a shareholder's position. Of course a
shareholder has also voting rights. Whether these coutd be transferred internally, an inter-
esting question; probably not as tong as you are nat really recognized as the shareholder,
The shareholder on record has to exercise the voting rights, but probably he can be in-
spired by the transferee who will tet! him in what manner to vote, etc, The same for cash-
ing dividends, but these to aspects are irrelevant for our case.

So we have only two relevant scenarios, in my view, that is to understand to what extent
receivables, claims already existing, could validly be transferred from SPS {Strategic Part-
ners) to Mr Carl Sax personally. In that respect I basically see no problem. These are
claims and the claims may originate from the Founders’ Agreement. The Founders’ Agree-
ment has an arbitration clause and it is quite common knowledge and accepted that if you
have a claim which is subject to an arbitration clause, the arbitration clause travels with it,
So I think it is even undisputed by Respondents that aif the claims which are now in the
hands of Mr Carl Sax are validly subject to the arbitration clause.”

Andrew Fletcher QC to the Chairman, Transcript page 519 line 14: "So far as assignment
is concerned, I accept what you say, in general the benefit is assignable but not the bur-
den of a contract. Engtish law does draw a distinction between those contracts where the
identity of the y Ig paity is sit and prohibits of contracts of that
kind without the consent of the other party.

The Chairman: English law is in good company." Transcript 200ct11 page 519.

ably some - activity at least as a developer. Given that it is clear that only a
contractual benefit, but not a contractual burden, can be transferred without
the consent of the creditors, little further explanation is needed to state that
- for lack of consent - the position as a developer as such ( could not validly
be transferred from PSP to Claimant. And basically the same applies to the
position as a 29.7% investor/shareholder.

337 Claimant's references, in this respect, to the Russian Investor Law are un-
convincing. The referenced Article 7 specifically refers to a foreign investor's
right “in accordance with an agreement to transfer its rights and obligations
...” (emphasis added); yet, in the present case, the trouble is that there is
precisely no such agreement pursuant to which the Respondents had con-
sented to the transfer of rights and obligations from PSP to Mr Carl A Sax
personally.

338 As regards Russian law, the Tribunal further notes that even assignment of a
monetary claim may be restricted where such a claim is closely connected
with specifics of the creditor (Article 383 Russian CC). In the latter case, the
assignment of the claim is permissible only subject to the debtor's consent
(Article 388 (2) Russian CC),?°

339 In addition, the Tribunal takes into consideration the requirements of Article
1216.2 Russian CC [The Law applicable to an Assignment of a Claim) under
which

For instance, as it was clarified by the Supreme Commercial Court of the RF under the
joint venture contract (Chapter 55 Russian CC) a partner’s persona by nature of such an
arrangement may have a material significance for the other partner(s), and therefore as-
signment of the claim deriving from such a contract requires the other partner's consent
(compare the Information Letter of Presidium of the Supremo Commercial Court of the RF
as of July 25, 2000, No 56, s. 4). Another, but not last and least example may be found in
r 0 gq setting up ‘i of a certain type (Act (opredelc-
niye) of the Supreme Commercial Court of April 24, 2008, No 10963/07). Furthermore,
compare hereto the approach specifically supported in Article 9.1.7 (2) of the 2004 UNI-
DROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts 2004, It provides that "the con-
sent of the obligor is not required unless the obtigation in the circumstances is of an es-
sentially personal character”.

“the permissibility of the assignment of a claim, the relations between the
new creditor and the debtor, the conditions under which this claim may be
made to the debtor by the new creditor, and also the question of proper per-
formance of the obligation by the debtor, shall be determined according to
the law that is applicable to the claim that is the subject of the assignment.”

Since, in the case at hand, the claims are subjected to Russian law and inter-
national law, one may come to the conclusion that restrictions of Article
388.2 Russian CC should be taken into consideration when analyzing the va-
lidity and effects of the assignment of the claims to Mr Sax. On the other
hand, it is the Tribunal’s view that the application of the statutory provisions,
including that of Article 388.2 Russian CC, shall not be made in the abstract,
but must connected to the circumstances of a concrete case, The Tribunal
considers that in an investment relationship, as the one at hand, the credi-
tor’s persona has a material (essential) significance for the partners.

Taking into consideration that Mr Sax appeared to have been the driving
force relating to the pre-development-phase of the Project, and the expendi-
tures incurred, he cannot be considered as a totally unrelated third party as
if, for Instance, the assignment had been made to a Chinese investor who
had not so far been invalved In the Project. For this reason, the Tribunal con-
cludes that the assignment of monetary claims in fact did not require the
Respondent's consent.

Hence, it seems to be legally possible is to accept Claimant's standing as a
transferee of the pre-development advance claim and of the developer fee
claim (i.e. the developer fee which SPS could earn under the Project), and of
the financial benefits which SPS possibly could derive as the 29.7% investor.

The legal construction in respect of the developer fee and the investor claim
would then be the following:

. Since by means of CX-66/CX-59 only claims could be transferred, but
not as such the position as a shareholder, SPS remained a shareholder
of IAT Pulkovo, and remained a party to the Founders’ Agreement;

. To the extent that the Founders' Agreement fore-shadowed that SPS
will be the developer of the Project {as argued by Claimant), SPS - and
not Claimant - remained eligible for such task;

. however, SPS can/could, even in advance of earning any remuneration
as a developer *, assign such future remuneration to Claimant Mr Sax;

. likewise, as regards the position as an investor and 29,7% shareholder
of IAT Pulkovo, it is clear that the shareholding as such could not valid-
ly be transferred to Claimant (for lack of consent by the other share-
holders, lack of satisfying their rights of first refusal, and for lack of
proper issuance of the shares; hence, it is clear that SPS remained the
shareholder in IAT Pulkovo even after December 2002;

. however, as it is normally possible that a shareholder can, for instance,
be committed to assign future dividends or liquidation proceeds to
another party (for instance to a creditor who had granted a loan to the
shareholder), it would likewise seem possible for SPS to assign all such
future benefits to Claimant;

° in both cases, the debtor of such assignments vis-a-vis would be SPS,
and it is SPS which — under CX-66/CX-59 — would be liable to effec-
tuate those payments, not Respondents or IAT Pulkovo;

however, as it is Claimant's case that SPS was unlawfully “thrown out"
of the Project, and was not further considered after 1999 and beyond,
Claimant suffered an indirect loss 77, a loss for which damages might
be claimed;

For goad reason, it was not alleged by Claimant that, for instance, the 4.5% developer fee
was a fee payable upfront, without the Foreign Parties or Mr Sax even having started any
kind of development for the realization of the Project; it was thus not simply a .receiva-
bie*, collectible like an amount due and payable forthwith. And even less could the future
investor's benefits be considered a mere «receivable”.

The direct loss is suffered by SPS which was ne longer enabled ta became the developer,
and was deprived of its pesition to be the investor for the NIPT and the AIPT; hence, SPS.
was deprived of earning the fee and deprived of the chance to earn the hundreds of mil-

. such indirect damage Is a receivable in the sense as it is claimed by

Claimant.

344 The transfer, therefore, must be regarded as valid as far as any "receivables"

are concerned.

345 As a_conclusion, the Tribunal certainly accepts the validity of CX-66 and CX-
59 as such, giving them such meaning as is clearly apparent from them on a
reading of the rather clear text (which in fact hardly needs an interpretation),
in the sense that Claimant Mr Sax thereby intended to “stand into the shoes

of PSP/SP".

346 The essential question to be analyzed and answered in this Award is to see

how far these "shoes" were fit to walk Claimant up the hill to collect and cash

the following:
. The reimbursement of the pre-development expenses,

. The alleged 4.5% developer fee and

. The 29.7% monetized interest in the future operational profits of the

NIPT and/or the AIPT.

347 On the other hand, Claimant’s extensive references in his PH-Brief to the

investor protection afforded to foreign investors under the Russian Foreign

Investor Law are not to the point in the framework of these proceedings, as

the further discussion in this Award will show, nor is there room for arguing

an expropriation case.

 

lions which - accarding to Claimant ~ could be earned by it under its 29.7% shareholding;
due to this shortfall suffered by SPS, SPS will not be enabled to pay Claimant, and this
causes the indirect loss to Claimant. — All this sounds a bit complicated, but indeed is very
simple. However, it was not possible for SPS to assign its position as a shareholder in IAT

Pulkovo, or the position as the “developer”.
Certainly, Professor Cheng’s testimony as an expert on international law at the

Hearings was the intellectual high-light of the Hearings, because - In his very cloquent

The Tribunal concludes that Claimant has standing (focus standi) as re-

Iv Jurisdiction over Respondents

349 In the present case, some queries were raised in respect of Respondent 3
which, according to Respondents’ explanations, became merged into, and
was absorbed by, Respondents 4 and 5.

350 More generally, Respondents - in their Liability Brief as wall as in their PH-
Brief’ - raised the jurisdictional defense that Claimant should have ad-
dressed any and all claims solely to IAT Pulkovo, as the party potentially lia-
ble for his claims, and not to his other previous stockholders, basically on the
argument that stockholders do not have liabilities among each other.

351 Claimant argues that Respondents’ liability must be affirmed, given the fact
that under their authority IAT Pulkovo became struck fram the commercial
register.

352 For the Tribunal, it is obvious that these issues may be rather complex; there
is no easy answer for a “post mortem liability" of stockholders of a company
to each other, especially if during the "lifetime" of the company such a liabili-
ty among stockholders was not oxplicitly provided for (in fact, Section 8.4 of
the Founders' Agreement seems to evidence the intention to exclude liability
claims among steck-holders).

 

 

lave with which the Arbitrators of course full-heartedly agree in all respects, and with which
they certainly were already very familiar. -- The only problem is that Professor Cheng’s
scientific analysis was in almost all respects entirely outside the real fact pattern which is
before this Tribunal.
Indeed, the further reasoning of this Award will show that there is no merit whatsoever for
arguing an expropriation case.

Nevertheless, the Tribunal takes it that there are at least some good grounds
to affirm jurisdiction over the Respondents, and by this affirmation, to af-
ford all parties the benefit of arbitral jurisdiction in respect of all of the issues
filed in this arbitration. On this basis, the Tribunal conducted these proceed-
ings,

valid D ion and Repr

 

Matters of the correct designation of the Respondents and their registered
addresses as well as the validity of Respondents’ 1 and 2 representation by
outside lawyers on the basis of valid powers of attorney have been exten-
sively discussed since October 2010, with clarifications repeatedly sought by
Claimant; see eq CM-63/64, CM-77.

Already in its 25" Order of 18 March 2011, the Tribunal dealt with Claimant's
concern regarding the name change of Respondent 4 which occurred on 22
November 2010 (and which remained non-notified to this Tribunal), and the
change of Respondent 5's registered address. Claimant, in that context, al-
leged “an attempt to manufacture a future defense against enforcement in
Russia of any interim or final award fn this arbitral proceeding, much tike the
defense asserted by Samaraneftegaz in Yukos Capital SARL v/Samara-
neftegaz.”

The Tribunal already addressed these concerns in Its 25" Order, and the rea-
soning there given entirely stands as a conclusive reasoning for the present
Award; the decisive part, reflecting a deeply rooted notion of due process,
may be recited by the following extract from the 25" Order:

"A party (here Respondents) which had been validly addressed as a Respon-
dent in arbitral proceedings, is under a duty to notify the Arbitral Tribunal
and the other Parties of any changes of its corporate name and structure as
well as of its changed address for allowing a valid service of communications,
A failure ta do so cannot later on, or in any subsequent (enforcement-) pro-
ceedings, serve as an argument that the Party had not been validly kept in-

forrned of the further arbitral proceedings. - For this simple reason, Clai~
mant’s concern is not well-grounded.”

The 25 Order further dealt with the validity of counsel's mandate to
represent Respondents 1 and 2 which was signed by the first Deputy Director
of Respondent 2 whose authority to validly sign such mandate was doubted
by Claimant.

Similarly, in this respect, the Tribunal in its 25” Order considered that it
would be ...

"quite unthinkable that, in any subsequent/resulting enforcement proceed-
ings, one or the other of the Respondent Parties would invoke that it had not
been properly kept informed on the present arbitral proceedings and any of
the numerous procedural steps, or invoke that the company name or service
address for communication was wrong, or invoke that a particular service ad-
dress should have been uscd as opposed to the business address, or invoke
that any of its legal counsc! were at any given moment in time not properly
mandated by Respondents 1 and 2, or would invoke that the Power-of-
Attorney, executed by the first Deputy Director Mr O.A. Ljapustin, was invalid
for some formal internal flaws or lack of authority.”

As the Tribunal further stated:

“Any of the above defenses, or defenses of a similar nature, whether raised
in these proceedings or in any subsequent proceedings or enforcement pro-
ceedings, would look “so bad" and would seem to be so clearly non-
meritorious by any standards that the present Arbitral Tribunal finds it unne-
cessary and unwarranted to burden the present proceedings with continuing
queries of the present nature.”

Summarized in an abstract form, the Tribunal noted:

“A party (here; Respondents) which over a period of time knowingly and
without intervention accepts to be represented by counsel/outside counsel
cannot later on, or in any subsequent (enforcement-) proceedings, deny the
validity of such representation - whatever legal system applics. For this
simple reason, Claimant's concern is not well-grounded,"

A footnote mentioned:

"This notion is so dear and obvious that no legal authorities need to be cited.
Indeed, any citation could only dilute the clarity of the Tribunal's dictum.”

All of these reflections are made part of the Tribunal's jurisdictional decision
as per the present Award, and hence this Tribunal is sufficiently satisfied

. (i) that Respondents 1 and 2, purported to be represented by counsel,
had indeed validly mandated all of their legal representatives, and that

. {ii) all Respondents were at all tines validly kept informed on the pro-
ceedings, and had al! appropriate opportunities to make their case
known to the Tribunal.

. (i) In particular, the Tribunal addressed special invitations in its Or-
ders for all of the Respondents to delegate an in-house counsel or
member of the management to be present during the Hearings, so as
to get their own impressions on the appropriateness and correctness of
the proceedings.

. (iv) And the Stockholm Liability Hearings were attended by two repre-
sentatives of Respondent 2, i.e, Maria Smirnova and Natalia Nazarova,
with the former addressing the Tribunal at the last day of the Hear-
ings;”

. (v) Mrs Smirnova, in particular, explicitly confirmed the following:

“First of all, being a representative of the City Property Management
Committee I would like to emphasize that the legal position
represented by DLA Piper during the proceedings is totally supported
by and agreed with the Committee, and of course we can see that all
the claims set forth in the claim of Mr Sax are groundless, but I would
like to elucidate [on] a bit different aspect ..““*

Needless to mention that the Tribunal is moreover satisfied that the counsel
appearing for Claimant had been properly mandated, although the Power of
Attorney issued by Mr Carl A Sax in favour of Amsterdam & Peroff, dated 9
December 2009, was only valid for one year.

To sum _up:

The Tribunal is entirely satisfied that Claimant as well as Respondents 1 and
2 were at all times properly mandated by their lawyers purporting to have
been given such mandate.

Moreover, the Tribunal is satisfied that all the Respondents (including Res-
pondents [3], 4 and S) were at all times sufficiently and correctly kept in-
formed on the proceedings, and at all times had the possibility to make their
views known to the Tribunal.

A First Review of the "Investment Contract” and Supporting
Documents Filed in this Arbitration

The two documents, i.e, the Founders' Agreement (CX-6, RX-1, RX-23) and
the Charter (CX-5, RX-2, RX-24), have been characterized by Claimant as
constituting an “Investment Contract" related to the development and con-
struction of an international passenger terminal facility (the investment
project); it “comports with internationally-recognized practices concerning
so-called ‘build, operate and transfer’ investment contracts”. CM-84 para. 7.
Respondents also used the term of “Investment Contract”.

In CM-84, para. 7, Claimant stated that the Investment Contract

“was drafted, reviewed, revised and executed under the auspices and super-
vision of a team of specialized international lawyers familiar with both Rus-
sian and international law.”

At the Stockholm Hearing, upen question of the Tribunal as to who drafted
the texts forming part of the Investment Contract, Mr Sax gave to under-
stand that the texts came from the US side, without giving any more precise
details.

The investment project was Initiated by a “Protocol” (which in these proceed-
ings was most frequently referred to as the "Protocol of Agreement") of 16
March 1994 (CX-2), and was followed up by the Founders! Agreement of 19
May 1995 (CX-6) and the Charter (CX-5).

It would serve no useful purpose to describe all the elements of the three
documents, i.e. the Protocol of Agreement, the Founders’ Agreement and the
Charter; however, for the further discussion hereinafter, it is helpful to recall
just a few provisions which are of particular significance,

The Protocol of Agreement of 16 March 1994 (CX-2) - which had been
drafted by Mr Sax” - could best be characterized as a memorandum of in-
tent™, reflecting the agreement to establish a joint stock company, premised
on the recital according to which “SP and SPBD have agreed to provide Fi-
nancing (..) and guarantees to construct the Complex, and to design (..) en-
gineer and construct the Complex with the participation of tocal Russian
companies” (preamble to the Protocol).

Clause 2 provides that "the Foreign Partners shall secure financing for 100%
of the cost to construct the Complex, which is anticipated to be approximate-
ly US$ 75 million, from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Develap-
ment (EBRD) and from its own participants, and shall guarantee repayment
to the EBRD,”

Regarding the shareholding in the joint stock company, Clause 5 stated: "The
Russian Parties shall be entitled to 66 2/3%, SP shall be entitled to 29 2/3%,
and SPBD shall be entitled to 3 2/3% interest in the stock and dividends of
PIATA’ (i.e. the joint stock company).

Regarding dispute resolution, Clause 8 of the Protocol provided for LCIA arbi-
tration in Stockholm, Russian law as applicable law, with each party to bear
their own costs and half of the cost of the tribunal, unless the arbitration
panel determines a different allocation “according to the equities of the mat-
ter in dispute”,

In view of the claims made in the framework of this Arbitration, it is notewor-
thy to remark the “cornerstones” of the Protocol, i.e. on the one hand

. the Foreign Parties’ financing obligation,

. coupled with the 2/3 Russian to 1/3 foreign participation in the joint
stock company and,

. on the other hand, absence of a provision in the sense that expendi-
tures as may be incurred by the Foreign Parties could be invoiced to
the Russian Parties, or could otherwise be recovered from the joint
venture company.

According to the Founders' Agreement, dated 19 May 1995, IAT Pulkovo
was to have a share capital of Rubles 50 mio, divided into 1‘000 shares of
Rubles 50'000 each, whereof the Property Management was to acquire 303
shares, the State Enterprise Pulkovo 334 shares, SP 297 shares (thus
representing 29.7% of the share-capital}, and two Western minority share-
holders (Grassi and SPBD) 33 shares each.

The Russian Parties, therefore, were to control 63.7% of the share-capital,
with the remaining 36.3% being subscribed by the Foreign Parties. No less
than 50% of the purchase price for the shares was to be paid prior to IAT
Pulkovo's registration, the balance to be paid within the first year of the IAT
Pulkovo‘s registration {but for the Property Management Committee which
was to pay its share by leasing to IAT Pulkovo the plot of land on which the
Terminal was to be constructed,

The Founders’ Agreement set out the obligations of the Parties with respect
to the establishment of IAT Pulkovo, laid down details for the management of
the Company, and set out the plans of the further cooperation.**

Regarding the expenditures of the Founders, Section 6.3 provides that each
Founder “agrees to pay its own expenditures related to the Company's for-
mation incurred prior to the Company’s registration”.

 

Respondents considered that the Founders’ Agreement only in its first part provides for

binding obligations, but not in its secand part, i.e. after the establishment of IAT Pulkovo,
which merely has the character of a letter of intent. R-Liab Brief paras. 23-45; Rejoinder

Section 8.4 is an exit-clause allowing the Founders - under the terms of the
clause - to withdraw themselves, whereupon "the Company shalt be
deemed as invalid, and shall be fiquidated ...”, with each Founder accepting
to bear any damages itself, “and shaft not transfer responsibility for them to
other Founders”.

Further, rather detailed provisions of the Founders’ Agreement deal with
transfer restrictions regarding any disposition of shares, requiring the pres-
entation of an “Acquisition Proposal” to the other Founders/sharehoiders, al-
lowing them to exercise their pre-emptive rights under Section 11.1 to 11. 4
of the Founders’ Agreement (with certain small-scale permitted dispositions
according to Section 11.10),

380 Again, in view of the claims made in the framework of this Arbitration, it is

noteworthy that:

. the repartition of the shareholding, is now 63.7% for the Russian Par-
ties, and 36.3% for the Foreign Parties,

. there is no provision for the reimbursement, by Respondents or by [AT
Pulkovo, of expenditures as may be incurred by the Foreign Parties in
connection with the tasks they have assumed to provide a financing
commitment; to the contrary:

e Section 6.3 of the Founders’ Agreement provides: “Fach Founder
agrees to pay its own expenditures related to the Company's formation
incurred prior to the Company's registration;" *

. Section 8.4 of the Founders’ Agreement (already referred to above)
then spells out what should happen at the end; it deals with damages
as may be suffered by the parties who had “funded the establishment
of the Company and implementation of the provisions of Article VIH"

Clalmant's caunsel, at the Stockholm Hearing, stressed that this provision only deals with
expenditures related to the formation, and nothing else. - The Tribunal may remark that,
nevertheless, ona may debate whether a narrow or wider meaning shauld be given to the
term "related to"; there is, however, no necessity to define this further.

and provides that each such Founder “shail accept these damages
as its own, and shail not transfer responsibility for them to oth-
er Founders" (emphasis added) -- a provision which, as the text
says, is broadly worded, covering not only the funding, by any of the
Founders, of the establishment of IAT Pulkovo, but moreover whatever
had been done for the Implementation; and as regards the Foreign Par-
ties, the warding suggests a conclusion that it also covers all their ex-
penditures incurred in the context of Section 8.1, i.¢. in the context of
their efforts to obtain the debt-financing.

. Further important elements are the tight transfer restrictions as per Ar-
ticle XI, and

. The Dispute Resolution clause is set out in Article XII.

381 The Charter, equally dated 19 May 1995, excludes in Chapter 3.5 the liabili-
ty of the Founders other than up to the value of their shareholdings; and
Chapter 4.11 provides for the issuance of share certificates in accordance
with the contributions paid by each of the shareholders.

382 Chapter 4.16 of the Charter states that the estimated cost to develop and
construct the Terminal

“will be up to US$ 100 million, including capitalized deferred construction ex-
penses. The Foreign Partics will use their best efforts to seek debt financing
for the Company from independent banks in the amount of USS 60 million”.

383 Further, Chapter 4.16 provides:

“It is understood under the financing documents that the Company will be
the borrower and PSP will be responsible for guarantecing the obligations of
the Company to the banks. No other Founder will bear responsibility for the
obligations of the Company urxier the finacing documents.”

384 Chapter 11 deals with the decisions requiring a unanimous vote at a Share-
holders’ Meeting.

Chapter 12 of the Charter provides for a Board consisting of 11 members,
whereof 6 nominated by the Russian Parties and 5 by the Foreign Parties.
Resolutions are basically passed by majority.

However, Chapter 12.7 of the Charter contains a long catalogue of decisions
requiring unanimity, such as c.g, the “entry into any contracts, agree-
ments and borrowings, in any amount exceeding US$ 10°000 or its
equivalent” and the "retention of professionals providing services to and on
behalf of the Company”.

Chapter 13 of the Charter provides for a Management Committee consisting
of “Executive Officers” which, according to Chapter 13.3, were to be ap-
pointed at a Board of Directors’ Meeting,

Chapter 16 of the Charter provides for very detailed transfer restrictions re-
garding share deals, in a more elaborate fashion than those provided for in
the Founders’ Agreement.

Termination of IAT Pulkovo shall occur by unanimity of the shareholders, or
upon a court decision or decision of an arbitral tribunal, or in accordance with
the Founders’ Agreement and the Russian legislation (Chapter 17).

An indemnification clause provides for holding the directors and officers of
IAT Pulkovo harmless in case of sults, claims or actions brought against them
(Chapter 19),

Chapters 20 and 21 contain the dispute resolution provisions and applicable
law clause referred to above in Chapter C.

For matters of interpretation of the Investment Contract, Claimant - in CM-
84 para 8 - referred to Article 431.1 and 431.2 Russian CC on the interpre-
tation of contractual obligations, which for the research of the real intentions
and common will of the parties to a contract, determines that

“all surrounding circumstances shall be taken into consideration, including

Although a detailed account on the negotiation and drafting history of the
Protocol of Agreement (and the subsequent Founders’ Agreement) would
have been of significant interest to the Tribunal so as to obtain a deeper un-
derstanding of the points which may have significant importance for the as-
sessment of the present dispute, for instance in respect of

* the repartitioning of the stockholders’ participation quotas,
° the maximum amount of the loan financing,

« matters regarding the bearing of costs and expenses incurred by the
Parties,

. the exit clause of Section 8.4,

 

. matters of repr ion of the joint: ty IAT Pull

. the hold-harmless provision in Section 19 and its relation to Section 20

no such details or other sources of information (which could have shed a light
on those aspects that were particularly significant or important to the Par-
ties) were provided by either side (neither preparatory drafts and their revi-
sions, nor any notes on discussions/negotiations).

Apart from the above three documents, numerous further documents were
filed in this arbitration.

However, a simple review (i) of the Investment Contract and (ii) of the fur-
ther files submitted by the Parties in these proceedings, shows that, signifi-
cantly for the present dispute,

tions such as DMG and EBRD;**

 

. moreover, no contractual provision contains a straightforward obliga-
tion for the other shareholders/Respondents to fe! quef accept a {or in-
deed any) financing proposal that may be submitted to them by SPS or
Claimant;*/

. no document was made known in these proceedings which purported to
grant an authority or mandate to SPS or Mr Carl A Sax personally to

Suggesting a canclusion that, hence, Claimant or Mr Carl A Sax, absent a mandate from
IAT Pulkovo or the other shareholders/Rospondents, only could act on his own behalf, or
on behalf of the Foreign Parties/SPS.

This may lead to an understanding — to be discussed further hereinafter — that any such
acceptance remained within the free decisions of all of the sharcholders, in particular the
Respondents, subject to applying a bona fide approach when reviewing the proposed fi-
nancing terms of a lending institution, In fact, Charter Section 12.7 (e) explicitly required
the passing of a Board Resolution which had to be adopted by an unanimous vote of all
directors in writing, or by all directors present in person at a meeting (or represented by a
proxy),

395 Furthermore, no transfer of shares in IAT Pulkovo in favor of any lending in-
stitution reducing the shareholdings of the Russian Parties was envisaged in
the Investment Contract.”

396 Moreover, no conversion of PSP's or Claimant's project expenses into a loan
had been foreshadowed in the Investment Contract, as this was later on re~
quested in the Credit Proposal of EBRD, Clause 3.2.2.

397 No developer fee of 4.5% for the management and construction of the Ter-
minal is mentioned in the Investment Contract. Section 8.3 of the Founders’
Agreement only contains a clause whereby the "Stockholders shail recognize

with its efforts to enter into each of the foltowing: fomissis} (c) Project De-
velopment Agreement between the Company and PSP".

398 No pledging of the shares in IAT Pulkovo was fore-shadowed in the Invest-

in Clause 3.3.4.

399 No possibility of the transfer of management functions to any third party or

Introduction to the Substantive Discussion

For the purpose of the substantive discussion, this Award will follow the List
of 9 Issues as. reflected in the 32" Order of 2 September 20414. The issues,
as listed in the 32™ Order, are quoted in the headings of the following Parts
L to R of this Award, and the more particular Qs Nos 1 to 53, as identified by
the Tribunal in the 32" Order, are restated in small caps.

In preparation for the Stockholm Liability Hearings, both sides submitted
Memorials addressing seriatim all of tha issues and each one of the 53 ques-
tions below; Claimant did so in CM-84 and in a detailed APPENDIX (“APP
CM-84", a document without pagination; pages manually inserted by the
Tribunal, numbered 1 to 27) filed on 13 October 2011, and Respondents 1
and 2 did so in 1-RM-36/2-RM-42, equally dated 13 October 2011 (together
with separate comments on Claimant's summary on Russian law applicable to
the Purchase Agreement stipulated In CM-76}.

It Is, for the purpose of this Award, therefore deemed most appropriate to
review the Issues 1-7 one by one of the Questions, and to conclude each
Chapter with short answers; Issue 8 will be addressed in the Cost Section.

Issue 1:

Did the Foreign Parties/ Claimant Perform Properly, and Were the Financ-
ing Terms, as Proposed by EBRD, Satisfactory Such that the Russian Par-
ties Should Have Accepted Those Terms?

1 Regarding the EBRD offer: is there a significant discrepancy between basic
terms of the Founders’ Agreement ("FA"), and the EBRD offer?

2. What about, for instance,
(i) the increased amount of the loan,
(ii) the interest terms,
(iii) Lhe removal of majority for the Russian Parties of 63.4% to a majority

of the Foreign Parties/EBRD, by the required transfers of 21.5%

(iv) pledging of the shares in favor of EBRD,
(v) transfer of management functions to Aéroports de Paris?

3 Hence: Have the Foreign Parties properly fulfilled their “primary obliga-
tion”, by providing the EBRD financing offer as It was made?

4 Were the Russian Parties bound to accept whatever financing offer would
be presented? Or wero they free to reject it, or let it lapse time-wisc?

Claimant's Position

Claimant in these proceedings emphasized in all of the substantive submis-
sions that Claimant had properly fulfilled his contractual duty by "employing
ail necessary efforts” to obtain the financing commitment. The most detailed
account of Claimant’s position was given in App CM-84, filed a few days prior
to the Stockholm Liability Hearing, addressing seriatim all of the Issues and
Questions put by the Tribunal in its 32" Order.

According to Claimant, the fact that the financing cornmitment was not al-
ready obtained by the 31 December 1995 deadline, set out in Section 8,1(c)

of the Founders’ Agreement, was not a breach of the Investment Contract,
because, in the above sense, “the Foreign Parties were clearly employing ‘all
necessary efforts’ to obtain such commitment”; CM-66 para. 5.

Most essentially, Claimant argues that PSP properly fulfilled its primary obli-
gation, and that there was no significant difference between the Founders’
Agreement and the EBRD proposal, essentially since the “the Founders’
Agreement requires such financing as is necessary to construct and com-
mence operation in Section 8.1 (b)".™®

Hence, Claimant’ case is to maintain that:

the Foreign Parties properly complied with their “primary obligation”
(CM-66 para, 2) to secure the financing for the NIPT, and

the terms of the financing had been agreed by the Parties to the In-
vestment Contract (CM-66, para, 4; Mr Sax in CWS-6, paras. 24-57),
and

the Investment Contract included firm obligations of the Parties. *'

Furthermore, the amount of the financing needed was assessed by
DMG/EBRD, and the Founders’ Agreement contemplated that the
amount of financing might increase;

Interest terms had net been specified in the Founders’ Agreement, and
the EBRD indicated a commercial pricing”;

regarding the removal of the Russian 2/3-majority, Claimant calculated
that the Russian Parties even after the exercising of the DMG- and
EBRD-options would still contro! over 50% in [AT Pulkovo;

aS

EBRD’s request regarding the pledging of the shares of IAT Pulkovo,
according to Claimant's testimony, “was commercially reasonable, by
definition”; ?

The further EBRD requirement that the management functions should
be assigned to a Western provider (i.e. Aéroports de Paris) was also
necessary for the project to qualify as pertaining to the private sector;

Mr Sax underlined the latter aspect at the Hearings: “EBRD required a
Non-Russian management to qualify for Pulkovo-3 as a private sector
project ... with regard to compliance, I believe that the private sector
criteria of EBRD were commercially reasonable and I know that they
were agreed to by SEP..."™,

Even if the EBRD proposal had to be considered unacceptable by the
Russian Parties, they were still bound by the Founders’ Agreement;
yet, according to Claimant, the Russian Parties could have properly
withdrawn from it, or could have negotiated an exit scenario; neither
was done.

The exceptio non (rite) adimpleti contractus |s not available to the Rus-
sian Parties, and Article 328 CC does not provide a basis.

Even if the Russian Parties were well-founded not to take the EBRD of-
fer further, PSP could rightfully continue to claim to be part of the In-
vestment Project which was not terminated in accordance with proce-
dures available under Russian law, and PSP's performance was moreo-
ver accepted by the Russian Parties. *

The provisions of the Founders’ Agreement remained binding and there
was no right to repudiate the Investment Contract, or to tacitly termi-
nate it.

° The disinterest of the Russian Parties was only realized on 2 October
2007 when Claimant was advised that the City of St. Petersburg in-
tended to develop the NIPT/AITP without the participation of Claimant
and/or PSP.

. In Mr Karpov’s letter of 16 April 2003 (CX-69), Clalmant finds evidence
that the Russian Parties confirmed fulfillment of Claimant's primary ob-
ligation, that the Founders’ Agreement was still in effect and that any
dissolution required the consent of all shareholders. *

. Regarding the question whether SPS or Claimant properly fulfilled the
primary obligation regarding the providing of a financing offer, Clai-
mant's answer is a clear "yes".

However, Mr Sax also fully agreed - upon a question by Respondents’ coun-
sel - that the Russian Parties “had full rights not to agree to proceed with
the EBRD proposai".”’ Claimant also confirmed this explicitly in the Appendix
to CM-84 at page 7, answering Issue 4.

At the Stockholm Hearings, Claimant Mr Sax in his testimony, maintained
that Respondents should have accepted the financing offer of EBRD, despite
some changes to the parameters as they were initially set out in the Protocol
of Agreement and the Founders’ Agreement. At the Hearings, Mr Sax de-
scribed the significant benefits which would have been availabla for all par-
ties, including the Russian Parties, had they accepted the financing offer
which, as he explained, in 2011 would have been fully amortized.

Asked by the Tribunal whether the financing proposal of EBRD, as presented,
fell outside the parameters which initially had been discussed and agreed be-
tween the Foreign Parties and the Russian Parties, Mr Sax, in his oral testi-
mony as a witness of 18 October 2011, defended the reasonableness of the
EBRD financing proposal; for instance, EBRD did not ask for control over [AT

Pulkovo, but on the other hand required debt-subordination for satisfying
their requirement as to the equity:debt ratio. **

412 The Tribunal explored some further details regarding the magnitude of the
required financing, noting that the Protocol of Agreement envisaged a financ-
ing in the approximate amount of US$ 75 Million *; the question was put to
Mr Sax whether that figure was a negotiated figure, whether for instance the
Russian Partners had a cap in mind in the region of that amount, and wheth-
er Mr Sax - in the framework of the discussions regarding the Protocol of
Agreement - indicated or "warned" that the financing requirement could in
the end be much higher, such as US$ 100 Mio or 200 Mio.

413 On the latter question Mr Sax replied that “we a/f agreed that the guestimate
was US$ 75 million, However, quite frankly, nobody knew exactly what it was
going to cost because everyone knew that the EBRD loan process was @ te-
dious, time-consuming process going over multiple number of years, and ob-
viously during that period there would have to be adjustments of the cost’.

414 Considering that the EBRD financing proposal in fact indicated a financing
requirement in an amount more than double of what has been contemplated,
the Tribunal remarked at the Hearing that such proposal meant that, in the
end, the Russian Parties had to pay most of the bill for such financing
through the operation of the Terminal, Mr Sax replied as follows:

“I think your question is relevant if the profitability of the project is in ques-
tion, However, if the profitability of the project is all excessive that all of the
parties, including the Russian Parties, are making more money than they have
ever made before in the entire history of the Russian Federation, then in fact
whether it Costs 7S million or 150 million or 200 million is irrelevant.”

415 Apart from the estimated amount of financing, the Protocol of Agreement laid
down a further cornerstone by stating the Parties’ participation in the Project,
by providing that the Russian Parties shall be entitled to 66 2/3% and the

Foreign Parties to 33 1/3% (29 2/3% for Strategic Partners and 3 2/3% for
SPBD. On the question put to him at the Hearing, Mr Sax confirmed that this
repartition was a negotiated repartition, in the sense of a “two-thirds/one-
third deal".

On further question by the Tribunal whether a two-third majority was impor-
tant for the Russian Parties, Mr Sax replied:

“Mr Sax: If we said at the time that you get only 51%, then unless we were
able to put the money on the table, they would mot have signed. With the
money on the table, yes, they wauld have signed at 50.1%, but don’t think
that the negotiations at that time -- I understand the question that you are
asking, but I can’t honestly answer the question, Again, I will say the 66%
and one-third different was a discussion; it was not a thoroughly contested
item ..."

In another context, a similar question was asked as to whether the share-
holdings, as initially agreed between the Foreign Parties and the Russian Par-
ties in the Protocol of Agreement, were to be considered fixed. In his re-
sponse, Mr Sax referred to Section 14.3 of the Founders’ Agreement which -
as he said — contemplates that

“in the event the financiers ask for shares, that we agree, the Founders’
agree, to dilute our shares pro rata, There was also an agreement — oral --
between myscif and the Russians that the Russian shares would not fall be-
low 50.1%".7

to obtain finacing referred to in Section 8.1 (a) so tong as such amendment or modifi-

cation does not alter the relative percentage interests in the capital stock of the

spectively in a new Project Company to be formed %*). Mr Sax commented on
this requirement as follows:

Mr. Sax: “Now was the EBRD 1.5% the exact number contemplated when
the Founders' Agreement was signed? No. Was it contemplated that they
would ask for a sharc interest? Yes. Was the DMG number of 20% contem-
plated at the time the Founders’ Agreement was signed? No. Was it contem-
plated that they would ask for a share interest’ Yes, because we didn’t know
the number, Did I tell my partner DMG at the time that they were being
greedy? Yes, Did the Russians say that DMG was being greedy? Yes, Would I
agree today that they were being greedy? Yes. But it is what it is, because in
1998 there were a lack of financiers available in Russia and if you did not go
to DMG or IFC or OPIC, quite frankly you couldn't find senior debt financing,
and If you didn't deal with somebody like DMG or Credit Suisse or someone
like that you couldn't get subordinated debt or equity or mezzanine financing
or whatever you want to call it at the time.

So to directly respand to your question: the Russians knew. They didn't like
the 20% and neither did 1, They may not have liked the 1.5%, but they knew
it was a "falt accompli", quite frankly, at the time that the EBRD asked for it
because there was not an alternative lender of EBRD stature, And even if you
take the numbers and you work the numbers out, the Russians never fell be-
low their 50.1% threshold that they were interested in maintaining, even
with the dilution of the EBRD and DMG.”

The EBRD proposal also contained further aspects, which were all "commer-
cialty reasonable”, such as e.g. the requirement of issuing shares and the re-
quirement that a new project company replacing IAT Pulkovo should be
formed, as Mr Sax explained at the Hearing.”

 

See hereto the requirement oft he EBRD counsel reflected in Transcript 18act11 page 158.

At the Stockholm Hearings, Mr Sax stated that SP/PSP .became aware of three facts: 1.
the shares had not been issued by the Russians as promised. 2. From speaking to our

counsel, that we could not compet the Russians to issue the shares.
The Chairman: You did not?

Mr Sax: We could not. Not that we did not, but we could not.

The Chairman: As a shareholder?

420 In sum, it is Claimant's case to argue that Respondents “against good faith":
. failed to accept the terms of the EBRD financing proposal,

. failed to implement numerous steps towards implementation of the
Project (starting with failures to obtain governmental permissions, fail-
ure to build an apron as well as access roads, failure to provide for a
correct management and administration of IAT Pulkove, and

. inter atia also failed to issue the IAT Pulkovo share certificates.

421 The Founders, Claimant nevertheless acknowledges, had the option to termi-
nate the relationship, either by terminating the Ground Lease, or by with-

 

Mr Sax: I coutdn’t compel them to sign a credit agreement where they were going to make
a whole fot of money, how can I compel them to issue shares in a Russian corporation?
The Chairman: But you required that the shares be issued? Mr Sax: No; the agreement
requires that the shares be issued. The problem is there was no procedure in Russia ro-
quiring that a shareholder could compel the Russians to issue the shares and, even if there
was - which there isn't - more importantly, if you read the letter from Bertram Millot in
1999, you'll find confirmation of the fact that in 1998, just prior to the closing, EBRD's
counsel, Dickstein Shapiro, came up - found - that there wasa - I'll use the word “de-
fect” (1 won't use the word that I use te describe it) - but let's say a ridiculously absurd
defect that EBRD's counsel found in IAT Pulkove, and EBRD's counse! wanted us and the
Russians to form a new company - this is RX-6, the EBRO letter dated January 8, 1999 ~
and the EBRD wanted us to revise the Charter, form a new company, etc. etc. as more
particularly set forth in Bertram’s fetter. As a result of that, candidly, even if there was a
way to compe! the Russians to issue the stock I wouldn't have compelled the Russians at
the time because it was illogical to when I knew that we had to form a new company to be
able to close the financing with the EBRD. Sa as a result of that you have the following
situation: 1. The four corners of the document are crystal clear to me what they trans-
ferred, and they certainly didn't transfer the right te compel the Russians to issue the
shares of IATP. 2. There was no procedure in Russia for us to compel the Russiars to issue
the shares; and 3. There was no reason for us to do it when we knew that the EBRD re-
quired a formation of a new company and, at that thme, the issuance of shares in that
company. So as a result of that - again, tome - the four corners of the document are
Gear and everything is obfuscation." Transcript 180cti1 pages 48-50.

Respondents’ Position

Respondents, in Rejoinder paras, 120-172 and 1-RM-32/2-RM-38, paras.
167-182, and throughout their PH-Brief, maintain that they have fulfilled all
their obligations under the Founders’ Agreement correctly and that the In-
vestment Project was not realized due to Claimant's failure to meet his pri-
mary obligation by providing an acceptable financing commitment,

More particularly - addressing Claimant's allegation that the City of St, Pe-
tersburg had not helped [AT Pulkovo in obtaining all permissive documents
and did not use all best efforts for the project to succeed, did not build an
apron and roads such that the financial dosing had not occurred - Respon-
dents maintain that the permissive documents had been obtained by 15 July
1998, as confirmed by CX-10 and CX-21. And as regards the alleged obliga-
tion to construct an apron and access roads, Respondents deny that they had
assumed any such obligation. In fact, such obligations were proposed by the
EBRD as a condition for obtaining the financing, but the EBRD's proposal had
never been accepted by Respondents.

Already in Rejainder para, 132, and repeated in 1-RM-32/2-RM-38, para.
177, Respondents maintain that roads had to be constructed by [AT Pulkovo,
not by Respondents, and it was not an obligation of the City of St, Petersburg
to construct any of the roads, utilities or the apron.

Furthermore, the Foreign Parties had no authority, on behalf of IAT Pulkovo
or the other shareholders, to represent them in relations with other third par-
ties, for any of the following (Rejoinder, para. 96):

“{i) Assign different consultants and advisors and execute contracts with
them, (li) agree on specific terms and conditions of debt financing, (iii) incur
multi-million expenses, and (iv) spend money for any other arrangements ei~
ther related ar not related to the Investment Project. The Claimant was not a
representative of the Respondent and was not entitled to act on their behalf
and spend any money. Therefore, any actions of the Claimant in the course
of attracting financing were made on his own, at his expense and without any
consent or approval of other shareholders of IAT Pulkovo.”

For Respondents it is clear that Claimant “solely caused the failure and sub-
sequent termination of the Investment Project", by not providing the financ-
ing commitment on acceptable terms, i.e. by submitting a financing proposal
with substantial delay and on terms which Respondents could not and were
not obliged to accept since, inter alia, they contradicted the initial agree-
ments of the Parties to the [Investment Project and the Founders' Agreement
and were commercially unreasonable, involving three times increased costs.

At the Stockholm Hearings, the adequacy and acceptability of the financing
commitment was reviewed in great detail, with the benefit of the testimonies
of Mr Sax and Mr Karpov.

Summarizing Respondents’ arguments, the following points may be short-
listed:

. Claimant was required to provide “the guarantee of obtaining financ-
ing”® which he failed to do;

° the time limit for obtaining the financing was not met: the deadline for
obtaining financing had been established in Section 8.1 (c) and 8.4 of
the Founders’ Agreement and expired on 31 December 1995, and no

agreement is in place according to which an extension had been
granted;

the financial terms proposed by EBRD were commercially unacceptable;

the EBRD moreover only issued a proposal which as such was not a fi-
nancial commitment, nor a guarantee to provide financing;

Claimant never had the power to negotiate on behalf of IAT Pulkovo or
its shareholders, and in any event any and all commitments or agree-
ments would have had to be signed off by both, Mr Demchenko and the
Claimant; the Founders’ Agreement nowhere envisages an authority
given to Claimant to represent any of the shareholders of IAT Pulkovo;

the two documents filed in support of an alleged authority, CX-14 and
CX-15, are incomplete extracts and do not constitute sufficient evi-
dence of an alleged authority;

Claimant should have worked together with the Chairman of the Board,
Mr Boris G. Demchenko, and documents required to be countersigned
by him;

Clalmant even failed to show evidence that he had been appointed
Vice-Chairman of [AT Pulkovo; under Russian law there is no such spe-
cial position within a Board of Directors of a joint stock company such
as a Vice Chairman; Claimant may only have been entitled to act for
IAT Pulkovo if he had been given a power of attorney, and Claimant
himself does not assert that such power of attorney existed;®*

furthermore, under Article 12.7 of the Charter, an approval of the
Board of Directors is required for the execution of any commitment ex-
ceeding US$ 10’000, and Article 11.2 requires an unanimous approval
for the construction budgets or commercial budgets and for the busi-
ness plan;

moreover, the Russian Federal Law on Joint Stock Companies, in Ar-
ticles 78/79, requires a Board approval for large scale transactions, or
approval by the Shareholders’ Meeting; ”°

the EBRD proposal contained a long list of conditions precedent which
EBRD required to be fulfilled;

Respondents had never agreed to unconditionally accept any and all of
the terms of financing which might be proposed by any member, and
Claimant himself recognized this;

the fact that Respondents continued their cooperation with the Clai-
mant, giving him a chance to fulfill his commitment, does not mean
that the Respondents had agreed to renegotiated the terms for obtain-
ing the financing;

in fact, the terms proposed by EBRD could not be approved for com-
mercial reasons, particularly due to significant discrepancies and con-
tradictions between the proposal and the basic terms laid down in the
Founders’ Agreement;

the amount of the loan was increased by a multiple of three in compar-
ison to what was established in the Founders’ Agreement, which meant
that the cost of the Investment Project also increased by a multiple of
threo;

the interest rates were substantially higher than those agreed in 1995
when the cost of the loan had been estimated at 8.5% to 9.5% p.a.,
while EBRD's proposal indicated an interest rate of 13%"'.

It was never envisaged that all assets of IAT Pulkovo and the shares in
IAT Pulkovo owned by the Parties should be pledged in favour of EBRD;
neither the Founders’ Agreement nor the Charter foreshadowed such a
pledging which, however, was required by the EBRD proposal;

. Claimant's comment that EBRD's request regarding the pledge, in the
sense that “it was commercially reasonable", is of no avail;

. the transfer of the management functions in relation to the Interna-
tional Passenger Terminal to Aéroport de Paris had also not been cov-
ered by any provisions in the Founders’ Agreement or by the Charter,
and this is another requirement to which the Russian Parties could nev-
er agree;

. the partial transformation of the pre-development expenses into a loan
has also never been agreed, neither in the Founders’ Agreement nor in
the Charter;

. the proposition that Claimant should be owed a development fee in the
amount of 4.5% of the Terminal's development costs has also never
been agreed;

. the transfer of a 1.5% stock interest in IAT Pulkovo to EBRD on the fi-
nancial closing and a further transfer of a 20% stock interest in LAT
Pulkovo to DMG upon the financial closing were likewise never agreed
and entirely contradicted Section 14.3 of the Founders’ Agreement, and
Mr Karpov in this respect testified: “The Russian Parties did not even
want to hear about redistribution of shares’”*;

. Mr Sax himself admitted that he also considered the requested sur-
render of a 21.5% shareholding as too high, with reference to the
Transcript of 18 October 2011, pages 166/167;

In fact, Respondents maintain, “Claimant has not proved that any agree-
ments in relation to main terms of construction and financing of the Invest-
ment Project were reached between alf parties, including the Respondents,
and EBRD, DMG.” *

In particular, as Mr Karpov explained in his witness statement, the requested
transfers of shares in IAT Pulkovo to the financial institutions was a deal-
breaker (a “stumbling block”), since the Russian Parties would loose the con-
trolling majority. These terms were incompatible with basic terms of the
Founders’ Agreement, as laid down in Section 14.3 of the Founders’ Agree-
ment, and moreover “commercially unreasonable”. 7°

Respondents further noted that in August 1998 the EBRD's proposal had "ex~
pired without a mutual agreement of the participants of the Investment
Project and the proposed terms of financing” “ and hence, the Investment
Project

"9 any case was factually terminated at the end of 1998 - first
half of 1999."

Respondents conclude as follows:

"Bearing all of the aforesaid in mind, it should be noted that the Claimant has
not fulfilled its main and sale function under the Founders' Agreement and in
the whole Investment Project; Obtaining of financing. Furthermore, cvery-
thing the Claimant managed to obtain from the financial institution, he ob-
tained with an enormous delay which was in material contradiction with the
Founders’ Agreement, and actually ruined the Project." 77

In their PH-Brief of 20 January 2012, Respondents once again addressed the
issue on pages 21ss, and in detail argued the non-acceptability of the financ-
ing proposal in paras. 147 to 188, concluding that ~ due to Claimant's failure
to obtain and present an acceptable financing - Respondents were freed
from their obligations under the Founders’ Agreement.’”*

The Tribunal's Observations and Assessment
{a) Brief References to the Hearings

Claimant acknowledged that the Russian Parties were free to reject or accept
any financing commitment, and were free to allow any offer to lapse; howev-
er, they were not free to pursue the development of an international passen-
ger terminal at Pulkovo Airport without PSP’s participation, unless they first
withdraw from IAT Pulkovo in accordance with the terms of Section 8.4 of the
Founders’ Agreement.

At the Stockholm Hearings, Claimant explained from his side

“why Pulkovo did not close in 1998 .... I blame only two people: Na. the
then Governor of the City of St, Petersburg, Vladimir Yakovlev who, quite
candidly, for his persona! reasons wanted to usurp the Americans’ position for
his own personal reasons, and no.2, Governor Valentina Matvienko who
Wanted at the time Deripaska’s company ... to, again, roplace the Americans
as the developer of Pulkovo-2”,"*

Regarding the expiry of the 31 December 1995 deadline, Mr Sax acknowl-
edged that it took “a /ot fonger to deliver the financing commitment than we
thought", but stressing that the Russians from time to time extended the
deadline, and were kept abreast of the financing.”

437 Regarding discrepancies between the Founders’ Agreement and the EBRD
offered terms, Mr Sax denied these, explaining in detail the commercial rea-
sonableness of the terms offered by EBRD.*? Mr Wong replied:

"Mr Wong: You have a rationale to it and you say It’s commercially reasona-
ble, but 1 think what I say Is that it was not unreasonable for my clients to
look at what was in front of them and think: Wow, this Is different. We are
talking three times the money, We are talking a reduction in our shareholding
and other matters as well. I would invite you to accept that, putting you in
the shoes of my client, it is not unreasonable for them to look at what you
proposed and think: This is way off from what we expected, and it was not
unreasonable for my clients to say: Look, we can't accept this."

Mr Sax: I think it was, quite candidly, unreasonable, and I think if your
clients did not accept it, they had bad advice -- and T'll tell you why; it's very
simple. EBRD and BAG were two of the premiere financial institutions in the
world in Russia at that time. Forget Carl, Carl is nobody, PSP is nobody, SP is
nobody, but DMG and EBRD are somebody ... (omissis). They were getting 4
completed Terminal without putting out any money. They were getting a sub-
stantial cash-flow. They were getting the first PPP as a project like this in
Russia and/or the world, And what happened? Okay, they decided not to do
it. And if they would have dona it, they wouldn't have to wait 15 years or 13
year for the next project,""*

438 Further in the examination, Mr Wong drew the attention to Section 14.3 of
the Founders’ Agreement, requiring any modifications to be signed off by
each of the Founders. Mr Sax’s answer to this was that it had been intended
that all of the project documents and financing documents would be executed
upon Closing, including a new Founders' Agreement, since the

"EBRD's caunsel wanted some ridiculous defect cured by incorporating a new
company and signing a new Founders’ Agreement .... But the bottom linc is
that the intervening event, the financial crisis and the delays caused by the
Russians, prohibited those changes.” **

439 = Mr Wong then continued:

“Mr Wong: Our position very simply is that our clients had full right not to
agree to proceed with the EBRD proposal.

Mr Sax: I agree."

440 At the Hearing, the discussion on the EBRD offer extended over Transcript
pages 144 to 183, essentially with Mr Sax maintaining that the EBRD offer
was commercially reasonable, while Respondents’ counsel maintained that it
was far away from the parameters agreed in the Founders' Agreement.

(b) Two General Remarks

441 First, Claimant Mr Sax stated eloquently, at the Stockholm Hearings, that the
commitment offered by EBRD should have been accepted by Respondents,
and - with his charisma and enthusiasm - figured out the very significant
benefits every party could have derived through an implementation of the
Project, even though the amount of the loan was significantly higher than in-
itially contemplated, and despite the required cut in the Russian Parties’ par-
ticipation and other requirements of the EBRD. By today, 2011, he said, the
entire loan would have been amortized,

442 Perhaps, the Tribunal may remark, Mr Sax was right; perhaps this is the typ-
ical American entrepreneurial approach which looks far ahead and, with crea-
tivity, alms to overcome obstacles, tries to evaluate the chances and - faced
with difficulties - reflects on the questions: “what are our options...?”, rather
than to get stuck in doubts, hesitations and concerns, driven by a mind-
pattern where the reaction “we cant, we are afraid that ....” prevails the
thinking and decision making.

443 However, it is very clear that only a common denominator of the mind-sets
would provide a basis for the PPP (which indeed - as it was described - was
the first Russian PPP), Such common basic mind-set was not there, and could
not be reached. And, realistically, the Tribunal concludes after intensive

study of ali the parameters, that Claimant Mr Sax should have taken this as-
ee

pect and risk inte calculation when launching and pursuing this project
Second, there is one additional aspect which, in the Tribunal’s view, needs to
be mentioned: A PPP - like any project with a partnership character - re-
quires openness and transparency, and arrangements without a prior discus~
sion and mutual consensus rarely succeed.

The Foreign Parties, however, played their cards very close to their chests,
essentially pursuing their own agenda, without an open/transparent commu-
nication, neither as to the incurring of pre-development costs, nor as to the
appointment of consultants, nor as to the charging of Mr Sax’ salary and of-
fice expenditures, nor as to their intention to seek a partial reimbursement of
their disbursements via the EBRD financing, nor - after 1998 - as to their
intention to claim a full reimbursement of their expenditures should the
Project not be pursued.

It is difficult to see how, under such parameters, mutual trust could be built
up which, after all, is probably the single most important factor for a success-
ful PPP.

The above two aspects, as will be seen in the following discussions, may ac-
count for the failure of the Project.

(c) Assessments

 

Risk, it may be noted specifically, is recognized as being one of the fundamental aspects of
any entrepreneurial activity under Russian law (Article 2.1 Russian CC). A level of uncer-
tainty is, higher in an in like the Russian econ-
omy had been at the time in the 1990s, and in fact still is. Risk not only means the posi-
tive side of gaining profits, but also includes the negative side of suffering losses, particu-
larly in @ pioneering project, Mitigation of risks may require specific efforts, and in par-
ticular constant and active coordination of all activities among the parties.

With the above introduction, the Tribunal now turns to the “acceptability” of
the offered EBRD-commitment,

Claimant's repeated statements and affirmations defending the EBRD pro-
posal, by emphasizing that all of the terms of the EBRD proposal were
"commercially reasonable”, is not the decisive criterium; indeed, the Tribunal
may remark, most probably they were reasonable, from the EBRD's point of
view; but this is not the real issue.

The (only) real issue is whether these terms were within - or outside of -
the agreed parameters of the Parties to the [Investment Contract,

On the latter/decisive issue, the Tribunal’s conclusions are clear:

. Under any standards of review, and irrespective of the particular par-
ties in question, a comparison of {i) what was discussed as the basic
parameters for the financing to be sought according to the Protocol of
Agreement and the Founders’ Agreement on the one hand, and (ii) the
commitment as offered by EBRD an the other hand, shows that the of-
fered commitment was significantly different from the agreed parame-
ters, indeed well outside of the parameters on which the Parties in-
tended to build the PPP.

. And the above, even more so, must to be concluded having regard to
the Russian Parties to the PPP, who — certainly at that time in the
1990s - approached such novel investments with less entrepreneurial
flexibility and optimism than perhaps other parties, for reasons which
everyone may very well understand, and arguably inter alia for the
reason of a probably rather cumbersome public administration; no
doubt, this aspect has to be respected; and it must have been known
to Mr Sax at all times.

What are the most problematic changes?

° Problematic is the significantly indicated increased amount of the
proposed loan, by a factor of more than two, or even three as alleged
by Respondents,

. Problematic are the high interest rates (although, the Tribunal recog-
nizes, interest rates were particularly high at the relevant time),

. Problematic, or even more than that, is the significant cutting of the
Russian majority percentage, a provision which stands in direct con-
tradiction to a particular “condition” as per Article XIV —- OTHER CON-
DITIONS of the Founders’ Agreement, reflected in Section 14.3, which
excluded specifically any alteration “to the relative percentage interests
in the capitat stock of the Company among the Founders”, and moreo-
ver requiring (in the next following sentence of the text in Section
14.3) that any amendments require "a written instrument signed by
each of the Founders",

. Problematic, and certainly an aspect raising additional concern, is the
requirement to pledge the shares in IAT Pulkova,

e Particularly problematic is the shifting of the management func-
tions to a Non-Russian provider (Aéroports de Paris), as something the
Russian Parties at that time did not want to give out of their own hands
and control, and

. Problematic is the fact that the EBRD did not issue a financing com-
mitment, but simply made a proposal for the envisaged financing.

And - without singling out a particular discrepancy/change — but instead
looking at the ensembie of al| deviations from what had been contem-
plated in the Investment Contract, no further detailed analysis is required to
conclude that an acceptance by the Russian Parties could neither be antic-
ipated, nor could it reasonably be expected by the Claimant.

In addition to all of the foregoing problematic aspects:

A probably particularly disturbing element, on top of everything said above,
might have been the burdening of the EBRD financing proposal with some of
the pre-development expenditures, - a matter which may have raised
serious concerns, as no advance indication (or “advance warning") what-
soever seems to have been given that such a charge would be made (at least
none of these were made known in the present arbitral proceedings). Absent
an open prior discussion and consent, it is hardly imaginable that the Russian
Parties could reasonably be expected to agree with such a charging of the
proposed EBRD loan - and indeed they did not.

(4) Summing up the Tribunal's View:

Under the Protocol of Agreement, the Foreign Parties intended to undertake a
clear contractual commitment, expressed by the language in title 2 "Financ-
ing" in the sense that the Foreign Partners

“shall secure financing for 100% of the cost to construct the complex which is
anticipated to be approx. US$ 75 million from the European Bank of Recon-
struction and Development (EBRD) and from its own participants, and shall
guarantee repayment to the EBRD. The complex shall repay the Financing
from operational revenues. The Financing shall be collateralized by the as-
signment of usage fee .."

The wording of this contractual undertaking, particularly by using the defini-
tive terms "shalf secure" and “shall quarantee repayment" and “shall be col-
fateralized by the assignment of usage fee” make it clear that the Foreign
Partners entered into a commitment, which was not only based on deploying
best-efforts,

Section 8.1 of the Founders’ Agreement is more cautiously worded;

“The Foreign Parties shall be responsible for the following: (a) to use
all necessary efforts to secure US$ 60 million in debt financing ..., and
{b) if the debt financing can be obtained, to provide at loast US$ 15

million in subordinated debt financing towards the development and
construction of the Terminal.”

Considering all of the factual and legal arguments presented by the Parties in
the framework of this Arbitration, the Tribunal has reached a clear decision
that the Foreign Parties, respectively Claimant, failed to live up to the terms
of the Protecal of Agreement, and entirely missed the targets as per Section
8,1 of the Founders’ Agreement.

While the Tribunal has noted to what the extent the Foreign Parties and
Claimant tried - with the assistance of several advisors and by putting to-
gether an impressing documentation - to obtain a financing commitment,
the result of these efforts, however, only resulted in a suggested financing
proposal which significantly deviated from the parameters initially agreed
upon between the Foreign Parties and the Russian Parties, and therefore was
not given suite by the Russian Parties.

The facts of the case, therefore, are clear in the sense that the first hurdle in
realizing the Project, i.e. the obtaining of a financing commitment, could not
be taken, which made the Project a "still-born child".

Hence, when reviewing and taking together all of the above enumerated
"flaws" and changes envisaged by the EBRD’s proposal“ as compared to
what the Parties had initially contemplated, there cannot be the slightest
doubt that the primary obligation, incumbent on the Foreign Parties and/or
Claimant Mr Sax, had not been met, and Claimant - correctly so - explicit-
ly acknowledged that the Russian Parties were in all respects free to discard
the EBRD proposal, or to let it lapse.

In short, the conclusions herein drawn can be summarized as follows:

. The Foreign Parties/Claimant failed to fulfill their contractual undertak-
ings/promises;

86 It may be noted that the EBRD only presented a proposal, which as such was still quite far
away from a financing offer, financing commitment or financing guarantee.

. hence failed in achieving and fulfilling their primary obligation to secure
financing for the launch of the Project;

. and - considering the discrepancy - the Foreign Parties/Claimant
could not have expected the Russian Parties to go forward on the basis
of the EBRD proposal.

Short answers to the initial Questions raised under Issue 1;
Q1: the answer is YES, there was a significant discrepancy.

Q2: None of those elements of tha financing proposal were covered by the
mutual agreement of the Parties evidenced by the Protocol of Agreement and
the Founders' Agreement,

Q 3: The answer is that the Foreign Parties did not accomplish what they
had undertaken to procure as their primary obligation.

Q 4: On the question (i) whether the EBRD financing proposal should have
been considered as acceptable by the Russian Parties (having regard to the
matrix provided for in the Protocol of Agreement and the Founders’ Agree-
ment), and (ii) on the related question whether Claimant, under a standard
of average reasonableness and good faith, could have expected the Russian
Parties to accept the EBRD proposal, the Tribunal can only answer with a
“no™,

Hence, the Russian Parties were entirely free not to take the proposal any
further, and Claimant has explicitly acknowledged that,

further: Could the Foreign Partics continue ta claim to be part of the In-

Claimant's Position

It is Claimant's view that, even if the EBRD proposal for good reason had to
be considered unacceptable, the Russian Parties remained committed unless
they properly withdrew in accordance with Section 8.4 of the Founders’
Agreement which, however, they did not.

According to Claimant, there is no provision in Russian corporate law for a
party to invoke the exceptio non (rite) adimpleti contractus; Article 328 of
the Russian Civil Code does not provide a basis for such withdrawal.

Even if the Russian Parties would have had to find another financier, they
were - in Claimant's view ~- still bound to recognize the Foreign Parties as
partners to the project with a 29.7% equity share and profit share, and all
provisions of the Founders’ Agreement remained fully in force and binding,
and moreover contained a specific framework of ongoing future obligations
as set forth in Section 8.5,

In any event, Respondents did not have the right to repudiate the Invest-
ment Contract, or to tacitly terminate it.

Only on 2 October 2007 did Claimant realize that the City of St. Petersburg
intended to develop the NIPT without the participation of Claimant and/or
PSP, It is, therefore, incorrect to argue that the Founders’ Agreement had
terminated already in the first half of 1999 (as this had been discussed by
Professor Belov).

Mr Karpov's letter of 16 April 2003 (CX-69} fully confirms that PSP had satis-
fied its primary obligation, that the Russian Parties no longer had the right to
withdraw from [AT Pulkovo and that the only way was to obtain consent of all
stockholders to dissolve IATP. The letter also suggests that the Russian Par-
ties Intended to honor the terms of the Founders’ Agreement and the Charter

and confirms that Claimant had been making regular lease payments on be-
half of IAT Pulkovo.*?

Respondents’ Position
Respondents denied the acceptability of the offered financing proposal.

Among further arguments, Respondents also invoked that the Investment
Contract did not impose binding obligations on them. ®*

Respondents’ view is that - due to the delay in Claimant's performance and
the unacceptability of the EBRD proposal - they were

° (i) relieved from any and all obligations which would become incum-
bent on them, based on the concept reflected in Articde 328.2 of the
Russian CC, and

. (il) they correctly terminated the Contract by a unilateral repudiation to
which they were entitled (without a necessity to comply with the re-
quirement of a written withdrawal as per Section 8.4 of the Founders’
Agreement),®° and

. (iii) as a consequence, the Foreign Parties could no longer claim per-
formance from the Russian Parties, or remain as parties to the Invest-
ment Contract.

Moreover, Respondents became entitled to claim damages for the costs in-
curred and losses suffered due to Claimant's failure to perform his obligations
in obtaining the financing for the Project. And in any event, the Founders’
Agreement was terminated in accordance with Section 8.4 thereof.*"

478 Relating to Question 8, Respondents maintain that the Founders’ Agreement
does not contain any provision to the effect that the Investment Project's
realization should be continued even absent the financing which had to be
secured by the Foreign Parties/Claimant.

479 Respondents moreover state that, after 28 August 1998, Respondents had
terminated all cooperation with the Claimant until the middle of 1999 which
fact, as such, evidences Respondents' intention to repudiate the Investment
Contract. The loss of interest to pursue the Project {s also evidenced by Mr
Karpov's letter known as CX-69.

480 Respondents’ loss of interest to further pursue the Project should have been
realized by Claimant after August 1998, as he also should have realized It in
the year 2000 when Claimant mentioned the pre-development expenditures
allegedly incurred, and on 17 December 2002 when, in the framework of the
Purchase Agreement, he sought to acquire “the right to damages {i.e. fost
profits) for breach of the Founders' Agreement and Charter; the right to re-
ceive the developer's fee contemplated in, inter alia, Section 8.3 (c) of the
Founders' Agreement, and the right to receive the approximately $ 20 million
Receivable ptus interest", which provisions make it clear that Claimant had
recognized the failure of the Investment Project’', and thus intended to ob-
tain assignment for claiming damages.

481 The effect of Mr Karpov’s letter of 16 April 2003 (CX-69) was to provide writ-
ten notice of withdrawals from IAT Pulkovo by the three shareholders and to
notify Claimant of the intention to terminate the participation in the Invest-
ment Project.

important aspect became clear; namely the aspect that the Foreign Par-
ties'/Claimant's promise and obligation to make available a viable financing
commitment was not only their primary obligation but in fact, literally said,
the key for the [nvestment Project and, indeed, for any subsequent steps to-
wards the further implementation of the Project (as partly foreshadowed in
the Founders’ Agreement).

The "key", however, was not provided, and the Tribunal has stated its view
that the Foreign Parties/Claimant were unable to honor their commitment
and promises. All of this became clear in the second half of 1998, and the
situation remained un-rescued in 1999 and beyond.

What is the consequence of the above for the contractual relationship be-
tween the Russian Parties and the foreign Investors? - The only correct
straightforward answer is to conclude that the very foundations on which the
Investment Project was premised and intended to be built, were not pro-
vided.

No single argument was advanced in the framework of this Arbitration in the
sense, for instance, that the Russian Parties had intended to have the For-
eign Parties on board of such a project, and to grant them a 29.7% share in
the future operational profits, even absent their expected contribution, i.e.
absent their providing the very "key" for the Project in terms of an accepta-
ble financing commitment. Nothing suggests that the Russian Parties had in-
tended to give away 29.7% of IAT Pulkovo's share “for nothing", |.@. as a
gift.

The providing of an acceptable financing commitment, therefore, was a ne-
cessary guid pro quo for the Foreign Parties to remain part of the Project. Or,
for using an expression several times used by Claiment Mr Sax in the Hear-
ings, but used by him in a different context: “Yt could not be a gift!". In the
present case, the continued shareholding of the Foreign Parties in IAT Pulko-
vo and their right to insist on further implementation of the Project would

have had to be earned first, by providing an acceptable financing commit-
ment - and it was not.

Conversely, from Claimant Mr Sax’ perspective, nothing suggests that he or
his predecessors (the Foreign Parties) could legitimately expect to gain the
fruits of a 29.7% shareholding in - what they expected to become - a
highly profitable project, without them having secured the financing accord-
ing to the terms of the Protocol of Agreement and the Founders' Agreement
and the Charter. For good reasons, Claimant did not allege that he or the
Foreign Parties were in any event entitled to derive the fruits of a profitable
Project even if, for instance, the Project ultimately became financed by public
resources of the Russian government, the Russian taxpayers, or by Russian
banks, or by a totally different bank consortium which the Russian Parties
themselves were able to line up.

The inter-relatedness of Claimant's obligation to come up with an acceptable
financing commitment on the one side, and the further tasks incumbent on
the Russian Parties (as per Section 8.3 of the Founders’ Agreement) on the
other side, was that of a reciprocal commitments, depending on each other,
therefore falling under Article 328,1 of the Russian CC.

All of the above not only intuitively appears to be simple, clear and
straightforward: It is also covered by deeply rooted legal notions commonly
known in civil law and stemming from the Roman-law-based notions of ex-
ceptio non (rite) adimpleti contractus.

The exceptio- principle is reflected in Article 328.2 of the Russian Civil Code
which reads as follows:

Article 328.2 Russian CC:

“In case of failure of the obliged party to make performance of the obligations
provided by agreement or the presence of other circumstances obviously indi-
cating that such performance will not be made within the established time-
period, the party upon whom the reciprocal performance lles has the right to
suspend performance of its obligation or to repudiate performance of this obli-
gation and to demand compensation for losses."

While the above stated English translation certainly does not sound very ele-
gant, its meaning and effect, nevertheless, are clear.

While already the contractual provision in Section 8.4 of the Founders’
Agreement provided that, if

"responsibilities are not satisfied and/or the commitments for the fi-
nancing for the Terminal have not been received prior to December
31, 1995" the Founders shall have the right to withdraw from the
Company "by delivering a written notice of such withdrawal to the
other Founders", whereupon "the Company shall be deemed as
invalid, and shall be liquidated in accordance with the effective legis-
lation, and each Founder which funded the establishment of the Com-
pany and implementation of the provisions of Article VIIT and incurred
damages hereunder shall accept these damages as its own, and shall

not transfer responsibility for them to other Founders",

the statutory provision Article 328.2 of the Russian Civil Code, quite in the
same sense, provide that - even absent a consent by the Foreign Parties -
the non-fulfillment of their primary obligation entitled the Russian Parties in
their sole discretion to withhold their further performance; and the further
provision in Article 405.2 of the Russian CC in any event allowed the Russian
Parties to repudiate any further steps under the Investment Contract due to
a loss of interest caused by Claimant's delay in providing the financing com-

mitment.°?

Once again this provision appears to be clear on its face and requires no fur-

ther legal interpretation.

. considering the financial crisis which hit most of the world's economies
in summer/beginning of Autumn 1998, and which also affected Russia
(as this was particularly underligned by Claimant), and which may well
have set back the NITP Project on the priority list of the Russian Par-
ties, and

. considering moreover that the Foreign Parties/Claimant were unable,
during the time-period granted to them and kept open until 1998, to
come up with a financing commitment which was compatible with the
cornerstones laid down by the Parties,

the Tribunal is bound to conclude that towards the end of 1998 or early 1999
in the latest the Foreign Parties/Claimant lost their chance which had been
given to them lo earn and maintain their 29.7% investor status regarding
IAT Pulkovo.

After 1998/early 1999, it is therefore the Tribunal's view that the Project was
not only still-born, but that moreover the momentum had been lost entirely
and that, without an explicit new agreement, the Russian Parties were no
longer bound to cooperate towards the implementation of the Project. Absent
such new or renewed cooperation, the Foreign Parties’ investor-status could
not be re-vitalized or kept alive.

It is undisputed that Claimant, after 1998, tried to rescue the project and to
put it on a different ground, with a "re-programming" of the Terminal.” The
Tribunal, at the Hearing, remarked that many “very sophisticated con-
tracts®® were drafted in 1998 to 2001, but noted that not one single contract
was finalized and signed by any of the Russian Parties,

In response, Mr Sax only referred to some letters, such as CX-53, but ac-
knowledged that no contracts were signed.”*

The Tribunal, in this context, mentioned the requirement, under Russian law,
that agreements between companies must be in writing (with references to
Articles 161 and 432.2 Russian CC), and Professor Skvortsov added that, ac-
cording to a proposed special law related to foreign economic activities,
transactions which are not recorded in writing are declared void.*” Mr Glady-
shev commented that signatures do not need to appear on the same docu-
ment, and exchanges of letters may satisfy the in-writing-requirement; how-
ever, Mr Gladyshev did not refer to any document or letter which could evi-
dence a legally recognizable commitment of the Russian Parties, and not only
a polite acknowledgement.

Hence, fact is that - in the present case - we do not have any signatures on
file evidencing any kind of contractual agreement to any of the Foreign Par-
ties further proposals, whether on the same document nor indeed on any
other document.” Nor is there any evidence on file that the Foreign Parties
were ever mandated to come up with such further proposals and/or drafts.

Tellingly, the draft contracts filed by Claimant were never discussed as such
with Respondents, let alone that they ever had been agreed, And none of the
several letters which Claimant submitted in these proceedings and had been
addressed to some officials of the Russian Parties received any meaningful
response apart from a polite answer.

The fact, therefore, remains that the project as such became stale, despite
the efforts undertaken by Mr Sax to keep it on track and te revitalize by
putting it on a new or renewed basis.

Moreover, it Is also plain that the Russian Parties were under no contractual
obligation to pursue the Project at all, let alone on terms proposed by the
Foreign Parties/Claimant; nothing suggests that the Foreign Parties/Claimant
had to be given a “second chance",

At the Hearings, there were discussions regarding the letter in CX-52 te 54 (Transcript

To conclude: All the further endeavors which the Foreign Parties and/or

Q8; The answer it that the Investment Contract contained no further
binding provisions regarding the implementation of the Project; regarding |i-

quidation, see below.

quirement for a particular repudiation,

SPH and/or Claimant went to very considerable expense for the planning of
the NIPT, lined up consultants, prepared numerous documents, for which
Claimant now seeks reimbursement - and Mr Rowson stated in para 26
that he was advised that the expenditures “are reimbursable under various
agreements prepared by the Parties ..”.

What is the documentary basis for this statement, in Claimant's view?

In 1995 and beyond: was it discussed among the shareholders that such
expenditures would be Incurred for and on behalf of IAT Pulkovo (or its
shareholders), and not only on behalf of the Foreign Parties or Mr Sax per-
sonally?

And if this was discussed: Was there ever an agreement - at the lime
when entering into the Founders’ Agreement ("FA"), or any time thereafter
- that these costs are reimbursable to the Foreign Parties/Claimant, cither
through IAT Pulkovo or otherwise thraugh the other Founders?

How do we have to understand that the Forcign Parties agreed to FA 6.3,
on the face of that provision waiving costs before ontering into the FA,
when on the other hand ~ as per Mr Rowson’s report - already prior to
December 1994 very significant costs exceeding US$ 3,3 million seem to
have been incurred which, despite the terms of FA 6.3, are now claimed as
part of Claimant's pre-development advance claim?

Following up from Q 14 above: In the framework of negotiations leading
the conclusion of the FA, did the Foreign Partics and/or Claimant indicate
the fact (and magnitude) of the expenditures already incurred and likely or
expected to be incurred in the time to come, particularly in connection with
the securing of a financing commitment?

More particularly, after the conclusion af the FA, and during the further
"life" under the FA and as shareholders in LAT Pulkovo:

Was the nature and magnitude of further spending during 1995 to 1998

ever discussed with the Russian Parties and the Board of IAT Pulkovo, and

was it approved?

For instance, were all Parties te the FA and sharcholders of IAT Pulkovo,

and JAT Pulkovo itself as the corporate entity, made aware of the charging

(or ultimately intended charging) by the Foreign Parties/Claimant) far the

following costs and expenditures incurred by the Forcign Parties:

(i) the charging of several millions for consultants,

ii) the charging of advisory costs paid or to be paid to OMG, OPIC, Un-
ipart Capital and MIGA of US$ 1.5 million

(iil) the charging of approx. US$ 2 million for salaries to employees of
Sax (Holdings) Limited,

(iv) the charging of the salary for Mr Carl A Sax of over US$ 1 million,

(v) the charging for Claimant's and STV's office overheads,

(vi) the charging of US$ 1 million for design and engineering, and

{vii} the charging of over US$ 4 million for “transfer agreements", for
transferring interests of individual shareholders to Strategic Part-
ners.

if not: why was this not disclosed, discussed upfront, with the view to-

wards seeking an agreement how to deal with such costs?

In the framework of the liability decision to be made by the Tribunal: how

should the Tribunal decide fiability and recoverability in principle for any

one/each one of the items as per Q 19 {i} to {vii} now claimed in this arbi-

tration?

When incurring those pre-development expenses! Could the Foreign Par-

ties or Sax act on behalf of IAT Putkovo, and bind IAT Pulkovo thereby, as

Claimant asserts?

Did Mr Sax have 4 proper corporate authority to act for IAT Pulkovo, or a

mandate ?

Or could Mr Sax only act on behalf of the Foreign Partics respectively him

self, absent the required unanimous decision under FA Chapter 12.7, as

this was argued by Respondents?

In this context: Was Mr Sax ever correctly appointed as Vice President of

TAT Pulkovo, and registered as such, as he claims, and as this had been fo-

reseen in FA 13.3?

. Tf not: why not?

25 How did the Foreign Parties and/or Mr Sax commercially assess their con-
tinued spending under the perspectives of the - as it scerns - relatively
casy exit cause according to FA 8.4?

26 Is FA 8.4 applicable in our context, as Respondents’ maintain, or inapplica-
ble, as Claimant maintains?

27 If there had been no agreement that these pre-development casts should
ultimately be borne by IAT Pulkovo or Respondents, on what basis could
those costs find their way into the EBRD financing offer, as part of the
loan?

And on what basis could the Foreign Parties expect that this will be accept-
able to the Russian Parties?
Has this been discussed, agreed?

Claimant's Position

It is evident from the file that the Foreign Parties and/or Mr Sax personally
incurred expenditures in connection with their task to provide a financing
commitment, and it is also obvious that those expenses added up to hun-
dred-thousands of US Dollars, possibly even beyond the mark of US Dollars
one Million, The exact magnitude, however, did not have to be established so
far, and on the basis of this Award will not have to be established, for the
reasons explained below.

Suffice it to note that Claimant filed an Expert Report by ASA Alan Stratford
& Associates, prepared by Peter Forbes and Ian Rowson, of the pre-
development expenditures incurred by the Foreign Parties/Claimant (labeled
as an “Advance Claim"), together with a valuation of two additional monetary
claims (to be discussed/reviewed further below in this Award) |.e. (i) for a
4.5% developer fee and (ii) for the monetary value of the 29.7% equity
stake in the Project Company.

Their reports provide for the following valuations of Claimant’s claims:

. the Pre-Development Advance Claim: depending on the interest rate,
the claim was valued US$ 146'400'000.—on a compounded interest ba-
sis, applying the contractual interest rate of 15.5% p.a.,

» the Development Fee claim of 4.5% on the investment costs (esti-
mated at US$ 418'200'000); the claimable amount was assessed at
US§ 18'800'G00, and

* the 29.7% share, the valuation was indicated with figures of between
US$ 180'100'000 and USS 294'500'000.

Regarding the Pre-Development Advance Claim, Mr Rowson states in para,
26;

"Il am advised by counsel to Claimant that expenditures incurred by SP prior
to the date on which the Loan agreement between EBRD and IAT Pulkovo and
the Subordinated Loan agreement were to be executed and delivered are
reimbursable under various agreements prepared by the parties and the
EBRD in accordance with the parties agreement and instructions.” {emphasis
added)

Mr Rowson’‘s statement, however, remained entirely unsupported by the evt-
dence,

In all the numerous written submissions as well as during the oral examina-
tions, Claimant Mr Sax argued that these expenditures were properly in-
curred for carrying out the task for obtaining the financing commitment, and
are fully recoverable from Respondents. - However, Claimant did not/could
not refer to any particular contractual provision backing up his statement.

Respondents’ Position

Respondents reject all of Claimant’s allegations and, in 1-RM-32/2-RM-38
paras. 209-260, for instance commented on the hypothetical situation (i)
that the Investment Project was not realized in 1998 due to shortcomings of
Respondents and (ii) that neither the Investment Project nor the Founders!

Agreement had been terminated, maintaining that, even in such a hypotheti-
cal situation, the Respondents would not be liable vis-a-vis Claimant.

In support of their conclusion, Respondents stress that neither the Founders’
Agreement nor the Charter envisages any liability of the Parties for defraying
another Party's expenses, and that there is no provision stipulating any liabil-
ity of Respondents to Claimant for not accepting the EBRD financing propos-
al, or indeed any financing proposal, or for not proceeding to a financial clos-
ing.

In this context, Respondents - throughout all of their submissions -
stressed that Claimant had no authority to represent them in any transac-
tions or relations with third parties, and they had never authorized the Clai-
mant to incur any expenses on their behalf, nor ta assume any obligations on
their behalf.”° The costs incurred and the losses arising from the failure of
the Investment Project, therefore, have to be borne by Claimant himself.

Russian law and Russian court practice require a claimant to prove the viola-
tion of a right, the losses and their amount, and the cause-and-effect con-
nection between the violation of the right and the losses suffered.’ Claimant
has not even attempted to substantiate or prove an entitlement to damages.

Moreover, Respondents stress that their liability vis-a-vis Claimant was ex-
pressly excluded by the Founders’ Agreement, Section 8.4, which specifically
provided that “each Founder which founded the establishment of the Compa-
ny and implementation of the provisions of Chapter VII and incurred dam-
ages hereunder, shai! accept these damages as its own and shall not transfer
responsibility for them to other Founders." 4

Mr Karpov's witness statement, para. 27, confirms that Section 8.4 correctly
expresses what the Parties had bargained for: “The /dea of Section 8.4 was

to say that if the Investment Project was not successful, then each party
would risk only those expenses which it had incurred."

525 Respondents emphasize further that the Russian shareholders never agreed
. to pay damages, or
. reimburse expenditures to any of the participants,
. nor had they ever agreed to be liable for any loss of profits,

. nor even did they ever contractually commit themselves to appoint the
Foreign Parties or Claimant as a development manager or construction
manager for the NIPT,

. let alone to pay him a fee of 4.5% of the cost of the development of
the Terminal.

III The Tribunal's Assessment and Decision
(a) The Alleged Pre-Development Expenditures’ Claim

526 As far as necessary within the liability phase of these proceedings, the Tri-
bunal looked into the entire documentation provided by Claimant in support
of his "Pre-development Advance Claim", submitted for a total nominal
amount of US$ 19'772'277.--, calculated - together with simple respectively
compound interest — in a total amount of US$ 37'185'672.—, respectively
US$ 146°353'668.--,

527 Regarding the various cost items of the Pre-Development Advance Claim, the
Tribunal notes that these include

M2 CM-66 para 120. The further calculations in the Rowson Report evidence pre-development
expenditures as of 30 December 1998 in the adjusted amount of US$ 19'765'315; see
CWS-9, Rowson Report para. 100. The difference Is, however, irrelevant.

. significant costs incurred by SPS for consultants,
. costs incurred for financial institutions,

. costs for annual salaries of Mr Carl A Sax (at US$ 350'000 p.a.) and Mr
Michael Santoro (at US$ 175'000 p.a.),

. costs of Sax (Holdings) Ltd, and STV International Inc.,
e office costs,
* design and engineering costs.

Furthermore, the Pre-Development Advance Claim comprises

. expenses referred to in transfer agreements for expenses incurred by
Mr Sax (US$ 1°391'666),

. Mr Sax legal fee of US$ 250'000,
. Mr Sax' financial service fee of US$ 280°000, and
. charges of other service providers totaling approximately USS 4 Mio.

Considering these expenses, the Tribunal noted the total absence of any con-

temporaneous document, originating from the years 1994 onwards, which fo-

reshadowed or discussed the incurring of such expenses and their recov-
103

ery.

(b) References to the Examination at the Stockholm Hearing
At the Stockholm Hearing, the following question was put to Mr Sax:

“The_Chairman: ... Now here, in our scenario, | am decply troubled by the
huge amount of expenditures you incurred, Mr Sax or Strategic Partners, for

*©3 The only answer which the Tribunal can give to itself is that, normally, in BOT Projects or

BOOT Projects and PPPs, the upfront expenditures incurred by each one of the parties for

the project's development, construction and start-up typically will only be recoverable

after realizing the project, thraugh future revenues during the concession period or con-

tract term.

this project, and neither in the Protocol Agreement nor in the Founders’
Agreement do I sce a basis for compensation up front for payment of Lhese
expenditures.” 1”

531 Mr Sax essentially answered;

“Mr Sax: Let me say this, Did we know that we were going to have to spend
@ lot of money? Yes. Am I going to say that anyone at the time understood
that it was going to be $ 20 million? No - including Cari. But everyone knew
it was going to be such amount as might be required by the financiers to be
able to reach Financial Closing. Did we try and negotiate all of the various
fees, agreements, with all of the consultants, lawyers, and everyone else to
the lowest amount possible? You bet. Why? Because we were paying.” #°°

532 Further in the examination, the Tribunal asked as follows:

“Chairman: Would you go so far as to say that the Russian Parties were there
and agreed that in the end the expenditures Strategic Partners and yourself
incurred will be charged to the loan, will be incorporated in the loan, and re-
payable thereby by the parties and essentially also picked up by the Russian
Parties? Did you discuss that?” 1%

§33 Claimant's answer was a “yes” that the pre-development expenses would be
reimbursed, and moreover reference was made by Mr Sax to the letter of
“one of the Vice-Mayors of the City of St. Petersburg", written in 2000,

534 In the further examination, the following dialogue ensued:

“Mr Sax; What is relevant is that as a practical matter everybody knew eve-
rything, And I am not going to say that in 1995 there was a signed agrea-
ment which I cannot put my hands on that said the Russians are going to
agree to reimburse us § 20 million out of loan proceeds, and I can't say it for
two reasons. Reason number onc is in 1995 nobody knew, including Carl,
that it was going to cost us $ 20 million. We were laying out all expenses that
were required from time to time, whatever that amount would be. Number

two, we were operating on the same basis that the EBRD operates, which is:
you reach an agreament; you then negotiate all the various terms and condi-
tions of the various agreements {which everybody did); and then you have
Financial Closing and at Financial Closing everybody everything is memoria-
lised in writing. And everything would have been memorialized in writing but
for twa facts, 1, The Russians didn't have the money for the access roads,
utilities and apron; and, 2. The 1998 financial crisis occurred and traffic was
destroyed.

The Chairman: Now, look, Carl, I have, of course, great admiration for all the
energy and devotion you did put into this project. I think it's absolutely ex-
traordinary - extraordinary entrepreneur, what you tried to achieve and
what you put in motion ta make this project fly and become a success, We
see that in our files. We see hundreds of pages of draft agreements » very
sophisticated agreements. So I must confess, I am deeply impressed by the
eneray and devotion you put into it. J also can correctly say you said you are
not stupid. You are smart, you also said. The only thing which is missing is
clarity in respect of the terms on which you or Strategic Partners Intended to
operate and make this project fly. The most logical, the most obvious, matter
of clarity which is missing, in my view, looking at it ex post, 15 years later, is
clarity of the relationship and your position as the moving force, as the de-
veloper, that the expenditures you incurred, the disbursements you incurred,
would ultimately be charged somehow to the project, including the Russian
Parties. I am still puzzled and I am still crying out far a good or better under-
standing. Why is it not in the Founders’ Agreement or in some documents
that you make an estimate of the disbursements which you calculate, esti-
mate, will have to be incurred so as to come up with the financing commit-
ment of EBRD, DMG or others? All of the dacuments, the studies you put to-
gether ... it seems to me why was that not openly discussed at the time In
1995/96/97; coming in and saying: Look here, I incurred X, Y, Z and it has to
be reimbursed. Why do I not see a clear-cut agreement on all these papers;
an agreement that your expenditures of 19,7 million, whatever the figure
was, will be put into the EBRD financing and will be repayable by the parties,
ineluding the Russian Parties? This for me is still something I really fail to un-
derstand, I cry out for a good answer .” '°7

Further in the examination, the Chairman - insisting on the issue — asked:

“The Chairman: ... I verily believe that the Russian Parties were quite aware
that signiftcant disbursements are being made. Maybe they ware still sur-
prised to sce that In the end you are charging your own salary into the EBRD,
etc., and your office expenditures; this might have been raising a@ little bit
more question marks, but basically I have no problem to accept most proba-
bly by a likelihood of things that the Russian Parties knew that significant ex-
penditures were incurred by you. What I don’t see is a clear agreement of the
Russian Parties that they will be reimbursed. This is what I don't see.” 78

Mr Sax did not directly answer the question, but prior to that question, he
made the following statement:

°Mr Sax: I cannat say it in any other way but the following one, In 1995, at
the time the Founders' Agreement was signed, everyone understood that we
were going to pay for the expenses required to obtain the financing and be
reimbursed, Otherwise It would have been a gift. And I don't know how to
say it, but there is no logical reason to make a gift for the deal, And it’s not a
buy-in price, it's not an option price; there was no reference to it anywhere
that it could be - it just isn’t.” '”

 

Regarding the alleged incurring of the pre-development expenditures for and
on behalf of IAT Pulkovo, the following dialogue ensued:

“The Chairman: Now, look, Mr Sax, in your statements you every time
strongly emphasize you or SP incurred these expenditures for and on behalf
of the company. Actually, 1 will leave it to the examination by Respondents’
counsel but, as far as 1 know the file, there is nowhere a corporate resolution
which would empower SP and/or yourself personally to act for and on behalf
of IAT Pulkovo and to incur expenditures; in the opposite, there are some
provisions that require double signature for any expenditure beyond Us$
10,000 or something of that nature. So is my thinking that you incurred
these things on behalf of SP and prabably on behalf of yourself rather than
on behalf of IAT Pulkovo correct? What would you say?

Mr Sax: Dr Blessing, first, there is no lagical reason for, let's call it SP/PSP, to
incur expenses on its behalf without knowing that it is gaing to be reimbursed

as soon as it meets tho pre-conditions. Why? Because what else is there? It's
not an option price and It's not a gift; the only thing it could possibly be is a
reimbursable expenditure. Again, I hate to say that in my experience as a
fawyer the best agreement is a handshake between twa parties, when the
parties are still friendly ,

The Chairman: And the second best?

Mr Sax: Well, that’s the only best. When you have an agreement and that
agreement is breached, then you have everybody saying "you should have
written this piece of paper", you should have had that resolution", “you
should have had the other resolutions." And this is the situation when you are
dealing, In the early 90s, with the conversion of communism to capitalism
(and we used to say red to pink), And the situation was more relationship
oriented as opposed to documentation oriented. If you were around in Russia
in the early 90s you know that the typical Russian agreement was a couple of
pages long, if that; and the typical American lawyer couldn't handle looking
at it because it was so short it didn't say anything. It was what the Aussies
would call Heads of Agrcement. The situation was very simple. We had an
agreement. The deal would have closed but for the fact that Sobchak lost the
election to Yakoviev, and it was unexpected; and that the financial crisis
stopped us figuring out a solution to the problem. That's it. There would not
have been a problem. We would have funded it; PSP/SP would have been
reimbursed expenses; SEP would have been reimbursed their expenses; the
terminal would have been up by now; the financing would have been paid off
by 2010 or 2011 and everybody would have made a lot of money, That's just
the way it is. And tt would have been nice today if I could take aut a piece of
paper that was signed by the Board of Directors that says; We agree to reim-
burse PSP 19,772,000. Yes, it would, except for two facts: 1. 1 don’t happen
to recall it; and, 2. 1 don't have IATP's records. If I had [ATP's records maybe
I could point to something, but I don’t and I cant.”

538 ‘The questions were followed up by Respondents counsel Mr Josh Wong:
Mr_Mong: ..., Dr Blessing has already asked many of the questions that we
wished to ask as well, We don't propose to repeat those, so that should save

time. The first issue, just touching on some of the paints that have already

been in discussion, Mr Sax, is you said you are a sophisticated lawyer, but
yet you still say that you prefer to do things by handshake. Now that leaves
you in a difficult position today when you are trying to make your claim, be-
cause in reference to the expenses you are saying things like "it couldn't
have been a gift; it’s obvious"; but things are not obvious if they are not writ-
ten down. So what surprises me, Mr Sax, is just a lack of any documentation
to support your core claims in respect of expenses, in respect of pre-
development advances, when you yourself know, as a lawyer - and people
around this table, as 1 am sure your side, almost all are lawyers - you get
something down if it has been agreed. My submission, which I will make to
the Tribunal at the end, is the fact that it is not written down really suggests
that it had not been agreed. How do you respond to that?" *?!

539 Mr Sax answered that all relevant documents were intended to be signed at
the financial closing, and that everything had been on the table; further he
said:

°Mr Sax: ...There is nowhere a document that says: Cart, lay out all this mon-
ey for free. You are not going to get it back; it's a gift. The Russians never
have to pay it back if you have satisfied the pre-conditions. You just keep
laying it out for ever and ever and ever and ever. I don't see it says it any-
where like that, because it doesn't. And if we should have, as a sophisticated
lawyer, gotten the Russians to write off, to sign off, on cvery expenditure,
then what can I say? But that's not the way a developer does business today,
be it in New York or Italy or in Sweden anything Is possible."

Mr Wong: Be that as it may, | think we have all agreed that there isn't any-
thing in the Founders’ Agreements or the Charter (which you described as the
Investment Contract) which entitles you to pre-development advances or the
development fee. The documents which you referred to are all documentation
which deperid on your side, and there's nothing which comes close to what
we can call an agrecment,"

Mr Sax: (after referring to the reference in the Founders’ Agreement to a de-
velopment agreement to be concluded): “... And it is a term of art, a “devel-
opment agreement" is a term of art, used in any transaction where there Is a
developer, be it a party who Is a developer, a third-party developer, And

every development agreement, as evidenced by the Coopers & Lybrand's
valuation study, refers to reimbursement for expenses, plus interest, plus a
development fee. So therefore that agreement by namo is included. And L
chatlenge you to tell me what clse could be in that agreement besides three
things: the abligation of the developer to the company during the develop-
ment period; the reimbursement of the developer for his expenses during the
development period; and, the payment of fees or expenses or a combination
of both during the development and construction period. Otherwise what is
the purpose for the agreement? To give the Russians a gift? Why don't we
call it an agreement to give a gift?” '?

Mr Sax then made his point clear, in the sense that the reference, in the
Founders’ Agreement, to the Parties’ intention that they shall agree on and
execute a development agreement would signify and equate at the same
time that the Parties will agree on the reimbursement of the pre-
development expenses and the payment of a developer fee, See hereto the
following dialogue:

On Mr Wong's observation that there exists no clause in the Founders’
Agreement or the Charter or the Investment Contract which provides for a
reimbursement of the pre-development expenses, Mr Sax replied:

“Mr Wong: ... The point you are making is it was agreed that you would be
reimbursed for those (sc: referring to advance funds, costs and expenses in-
curred). We have, I think, agreed that there isn’t any cause in the Founders’
Agreement or the charter which supports that.

“Mr Sax: No, we haven't agreed to that fact, Because I have said previously
that the agreement to execute a development agreement was evidence of the
fact of pre-development cxpense reimbursements and a developer fee reim-
bursement. Because the general commercially-accepted definition of a devel-
opment agrecment has three or four things In it:

(1) Obligations, I'm going to develop the project, whatever it is.

(2) I'm going to get reimbursed,

(3) I'm going to get a development fee, and:

542 Mr Wong, further insisting that Mr Sax should show in the relevant docu-

ments a clause reflecting an agreernent that pre-development expenses shall
be reimbursed, Mr Sax answered:

“Mr Sax: The situation is very simple. I consider myself an experienced de-
veloper. If you would like to bring in a developer with the experience that I
have as an expert witness and say what else would be in the development

be spent at the time, because we didn't. Okay? However, we did expect it to
be reimbursed and everyone understood it would be reimbursed because it
wasit't to be a gift,“24

543 In further examination, Mr Wong confronted Mr Sax with the written testimo-

ny of Mr Karpov who stated that

«Russian shareholders had never agreed to reimburse PSP’s expenses in-
curred in implementing the Investmant Project, According to the Founders’
Agreement, all project implementation expenses should be borne by each
party on its own.»'"%

544 Mr Sax answered that his case is that IAT Pulkovo agreed to reimburse PSP,

« and would have done so but for the breach by the Russian Parties ...,
The Russian Parties should reimburse because they breached, Otherwise IAT
Pulkovo would have been the reimbursing agent through loan proceeds ...”.1*°

Questioned further on Mr Sax's authority to act in the name and for and on
behalf of IAT Pulkovo, the extract of the resolution CX-15 and CX-15 were
examined; CX-14 provides for an authority to negotiate of Mr Boris G, Dem-
chenko as Chairman of the Board and Mr Carl A. Sax as Vice-chairman of the
Board, for documents to be counter-signed by both of them. Mr Sax com-
mented that Mr Demchenko “never accompanied” him to meetings for the
purpose of negotiating documents.”

Nevertheless, Mr Wong certainly correctly summarized the point by saying
that no document or agreement could be finalized without the Russian side
"being involved, or at least signing off on it”.

(c) The Tribunal’s Observations
What should the Tribunal conclude from these examinations?

On the basis of Mr Sax’ statement, it is in the Tribunal’s appreciation of the
evidence, very clear

. that the Russian Parties had never - with any requisite degree of clari-
ty, if at all - been appraised of the magnitude of the pre-development
expenditures incurred or intended to be incurred by the Foreign Par-
ties;

* that these expenditures were in fact incurred by the Foreign Parties on
their own initiative and

. were incurred without any prior approvals evidenced in any proper
form as per the requirements in the Founders’ Agreement and the
Charter, and

. there is no evidence in any recognizable form — apart from vague unila-
teral allegations made by Mr Sax - that any of such expenditures
were ever accepted by Respondents or IAT Pulkavo as reimbursable
expenditures, whether orally, or in writing,

. nor could a reimburseability be inferred by way of implication,

. nor is there the slightest evidence that the Russian Parties had agreed
that such expenditures - whether in full or in part - would ultimately
be charged to the project via the EBRD financing.

With the above summarized reflection in respect of the evidence, it is more
than obvious that the entire pre-development reimbursement claim must fail,

The Tribunal will add further aspects in this context:

First: There is no basis for a reimbursement of any of the Parties expendi-
tures in the Protocol of Agreement,

Second: There is no such basis in the Founders’ Agreement and /or the
Charter; on the contrary, Section 6,3 regarding incorporation expenses, and
Section 8.4 of the Founders’ Agreement referred to above both speak against
the recoverability of costs incurred by a Party,

Third: Already when entering into the Founders’ Agreement, SPS/SP respec-
tively Claimant - according to the Forbes Expert Report, CWS-9, had in-
curred quite sums as di ‘es. g that

 

such amount really had been spent, the Tribunal received no answer why — in
negotiations with the Russian Parties - this aspect had not been clearly
voiced by Claimant (or his predecessors), drawing thair attention thereto, fol-
lowed by discussion with a view towards finding an agreement as to the
reimbursability of such expenditures (for instance in the case that the Project
should not proceed for a reason or failure attributable to either the Foreign
Parties or the Russian Parties).

554 Fourth: After the signing of the Founders’ Agreement, further significant
expenditures were incurred by the Foreign Parties, allegedly on behalf of IAT
Pulkova, with Mr Sax purporting to act on behalf of IAT Pulkovo, when - on
the other hand —

. no evidence was shown in these proceedings that any of the incurred
expenditures had first been discussed,

. no evidence was shown In these proceedings that any of them were
approved by the Russian Parties,

. no evidence was shown in these proceedings that Mr Sax had complied
with the strict requirements as per the Founders’ Agreement, requiring
Board approvals and double signature from Mr Demchenko; on the
contrary, there is evidence that he did not, and

. incidentally, it may be remarked in passing that no actual and legally
satisfactory evidence in respect of any of the items of the alleged dis-
bursements had been submitted in these proceedings so far '!, and
lastly

 

Of course it is true that the Tribunal ordered a bifurcation of the proceedings such that
evidence as to quantum wauld only have to be submitted in a separate quantum phase,
after the present liability phase,

However, this had not been so from the inception of these proceedings, and Claimant
could have served documentary evidence justifying the huge expense claim of $ 19.7 mio
much earlier in these proceedings, for Instance in support of his request for interim relief
(in respect of which it had been made clear that a reasonable likelihood of success on the
merits is an aspect to be considered by the Tribunal); after all, Claimant - as an expe-
rienced lawyer and advised by experienced counsel — must have known (or could not rea-
sonably expect) that this Tribunal ~ If it has ta proceed to an examination of the quantum
- would simply accept the PriceWaterhouseCoopers Report referred to in the ASA Report,
and that - for this Tribunal to assess quantum, the detailed back-up documentation would
have to be analysed, if need be thousands of detailed documents -- to the extent that
these still exist.

. no evidence was shown in these proceedings that there had been any
sort of an agreement that such costs should be reimbursed, other then,
in case the Project comes to fruition, through the future earnings dur-
ing the tenure of the PPP (which was supposed to be entered for an un-
limited period of time),

Fifth: It is, therefore, a clear and indeed inevitable conclusion that, in case
of a failure of the Project, those costs/expenditures remained non-
reimbursable, in any event not reimbursable from IAT Pulkovo or from any of
the Respondents.

Perhaps Claimant Mr Sax, from the very beginning, had his own “agenda” in
this respect, by calculating that such expenditures could be packed into the
EBRD financing commitment; yet, if so, such intention would have had to be
made transparent to the Russian Parties up-front as a matter of the most ba-
sic notions of proper behavior and good faith in a partnership-situation - a
requirement which is so obvious that no legal authority would have to be re-
searched for backing up this clear statement.

Likewise, any other “agenda” for a recovery-claim would also have had to be
voiced against the background of the clear waiver-provision in Section 8.4. of
the Founders’ Agreement, which likewise is so clear that it needs no interpre-
tation; the provision simply must be applied, otherwise one would abolish the
notion that Parties may have confidence that clear words mean what they
plainly say.

Sixth: Also after 1999, Mr Sax continued to incur expenditures, which he
then occasionally mentioned to the Russian Parties in passing, but without in
any way inspiring the und ing that he req reir Mr Say
confirmed this at the Hearings of 21 October 2011, by explaining that - had
he addressed a claim for reimbursement - the Russian Parties would imme-
diately have ceased any further cooperation (which Mr Sax in 1999 and
beyond hoped to reactivate by several different proposals),

 

Seventh: Hence, not even in the years 1999 to 2007 did Mr Sax claim the
reimbursement of pre-development expenses incurred, since - as he feared

- this could have prompted counter-productive/negative reactions, frustrat-
ing any future endeavors to re-activate the Project. This is an element to be
taken into account when discussing the issue of the time bar for the claims
submitted in this Arbitration in the further part of this Award.

Eighth: At the examination of Mr Sax on 18 October 2011, Mr Durkovic
raised the question whether these expenses could alternatively be sought as
damages “for the breach of the Russian Parties””" {instead of claiming
those expenditures on an alleged agreement as to their reimbursability).

Indeed, theoretically, this would seem to be possible; however, this would
require the showing of a fault committed by the Russian Parties, in the sense
of a violation of contractual obligations. Having reached the decision that the
Russian Parties could not be blamed for not having accepted the EBRD fi-
nancing proposal, and that they were indeed free to do so on the basis of the
contractual documents, no violation of a contractual obligation could be af-
firmed, nor a liability in tort, nor a liability in the sense of culpa in contrahen-
do,

Claim for a 4.5% Developer Fee (Valued at US$ 18’000’000.—-):

28 What is the legal/contractual basis for this claim?
29 How was It negotiated/agreed? No we have a signed document?

I Claimant's Position

578

579

This daim, according to Claimant, falls under the heading of damages in-
curred as a direct result of Respondents’ breach of the Investment Contract.
When Respondents appointed Northern Capital Gateway as the developer of
the AIPT, they effectively precluded any other entity from developing the

NIPT and, by extension, from collecting the development fee.

Regarding the negotiation of the developer fee, Mr Sax in APP to CM-84,

pages 20/21, stated the following:

“The Russian Partics and the Foreign Partics agreed - although not in an ex-
ecuted written contract, as such - that PSP, as the developer, would receive
a standard development fee to be paid at financial closing and/or during the
course of the development itself. Evidence of this agreement is found in vari-
ous documents prepared and/or approved by the EBRD and DMG, Further, it
is found in a draft Development Agreement, which was approved by the Rus-
sian Parties, the EBRD and DMG and was to be fully executed at the time of
financial closing. The earliest evidence of the parties’ agreement is found in
the Coopers & Lybrand (later PWC) Valuation Analysis (CX-12), which ana-
lyzed independently the value of certain In-kind contributions to IATP, includ-
ing those of the Russian Parties. Said Valuation Analysis canctudes that the
amount of the fee (4.5% of the total estimated development costs) was "with-
in a reasonable range of development fees attributable to other infrastructure
projects of similar size." (CX-12, at p. 12). The Valuation Analysis also con-

tains an in-depth discussion, beginning on page 10, of the development
process, development fees and reimbursable predevelopment expenses in
general.”

At the Stockholm Hearings, Mr Sax emphasized the reference in Section 8.3
of the Founders' Agreement to the execution of a “project development
agreement between the Company and PSP" as the contractual evidence that
a development fee must be paid.!*?

Respondents’ Position

Respondents, throughout these proceedings, emphasized that there is no
agreement whatsoever in place which appointed PSP or Claimant as the de-
veloper for the NIPT, and that the reference to a conclusion of a development
agreement in Section 8.3 of the Founders' Agreement cannot be taken as a
legally valid commitment to conclude such a contract on the terms as de-
scribed by Mr Sax, let alone for the payment of a developer fee to Mr Sax,
whether at a percentage of 4.5% of the development costs, or otherwise. !22

Mr Karpov confirms this in his witness statement at para. 25:

"Russian sharehoklers of IAT Pulkovo never agreed to appoint PSP as a con-
struction manager and pay them 4.5% of the cost of the development of the
Terminal ... Under no circumstances could PSP manage the construction;
therefore, the Founders’ Agreement could not have contained and did not
contain any pravisions on the engagement of PSP as a construction manager
and the payment to it of a remuneration."

The Tribunal's Assessment and Decision

The Tribunal has already noted that there exists not one single document
which would evidence the agreement, by IAT Pulkovo and/or the Russian
Parties, to pay, or owe to pay, a developer fee to SPS or Mr Sax,

Compare hereto the dialogue at the Stockholm Hearings:

“Mr Wong: I am going to move to the pre-development fee next. Mr Sax, 1
am going ta move on to the 4.5% development fee. I hesitate to ask you
again, but, just to be sure, there isn't anywhere in the Founders' Agreement
or in the Charter which entitles you to the 4.5 development fee, is there?

Mr Sax: Tf you would like me to be repetitious I will be more than happy to.
The Founders' Agreement, whatever the number was, 8.3 or something, lists
the term "development agreement". To me a development agreement has a
number of items, and in this particular case it is a development fec; that's
what a developer works for. [omissis]

Mr Wong: Can I ask you to look at Mr Karpov's witness statement again, pa-
ragraph 25. The question asked by Mr Karpov was: Did Russian shareholders
of IATP Pulkovo ever agree to appoint PSP as construction manager and pay
it 4.5% of the cost of construction of the Terminal? If yes, then why was not
this provision incorporated into the Founders’ fee? Mr Karpov responds to this
by stating, at paragraph 25: Russian shareholders of IAT Pulkova never
agreed to appoint PSP as a construction manager and pay them 4.5% of the
cost of the development of the Terminal. That was never agreed. The official
general contractor was appointed and only it could manage the construc-
tion.*2?

Mr Sax replied that PSP was never retained as the construction manager, but
as the project developer, and was to receive 4.5% of the development
costs,"

Fact however remains that Claimant was unable to provide any kind of evi-
dence that such a developer fee had been agreed to, whether based on de-
velopment costs, or on any other basis or project-related costs.

Apart from that, it is the Tribunal's view that an acceptable financing propos-
al (resulting in a financial commitment) was an essential pre-condition for
pursuing the Project. The failure to come up with a financing propos-
al/financing commitment in a form and substance which could be considered
acceptable under the circumstances, was a deal-breaker, respectively a con-
ditio sine qua non without which the Russian Parties were not obliged in any
respect to undertake further steps for implementing the project.

It is true that neither the Protocol of Agreement nor the Investment Contract
specified the pre-conditional nature of the Foreign Parties'/Sax' obligation in
exactly these clear words. Yet, In fact, Section 8.4 of the Founders’ Agree-
ment goes even further, by allowing any party to withdraw itself from the
Project by a simple written notice, and without incurring any financial obliga-
tions.

Yet, even absent the explicit provisions in Section 8.4 of the Founders’
Agreement, the Tribunal! would reach the identical conclusion regarding the
pre-conditional character of submitting an acceptable financing propos-
al/financing commitment, for the following reasons:

Absent Section 8.4, the Arbitral Tribunal would have to interpret the Invest-
ment Contract according to the usual civil law-based contract-interpretation-
rules. These typical civil law interpretation rules found their way into the
Russian Civil Code, and are reflected in Article 431, which reads as follows:

Article 431 Russian Civil Code:

In interpreting the canditions of the contract, the court shall take into consid-
eration the literal meaning of the words and expressions contained in it. The
literal meaning of a condition of the contract, in case of its ambiguity, shall be
established by means of comparison with other conditions and with the sense
of the contract as a whole,

If the rules contained in paragraph one of the present article do not make it
possible to determine the content of the contract, the common will of the par-
tics shall be ascertained by taking inte consideration the purpose of the con-
tract. In this caso, all the surrounding circumstances shall be taken Inte con-
sideration, including negotiations and correspondence which preceded the
contract, practice established in the mutual relations of the parties, business
custom, and subsequent conduct of the parties,

591 According to Article 431.2, If a situation is not explicitly covered by the word-
ing of a contract, all surrounding circumstances shall be taken into considera-
tion for assisting a tribunal to correctly interpret the contract, including the
subsequent conduct of the Parties, Claimant's counsel, correctly so, have
specifically referred to Article 431 Russian CC in CM-84 page 4.

592 Such further circumstances could e.g. be the pre-contractual discussions,
earlier drafts of a contract (for instance earlier drafts of the Protocol of
Agreement and the Founders’ Agreement, their changes up to the signed
wording), oral testimony of negotiations etc.

593 In the present case, no such surrounding evidence was made available, an
aspect which the Tribunal mentioned specifically at the Stockholm Hearings,
remarking that - in the present case - no such further interpretative guid-
ance was given to the Tribunal,

594 Absent such further evidence assisting the Tribunal in its task to make a cor-
rect interpretation and to reach a correct understanding of the Parties' deal,
civil law requires a court or tribunal to proceed to a hypothetical contract In-
terpretation.

595 The hypothetical contract interpretation - for the present discussion -
would essentially raise the following question:

Assuming that - just before signing the Investment Contract - one of the Parties
raised the follawing question:

“But, what is the situation if the Foreign Parties, against our expectation,
would not succeed in coming up with @ financing commitment, or would pro-
vide a financing offer totally unacceptable to us - what then?

And if, in such situation, we as the Russian Parties, would ourselves have to
find financing, for instance from our own taxpayers: Would we stiff be bound
to team up with these Foreign Parties?

Would we still have to retain them as the developer paying them a percentage
fee?

And wauld we still have to concede to them 29.7% of the future revenues
from a successful operation of the New Passenger Terminal, even for many
decades of its operation, although they did not fulfill their primary obligation,
4.€. to come up with a financing commitment?"

Putting the issue in this way makes the answer so obvious that it does not
even have to be proposed or stated here.

Indeed significantly, in the present case, the Parties to the Investment Con-
tract bargained for an explicit and practically unconditional exit clause, and
this is the aforementioned Section 8,4 of the Founders’ Agreement, a clause
which most probably was drafted by the international law specialists man-
dated by the Foreign Parties, as this was stated in CM-84 para. 7.

With the above reflections, it is clear that the Foreign Parties - not having
presented an acceptable financing proposal - entirely lost their further
standing and eligibility as investors of the Investment Contract.

It is for this reason that the Tribunal already had to conclude that the in-
vestment project became stillborn after 1998, and none of the Foreign Par-
ties’ endeavors to rescue its life were blessed by any kind of success. Neither
were the parameters for a financing commitment the subject of further dis-
cussions after 1998, nor was any green light given to the Foreign Parties to
seek to obtain a new proposal, nor was there an explicit request made by the
Russian Parties to the Foreign Parties to continue their efforts and to come
up with new drafts of agreements.

Nevertheless, the Foreign Parties continued to establish such further drafts
(presented in this Arbitration) which, however, to the extent they had been
submitted to the Russian Parties, do not even seem to have prompted any
further attention or interest by them.

It is the Tribunal's clear assessment and conclusion that the Foreign Parties,
after 1998/beginning 1999, could no longer claim to be retained as the de-
veloper, let alone to become entitled to earn the potential benefits as 29.7%
shareholders of IAT Pulkovo. This is a clear and inevitable conclusion directly
following from the pre-conditional nature attributed to the delivery of an ac-
ceptable financing commitment.

After having stated the above reflections, it is even superfluous to mention
that there is nowhere a binding contractual agreement for mandating the
Foreign Parties to become the developer for the planned International Pas-
senger Terminal, and the merely “programmatic” reference thereto in Section
8.3 (c) of the Founders’ Agreement is very far away from stepping up to the
level of evidencing a contractually binding/enforceable commitment, since
quite obviously the successful conclusion of the Project Development Agree-
ment will still depend on the agreement of both sides as to the mutual tasks
and the Foreign Parties' remuneration.

Hence, Section 8.3 of the Founders’ Agreement would only provide a basis
for a claim if, at least, all the essentialia negotii of such a Project Develop-
ment Agreement had been agreed upon, and absent such terms, Section 8.3
can only be understood as a programmatic article indicating the way forward
for the Parties, coupled with a good faith obligation to follow that route.

To sum up:

Due to the pre-conditional nature of the submitting, by the Foreign Parties, of

an ac financing prop ing in an
mitment, the Project became stitlborn, latest as from the beginning of 1999,

financing com-

No agreement is in place (neither explicit nor conclusive) of the Parties which
would have bound the Russian Parties beyond 1999,

606 = The provision in Section 8.3 of the Founders' Agreement to "recognize the
importance of the following agreements to the Company and cooperate with
its efforts to enter into each of the following .. (c) Project Development
Agreement between the company and PSP" does not as such give rise to par-
ticular contractual claims. And, most importantly, no agreement whatsoever,
whether in writing or oral, has been reached at any time that a 4.5% devel-
oper fee would be payable to the Foreign Parties.

607 What is the effect of the above?

The effect is that in December 2002, when the Foreign Parties and Mr Sax
entered into the Transfer Agreement (CX-66/CX-59), there was no valid or
“claimable" contractual right to a developer fee which could be transferred to
Mr Sax as the transferee.

608 In any event, the objections and defenses which were available to the Rus-
sian Parties to contest any and all claims, and all their objections available to
the Russian Parties in the context of the non-fulfillment of the Foreign Par-
ties’ commitment to provide a financing commitment, remained of course
available against Claimant as the transferee/assignee.

609 With this clear conctusion, Claimant's developer fee claim has to be dismissed

in its entirety.

30 Was IAT Pulkovo properly administered even beyond 1998 and ultimately
properly liquidated?
31 If not: Would an incorrect administration or liquidation of IAT Pulkovo give
rise to a justified claim of Claimant?
32 If sa, for what kind of claims?
33 Is there a violation of international law? Was there an act akin to expropri-
ation?

I Claimant's Position

613 Claimant maintains that the Investment Contract never lapsed or ceased to
be effective; among other reasons, Russian law precludes either

° a “lapse” of a contract,

. a tacit abandonment, or

. a unilateral dissolution,

. except where so provided by contract or statute, and moreover:

° there had never been a rescission of contract complying with the re-
quirements of Article 452.1 of the Russian Civil Code (which requires
for a rescission to be concluded in the same form as the contract itself,
ie. by a written agreement of all Parties. '*

In Claimant's view, in short, the corporate administration of IAT Pulkovo by
Respondents was incorrect, the non-issuance of share certificates was incor-
rect, and no correct winding-up has taken place.

As a result, Claimant asserts, an “act of expropriation occurred at the mo-
ment IATP was ifegally liquidated, in contravention of the Rules of Russian
Law on Protection of Foreign Investments and Customary Rules of Interna-
tional Law on Prohibition of Expropriation of Foreign Investments. “7°

In support of Claimant's expropriation case, Professor Tai-Heng Cheng sub-
mitted his Expert Opinion on 22 April 2011 and provided an excellent and
eloquent presentation of his assessment under the perspectives of Russian
investment law and international law at the Stockholm Hearings of 20 Octo-
ber 2011.12”

Respondents’ Position

Respondents reject any and all allegations made by Claimant, and - sup-
ported by a very elaborate opinion of Professor V.A. Belov - maintained
that the liquidation of LAT Pulkovo was correctly performed,

The Tribunal’s Assessment and Decision

The Tribunal notes that the Parties argued the allegedly incorrect administra-
tion of IAT Pulkovo quite extensively in their written submissions and through
expert opinions. However, these observations bear little weight, for a simple
reason: IAT Pulkovo only had to become activated once the Foreign Parties
had met their primary obligation by putting an acceptable financing commit-
ment on the table,

Only if and when Claimant would have fulfilled properly such primary task
would it have become of importance to fully install and ascertain the appro-
priate corporate managernent, administration and "house-keeping". The dic-
tum “first things first" applies, and it has its legal connotation, for instance in
Article 328 of the Russian CC cited above.

Apart from the above very general remarks, it must be said that the Tribunal
is not convinced that the Russian Parties failed to honor their tasks; and if
indeed there was a slowing down in respect of Respondents’ cooperation af-
ter 31 December 1995, this would only seem to be understandable against
the background that the Foreign Parties had failed to present the promised
financial commitment within the deadline of 31 December 1995,

Furthermore, Claimant's allegation regarding Respondents’ failure in respect
of the construction of access roads and the financing of the apron, were con-
tested by Respondents and, in essence, remained without proof. Yet, this as-
pect did not have to be explored any further in these proceedings, due to the
Foreign Parties’ failure to meet their primary obligation.

For the same reason, Claimant's further complaints regarding an alleged fail-
ure to properly issue the share certificates in respect of IAT Pulkovo remain
irrelevant. The Tribunal, however, notes that Respondents submitted subs-
tantiated legal comments rejecting any allegation of a shortcoming under the
provisions of the Russian corporate law, and the Tribunal has in particular
noted the detailed explanations provided by Professor V.A. Belov. It is, how-
ever, not necessary for this Tribunal to explore these aspects in more detail,
or to reach decisions thereon, since these matters are not directly relevant
for the decisions to be made by the Tribunal.

In addition, Claimant throughout the proceedings argued that the liquidation
of IAT Pulkovo was incorrect and, therefore, triggers Respondents’ liability.

However, also this argument - whether correct or not - Is of no avail to
Claimant, since, practically speaking, there was no substance in IAT Pulkovo
to be liquidated, In this context, the Tribunal was given to understand that
IAT Pulkovo had not as yet been funded by the Parties through any meaning-

ful cash injections or otherwise which would have given it a substance to be
distributed to the shareholders as liquidation proceeds. This fact may also
have been the reason that the shares of IAT Pulkovo had never been issued
to its shareholders.

625 Hence, even if IAT Pulkovo disappeared from the surface without going
through all the steps for the liquidation of a company which (in contrast to
IAT Pulkove) had had an active life, no tangible claim would possibly seem to
arise for the Foreign Parties which could have been the subject matter of an
assignment to Claimant on the basis of the transfer documents CX-66/CX-59.

626 And in any event, even if there had been some assets, such as for instance
some office materials, desks, chairs or possibly sorne money on a bank ac-
count (if at all) such assets have not been in evidence in these proceedings
and, if they existed, would be insignificant.

627 In any event, no evidence was provided that Claimant Mr Sax or the Foreign
Parties have made any cash contribution to EAT Pulkovo, and if some assets,
tangible materials, possibly office equipment etc. had been contributed, it
would presumably have been provided by the Russian Parties.

628 A few comments need to be made on the topic of expropriation:

629 Beyond any doubt, Professor Cheng provided an excellent and succinct ac-
count of the basic notions of international law which, most certainly, as such
did apply to the Investment Contract alongside with the Russian law, and the
Tribunal finds itself in full agreement with all the reflections and principles to
which Professor Cheng has referred,

630 The only problem is that - in reality, and as discussed above - none of the
parameters which would have to underlie the application of those notions of
international law and notions on the prohibition of expropriation of a foreign
investment are present in the instant case. More precisely:

. Fact is that the Foreign Parties/Claimant did not fulfill their primary ob-
ligation.

. Such failure is accountable for the fact that the Project did not proceed
and became entirely stale towards the end of 1998/beginning of 1999.

° Thereafter, the Russian Parties could no longer be considered bound to
work towards an implementation of the Project, and indeed any such
further implementation would have required the Parties to settle down
new terms, for instance providing that the Foreign Parties are given a
second chance to endeavor to come up with a more acceptable financ-
ing proposal etc.; the Tribunal has expressed its view in this regard
very clearly and it is not necessary to repeat its reflections in this re-
spect.

. At the moment in time when the Foreign Parties and Mr Sax entered in-
te the Transfer Agreement (CX-67/CX-59) in December 2002, no "liv-
ing" investment project existed anymore; and the Foreign Parties - for
reasons already explained in this Award - no longer had a valid claim
to be and remain as the investors for the development and construction
of 2 new International! Passenger Terminal at Pulkovo Airport.

. As far as the shareholding of the Foreign Parties in IAT Pulkovo Is con-
cerned, the only residual matter which, in December 2002, was not yet
settled, is the formal liquidation or de-registration of IAT Pulkovo.

° The latter, however, basically had no assets of any significance (apart
possibly from some office equipment and the lease provided to it by
Respondents), or possibly some grants or licenses provided by Respon-
dents on which the Foreign Parties hardly could have a claim in liquida-
tion proceedings.

. In any event, the Tribunal was not made aware of any significant as-
sets (such as e.g. bank accounts), to which the Foreign Parties or
Claimant had made a contribution, and no particular substantiated
claim in the framework of this Arbitration were alleged in these pro-
ceedings.

Tt would be inappropriate to argue that the present case has anything to do
with an illegitimate expropriation of the Foreign Parties or of Claimant. In the
opposite, it is the case of the Foreign Parties’ failure to provide what they
had firmly undertaken to provide.

For the above reason, the Tribunal sees no merits in any damage claim con-
nected to an allegedly incorrect liquidation of IAT Pulkovo, let alone for an
expropriation claim.

The above reflections, finally, bring the Arbitral Tribunal back to what the
Parties themselves had expressly bargained for:

Namely to provision of Section 8.4 of the Founders’ Agreement which had al-
ready been cited several times in this Award, and which so clearly reflects
the Parties’ bargain.

Section 8,4 of the Founders’ Agreement operates in the sense of a full waiver
of any of Claimant's claims, and there is no legal way how this clear contrac-
tual hurdle could be removed or Ignored.

The Tribunal’s Summarized Short Answers to the Questions 30 to 33

Q30: Pending the Foreign Parties’ coming up with an acceptable financing
proposal, a minimum of house-keeping seems to have been done for IAT
Pulkovo, for instance regarding the formalization of corporate powers and
administration, non-issuance of shares and possibly other matters which di
not have to be explored in detall.

Q 31: The Tribunal was given to understand that IAT Pulkovo had no assets
of any significance which had been contributed by the Foreign Parties, and
for which there could be a valid recovery-claim; and if IAT Pulkovo had some
fixtures and possibly licenses in view of a future operation, these were pro-
vided by the Russian Parties, The Tribunal does not see any claim which
Claimant could possibly derive from that, even if - what was contested by

Respendents — the liquidation of IAT Pulkovo had not been conducted in the
most correct “text-book” fashion.

637 Q 32: None. Apart from the above, any claims were waived on the basis of
Section 8.4 of the Founders' Agreement.

638 Q 33: Claimant, without any foundation, has invoked a violation of interna-
tiona! law (or Russian law on Foreign Investments); the question however is
moot since the Foreign Parties, after 1998/beginning 1999, were no longer
eligible to remain as the investors, after having failed to submit an accepta-
ble financing commitment, and no unfair or inequitable treatment or expropr-
jation in connection with the dissolution of the project-vehicle and/or the
launching of the AITP in2007 could be found.

Are Ail Monetary Claims Barred by the Russian Statute of Limitations?

How can we understand Claimant's rationale for not submitting the pre-
development expense claim forthwith or rather promptly, as expenditures
were being incurred, or in any event immediately when the EBRD offer
lapsed in 1998, if thare had been an agreement that they are reimbursa-
ble?

Would it be unreasonable to think that Claimant, a very well experienced
lawyer, must have been aware of the statute of limitation, and a 3 year
statute arguably must have been familiar to him, since this is the statute
of limitation according to many if not most US State law legislations.
Regarding Claimants monetary claims: when did a violation of rights occur,
falling under Article 200.1 CC?

Respectively, when could or should Claimant have presented his claims for
pre-development expenses, under Article 200.2 CC?

Are some or all of Claimant's monetary claims for pre-development ox-
penses time-barred?

Tf not: on what basis does Claimant have a valid claim in principle (subject
to the anatysis of the quantum in a finat stage of this arbitration)?

And how to deal with interest (which may be more significant than the
capital amount), interest rate, simple, compound (and compounding ba-
Sis)?

Claimant's Position

Claimant,
2007, he

throughout these proceedings, maintained that, prior to October
never had a reason to present his monetary claims for the reim-

bursement of very substantial pre-development expenditures, since only in
October 2007 did it become clear that the Russian Parties were no longer
minded to stand by the Investment Contract with the Foreign Parties, by

choosing another party for developing and constructing an international pas-
senger terminal, respectively the AITP.

Literally, Mr Sax stated in APP-CM-84 at page 22:

"The agreement was that the pre-development expenses would be reimbursed
at financial closing - although neither IATP nor the Russian Parties were obli-
gated to accept the financing terms to which the EBRD and DMG had commit-
ted before the anticipated mid-1998 financial closing. Indeed, after the 1998
Financial Crisis, the Parties attempted diligently to restructure the financing
and development arrangements. Those efforts, albeit unsuccessful, culmi-
nated after the Presidential Administration provided Claimant with assurances
that the Investment Contract remained in full force and effect, that further
development of the NIPT would commence as soar as certain specified cir-
cumstances were present, and that Claimant's position was secured by virtue
of the highest Russian courts! refusal to dissolve the NIPT ground lease. It
was only after the stated circumstances materialized, and Claimant reinitiated
communications with the City of St. Petersburg, that he learned that Respon-
dents intended to develop the NIPT without the involvement of PSP/Claimant.
It was only at this point that Claimant knew that there would be no financial
closing to fund the reimbursement of the SP/PSP pre-development expenses."

Furthermore, Claimant stated that he may have understood that the statute
of 3 years might apply. However, under Russian law, the d/es a quo (i.e. the
day on which a statute of limitation starts to run) is the day on which a
breach of contract occurred, and this happened on 2 October 2007, and not
before, Thereafter, arbitral proceedings were initiated less than 4 months
later, i.e. in January 2008.

In support of his legal arguments regarding the statute of limitations, Clai-
mant filed the Expert's Witness Statement of Professor Oxana Oleynik dated
21 April 2011 (C-WS-8). Professor Oleynik based her opinion on the applica-
tion of Article 200.1 of the Russian Civil Code in support of her proposition
and conclusion that the relevant statute of limitations only started to run as
from the moment when Mr Sax knew or should have known about the viola-
tion of his rights.

Moreover, Professor Oleynik stated;

“As I understand, the Parties have repeatedly asserted that once financing

were ji their obligations as ta and subse-
quent commercial exploitation of the Terminal are not subject to any time-
limit. ?#

 

Professor Oleynik’s Opinion then deals with the situation that several viola-
tions had occurred, for instance in the framework of contracts which had to
be performed in instalments, and she then reached the conclusion that none
of several (smallish) breaches which occurred prior to October 2007 “resulted
in such a violation of the right on which Mr Sax predicates the present claim,
ta wit - none of the above violations have fed to an unconditional depriva-
ton of the right to take part in the development and commercial exportation
of the Terminal." Prior to the Decree of the President of the Russian Federa-
tion of 25 September 2007 No. 1283 “On transfer to the ownership of St. Pe-
tersburg shares of the Joint Stock Company “Pulkovo”", and the date closely
linked to it, i.e. 2 October 2007, when Claimant was informed that the devel-
opment of a new international passenger terminal would be realized without
his participation.”

As regards Claimant's interest claim, Mr Sax explained that the Russian Par-
ties had approved an interest rate of 15.5% p.a.; see his statement in APP-
CM-84 page 23:

"The Russian Parties approved an interest rate of 15.5% p.a., compounded
annually. This interest rate is first set aut in the EBRD Operations Committee
Final Approval. It is significant to note that, hac financial closing of the
EBRD/DMG financing gone forward, DMG's subordinated financing wauld have
accrued interest at a fixed rate of 17.5% per annum, compounded semi-
annually, which supports the notion that the approved interest rate of 15.5%
for the riskier pre-development advances, was reasonable.“

124 Opinion Professor Oleynik, CWS-8 page 2, end of 2™ paragraph, - The Tribunal notes
that the source of this information remained unclear.

Respondents' Position

Respondents reiterate that the Investment Project was finally terminated at
the end of 1998 - first half of 1999, for lack of a mutual agreement of the
participants to the Project to EBRD's financing proposal,*?*

Implementation of the Investment Project without financing was impossible.
Moreover, the obtaining financing was not enough for the further Implemen-
tation of the Investment Project, since the Parties moreover had to come to a
mutual agreement in respect of the details of further actions and terms of
their c in the 1 of the Yt Project which,
however, never occurred.

 

Respondents maintain that Claimant should have raised his clalms at the end
of 1998 - first half of 1999, as the first milestone date. With reference to
para. 20 of Mr Karpov's witness statement, Respondents argued that “be-
ginning from the second half of 1999, IAT Pulkovo completely ceased all of
its operations. Meetings of shareholders and those of the Board of Directors
were not held, members ta the Board of Directors were not elected, the sole
executive body was not established, There was mo money in the operating
account of IAT Pulkavo."

Alternatively, the claims should have been voiced at the beginning of 2000,
when Claimant requested from other parties of the [Investment Project the
reimbursement of his expenses due to the failure of the Investment
Project.2°

Reference was made to the witness statement of Mr Karpov, para. 24, who
refers to a meeting between Mr Demchenko and Mr Carl A. Sax in St. Peters-
burg. At that meeting, Mr Sax noted that he had incurred substantial ex-
penses on the assumption that they would be repaid during the Terminal's
operation. Because of the failure of the Investment Project, he (Mr Sax) had
no possibility to get his expenses reimbursed through the profits from the

Terminal's operation and, therefore, requested a reimbursement of his ex-
penses from the other shareholders of IAT Pulkovo.

At that meeting, as Mr Karpov stated, Mr Demchenko referred Mr Sax to the
agreement of the Parties, i.e. that the non-implementation of the Investment
Project was the risk of each party and that losses which they might suffer in
connection therewith could not be shifted onto other parties, and that each
party would have to bear the losses itself, as clearly set out in Section 8.4 of
the Founders' Agreement.

Respondents, therefore, argue that in any event Claimant, in the beginning
of the year 2000, had to recognize that the Investment Project failed, that
Respondents would not further proceed and that his clairn for a reimburse-
ment of pre-development expenses was rejected. Claimant, therefore, should
have raised his claims at least in the beginning of the year 2000, as the
second milestone point in time.

As a third milestone date, Respondents refer to 17 December 2002 when
Claimant acquired from PSP under the Purchase Agreement the "Receivable"
i.e. the right to claim pre-development expenses. PSP itself, when executing
the Share and Purchase Agreement relating to the IAT Pulkovo shares (CX-
66, CX-59) thereby terminated its participation in the Investment Project;
however, Claimant as a new participant had never been approved as a new
investor.

Respondents also noted that the assignment of the "Receivable" against IAT
Pulkovo In December 2002 had not been notified, neither to IAT Pulkovo nor
to the other shareholders.

As a fourth milestone date, Respondents refer to Mr Karpov's written notifica-
tion of 16 April 2003 (CX-69) which notification “obviously should have trig-
gered the Claimant's claims to the Respondents if he deemed that termina-
tion of the Investment Project infringes his rights.” (1-RM-32/2-RM-38, para.
283),

Based on the foregoing, Respondents conclude that any and all claims are
time-barred, by application of the three year statute of limitations as per Ar-
ticle 196 of the Russian CC.

In any event, due to Claimant's failure to obtain an acceptable financing,
Respondents were entitled to unilaterally repudiate the Founders’ Agreement.
Such right, Respondents maintained, is based on the exceptio non (rite)
adimpteti contractus - defense as per Article 328.2, and by Article 405.2 of
the Russian CC. These Articles provide for the right of unilateral out- of-
court repudiation based on two interrelated grounds: in case of failure or de-
lay of a party to perform its obligations, and in case of a loss of interest by
the other party due to such delay."

Respondents also refer to Section 8.4 of the Founders’ Agreement which pro-
vides that the Investment Project and the Founders' Agreernent may be ter-
minated in case financing is not obtained, by serving a written notice by any
of the participants to other participants of the Project. Such notice, Respon-
dents allege, was given by Mr Karpov in his letter to Mr Sax of 16 April
2003,'"?

Respondents expert, Professor Belov, concludes in respect of the moment in
time of the termination that the Founders’ Agreement was terminated when
Claimant had to recognize tacit actions of the Respondents on a unilateral
repudiation of the Founders’ Agreement and termination of the Investment
Project. Such actions — in his view - took place at the end of 1998 or first
half of 1999,'? However, according to Professor Belov, even if the Tribunal
should consider that the unilateral repudiation did mot already occur
1998/1999, it in any event occurred on 16 April 2003, based on Mr Karpov's
letter of 16 April 2003.

In the legal analysis, regarding the starting-point of the running of the time-
period of limitation {d/es 2 quo), Respondents not only refer to Article 200.1
of the Russian Civil Code, but particularly to Article 200.2 second sentence
which reads as follows:

“For abligation for which the time-period of performance is not defined or is
defined as the time of demand, the running of the limitation af action starts
from the time when the right to make a demand for performance of the obli-
gation arises for the creditor and, if the debtor is given a grace period for the
performance of such demand, then the calculation of the limitation of actions
Starts at the end of this time-period.”

Respondents maintain that all of Claimant's claims {reimbursement of alleged
pre-development expenses, the payrnent of a development fee and the com~
pensation for loss of profits) fall into the category of obligations whose period
of performance is not determined, such that the statute starts to run as from
the moment in time when Claimant had "the night to make a demand for per-
formance".

Under Article 393 of the Russian Civil Code, the obligation to reimburse
losses (actual damages and lost profits) arises when the debtor fails to per-
form or stops performing its obligations.

In the present case, Respondents stopped performing their alleged obliga-
tions under the Founders’ Agreement at the end of 1998 - first half of 1999.

Thus, Respondents conclude, the Claimant's right to present a demand for
reimbursement of losses arose at the end of 1998 - first half of 1999, From
that time, the three year statute of limitations started to run. In support of
this conclusion, Respondents refer to the Expert Opinion of Professor Butler
and his answers to questions 6 and 7.

However, even if the Tribunal would determine that the dies 2 quo was trig-
gered at the second, third or fourth milestone date (as above referred ta),
the claims would clearly be tirne-barred.

In respect of the further issues of Issue 7, Respondents deny that any of the
claims could validly be directed against the Respondents, but in fact should
have been directed against IAT Pulkovo. Any of Claimant's alleged losses
should be recovered from IAT Pulkove and not from its shareholders, in par-
ticular the Respondents.~*

In 2008, IAT Pulkovo was struck from the state register of legal entities and
in fact ceased to exist.13°

Under the Russian Federal Law on Joint Stock Companies, Article 56.3 and
Article 2,1, shareholders are not liable for obligations of a joint stock compa-
ny, and their liability in connection with the activity at the company are |i-
mited to the value of shares belonging to them. A subsidiary liability of the
shareholders for obligations of IAT Pulkovo is excluded, as specifically pro-
vided for under Section 4,3 of the Founders’ Agreement,

As a final point, Respondents also note that Claimant filed his claims on the
basis of an alleged joint responsibility of the Respondents whereas, as Res-
pondents point out, the Founders’ Agreement does not establish or provide
for a joint responsibility of the Parties to the Investment Project. As a conse-
quence, Claimant would have to determine how the liability of the Respon-
dents would have to be split between GUP Pulkovo and the City of St. Peters-
burg (or Respondents 1-5) and would have to specify the alleged responsi-
bility and fault causing the failure of the Investment Project. **

Finally, Respondents also refer to Section 6.3 of the Founders' Agreement
regarding expenditures which provided that each party agrees to pay its own
expenditures related to the company formation where such expenditures
have been incurred prior to the company's registration.

Under a different line of arguments, Respondents extensively argued - par-
ticularly at the December 2010 Hearings - that the Alternative Terminal is a

different investment project, different from the NIPT, and that Claimant can
not ralse any claims in respect thereof, '3”

1m The Tribunal’s Assessment and Decision

672 In the previous Parts of this Award, the Tribunal already had to reach the
conclusion that - absent a contractual basis for claiming the reimbursement
of pre-development costs - all monetary claims submitted in this Arbitration
under the heading “Pre-Development Costs" and a "4.5% developer fee"
have to be denied. Hence, the extensively debated matter of the statute of
limitations, for all intents and purposes, has become moot.

Nevertheless, in the following few paragraphs and obiter dictum, the Tribunal
will provide its legal assessment,

673 It is Claimant's case that pre-development costs amounting to millions of US
Dollars had to be incurred in connection with the endeavor to obtain a financ-
ing commitment and, apparently, significant costs started to be incurred al-
ready in 1994. However, such costs were not claimed prior to Claimant's fil-
ing his Request for Arbitration in January 2008,

674 = The delays in submitting such monetary claims, in particular for recovery of
disbursements, is indeed difficult to understand. Very certainly, Claimant Mr
Sax, a highly experienced lawyer and a highly “sophisticated investor” (as ha
described himself)'**, must have been aware of the running of a statute of
limitations, and it must have been within his thinking that such statute, un-
der Russian law, could be the same as in many US state laws, i.e. 3 years.

675 During these proceedings, Claimant has not provided convincing reasons why
the Foreign Parties (and subsequently Claimant) never put those pre-

development claims on the table, except for occasionally and in passing men-
tioning the high amount of disbursements which they had incurred.

Nevertheless, there are probably some reflections which might give an an-

First, it is rather typical for this kind of investment (be it as a PPP, or
BOT, or BOOT) that the foreign/Western party provides the up-front fi-
nancing for the Project (be it the financing for an Industrial com-
plex/production facilities in the private or public sector, or for infra-
structure projects), whereby the up-front expenditures would be
earned back during the term of the PPP (BOT or the BOOT) “; hence,
such Up-front costs are, rather typically, not charged to the corporate
vehicle (in the present case [AT Pulkovo), which typically starts without
assets apart from the paid-in share-capital and possibly contributions in
kind, Nor are such expenditures charged to the other shareholders. The
up-front expense of the foreign investor is typically earned back
through future profits derived from the operation of the project or facil-
ity, and in the present case the Charter provided for an unlimited term
of operation in Chapter 1.4,

The above (rather typical pattern) may indeed explain why the Foreign
Parties and Claimant Mr Sax never (in the years 1994-1998) advised
the Russian Parties and IAT Pulkovo of the pre-development costs as
they were being incurred, and in fact never required a prior approval
for incurring any such costs (which, if they were to be charged to [AT
Pulkovo, would have had to be approved by a unanimous Board Reso-
lution in respect to any amount exceeding USS 10'000),

No evidence was put on file that the Russian Parties had been advised
that, in the end, such costs would in part be debited to IAT Pulkovo.

However, possibly when the Foreign Parties and/or Mr Sax realized that
tha implementation of the Project (and thereby the recovery of pre-

It was not clarified, in these proceedings, whether such an intention of the Foreign Parties

349

development expenditures) might be rather uncertain, the Foreign Par-
ties submitted those pre-development expenses to EBRD, causing
EBRD to reflect them as a part of the loan.'4#°

The fact is that the charging of the pre-development expenses via the
EBRD loan had never been openly discussed up front and certainly had
never been approved by the Russian Parties. In any event, Mr Sax did
not claim that he had ever asked the Russian Parties to agree that
such charge should come into the financing proposal, nor did he claim
that particular expenditures had ever been validly approved by the
Russian Parties and/or by IAT Pulkovo.

After 1999, i.e. at a time when the EBRD proposal was no longer on the
table, the Foreign Parties tried to rescue or revitalize the Project and,
as the Tribunal may assume, for commercial reasons (and for the rea-
son not to burden or jeopardize such 4 “revitalization") the Foreign Par-
ties and/or Mr Sax - who occasionally mentioned the huge pre-
development expenditures already incurred in some letters - never
demanded a reimbursement.

And even after the transfer/assignment of the "receivables" as per CX-
66/CX-59 to Mr Sax personally, the pre-development expenditures
were never claimed any time prior to January 2008,

The above paragraph tries to provide some understanding of business rea-
sons which might have been in place and which resulted in the indeed sur-
prising situation that very significant expenditures (whatever their amount

(i.e. to charge their pre-development expenses via the EBRD loan) had been the intention
from the very beginning, or whether such intention only came up e.g. In 1996/1997. Like-
wise, it was not clarified whether and how EBRD was instructed in regard of the pre-
development expenditures; yet, it would scem rather unlikely that EBRD would put the
Foreign Parties expenses (nto its proposed loan package on its motion, or withaut the For-
eign Parties approval,

might be) were not invoiced to either IAT Pulkovo and/or the Respondents
for 10 or even more years.

Now turning to the issue of the statute of limitations: Article 200 of the Rus-
sian CC - in rather bad English translation - reads as follows:

“Article 200; The Start.of the Proceeding of the Term_of the Limitation of Ac-

tons

1.

The proceeding of the term of the limitation of actions shall start from
the day, when the person has learned, or should have learned, about
the violation of this right. Exceptions to this rule shall be established
by the present Code and by the other laws.

By the obligations with a fixed term of execution, the proceeding of the
term of the limitatian of actions shall start after the expiry of the term
of execution. By the obligations without a fixed term of cxecutian, or
by those, whose term of execution has been dofincd as that on de-
mand, the proceeding of the term of the limitation of actions shall start
from the moment, when the creditor's right to present the claim for
the execution of the obligation arises, and if the debtor has been
granted a privileged term for the execution of such a claim, the term of
the limitation of actions shall be counted after the expiry af the said
term.

By the regress obligations, the proceeding of the term of the limitation
of actions shall start from the moment of execution of the basic obliga-
tion,"

It Is very clear for this Tribunal that the relevant provision in the present
context is Article 200.2 Russian CC, second sentence, and - contrary to the
opinion of Professor Oxana Oleynik referred to above - not Article 200.1
Russian CC. In fact, it remained undear on what kind of instruction Professor
Oleynik rendered her opinion, since her instruction letter had not been dis-
closed by Claimant.

682

In other words, if the Tribunal had affirmed a monetary claim, and if Clai-
mant's allegations as to the reimbursability of expenses were correct (since
“it could not be a gift”), it is the Tribunal's view that

« the statute of limitations would not start to run from the day of a viola-
tion by Respondents,

. but would start to run as from the day when a claim for reimbursement
of expenses arose, which basically would coincide with the day on
which the Foreign Parties had to effectuate a payment to a provider of
services, a consultant etc.

° Eventualiter, |f the understanding had been that pre-development ex-
penditures would only flow back after commencing a commercial op-
eration of the Passenger Terminal, the dies a quo would have to be de-
termined at the time when the Project became still-born, |.e. end of
1998/beginning of 1999.

However, the premise (underlying the above), i.c. the existence of an
agreement between the Russian Parties and the Foreign Parties that pre-
development expenses are as such chargeable to either the Russian Parties
or to IAT Pulkovo as the project-company (and should not simply be earned
back through the dividends expected to flow during the tens of years of the
operation of the Terminal which the Parties had in mind), has nowhere been
established in these proceedings.

The most straightforward answer, therefore, is to conclude that the dies a
quo, in the Tribunal's view, would have to be located in early 1999, i.e. at a
moment in time the Foreign Parties must have realized that, realistically, the
EBRD proposal was no longer on the table. It is from that latter moment that
a diligent creditor would have been required to either consider pursuing a
claim or, alternatively to drop it.

And, conversely, it is as from that moment in time that the 3 year period
starts during which IAT Pulkavo and/or Respondents had to be aware of the
risk to be confronted with a claim for the pre-development expenditures In-

curred by the Foreign Parties and/or Mr Sax. And after such lapse of time,
IAT Pulkovo and the Respondents had to be protected in their reliance that -
due to the non-filing of reimbursement claims - they will not any further be
concerned with any such claims.

The above approach, as explained by the Tribunal, shows that the statute of
limitation in fact is a concretization of the bona fides principle, i.e. the re-
quirement of the Parties to act in good faith. The principle had two sides of
the coin:

. It does require from a creditor a certain minimum standard of diligence
(he must properly raise a claim within a certain period, i.e. 3 years un-
der Russian Law and numerous other national laws, including US laws),
and

. on the other hand, after a certain lapse of time (3 years or whatever
the statute is) grants a protection to the other party/debtor who de-
serves legal! protection In his/its expectation that he/it will no longer
have to be concerned with any claims originating from a remoter past.

The Tribunal has also noted that Respondents' alternatively pleaded to take
the date of CxX-66/CX-59, i.e, 17 December 2002 as the dies a quo. In this
respect, the Tribunal would say that - if one were to apply the most gener-
ous viewpoint for setting the dies a quo - this approach would also be possi-
ble, yet with a significant stretch of leniency. Such leniency would be justified
if for instance, through certain statements or behavior, the Russian Parties
had repeatedly signalized that they are not only aware of the pre-
development expenses, but had also signalized to be favorably prepared to
come up with a reimbursement, However, the present file is extremely slim
in this regard and, in particular, there is not one single document which could
reasonably have inspired the Foreign Parties’ or Mr Sax's confidence that the
Russian Parties and/or IAT Pulkovo in fact considered to reimburse approx-
imately US$ 20 million pre-development expenditures incurred.

Nevertheless, even under the latter approach with a d/es a quo starting some
time in 2002, it would be very clear that the monetary claims, submitted as
late as in January 2008 - were entirely time-barred.

Finally, the Tribunal must clearly discard Claimant's pleadings regarding the
statute of limitations arguing that the dies a quo was only triggered in Octo-
ber 2007. There can be no merits to such position.

To sum_up:

The Tribunal had to find that Claimant's monetary claims lack any contrac-
tual/legal basis and had to be rejected in their entirety,

However, even if the Tribunal had come to a different conclusion and had
found that a certain amount was due to Mr Sax as reimbursement for pre-
development expenditures, or as damages, the Tribunal would have had to
entirely reject any such claims as time-barred.

The Tribunal’s Summarized Short Answers to the Questions 34 to 40:

Q34: Claimant as witness gave to understand that a clear demand in the
years 1999 and following addressed to the Russian Parties that they should
effectuate the reimbursement of the pre-development expenses would have
been counter-productive. - However, it is obvious that such an argument
does not improve Claimant's situation.

Q35: The question was not asked at the Hearing, but a 3 year statute of
limitation basically must have been familiar to Claimant as a lawyer; apart
from that, the clear legal provisions of the Russian CC must be taken as
known by any investor or contract-party, let alone by a “sophisticated inves-

tor"; and Claimant himself described himself as an experienced and sophisti-
cated investor and lawyer.'~

Q 36; It is the Tribunal’s view that the Russian Parties did not violate any
contractual rights of the Foreign Parties; in any event, such a violation has
not been evidenced. Absent proper performance by the Foreign Parties, the
Russian Parties were entitled to withhold their own further performance un-
der the exception rule discussed above.

Q37: Claimant respectively the Foreign Parties should have raised the
problem of the expenditures upfront during 1995 and 1997 and should have
sought agreement on reimbursability in case the project would not proceed;
however, no such agreement was ever discussed, let alone agreed. In any
event, the Foreign Parties should have presented their accounting promptly
upon incurring the costs and expenditures, at least in 1997.

In any event, the submission to IAT Pulkove and/or Respondents of the pre-
development expenses should have taken place latest in 1999 so as to comp-
ly with an appropriate standard of diligence. The deferring of such submis-
sion of the accounting and claiming of an allegedly due reimbursement for
opportunity reasons or business reasons - as they were explained by Mr Sax
- does not wash away the standard of diligence which must be applied to
any diligent creditor,

Claimant's argument that he only was prompted to claim such reimburse-
ment after October 2007 |s entirely unconvincing, and indeed meritless under
Russian law and standards of due diligence.

Q38: Yes, all of the pre-development expenses are time-barred under Ar-
ticle 200.2 second sentence of the Russian CC; the latest conceivable dies 2
quo for determining the 3-year period was the 17" December 2002 when the
transfer Agreement CX-66/CX-59 was signed.

R_ Issue 7:
Claimant's Investor Claim

Does Claimant Have a Valid Claim for His Re-Instatement as a 29.7% -
Investor For the Alternative Airport Terminal?

Or, Alternatively, Does Claimant Have a Valid Damage Claim, for the
Claimed Amount of US$ 294’500'000,--, or for any Other Amount?

The Tribunal’s Second Look at The Issue Concerning Claimant's focus
standi for Being as the for the ‘@ Interna-
tional Passenger Terminal at Pulkovo Airport

 

The more precise questions for this Chapter P and the following Os were as fol-
jows:

41 Does Claimant have standing on the basis of CX-66, for claiming that he
should have been selectcd as the developer for the AT in 2007?

42 What was transferred/assigned to Claimant under CX-66, having regard to
the (probably universal, but 2'000 year old Roman notion of) “nemo plus
Juris transferre potest quam ipse habet"?

43 The issue might not really be answered by English law (governing CX-66),
bul by Russian law, since the transfer/assignment would have to deploy
certain offects for IAT Pulkovo. Views/comments?

44 On the same issue: what could be transferred as a stock-interest, having
regard to the strict Transfer restrictions as per the Charter and the FA?

45 Re-thinking the Tribunal's earlier preliminary decision as per the 24% Or-
der: Can Mr Sax stand “into the shoes" of the initial Party?

that the participation in the project as an investor and developer |s not “in-

even though at the time Mid-1990s Mr Sax might have been the driving
force behind SPH/PSP?
46 Regarding Mr Sax’ claim that, in 2007, he should have been elected as the
developer/investor for the Alternative Terminal:
. Is it of significance that - during the 1990s, SPH and Mr Sax were
y icantly engaged in airport p
and were active around the globe (as can be secn from Mr Sax first
witness statement, CWS-1, identifying numerous airport develop-
ment projects in which Strategic Partners were involved, such as in
Moscow/Seremetjevo, Vietnam, Gibraltar, Senegal, the Philippines,
Guatemala,, Conga, Ecuador, Indonesia, Honduras, Pakistan, Arme-
nia, Jamaica and Uruguay - none of which however materialized,
see Transcript of 16 December 2011, p, 93),
. whereas there seems to be no further record of Mr Sax involvement
since 1998 to date (but for Mr Sax to corract if this is wrong).
47 Why did Mr Sax not participate in the tender process for the Alternative
Terminal?
48 How could Mr sax he have fulfilled the (very heavy) pre-qualification crite-
ria?
49 Was Mr Sax aware that procurement laws In Russia changed?
Was he entitled to expect that laws in Russia would not be changed, and
would remain stabilized on the basis as they were in 1995?
And would a claim for exclusivity, as requested by Claimant, be contrary to
Russian antitrust law?

Claimant's Position

Claimant's investor claim, throughout these proceedings, stood out as a ma-
jor pillar of his case. It is, very basically, his claim that - when the project
to construct an international passenger terminal at Pulkovo Airport - was
re-launched in 2007, the Russian Parties should have contracted with him
(and/or his partners) and in fact were contractually and legally bound to do
so.

Under Russian law, Claimant asserts, he is entitled to specific performance,
and the employment of Northern Capital Gateway to become the developer
of a new international passenger terminal triggered his investor claim.

During the present proceedings, Claimant has several times rephrased his
request for specific performance and - after the Tribunal's ruling on his re-
quest for interim relief and reinstatement as an investor - he amended his
claim to a claim for monetary relief and/or damages. Claimant and Clai-
mant's counsel submitted very extensive pleadings on the issue, supported
by references to Articles 7 and 10 of the Russian Foreign Investment Protec-
tion Law, and by references to numerous decisions and arbitra! awards.

In APP-CM-84, Claimant again stressed his experience, ability and qualifica-
tions for implementing the project respectively the AIPT, coupled with the
daim to be afforded a “full compensation commensurate to his restoration as
the investor, or an award of significant moral damages which satisfies the re-
quirement for full compensation under Russian faw,”

In respect of the question why he did not, in 2007, participate in the tender
for the AIPT, Mr Sax stated that he would have waived his rights for damages
and specific performance resulting from the breach of the Investment Con-
tract by acquiescing to Respondents’ claim that his rights had been extin-
guished, which is not the case.

In respect of changed procurement laws in Russia, Claimant argued that pro-
curement laws are not retroactive and that the investment protection laws
include a grandfathering provision.

Respondents' Position

Respondents' position was argued very extensively in these proceedings,
initially with a main focus on the allegation that the 2007 AIPT-Project is a
different project - an aliud, for using the Roman-law term - with little com-

monality to the NIPT-Project conceived in the middle 1990s, and testimonies
on this subject were heard in the Zurich Hearings in December 2010.

In addition, Respondents developed their investment-law defense in exten-
sive pleadings, in essence disputing Claimant's investor claim (whether as a
dlaim for specific performance, or for a purely monetary claim for damages),
Inter atia, Respondents argued that

. Russian law prevails over custornary international law;

. there is no breach of international law entitling the Claimant to his

claims;

. the Founders’ Agreement which was the agreement that basically de-
scribed the intentions of the Parties does not have a choice of law
clause similar to the one reflected in the Charter with its reference to
Russian law, treaties and principles of international law;

. neither did the Protocol of Agreement contain any reference to interna-
tional law;

. general principles and norms of international law invoked by Claimant
do not prevail over domestic statutes in case of conflict and can only
apply on a subsidiary basis;

. apart from the above, there was no breach of international law by Res-
pondents; they acted in good faith in the negotiations and the perfor-
mance of the contracts, did not abuse any of Claimant's rights and
have nowhere breached the standard of fair and equitable treatment in
relations with the Claimant;

* nothing can be seen as constituting an act of expropriation, neither un-
der international law nor under Russian law;

. this is not the case where a foreign investor's property had been seized
or expropriated by the host government;

. the termination of IAT Pulkovo was made In compliance with the Rus-
sian legislation and was within the regulatory powers of the state, and

Finally, Respondents argue that Claimant would have had the possibility to
mitigate his losses by raising his claims much earlier, or by requiring from
the Respondents’ specific performance of their alleged obligations in 1999, or
by attempting to settle the dispute with the Respondents, or by participating
in the tendering process for the ALPT Project.

The Tribunal's Assessment and Decision

The Tribunal was caused to reflect on the issues regarding the requested
reinstatement of Claimant as an Investor a first time in the framework of the
decision to be made on Claimant's request for interim relief.

In its determination of the issue, communicated by the Tribunal’s 24" Order
of 8 February 2011, the Tribunal essentially reasoned that the position as
such of a joint-venture partner (ar partner to an investment project) is an ad
personam position, acquired fntuitu personae, earned because of the individ-
ual attributes, capabilities etc. of each one of the partners - and, conse-
quently, it cannot be transferred to someone else without the consent of all
other partners.

This - indeed most basic legal principle - is probably recognized in all legal
systems, since the Roman times, more as a matter of pure and basic com-
mon sense than as a matter of sophisticated legislation. The Tribunal’s reflec-
tions, communicated with the 24" Order, are - in essence - are reproduced
in Chapter F above.

For the purpose of the present Award, no second thoughts had to be given to
the Tribunat‘s statements as per the 24-” Order: It is therefore clear that the
Claimant's /ocus stand in respect of any claim seeking his reinstatement as
an investor — to the extent It was maintained by Claimant - must be denied.
This also means that Claimant's requests are reduced to purely monetary

claims,

The basis for such monetary claim is the same as the one applicable to the

4.5% developer claim, in the sense of an indirect damage claim. The legal

construction could be the following:

i)

(il)

(ili)

(iv)

vy)

Because the shareholder-position of the initial Foreign Parties as such
could not be transferred to Claimant — as repeatedly discussed herein
~ the Foreign Parties, remained as shareholders of IAT Pulkovo;

according te Claimant’s case, they were expropriated in October
2007, and IAT Pulkovo seized to exist;

for such expropriation, the Foreign Parties could claim reinstatement
and/or damages in the sense of loss of future profits which could be
derived from the commercial exploitatian of the AITP during an inde-
finite period of time

such reinstatement claim (or, alternatively, damage claim) would be
commensurate to the 29.7% shareholding;

and due to the transfer and assignment as per CX-67/CX-59, argua-
bly, the Foreign Parties would have to surrender and disgorge all such
benefits’? - which would have flowed to the Foreign Parties but for
their expropriation by the Russian Government - to Claimant;

“3 The construction would signify that the Foreign Parties — under the Charter and under

Russian law - would have been allowed to - in advance - assign any and all benefits from

a future investment, unlimited in time, to an assignee such as Mr Sax. This, obviously, is

something entirely different from, for example, the assignment of an already declared
dividend etc, Whether such a general transfer/assignment of all economic interests by a

shareholder of a Russian cornpany to a third party like Mr Sax would at all be permissible

and in that sense, Claimant could be seen as indirectly damaged par-
ty.

Claimant has not argued his case along the above lines, but for the Tribunal
this would be the most logical and simple way to understand Claimant's mo-
netized investor claim.

The question which therefore is left on the table is, whether or not such a
monetized investor claim, in the sense as above described, or indeed any
monetary claim advanced by the Claimant and not so far addressed in this
Award, could have merit.

For such “monetized investor claim” the Tribunal has to apply its analysis -
already extensively discussed In this Award - as to the Foreign Parties per-
formance (respectively unsuccessful performance) under the Investment
Contract.

This clearly means that

° due to the failure of the Foreign Parties to come up with an acceptable
financing commitment, the primary obligation incumbent on the For-
eign Parties - and conditio sine qua non for the Foreign Parties partic-
ipation in the exploitation of the Praject - was not met;

. and due to this, the Project became stillborne towards the end of
1998/beginning of 1999, and never became revitalized thereafter on
the basis of a renewed agreement, or through continued active cooper-
ation of the Russian P artlies;

 

under Russian law, may seem doubtful, and may remain as an interesting question. Intui-

tively, one would expect that such an assignment is potentially invalid, because in fact and
reality such a far-reaching assignment by a sharcholder to a creditor may totally remove
the shareholders’ intcrest to the Company, and might be seen as a circumvention of the
transfer restriction as per the Charter and the Founders’ Agreement. - For the purpose of
this Award, this legal aspect does not need ta be explored any further, and the Tribunal
simply discusses thls Chapter of the Award on the hypothesis that indeed such assignment
was somehow and to some extent possible.

. with the consequence that, after 1999, the Foreign Parties ~ having
failed in their promised performance - could no langer expect or claim
to become the developer and/or investor in a subsequent project, or
even in a re-launch of the initial project.

The Tribunal’s Summarized Short Answers to the Questions 41 to 49:
Q41; The answer is NO.

Q42: The nemo plus juris transferre potest — rule applies'"* : In December
2002, the Foreign Parties had already at least 3 years earlier lost any con-
tractual expectation or claim to be considered as the future developer and/or
29.7% investor in a subsequent project for an International Passenger Ter-
minat,

Q 43: Certainly, the ultimate and most important test is under Russian law,
not under English law.

Q 44: Only assignable monetary interests, but not the standing as a share-
holder of EAT Pulkovo (the latter consisting of multifold corporate and con-
tractual rights associated to the position as a shareholder},

Q 45: The /ntuitu personae principle is a universal most basic and indeed
axiomatic notion and applies wherever a relationship is based on particular
personal qualifications which are not exchangeable or interchangeable (ex-
cept with the consent of the other parties}.

Q46: No answer needs to be given ; but it might well be that Mr Sax had
been one of the foremost developers for airport projects in the mid-1990s,
with numerous connections enabling him to put a powerful consortium to-
gether ; the question remains whether he was in the same position in 2007
(no representations were made by Mr Sax referring to recent projects in
which he had been involved, but he affirmed that he would have been in the

444 The rule means that no-one can transfer more rights than he himself has.

725 Q47: He explained that this would have undermined his case claiming that
he had never lost the entitlement under the Investment Contract (an argu-
ment which the Tribunal understands).

quirements,

and competition has no retro-active effect; however, the issue remains irre-
levant, due to the Tribunal’s conclusions.

Regarding the Pre-Development Advance Claim in the amount
of US$ 146’400'000.--:

Claimant has standing (/ocus stand/) to bring such claim on the basis of the
Purchase Agreement/Bill of Sale dated 17 December 2002 (CX-66 and CX-
59), and the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide the claim,

However, on the merits, the Tribunal found that there exists/existed no
agreement, neither written, oral or by way of implication, between Claimant
or his predecessors SPS/SP (respectively the Foreign Parties) and IAT Pulko-
vo or its other stock-holders (respectively Respondents 1-5) for recovering
any of the alleged and claimed pre-development expenses,

Claimant's repeated oral affirmations at the Stockholm Hearings in the sense
“_it could not be a gift!” does not translate into a contractual obligation.

Any liability of Respandents, therefore, has to be denied in its entirety.

Moreover, even if the reimbursability in principle would have had to be ans-
wered otherwise, i.e. positively, any and all claims would have had to be de-
clared time-barred in accordance with Article 200,2 second sentence of the
Russian CC, and consequently any such claims would have had to be rejected
also under this defense.

The entire pre-development expense claim, therefore, has to be denied.

Regarding the 4.5% Developer Fee, Claimed in the Amount of
US$ 18’800'000.--:

Claimant has standing (focus standi) to bring such claim on the basis of the
Purchase Agreement/Bill of Sale dated 17 December 2002 (CX-66 and Cx-
59), as far as this claim could be understood in the sense that the initial For-
eign Parties - if and when retained as developers for the NIPT - would have
been required, pursuant te CX-66/CX-59, to assign such developer fee to
Claimant Mr Sax.

However, during the present proceedings it has been shown that there exists
no acknowledgment (let alone any kind of a valid agreement, be it in writing,
oral or otherwise such as by implication or conclusive conduct) that such a
developer fee would indeed be owed, or would be due to be paid, by LAT Pul-
kavo or its other stack-holders (respectively Respondents 1-5) to SPS/SP re-
spectively the Foreign Parties, or Claimant personally; a sufficient contractual
and/or legal foundation for such claim has not been demonstrated, whether
as to the principle of such a claim, or its quantification (i.e. the claimed 4,5
percentage),

Even if such a developer fee had somehow been on the discussion table (of
which the Tribunal, however, has seen no evidence), the Tribunal finds that
SPS/SP (or allegedly Claimant Mr Sax personally) did not “earn the ticket” to
be accepted/chosen as the developer for the project, be it in 1998 or any
time thereafter, or in 2007 and beyond.

This latter conclusion has to do with the non-conformity of the EBRD financ-
ing offer with the parameters of the Investment Contract. Such conformity
has to be qualified as a conditio sine qua non (a condition precedent) for the
further implementation of the Project and, in any event, for the Foreign Par-
ties'/Claimant's further eligibility to participate in the development of the
Project and, ultimately, for participating in the expected benefits of the
Project which, according to Mr Sax’s (possibly overly enthusiastic) state-
ments at the Stockholm Hearings, would have shown huge profits,

In other words and in the latter respect:

. Could Mr Sax claim to be entitled to derive such profits, even if - for
instance - the Russian Parties, absent an acceptable EBRD financing
offer - had decided to put up the financing themselves, i.e. by using
the Russian taxpayers’ money?

. In the Tribunal’s view, the answer is “no" and the exceptio non adim-
pleti contractus - defense appears to be available to Respondents, as
per Article 328 of the Russian CC,

. However, it is not necessary for this Tribunal to make a final statement
in this regard, since the claim in any event has to be denied on other
grounds.

739 = The 4.5% developer fee claim, therefore, has to be denled.

III The Investor Claim, Claimed in the Amount of US$
294’500’000.--:

740 = The Tribunal had opined in its Decision on Interim relief that Claimant has no
standing (locus standf) to bring any kind of an investor claim on the basis of
the Purchase Agreement/Bill of Sale (CX-66 and CX-59), absent the exis-
tence of a cansent of IAT Pulkovo and /or all of the Respondents to Claimant
assuming the function as investor In lieu of the initial parties to the Founders’
Agreement and the Charter.

741 However, thereafter, Claimant has converted his claim into a monetary claim
similar to the conversion of the developer-fee claim, and for such a claim the
Tribunal affirms Its jurisdiction.

742 The failure to satisfy the cenditio sine qua non of coming up with an accepta-
ble financing proposal and financing commitment, however, made the Project
still-borne as early as in late 1998/beginning of 1999.

743 After 1999, Claimant could not expect to be retained as the investor after
having failed to satisfy the primary obligation, and could not expect to be en-
titled to participate in the expected profits once the Project is completed (of
which Claimant spoke at the Stockholm Hearing}, and hence Claimant could
net convince the Tribunal of any good reason why nevertheless he should
have been eligible and retained, in 2007, as the developer and investor of
the AITP.

744 ~=In the Tribunal’s view, the exceptio non adimpleti contractus - defense is
available to Respondents, as per Article 328.2 of the Russian CC.

745 Moreover, the present extensive proceedings have shown that no evidence
whatsoever exists that there had been any objectionable acts of expropria-
tion or unfair treatment — under the standards of Russian and international
law - by any of the Russian Parties, or the Russian Government.

746 Claimant's arguments regarding the alleged improper liquidation of IAT Pul-
kovo in 2007, which in his submission would give rise to a claim for damages
under international law, or his arguments that he had the right to be named
the developer for Pulkovo’s Alternative Terminal without undergoing the ten-
dering process, are meritless.

747 ~—- The investor claim, therefore, has to be denied.

748 Absent a finding of any liability of any of the Respondents, this Award will
therefore finally conclude the present arbitral proceedings, without any fur-
ther Quantum stage,

749 Remains the decision on costs in the next Part, and the Final Holding.

T Regarding Arbitration Costs:

Is Section 20.10 of the Charter Applicable?

50 Is Charter Section 20.10 applicable, as Claimant asserts, or inapplicable,
as Respondents assert?

51 Does it derogate the Tribunal's authority and level of appreciation under
the UNCITRAL Rules?

52 If Section 20.10 is applicable: how to understand better the provision on
costs in Charter Section 20.10, referring to an arbitration “in accordance
with this Chapter 19°?

53 What would be the yardstick for measuring bad faith or grass negligence or
willful misconduct, in connection with a claim for costs?

I The Provision on Costs As Per Chapter 20.10 of the Charter
750 Chapter 20.10 of the Charter provides for the following:

20,10 The Company shall bear all expense of an arbitration brought in accor-
dance with this Chapter 19, unless there shall be a determination by the pan-
el that, in cannection with the matter that is subject to arbitration, a party
has acted in bad faith or committed gross negligence or willful misconduct.
The arbitration pane! shall make such a determination upon the request of
the Company or any party to the arbitration.

751 Chapter 19 provides for the following:

19.1 The Company shall indemnify any Director and officer (including the
Chairman, Vice-Chairman and Co-Presidents) against all suits, claims and ac-

tions brought against such Stockholder, Director or officer, that may arise out
of or in connection with the activities of the above Company, except for kno-
wingly committed violations of law by such Stockholder, Director or officer.

19.2 The State Enterprise shall indemnify the Company against any liability
or damages which may arise from earlier environmental conditions. The
Company shall comply with published, readily accessible environmental regu-
lations and shall adopt operating methods which comply with environmental
aid safety standards.

Claimant's Position

Claimant, by reference to Chapter 20.10 of the Charter, argues all expenses
of the legal proceedings should be allocated to Claimant to the tune of
29.7%, with the remaining 70.3% to be allocated to the Respondents, i.e.
according to the respective percentages of the Parties interest in IAT Pulko-
vo.

"Claimant and Respondents expressly agreed in the Charter that founded IAT
Pulkovo that the ‘Company shalt bear alt expense of an arbitration brought’
pursuant to the Parties contractual agreements ..(ref omitted). Accordingly,
Claimant and Respondents are contractually obligated to pay 29.7% and
70.3%, respectively, of the expenses (including legal fees) of the Arbitral
Proceeding™.445

Claimant emphasizes that the reference to “alf expense of an arbitration” not
only covers the Tribunal costs and disbursements, but also the party costs,
including the legal fees incurred, which provision should take precedence
over Articles 38 and 40 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, which provide for
a discretion of the arbitral tribunal to require the unsuccessful party to pay
the adversaries’ legal costs.

More particularly, Claimant, in APP-CM-84 pages 26/27, argues that Section
20.10 should apply against Respondents who had acted in bad faith or com-
mitted gross negligence or willful misconduct, such that the Tribunal should
find that all arbitration costs are to be borne by Respondents. Claimant says
that

"the bad faith conduct of Respondents in this arbitral proceeding is well do-
cumented and has been a subject of various submissions by Claimant; Res-
pondents’ bad faith conduct includes: (a) intentional breach of contract; (b)
appointment of clearly biased arbitrators; (c) misrepresentation of the Rus-
sian law to the Tribunal; (d) misrepresentation of facts to the Tribunal and
(e) corporate shell game related to attempt to shield Respondents 4 and 5
from execution of an arbitral award."

Furthermore, Claimant refers to Respondents’ bad faith behavior by proceed-
ing to an illegal dissolution of IAT Pulkovo shortly after commencement of the
present Arbitration.

Section 20.10 of the Charter protects and shields Claimant from being pu-
nished with high costs of arbitration. Section 20.10 of the Charter forms part
of the arbitration clause and, as such, derogates the Tribunal’s authority un-
der Article 41 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.

In relation to Issue 52, Claimant mentions that in the English text the word
"stockholder" is omitted, whereas the Russian text contains a reference to
stockholders (shareholders), "making it abundantly clear that these arbitral
proceedings fall under provisions of Chapter 19."

In relation to Issue 53 regarding the yardsticks for measuring bad faith or

gross negligence, Claimant stated:

The yardstick is: (a) any conduct that aims exclusively to harm the other par-
ty in the litigation beyond the permissible conduct of a party to the litigation;
(b) any conduct not in accord with laws or applicable rules of international

law and (c) any conduct that aims to provide an unfair advantage to a party."

On these grounds, Claimant seeks a cost award against Respondents. In CM-
68, Claimant requested that the expenses including legal fees be
awarded/allocated between Claimant and Respondents in the ratio 29.7%
and 70.3%,

In Claimant's Cost Submission, dated 20 February 2012 (CM-&7 of 20 Febru-
ary 2012 and CX-265 and Exhibits 1-9), seeks recovery of US$ 2'829'688.98
(see further below),

Respondents’ Position

Respondents commented on the cost-issue in their Skeleton Brief of 13 Octo-
ber 2011 (1-RM-36/2-RM-42 pages 19/20), with further references.

First, Respondents are of the opinion that Section 20.10 of the Charter is
inapplicable, since it states that IAT Pulkovo {not the Parties) shall carry the
costs, while in the present arbitral proceedings [AT Pulkovo had not been a
party. For this reason, Section 20.10 altogether does not apply with the ef-
fect that the general principles must be applied: “The fosing party pays the
costs",

Second, even under the assumption that Section 20.10 should be applied,
Respondents argue that the reference to Chapter 19 is a misprint and the
correct wording should read: “in accordance with this Chapter 20".

Third, Respondents reject Claimant's assertion that Respondents acted in bad
faith, and (in respect of Issue 53), turn around and reproach that - not they
- but Claimant must be blamed for having acted in bad faith by filing this ar-
bitration,

Fourth, due to Claimant's bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct,
all costs should In any case be imposed on Claimant who committed an
“abuse of process”, inter alia because:

. the period of limitation has expired long time ago;
. the Claimant did not receive any rights under the Purchase Agreement;
° the Respondents are not the proper respondents in the case, and

. the Claimant obviously lost his right to be the investor in the end of
1998 - first half of 1999.

Finally, Respondents argue that Claimant's bad faith has caused, and contin-
ues to cause, much higher costs for the Respondents due to several actions
by Claimant, his

“4. endless challenges of the Arbitrators nominated by the Respondents, init-
lation of proceedings in Russia with respect to putting on hald the tender for
the Alternative Terminal, refusal to pay an advance to cover the costs of arbi-
tration, interim measures hearings etc."

Due to his bad faith, Claimant should bear all of the costs in these proceed-
ings.

The Tribunal's Determination

(a) Provisions of the Charter

The Arbitral Tribunal first has to reflect on the wording and meaning of Chap-
ter 20.10 of the Charter and its applicability in the framework of the present
Arbitration.

A first - rather obvious - question arises whether the reference in Chapter
20.10 to Chapter 19 is a typo (as Respondents assert), or whether the Par-
ties really intended to make reference to Chapter 19 which, essentially, deals
with liability suits,

Obviously, if this Tribunal had had the benefit to consider any earlier drafts
of the Charter, an answer could possibly be found therein, for instance if
Chapter 20 of the Charter, in an earlier draft, had been its Chapter 19, such
that - for the final version - the reference in Chapter 20.10 was not cor-
rected. Yet, as already discussed, no such materials were made available in
these proceedings.

If the reference to Chapter 19 indeed was a typo or a forgotten correction,
Chapter 20.10 of the Charter would generally apply to arbitral proceedings,
but only if - as per its terms - the Company (i.e. IAT Pulkovo) is a party.
Otherwise, Chapter 20.10 of the Charter cannot be applied, in any event not
as per its wording. An application to the present proceedings opposing Mr
Carl Sax and the former shareholders of IAT Pulkovo (but not [AT Pulkovo)
would indeed require a somehow creative stretch of Interpretation of Chapter
20.10 of the Charter which might be difficult to justify.

In the other alternative, i.e. in case the reference to Chapter 19 was not a
typo, or was not an overlooked correction which should have been done, but
was indeed what the Parties had intended to agree, then the Tribunal would
have to determine whether the present Arbitration could be considered to
constitute an arbitration under Chapter 19 of the Charter.

On reflection, the answer to this question is negative:

Chapter 19 appears to be a hold-harmless-clause, dealing with the indermnifi-
cation of directors and officers against suits, claims and actions brought
against them, or against stockholders etc., and it would seem difficult to jus-
tify that the present dispute would be covered by the probably narrower in-
tentions underlying Chapter 19 (although, to some extent, Claimant's claims
may have to do with an alleged liability of representatives of IAT Pulkovo
and/or its other shareholders).

However, as the following reasoning will show, the above questions can be
left open, due to the second part of Chapter 20,10 initiated by the words “...,
unfess there shall be a determination ...": As the above summary of the Par-
ties' arguments indicates, Claimant Mr Sax has referred to the “un/ess provi-

sions" by arguing misconduct by the Respondents and their bad faith, includ-
ing “intentional breach of conduct", which might be a typo and was intended
to read “intentiona/ breach of contract", appointment of biased arbitrators,
misrepresentations te the Tribunal of facts and law etc.

However, this Tribunal cannot share Claimant's view, as explained below af-
ter an introductory comment.

(b) Introductory Comment to the Tribunal’s Further Assessment:

It is a good - unscripted - practice of international arbitral tribunals that
the award to be written up by the Arbitrators should at all times be carefully
worded, moderate in its expression, polite, inoffensive and respectful, and
unnecessary criticism of persons involved, or of the Parties, should be
avoided. And parties engaged in international arbitration, for good reasons,
expect to be treated with courtesy, entire correctness and due respect even
though the arbitrators in the end might reach different views from those pre-
vented by the Parties.

In the present case, the decision on costs which the Tribunal is required to
make, urges or even forces the present Arbitrators to step out of the above
described attitude and to speak "clear text".

(c) The “Clear Text”

The “clear text", which the Tribunal necessarily must state for the cost decl-
sion it has to make, is the following:

It is the Tribunal's view that the filing of this Arbitration by Claimant was un-
reasonable.

It is the Tribunal's view, more particularly, that Claimant has presented an
untenable claim for reimbursement of predevelopment expenditures, due to
the simple fact that not one single document could be produced in this Arbi-
tration evidencing the slightest agreement of Respondents to reimburse such

expenditures which, indeed obviously, were incurred by the Foreign Parties
on their own initiative and at their own risk and peril,

The absence of any contractual or legal basis for Claimant's massive claim is
best evidenced by Mr Sax’ statement at the Stockholm Hearing when he
could argue nothing better for supporting his case than by saying, in respect
of the predevelopment expenditures; “/t could not be a gift”.

The same "verdict" must be stated in relation to Claimant's 4.5% developer
fee claim, in respect of which, again, Claimant was unable to present even
the slightest basis for such claim.

And again this Is best evidenced by Mr Sax' own staternents at the Stockholm
Hearing when, absent any proper contractual evidence, he simply referred to
the programmatic clause in the Founders’ Agreement contemplating the en-
tering into a development contract with the Foreign Parties and when, absent
any negotiated terms for such development contract, he only was able to as-
sert that “everybody knows what a development contract is", and everybody
knows that the developer earns a fee of 4.5%,

The Tribunal does not go too far in commenting that such a line of argumen-
tation could not be endorsed by any court nor any arbitral tribunal, wherever
the court or tribunal is established and whatever law applies.

For these two categories of claims, therefore, there was not even a shadow
of a valid contractual agreement, and above all, if there had been a contrac-
tual agreement, any and all claims - again obviously - were entirely time-
barred under a 3-year statute of limitations, and Claimant's arguments seek-
ing to bring his claims under Article 200.1 of the Russian Civil Code were -
once again obviously - entirely non-meritorious,

‘The most unhelpful claim, however, was Claimant's investor claim which, for
the reasons very clearly explained in this Award, had a zero chance of suc-
cass.

All of the above, furthermore, is connected to a basic misconception of the
Claimant regarding the fulfillment of the Foreign Parties primary obligation,
Le, the fulfillment of their promise to provide a financing commitment.

It is indeed inconceivable that the Foreign Parties could reasonably expect to
become 29.7% investors in such a project (which, according to Mr Sax' own
words, would have resulted in “more profits than ever earned by the Russian
Parties") if the Foreign Parties should fail to achieve to come up with an ac-
ceptable financing commitment.

In the latter regard, the strong stands taken by Claimant in these proceed-
ings that the EBRD financial proposal should have been acceptable to the
Russian Parties is indeed hardly comprehensible, since the EBRD proposal
was so far away from what the Foreign Parties and the Russian Parties had
bargained for in the Protocol of Agreement and the Founders’ Agreement.

Based on the foregoing, the Arbitral Tribunal must conclude that this entire
Arbitration was initiated by Claimant not in good faith, but indeed “frivolous-
we”

The Arbitrators, by the introductory remarks stated in Sub-title (b) above,
have indicated that they did not take it as a light decision to speak this "clear
text", and there is no intention whatsoever to be offensive to any of the Par-
ties.

Yet, this Tribunal in fact has a primary duty and mission, which is to render a
clear decision when the facts and the legal assessments are so clear as they
are in the present case.

After all, it also must be said: None of the elements discussed in this Award
and which had to be decided by this Arbitral Tribunal were of any complex

the practice in international arbitration - the “American rule” prevails, in the sense that

been brought against good faith or even "frivofousty".

nature, and the legal assessment is not derived from any "enigmatic" legal
texts or articles of legislations, but based on the most simple and most ob-
vious legal and contractual notions which apply under Russian law, under in-
ternational law, under US law or indeed whatever educated legal system.

This must have been known to Claimant Mr Sax, as a most experienced law-
yer, and the present Award can not come as a surprise to him.

quences of this Arbitration resulting from the above assessment.

The Notion that “thre Costs Follow the Event”

According to Article 38 of the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the Arbitral
Tribunal has to fix the costs of arbitration in its Award.

The term “costs” is defined therein and include the fees of the Arbitral Tri-
bunal (stated separately as to each Arbitrator and to be fixed by the Tribunal
itself in accordance with Article 39), the travel and other expenses incurred
by the Arbitrators, the costs of expert advice and of other assistance required
by the Arbitral Tribunal, the travel and other expenses of witnesses (to the
extent approved by the Arbitral Tribunal), the costs of legal representation
and e of the successful party if d during the proceed and
to the extent that such costs are reasonable, and the fees and expenses of

 

any appointing authority.

According to Article 40 of the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the costs of
arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party, However,
the Arbitral Tribunal has the authority to apportion the costs between the
Parties if deemed reasonable.

The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, therefore, reflect the general notion prevail-
ing In international arbitration known as “the casts fallow the event”, abbre-
viated "CFE"*® - sometimes simply paraphrased with the words: “the foser

pays!". Again, one may add that this notion may be CHARACTERIZED as an al-
most universal notion in international arbitration."*?

798 Applying this standard to the present case, the Tribunal will have to award
that:

. all Tribunal costs shall have to be borne by Claimant, and to the extent
that these had been advanced by Respondents, Claimant will have to
reimburse those advances to Respondents;

. all party costs incurred by Claimant must be borne by Claimant himself,
and no reimbursement is due in respect of any such costs by the Res-
pondents;

° all of Respondents’ reasonable costs incurred In this Arbitration, includ-
ing reasonable legal fees, are to be reimbursed to Respondents by
Claimant.

II Deposits Paid to the Tribunal's Account, and Tribunal Costs

799 The Tribunal costs and disbursements were secured by deposits paid by the
Parties as follows:

. Payment by DLA Piper on behalf of Respondents 1 and 2,
credited 7 May 2009 EUR 250'000

° Payment by Mr Vladimir Geryunov on behalf of Mr Sax,

 

(with an analysis of 100 investment cases decided}; Noah Rupins, The Allocation of Costs
and Attorney's Fees in Investor-State Arbitration, (2003) FILJ, 109 ss..

19 The Tribunal, of course, is aware that this notion - as described - was not as such 4
guiding notion in the United States, as far as US domestic arbitration and US State Court
Litigation is concerned, and where, generally, even a successful party has to bear its own
costs of litigation, unless the claimant's claims had been initiated against good faith or
frivolously.

The total Tribunal costs (including fees and all costs/disbursements), there-
fore, amount to EUR 700'000.--, thereby absorbing the entire deposits
made by the Parties, paid in the same amount of EUR 700'000.--.

III The Final Allocation of the Tribunal Costs to the Parties
(a) Allocation

802 As a consequence of the fact that Claimant entirely loses in respect of all of
his claims, the Tribunal determines that 100% of the Tribunal Costs are to be
borne by Claimant Mr Cari A Sax.

803 Since Respondents have paid deposits in the total amount of EUR 350'000,
Claimant Mr Sax has to reimburse the amount of EUR 350'°000 to Respon-
dents 1 and 2.

804 Such payment is to be made to the account as will have to be indicated by
Respondents’ counsel of record, i.e. Professor Oleg Skvortsov and/or Leonid
Kropotov.

805 At the telephone conference of 7 February 2012, it was discussed that - in
principle - the reimbursement for costs becomes due and payable imme-
diately upon notification of the Award (a principle which was particularly
stressed by Claimant's counsel Mr Durkovic). However, the Tribunal indicated
at the telephone conference that it would rather be minded to grant a grace
period of 30 days for effectuating such payment, such that interest on any
unpaid amount would only start to accumulate as from the 31° day onwards,
until a full payment has been made,

806 ‘The Tribunal finds it reasonable to grant such grace period to Claimant, such
that the reimbursement shall have to be made within 30 days from the elec-
tronic notification of the present Award in PDF-format. The PDF will be fol-
lowed up by hard-copy originals of this Award, dispatched by courier service

to the counsel of record of Mr Sax and Respondents land 2, and to Respon-
dents 4 and 5.

After the lapse of 30 days, if unpaid, interest will become due and payable on
the arnount of EUR 350'0C0.— up to the day of full payment.

(b) General Remarks Regarding Post-Award Interest

In most arbitration proceedings, little to nothing is argued by the Parties, or
determined by arbitral tribunals, as to the post-award-phase of the dispute,
possibly on the expectation that, in any event, the determinations as made
by the Arbitral Tribunal will be fulfilled by the Parties without any further
complications, However, the latter is not always the case and, in a post-
award-phase, the most typical/frequent issue which is likely to arise Is the is-
sue of post-award-interest payable by one party to the other for the reim-
bursement of costs. Quite often times, such post-award-discussions have led
to further significant costs in the framework of enforcement proceedings.

Matters of interest rates are often times connected to the financial market for
the respective currency, rather than to a particular /ex causae (meaning the
law applicable to the substance). Indeed, an unpaid creditor will suffer a
damage which is best measured according to the cost for borrowing the sum
at the relevant market for the currency at the commonly used commercial
rates for the particular currency!”

awarded interest an the USD amount at the 3-month LIBOR rate plus 1%. On the other
hand, the application of statutory rates of interest, such as the rate of the lex causae,
might be totally unfair (indeed, some of them have underlying policy reasons for encour-
aging prompt payments by debtors etc. which find no justification in international arbitra-
tion), See further Article 7.4.9{2) of the 2004 UNIDROIT Principles of International Com-
mercial Contracts, referred to below in this Award; see also the Ove Lanpo - Principles in

For instance, the 2004 UNIDROIT Principles provide as follows:

Article 7.4.9 (Interest for failure to pay money)

(1) Ifa party does not pay a sum of maney when it falls due to the aggrieved party
is entitled to interest upon that. sum from the time when payment is due to the
time of payment whether or not the non-payment is excused.

(2) The rate of interest shall be the average bank short-term lending rate to prime
borrowers prevailing for the currency of payment at the place for payment, or
where no such rate exists at that place, then the same rate in the State of the
currency of payment. In the absence of such a rate at cither place the rate of
interest shail be the appropriate rate fixed by the law of the State of the cur-
rency of payment.

(3) The aggrieved party is entitled to additional damages if the non-payment
caused it a greater harm.

Certainly, the average bank short-term lending rate to prime borrowers of
the currency in question at the place for payment |s a frequently used formu-
la in international arbitration. The fall-back provision in the UNIDROIT Prin-
ciples suggests to look at the appropriate rate fixed by the law of the State of
the currency of payment, which in the present case will be the USA and the
EU.

Moreover, frequently, the LIBOR rate for US$¢-denominated payments (or the
Euribor for payments in EUR) is taken as a basis, plus one to several per-
cents as a mark-up so as to reflect the lending rate which could be obtained
by a prime non-banking borrower.

(c} Positions of the Parties

Claimant, in CM-87, has researched quite in detail the possibilities for him to
obtain refinancing in case he would become the award-creditor, recalling that

"the purpose of post-award interest is twofold: (a) to compensate the win-
ning party for lost use of tha money during a default period, and (b) to incen-
tivise the losing party to pay the award." 153

Claimant went on to describe quotations he had received from certain per-
sonal loan lending clubs, offering interest rates between 6.78% to 27.99%
p.a., the Wells Fargo Bank offering 21.58% p.a., both on Dollars, and refer-
ring to some rates offered by Banca FINNAT in Milan with rates of 5,5-7%
p.a. on EUR, or an EURIBOR rate of 1 month 1.07% or 3 months 1.37% plus
350/450 basis points subject to net worth, yet with the comment that unse-
cured loans are not available in Italy today. The same, as Claimant's counsel
writes “is undoubtedly true in the United States as well",'"*

Claimant further referred to the statutory post-judgment interest rate in the
State of Florida, as of 1 January 2012 is the statutory rate of 4.75% p.a. Fur-
ther, Claimant quotes the Directive 2011/7/EU of the European Parliament
and of the Council of 16 February 2011 at Article 2 (6) which look at the ref-
erence rate of the respective Central Bank, currently 1% p.a., “plus at least
8%", Thus, Claimant states:

“The annual interest rate for post-judgment interest under the European Un-
ion Directive is at Icast 9% p.a.".1%

Claimant also refers to the writings of Irmgard Marboe, Calculation of Com-
pensation and Damage in International Investment Law, where it is stated
that

"the higher interest rate is, as 3 matter of principle, in line with the specific
function of post-award interest, mainly preserve as an effective incentive to
comply with the terms of the judgment or award as expediently as possible,

It will also serve to ensure the effectiveness of international jurisprudence
and enhance legal certainty ..."2**

Further references of Claimant refer to the compounding of interest, with a
reference to the CMS v/Argentina Decision in which a differentiation of simple
and compound Interest was made, with the first 60 days after the date of the
Award to carry simple interest and thereafter compounded annual interest at
the arithmetic average of the G months US Treasury Bills’ rate.

However, the market may also be the home-market of the party in question,
ie. in the present case, the financial market in Russia, with its prevailing
conditions for refinancing in US Dollars. As the relevant market is situated
within the territory of the applicability of the fex causae, it may be quite ap-
propriate to take guidance from Article 395 of the Russian CC. In this con-
text, Claimant argues:

“the appropriate measure of interest applicable where a party fails to pay a
monetary debt - including failure ta pay an arbitration award when due - is
the applicable rate of interest in the jurisdiction where the prevailing party
resides or is located. Post-award interest is governed by Articles 395 of the
Civil Code of the Russian Faderation.""*?

Article 395 of the Russian CC, as it was referred to by Claimant in CM-87,
reads as follaws:

Article 385 Russian Civil Code.
Responsibility for the Non-Discharge of the Pecuniary Obligation

1, For the use of the other person's moncy as a result of its illegal retention,
of the avoidance of its return or of another kind of delay in its payment, or as
@ result of its groundicss receipt ar saving at the cxpense of the other per-
son, the interest on the total amount of these means shall be due. The inter-
est rate shall be defined by the discount rate of the bank interest, existing by

the date of the discharge of the pecuniary obligation or of the corresponding
part theroof at the place of the creditor's residence, and if the creditor is a
legal entity - at the place of its location. If the debt is exacted through the
court, the court may satisfy the creditor's claim, proceeding from the dis-

Respondents have not detailed i regarding post rd
interest in the case the Tribunal’s determination would result In an award in

 

Respondents’ favor, with the consequence that the Respondents will not be
the debtors but, in the opposite, will be the creditors as regards the recovery
of casts. However, Respondents, commenting on Claimant's interest claim,
nevertheless mentioned that an application of the LIBOR for 3-months depo-
sits “as a rate which would not depend on the winning party” would be ap-
propriate.

{c) The Tribunal’s Determination

As matters of interest in the post-award-phase may give rise to further ar-
guments between the parties, this Tribunal, already in the Stockholm Hear-
ings, had decided to raise and discuss the issue with the Parties, basically in-
viting them to agree on the common ground as to (i) whether or not there
should be a certaln grace period of, for instance, one month after a notifica-
tion of the award for making the payments as per the determination of this

Tribunal, as well as (ii) in respect of the interest rate to be applied, and
whether interest should be calculated on a simple or compounded basis.

The subsequent Cost Submissions of the Parties, however, did not result ina
common ground, and the issue was further debated orally between the Tri-
bunal and counsel to both sides at the occasion of the telephone conference
of 7 February 2012.

Claimant has depicted a wide horizon of references which might be consi-
dered by this Tribunal in case Claimant would finally become the Award-
creditor, and has concluded that monies which would become due to him
should carry a 21,58 % interest ticket, compounded on a monthly basis.

Respondents, in response to a query of the Tribunal - specifically addressed
in the Tribunal's 36" Order of 22 February 2012 - as to Respondents’ interest
claim in the case of a cost decision in favor of Respondents, did not indicate
actual rates for which the City of St. Petersburg may obtain financing on the
international financial markets, or may obtain financing from Russian banks
or under governmental loans which had been refinanced, or are to be refi-
nanced, on the International monetary markets, but indicated agreement to
apply the LIBOR rate for 3-month deposits (without indicating a percentage
mark-up). No submission as to the currently applicable rates for US$ and
EUR was made.

For the Tribunal, it seems clear that Respondents’ submission in the sense
that the LIBOR for 3-month deposits should be applied, may not provide
adequate remedy for actual refinancing costs, as the LIBOR for US Dollars as
well as for EURO are fluctuating well below one percent.

However, on the other hand, the Tribunal cannot go uitra petita, i.e. beyond
what had been requested by Respondents.

For this reason, the Tribunal determines that Respondents’ claim for the
reimbursement in the amount of EUR 350'000 shall carry interest at the LI-
BOR rate for 3-month deposits.

The rcimbursement to be made by Claimant is payable within 30 days from
the notification of this Award, as per the discussions as per the telephone
conference held on 7 February 2012, and the respective details of the Bank
account of Respondent 2 will have to be indicated by Respondents’ counsel of
record, |.e. DLA Piper, respectively Professor Oleg Skvortsov and/or Leonid
Kropotov.

Since both sides agreed to a grace period of 30 days after communication of
this Award, the interest starts to run as from the 31* day, until full payment.

Claimant’s Cost Claim, and Its Allocation

Claimant's cost submission (CM-87 of 20 February 2012, consisting of 67
pages),specified the costs for his representation in the present proceedings
in the total amount of US$ 2'829’688.98, consisting of the following major
items;

. Legal counsel costs (without success fee): US$ 1'851'804.88

. Experts fees and costs US$ 442'234,11

« Party expenses USS 535’649.99

. Total cost claim US$ 2'829’688.98

In support of the daim, all fee arrangements entered into between Mr Carl a
Sax and his legal advisors were filed, as exhibits to CX-265. The claim ap-
pears to be well documented.

However, as a consequence of the rule “the costs folfow the event”, Claimant
-— whose claims had to be rejected by this Tribunal in their entirety - will have

to bear his own costs to their full extent, without any recovery from the res-
ponding parties.

833 The question, debated at the telephone conference of 8 February 2012,
whether or not Mr Sax’ time and expenditures would be a recoverable item
under the present special circumstances, Is moot.

Vv Respondents’ Cost Claim, and Its Allocation

834 Respondents’ cost claim submitted on 20 February 2012 and the pertaining
schedule shows the following break-down of costs;

. |Legal counsel's fees “in fact incurred” US$ 2'171'114.65)
. Legal counsel's fees "billed within the agreed budget” US$ 1°117’901.06
. Legal counsel’s expenses US$ 58’098.37
. Experts’ fees US$ 95°767.32
° Experts’ expenses US$ 12/105,.79

. Total fees and costs {but without the “incurred costs"} US$ 1’283’872.54

835 The Tribunal has considered these cost claims and finds as follows:

« The Tribunal notes and understands that Respondents’ counsel’s
charges (i.e. the “incurred fees”) ~ according to the DLA Piper’s custo-
mary billing rates - represent almost the double amount as compared
to the budget agreed, respectively contracted for, with Respondents. “©?
Hence, the costs incurred by Respondents 1 and 2 are capped at the
amount of US$ 1'117’901.06, and it is dear that the Tribunal can only
consider the latter amount as a recoverable expense.

188 This understanding - upon a query by the Tribunal - was confirmed by Mr Leonid
Kropotovy, in his email dated 21 February 2012.

. Taking such latter figure, and given the magnitude, length and numer-
ous complications in the present proceedings, there can be no doubt
that the amount represents entirely reasonable attorneys’ fees.

. The legal counsel’s expenses are well documented and appear justified,
. The experts’ fees are likewise well documented and reasonable.*”°
. The experts’ expenses are equally well documented.

It is apparent that Respondents’ cost statement is significantly lower than
Claimant's cost statement.

The Tribunal finds It reasonable, having regard to
(i) the very extensive filings of Mr Sax,

{ii) the burdening of the proceedings with unsuccessful challenge proce-
dures,

(iii) the excessive documentary requests which had to be rejected, and

(iv) the equally non-meritorious requests for interim relief - all of which
created a very heavy burden for Respondents and their counsel -

to award, in favor Respondents, a full recovery of the costs, in the amount
of US$ 1'117'901.06, the reimbursement to be borne by Claimant Mr Carl
A Sax.

The Tribunal understands that Respondent 2 had financed the proceedings;
hence, the payment will have to be made to Respondent 2.

The reimbursement to be made by Claimant is payable within 30 days from
the notification of this Award, as per the discussions as per the telephone

1 The Tribunal notes that US# 6'136.31 of fecs were charged for preparing the first

Professor Sukhanov opinion RWS-5, but not for his second opinion (which the Tribunal di
not admit into the files). This seems to be very correct indeed.

Vv A Final Word of Thanks

841 The Tribunal owes words of thanks to all of the lega! counse! appearing in
these proceedings, for their very extensive work, and for the fine and friendly
cooperation between the two teams of lawyers, and their very fine coopera-
tion with the Arbitral Tribunal. This is very highly valued.

842 Moreover, thanks are owed to the legal experts who have done a very im-
pressive job in analyzing in depth the relevant aspects of the Russian Civil
Law, Corporate Law and the Russian Investment Law,

843 All of the Experts’ Opinions and the legal/statutory provisions referred to in
their Reports were carefully studied by the Arbitral Tribunal. The only reason
why these Opinions are not given more coverage In this Award is that - as
apparent in the reasoning above ~ practically none of those issues gained
any kind of relevance.

844 Notwithstanding the outcome of these proceedings, particular words of
thanks are also owed to Claimant Dr Carl A. Sax. He beyond doubt took
center-stage in the Hearings in Zurich and Stockholm, and with his impres-
sive entrepreneurial approach, his eloquence and his enthusiasm, he will re-
main unforgettable to all those who participated in these proceedings. --
Nevertheless, upon careful consideration of all relevant arguments, this Tri-
bunal had to deny all of his claims,

The T I's Note on Adv Per land's Sep: c

Advokat Per Runeland - while concurring with the decisions taken in the Holding
of this Award - has suggested some deletions or alterations in the reasoning of
the present Award, and has condensed his comments in a Separate Opinion.

Advokat Per Runeland's comments were carefuly considered by the other two
Arbitrators who - however - fully stand by the reasoning as stated in the
present Award, They do not deem it necessary to provide any further comments
in response to Advokat Runeland’s Separate Opinion, except for remarking that
the discussion on good or bad faith (paras. 778-792) was In fact inevitable due to
Claimant's assertion - throughout these proceedings - that not only IAT Pulko-
vo, but Respondents, are liable for all of the substantive claims as well as for the
cost claims. Consequently, both sides have addressed the issue of bad faith un-
der the terms of Chapter 20.10 of the Charter (see above paras. 754/755; paras.
764-767). For this reason, the Tribunal - as much as It would have preferred to
simply adopt Advokat Runeland's argument (endorsing Respondents’ argument
referred to In para, 262 above) - it was necessary for the Tribunal to assess ~ as
politely as possible - whether or not - under the standard |mposed by Chapter
20.10 of the Charter - this arbitration was brought in good faith. The decision
was carefully considered by the Tribunal and certainly not lightly taken.

The Arbitrators unanimously decide to make Advokat Runeland's Opinion known
to the Parties, by delivering it to the Parties as a separate attachment together
with the presant Award,

SEPARATE OPINION OF PER RUNELAND

in respect of the Final Arbitral Award issued in an UNICITRAL Arbitration between Dr. Carl A. Sax
and the City of St. Petersburg, the Property Management Cammittee of the City of St. Petersburg,
OJSC Aviation Company "Rossiya" and Open Joint Stock Company Airport "Pulkovo™.

1 Although ( have concurred in the dispositive decisians contained in Chapter W of the Award, | feel
obliged to leave on the record my dissent from certain parts of tho reasoning.

Zz 1 do not consider it part of my mandate as arbitrator to assess the performance of any person
appearing in the course of the proceedings with respect to, for instance, intelligence, enthusiasm
of eloquence, except as required for the evaluation of evidence. Consequently, | have not
contributed to any such assessment.

3 tn the course of this arbitration, a number of questions regarding facts and circumstances have
been raised by the Tribunal, rather than by either party. Examples may be found under paragraph
| Main Issues of Liability of tho 24th Order of 8 February 2011, which reflects the Chairman's
closing remarks at the end of the hearing that took place in December 2010. The Parties have nat
objected to such questions being raised by the Tribunal, but, in my opinion, it would have been
preferable not to deal in the Award with each and every one of the 49 questions emanating from
the Tribunal. | should have preferred to limit the Award to the dispute, its facts and circumstances,
as pleaded by the Parties.

4 | should have preferred to eliminate from the reasons those considerations which arise fram the
experience of the arbitrators and which have not been introduced and discussed by the Parties.
Limiting the Award in that respect would have made it shorter and the reasoning fess speculative,
| would especially have avoided the testing of hypotheses which have not been introduced by the
Parties.

& When concurring in the majority's decision on tho allocation of costs, 1 have not based my
conclusion on the arbitration having been brought by the Claimant in bad faith. | do not hold that
the Claimant has brought this arbitration in bad faith, and | object ta the numerous references, in
the adjudication of the claim, to the Claimant's professional background. The Claimant is not a
litigant in person but has been represented by experienced international counsel, some of whom
have made a personal investment in the outcome of the dispute by accupting to work on a
contingency foe basis, The fact that a claim is unsuccessful, and rejected in particularly strong
terms by the majority of an arbitral tribunal, does not in itself permit the conclusion that the claim
was not brought in good faith. In my opinion, there is every indication that the claim has been
supported by the opinions of experts and was brought in good faith.

6 The reason why the Ciaimant must bear the costs of arbitration, including the costs for legal
tepresentation of those Respondents that have taken part in the arbitration, is thal the Claimant's.
argument that the Respondents, as shareholders in [AT Pulkovo, shall be made responsible for
costs in proportion to their shareholding, must fail. This failure is basod on the simple facl, relied
on by the Respondents, that the relevant clause of the Charter of IAT Pulkovo, the Company,
commits only the Company which, as is undisputed, was liquidated in early 2008, shortly after the
instigation of this arbitration. The Company has not been represented in this arbitration. Its

1675'S 22932. /LIVE:71076175,1/PABR

shareholders are not liable for the debts of the Company and, consequently, the Claimant's
reliance on clause 20.10 is misplaced.
