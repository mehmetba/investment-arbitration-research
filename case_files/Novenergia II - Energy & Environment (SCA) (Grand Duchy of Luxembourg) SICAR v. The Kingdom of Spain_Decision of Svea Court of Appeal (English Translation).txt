Department 02

The Kingdom of Spain has again requested that the Court of Appeal shall
request a preliminary ruling and has, in addition to the questions already

detailed, suggested several additional questions to be referred to the CJEU.

Novenergia II - Energy & Environment (SCA), SICAR (Novenergia) has contested

this request.

In a submission received by the Court of Appeal on 11 March 2020, the European
Commission has informed the Court of its intention to — with the support of article
29.2 in the Council Regulation 2015/1589 of 13 July 2015 laying down detailed
tules for the application of Article 108 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the
European Union — to submit a written statement to the Court on its own initiative.
The Commission has also requested the Court of Appeal’s permission to give an

oral statement at upcoming oral proceedings in the case.

The Commission has requested that the Court of Appeal shall issue a deadline to

submit the written statement.

The Kingdom of Spain has welcomed a written statement and raises no objection to

the Commission’s request to give an oral statement at an upcoming main hearing.

Novenergia has opposed the Commission’s request and argued that there is no legal
basis for either a written or an oral statement with reference to, inter alia, that there

is no question concerning the application of State aid rules.

Subsequent to reporting the issue the Court of Appeal makes the following

DECISION (to be rendered on 2020-05-27)

1. The Court of Appeal rejects the request to obtain a preliminary ruling

from the CJEU.

2. The European Commission is provided opportunity to submit a written

statement on 1 August 2020 at the latest.

Reasons for the decision

On the basis of what has been submitted in the case so far, it is currently not

motivated to obtain a preliminary ruling from the CJEU.

The Commission’s right to give a written statement in a national court derives
directly from Article 29.2 in the Council Regulation 2015/1589 of 13 July 2015
laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 108 of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union and does not require any permission from the

court.

As regards the Commission’s request to give an oral statement at upcoming proceedings,
such a statement may closest be equated with an expert opinion (Cf. Government Bill
2003/04:80 p. 60 et seq.). Under such circumstances, an oral statement may only be
considered at a main hearing. The Court of Appeal is yet to determine if a main hearing shall
be held and therefore intends to consider the Commission’s request to give oral statement

after that the Court of Appeal has decided on the further steps in the proceedings.

The decision may not be appealed separately.
