Ill. SUMMARY OF THE PROCEDURAL HISTORY

A. The Institution of These ICSID Proceedings

5. This arbitration concerns a legal dispute between TCCA and Pakistan arising out of

TCCA's claimed investments in Pakistan. Claimant alleges that Pakistan violated the

Agreement between Australia and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan on the Promotion and

Protection of Investments, which was signed on 7 February 1998 and entered into force
on 14 October 1998 (the "Australia-Pakistan Treaty", the "Treaty" or the "BIT"),! by
its arbitrary and unlawful denial of a mining lease to Tethyan Copper Company Pakistan
(Private) Limited (“TCCP”), TCCA’s wholly-owned Pakistan subsidiary, and other
actions attributable to Pakistan that, according to Claimant, deprived TCCA of the value

of its investments. Such alleged actions include, in particular, developing and executing

a scheme to take over TCCA's Reko Dig project, denying the Mining Lease Application

in pursuit of that scheme and using TCCA's exploration and feasibility work product in

its own project, which allegedly amounted to a breach of the fair and equal treatment

obligation under Article 3(2), an expropriation of TCCA's investment without

compensation in violation of Article 7(1) and an impairment of TCCA's investment in

violation of Article 3(3) of the Treaty.

6. — Article 3 of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty provides, in relevant part:

"1. Each Party shall encourage and promote investments in its territory
by investors of the other Party and shall, in accordance with its laws
and investment policies applicable from time to time, admit
investments.

2. Each Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment in its own
territory to Investments."
7. Article 7(1) of the Treaty provides:

"Neither Party shall nationalise, expropriate or subject to measures
having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation
(hereinafter referred to as ‘expropriation’) the investments of investors
of the other Party unless the following conditions are complied with:

the expropriation is for a public purpose related to the internal needs
of that Party and under due process of law;

the expropriation is non-discriminatory; and

the expropriation is accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate
and effective compensation."

Article 3(3) of the Treaty provides:

"Each Party shall, subject to its laws, accord within its territory
protection and security to investments and shall not impair the
management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments."

On 28 November 2011, Claimant filed its Request for Arbitration with the Secretary-
General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”)
pursuant to Article 36 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes
between States and Nationals of Other States (“ICSID Convention”).” Article 36 of the
ICSID Convention provides:

"(1) Any Contracting State or any national of a Contracting State
wishing to institute arbitration proceedings shall address a request to
that effect in writing to the Secretary-General who shall send a copy of
the request to the other party.

(2) The request shall contain information concerning the issues in
dispute, the identity of the parties and their consent to arbitration in
accordance with the rules of procedure for the institution of
conciliation and arbitration proceedings.

(3) The Secretary-General shall register the request unless he finds, on

the basis of the information contained in the request, that the dispute is

manifestly outside the jurisdiction of the Centre. He shall forthwith

notify the parties of registration or refusal to register."
In its Request for Arbitration, Claimant referred to Article 13(3)(a) of the Australia-
Pakistan Treaty pursuant to which Pakistan agreed to "consent in writing to the
submission of the dispute to the Centre within thirty days" of receiving the Request for
Arbitration.?

On 12 January 2012, the Secretary-General of ICSID (“Secretary-General’”) registered
Claimant’s Request for Arbitration.

By letter dated 11 April 2012, Claimant elected the formula for the constitution of the
Tribunal provided under Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention (i.e., that the Tribunal
would consist of three arbitrators: one arbitrator to be appointed by each Party, and the
third, who would be the President of the Tribunal, to be appointed by agreement of the
Parties).

By letter dated 18 May 2012, Claimant informed the Secretary-General that it appointed
Mr. John Beechey, a British national, as an arbitrator pursuant to Article 37(2)(b) of the
ICSID Convention. Mr. Beechey accepted his appointment on | June 2012.

On 12 June 2012, Respondent appointed as arbitrator Rt. Hon. Lord Leonard Hoffmann,
a British national, who accepted his appointment on the following day.

In separate letters dated 9 July 2012, the Parties expressed their agreement to the
appointment of Professor Dr. Klaus Sachs, a German national, as the President of the
Tribunal. Prof. Sachs accepted his appointment as presiding arbitrator on 12 July 2012.

On 12 July 2012, the Tribunal was constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) of the
ICSID Convention.* Mrs. Mercedes Cordido-Freytes de Kurowski, ICSID Legal
Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary to the Tribunal.

On 23 July 2012, Respondent filed a proposal for disqualification of Mr. Beechey as an
arbitrator pursuant to Article 57 of the ICSID Convention (the “Disqualification
Proposal”). On the same date, the ICSID Secretariat (the “Secretariat”) informed the
Parties that, pursuant to Rule 9(6) of the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings
(ICSID Arbitration Rules”), the proceeding was suspended until a decision on the
Disqualification Proposal had been taken.

Also on 23 July 2012, Claimant filed a Request for Provisional Measures (the
“Provisional Measures Request”). The Secretariat informed the Parties that, in light of
the suspension of the proceedings, Claimant's submission would be sent to the Tribunal
once the proceedings resumed.

On 25 July 2012, Professor Dr. Klaus Sachs and Lord Hoffmann fixed a procedural
schedule concerning the Disqualification Proposal.

On 26 July 2012, Respondent supplemented its Disqualification Proposal.
On 31 July 2012, Claimant submitted a reply to the Disqualification Proposal.

On 3 August 2012, pursuant to Rule 9(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, Mr. Beechey
furnished explanations in response to the Disqualification Proposal.

Following consultation with the Parties, by letter of 7 August 2012, the Secretary of the
Tribunal on instructions of the President of the Tribunal, confirmed that a hearing on the
Disqualification Proposal would be held at the International Dispute Resolution Centre
(the “IDRC”) in London, on 8 September 2012.

On 31 August 2012, each Party filed observations to Mr. Beechey's explanations of 3
August 2012.

By letter dated 6 September 2012, Claimant informed the unchallenged Members of the
Tribunal that the Parties had jointly requested Mr. Beechey to resign from the Tribunal
and that he had complied with this request. By letter of the same date, Respondent
expressed its consent to Mr. Beechey’s resignation from the Tribunal. Respondent stated
that its consent was without prejudice to objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal,
which it might raise at a later stage of the proceedings.

By e-mail of the same date to the ICSID Secretariat copied to his co-arbitrators, Mr.
Beechey confirmed his resignation from the Tribunal.

By letter dated 7 September 2012, the unchallenged Members of the Tribunal informed
the Secretary-General of their consent to Mr. Beechey’s resignation. By letter of the same
date, the Secretariat informed the Parties thereof and invited Claimant to appoint an
arbitrator pursuant to Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention in order to fill the vacancy
resulting from Mr. Beechey’s resignation.

By letter of 7 September 2012, Claimant informed the Secretary-General that it appointed
Dr. Stanimir Alexandrov, a national of Bulgaria, as an arbitrator pursuant to Article
37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 11(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.
Attached to Claimant's letter was a letter from Respondent of 6 September 2012 providing
its advance consent to Dr. Alexandrov's appointment, subject to Dr. Alexandrov's formal
confirmation of the disclosure of his participation as counsel in two concluded cases.

On 10 September 2012, Dr. Alexandrov accepted his appointment and confirmed the
disclosure which he had previously made to Claimant.

By letter of the same date, the Secretariat informed the Parties of Dr. Alexandrov's
acceptance, and that the proceeding would resume pursuant to Rule 12 of the ICSID
Arbitration Rules from the point it had reached at the time the vacancy on the Tribunal
had occurred. The Secretariat provided the reconstituted Tribunal with Claimant’s
Provisional Measures Request dated 23 July 2012 (“Provisional Measures Request”),
including supporting documents as well as the Witness Statements of Messrs. Timothy
Livesey and Robert Kremarov. In its Provisional Measures Request, Claimant requested
that the status quo be preserved during the pendency of the arbitration. Specifically, it
requested that Respondent and Balochistan refrain from (i) further developing; or (ii)
disposing of, the Reko Diq Mining Area; (iii) breaching the confidentiality provisions of
Claimant's Feasibility Study; and (iv) infringing Claimant's exclusive surface rights. In
addition, Claimant requested that Respondent and Balochistan issue any authorization
required to allow Claimant's expatriate staff to work in, and travel to Pakistan.

The Initiation of the ICC Proceedings

Prior to the initiation of these proceedings, Claimant filed a Request for Arbitration
against the Province of Balochistan, Pakistan, with the International Chamber of
Commerce, which was registered on 28 November 2011 and assigned the number ICC
Case 18347/VRO/AGF (“ICC Proceedings”). Claimant's claims in the ICC Proceedings
arise out of Claimant's alleged right to a mining lease under Article 11.8.2 of the Chagai
Hills Exploration Joint Venture Agreement dated 29 July 1993 between the Balochistan
Development Authority and BHP Minerals International Exploration Inc. ("CHEJVA")
and Rule 48(1)(b) of the 2002 Balochistan Mining Rules. Claimant claims Respondent
has breached the CHEJVA and the 2002 Balochistan Mining Rules by denying its
application for a mining lease.

Claimant submitted the dispute to arbitration pursuant to Clause 15.4 of the CHEJVA
which provided that “any dispute” which the parties failed to resolve amicably or through
voluntary expert conciliation “shall be submitted” to international arbitration before
ICSID or, in the event that ICSID does “not accept jurisdiction” or “reject[s] the
arbitration request,” to arbitration under the ICC Rules.>

On 23 July 2013, the ICC Tribunal, in response to TCCA's request dated 10 May 2013,
issued its ruling on bifurcation, ruling that the Government's objections as to jurisdiction
and admissibility be joined to the merits and that the validity and binding nature of the
CHEJVA should be decided in advance of the main allegations regarding breach of the
CHEJVA. The ICC Tribunal issued its Rulings on Preliminary Issues on 23 October 2014
("ICC Rulings on Preliminary Issues").° These rulings will be referred to later in this
Award.

Thus, Claimant is currently conducting parallel and independent arbitration proceedings,
with the ICC Tribunal deciding Claimant's contractual claims under the CHEJVA and
this ICSID Arbitral Tribunal deciding Claimant's treaty claims under the Australia-
Pakistan Treaty.

arbitration proceedings against Pakistan and Balochistan before the International Centre for the Settlement of

Investment Disputes

 

"ICSID") pursuant to clause 15.4.8 of the CHEJVA. By notice dated 7 December 2011, the

ICSID Secretary-General informed the Parties that ICSID lacked jurisdiction over the dispute with Balochistan
because Pakistan had neither designated Balochistan as a constituent subdivision, nor approved Balochistan's
consent to ICSID arbitration, nor informed ICSID that such approval was not required.

The ICSID Arbitral Proceedings

The Pre-Hearing Phase

By letter dated 14 September 2012, the Secretariat, on behalf of the Tribunal, confirmed
that the First Session pursuant to Rule 13(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules ("First
Session") and the hearing on the Provisional Measures Request (the “Provisional
Measures Hearing”) would be held at the IDRC in London on 6 November 2012.

Under cover of a letter dated 1 October 2012, Respondent submitted, without prejudice
to its jurisdictional objections, its Response to Claimant’s Request for Provisional
Measures ("Provisional Measures Response") with supporting documents as well as the
Witness Statement of Dr. Samar Mubarakmand and its annexes. In its Provisional
Measures Response, Respondent informed the Tribunal about its plans to develop the
deposit H4 (the "H4 Work Plan") and noted that the GOB had no present intention to
exploit the area beyond H4. It therefore requested that the Provisional Measures Request
be dismissed with costs awarded in Respondent's favor.

On 15 October 2012, Claimant submitted its Reply on Provisional Measures
(“Provisional Measures Reply”), with supporting documents as well as the Second
Witness Statement of Mr. Livesey. In the Reply, Claimant renewed its request that, given
the imminent nature of the harm anticipated by Claimant, the Tribunal immediately grant
the requested provisional measures as a temporary restraint pending disposition of the
Provisional Measures Request.

By letter dated 18 October 2012, the Secretariat informed the Parties of the Tribunal’s
decision that the Tribunal would not decide on the requested relief before having received
Respondent’s Provisional Measures Rejoinder and having heard both Parties' arguments
at the oral hearing.

Under cover of a letter dated 29 October 2012, Respondent submitted the Rejoinder (titled
“Respondent’s Answer to the Claimant’s Reply”) (“Provisional Measures Rejoinder’”),
together with supporting documents.

By letter dated 31 October 2012, the Secretariat, on behalf of the Tribunal, requested that
Respondent inform the Tribunal and Counsel for Claimant whether Respondent intended
to cross-examine Messrs. Livesey and Krcmarov during the Provisional Measures
Hearing. By letter of the same date, Respondent confirmed that it did not intend to do so.

The Tribunal held the First Session with the Parties on 6 November 2012. The Parties
confirmed that the Members of the Tribunal had been validly appointed. It was agreed,
inter alia, that the applicable ICSID Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10
April 2006, and that the procedural language would be English. The Parties were unable

to reach an agreement on the place of the proceedings. Having heard the Parties on this
matter, the Tribunal decided that Washington, D.C. would be the place of the proceeding
and that, unless otherwise agreed, the hearings would be held at the World Bank
Conference Centre in Paris. During the First Session, the Parties and the Tribunal also
discussed the other items on the Draft Agenda and Procedural Order previously circulated
by the Secretary of the Tribunal, the Parties' agreements and their respective positions
regarding the items on which they did not agree and agreed on a procedural timetable. At
the proposal of the Tribunal, the Parties agreed to the appointment of Dr. Tilman
Niedermaier as Assistant to the Tribunal.

The Provisional Measures Hearing was held at the IDRC on 6 November 2012, following
the First Session. In addition to the Members of the Tribunal, the Assistant and the
Secretary of the Tribunal, present at the hearing were (i) For Claimant: Mr. Donald
Francis Donovan, Dr. Dietmar W. Prager, Ms. Natalie L. Reid, Mr. Matthew H. Getz,

of the Government of Balochistan; and Dr. Samar Mubarakmand, Fact Witness of the
Respondent. During this Hearing, the Tribunal heard oral arguments from each of the
Parties on this matter and Respondent’s witness Dr. Mubarakmand was cross-examined.

Under cover of a letter dated 13 November 2012, Claimant submitted the Third Witness
Statement of Mr. Livesey.

On 19 November 2012, Respondent submitted its comments on the Third Witness
Statement of Mr. Livesey.

By email of 27 November 2012, Respondent proposed to amend the procedural time table
discussed during the First Session in view of an expected judgment of the Pakistani
Supreme Court on the validity of the Chagai Hills Exploration Joint Venture Agreement
dated 29 July 1993 between the Balochistan Development Authority and BHP Minerals

By letter dated 28 November 2012, Claimant, upon direction by the Tribunal, stated its
position on a cross-undertaking and security in the event that the Tribunal was inclined
to grant Claimant's Provisional Measure Request.

By letter dated 30 November 2012, Respondent replied to Claimant’s letter dated 28
November 2012.

By letter of the same date, Claimant responded to Respondent’s email of 27 November
2012 and requested that the Tribunal should “decide in a first phase of the arbitral
proceedings on (i) any jurisdictional objections raised by Respondent, (ii) the claim that
Respondent breached the Australia-Pakistan Treaty; and (iii) Claimant’s request for
specific performance as a remedy to the breach of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty, if any.”

By letter dated 1 December 2012, Respondent commented on Claimant’s letter dated 30
November 2012.

By letter dated 3 December 2012, the Secretariat informed the Parties that the Tribunal
had noted the Parties’ respective positions in respect of the timetable and, for the time
being, did not consider a decision to be required.

On 13 December 2012, the Tribunal issued its Decision on the Provisional Measures
Request. In its Decision, the Tribunal ordered Respondent to "immediately inform the
Tribunal and Claimant of any change of its intention (i) to implement the H4 Work Plan,
(ii) not to expand its mining activities to H14 and/or H15 or to any other deposit within
License EL-5 and (iii) not to give any rights in this regard to any third party." The
Tribunal further ordered Respondent to "inform the Tribunal and Claimant, on a regular
basis, about its specific plans and activities with respect to deposit H4." Finally, the
Tribunal stated that it remained seized of the matter and would consider further
applications by Claimant if the situation materially changed.

Under cover of a letter dated 18 December 2012, the Secretariat provided the Parties with
a letter of Co-Arbitrator Dr. Alexandrov of the same date, in which Dr. Alexandrov
informed the Parties that the international arbitration practice of his firm Sidley Austin
LLP had been asked to serve as counsel in an arbitration in which Mr. David A.R.
Williams also served as counsel and that he was part of the counsel team. In a letter dated
20 April 2012, Respondent had raised concerns regarding the proposed nomination of
Mr. Williams as an arbitrator in the instant case due to his role in said arbitration.

Under cover of a letter dated 21 December 2012, the Secretariat provided the Parties with
Procedural Order No. | issued by the Tribunal on 3 December 2012. Procedural Order
No. | had been prepared on the basis of the Parties’ respective comments, reflects the
Parties’ agreements and the Tribunal's decision during the First Session and, inter alia,
sets out the procedural timetable.

By letter of the same date, Claimant applied for an extension of time for the submission
of its Memorial on the Merits from 25 January to 1 February 2013.

Upon invitation by the Tribunal to comment on Claimant’s application, Respondent
informed the Tribunal by letter dated 27 December 2012 that the Pakistani Supreme Court
had yet not rendered its decision on the validity of the CHEJVA and that Respondent
therefore was not in a position to comment on Claimant’s application. The Tribunal
extended the time limit for comments on Claimant’s application until 14 January 2013.

By letter dated 6 January 2013, Claimant renewed its application for a one-week
extension of the time limit for the submission of its Memorial on the Merits.

On 7 January 2013, the Tribunal granted an extension of the time limit for the filing of
Claimant's Memorial on the Merits from 25 January to 1 February 2013, noting that
Respondent's right to submit a request for amendment of the procedural timetable,
following the Pakistani Supreme Court's order/judgment, remained unaffected.

Under cover of a letter of the same date, Respondent filed a short order of the Pakistani
Supreme Court, by which the Court had held the CHEJVA to be void, illegal and non est.
In its letter, Respondent announced that it would submit a brief in respect of the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction within two weeks after the release of the detailed judgment of the Pakistani
Supreme Court and made a proposal for a schedule for a one-day hearing on jurisdiction.

By letter dated 14 January 2013, Claimant commented on Respondent’s letter dated 7
January 2013, objected to Respondent's proposal to hold a one-day hearing on jurisdiction
and requested that the procedural calendar in place be confirmed.

By letter of 16 January 2013, the Tribunal noted that the procedural timetable in place did
not provide for a separate hearing on jurisdiction. It indicated that, before Respondent
filed any submissions on jurisdiction, which were not provided for in the procedural
timetable, Respondent would be required to file a reasoned application for its amendment,
Claimant would be afforded the opportunity to comment, and the Tribunal would then
decide whether it would amend the procedural schedule. Until then, the agreed procedural
schedule set out in Procedural Order No. 1 would remain the same.

On 1 February 2013, Claimant filed its Memorial on the Merits (the "Memorial"),
together with supporting documents as well as the Witness Statement of Ms. Catherine
Boggs and the Fourth Witness Statement of Mr. Livesey.

By letter dated 5 March 2013, Respondent informed the Tribunal that its lead counsel,
Mr. Arthur Mariott QC, had fallen severely ill and therefore requested an extension of six
weeks for submitting its Memorial on Defence and Counterclaim.

Upon invitation by the Tribunal, Claimant commented by letter dated 11 March 2013 on
Respondent’s request for an extension of time. Claimant refused to agree to an extension
of six weeks and instead invited Respondent to agree on a timetable which would allow
the procedural timetable to be upheld.

By letter of 12 March 2013, enclosing a letter from the arbitral tribunal in the parallel ICC
Proceedings, Respondent reiterated its request for a six-week extension.

Upon invitation by the Tribunal to comment on Respondent’s letter dated 12 March 2013,
Claimant, by letter dated 18 March 2013, informed the Tribunal that it would agree to
move the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability to the period between 20 January and 21
February 2014 and that, if the Hearing could not then be held, it would maintain its
original position.

By letter of the same date, Claimant informed the Tribunal that it had appointed Mr.
Mansoor H. Khan of Khan & Associates as co-counsel.

By letters of 28 March 2013 respectively, the Parties confirmed that they would be

Parties in the Minutes of the First Session and the Pre-Hearing Organizational Meeting:
Mr. Ahmed Baksh Lehri, Former Chief Secretary, Balochistan and Member, Federal
Public Service Commission, Pakistan; Mr. Amanullah Kanrani, ASC, Former Advocate
General, Balochistan; Mr. Irshad Khokhar, Former DG, Ministry of Petroleum & Natural
Resources, Pakistan; Mr. Babar Yaqoob Fateh Muhammad, Former Chief Secretary,
Balochistan, Secretary Communication, Pakistan; and Dr. Samar Mubarakmand (NI),
(AD, (SI), Former Member Planning Commission, Pakistan.

By letter dated 7 October 2014, Claimant reiterated its requests of 27 and 28 September
2014 insofar as they had been denied by the Tribunal on 2 October 2014.

By letter dated 8 October 2014, Respondent opposed Claimant's requests of 7 October
2014 and requested that the Tribunal refuse Claimant's invitation to reverse in these
respects its decision of 2 October 2014.

On 10 October 2014, the Tribunal decided on Claimant's requests of 7 October 2014.

During the course of the Hearing, by letter dated 12 October 2014, Claimant informed the
Tribunal that it would not cross-examine Respondent's witness Mr. Yaqoob Fateh
Muhammad and had so informed counsel for Respondent; requested leave to submit a
new exhibit, Respondent's National Mineral Policy 2013 ("2013 NMP") as Exhibit CE-
416; and also requested leave to submit four new legal authorities, two cases from the
Pakistan Supreme Court and two decisions of other Pakistan courts, all of which had
already been submitted as authorities in the ICC Arbitration, as Exhibits CA-172 through
CA-175.

By letter dated 12 October 2014, Respondent proposed to produce Mr. Yaqoob Fateh
Muhammad, as he had already arrived in Paris before Claimant determined that it would
not cross-examine him, to give a brief oral testimony regarding his statement and to
answer any questions the Tribunal might have. In addition, Respondent opposed
Claimant's request to submit proposed Exhibit CE-416 and proposed Exhibits CA-172
through CA-175 on the grounds that, contrary to agreed agenda paragraph 11.A of the
Pre-Hearing Conference Call, Claimant did not approach Respondent to inquire whether
it would agree to the submission of the proposed new exhibits and there were no
exceptional circumstances that justified the admission of these new exhibits.

On 13 October 2014, at the Hearing, the Tribunal responded to Claimant's application
and Respondent's response as follows:

(i) the Tribunal accepted Respondent's proposal to produce Mr. Yaqoob Fateh
Muhammad to give brief oral testimony at the Hearing to affirm his statement and
answer questions posed by Respondent; it being understood that Claimant was free
to cross-examine Mr. Yaqoob thereafter; and

Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability
ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1

(ii) the Tribunal accepted the 2013 NMP and the four legal authorities as new
documents, it being understood that Claimant would not be permitted to use them
in the cross-examination and that both Parties would be given an opportunity to
comment on their relevance, if any, in the further proceedings, i.e., the oral closing
arguments or the post-hearing briefs.”

169. By letter dated 17 October 2014, Respondent requested the Tribunal's consent for it to
refer to two cases shown on Slide 94 without having to submit those authorities in this
arbitration and to submit two new legal authorities and three new exhibits for use in its
closing submissions.

170. At the Hearing, the Tribunal admitted the use of Slide 94 in Respondent's Closing
Submission, reserving its right to reject these references after having considered the
application; however, the Tribunal requested that Respondent not refer in its oral closing
argument to the two new legal authorities mentioned on page two of its letter or the three
new exhibits mentioned there, noting that the Tribunal would make a decision on whether
to admit them into the record.'° Further, the Tribunal admitted Annex 4 to the record.

3. The Post-Hearing Phase

171. By letter dated 23 October 2014, the Tribunal invited the Parties to comment on the results
of the Hearing and, in particular, address the following issues/documents:

"1. The Rulings on Preliminary Issues rendered by the ICC tribunal on
21 October 2014 and the relevance of this decision for this case, if any;
2. The admission requirement in Article I(1)(a) of the Treaty and
whether the admission of an investment may be retrospectively affected
by an event such as the Supreme Court judgment of 7 January 2013,
taking into account the particular language used in Article 1(1)(a) of
the Treaty;
3. Claimant: Clarification of its relief sought, in particular regarding
the alleged FET breaches, i.e., whether it claims that Respondent's
"other measures against TCCA's investments" (Reply on Liability, para.
505 (b)) amount to independent breaches of the FET standard in Article
3(2) of the Treaty or whether it regards them as cumulatively amounting
to an FET breach;
4. The 2007 EL-5 Quarterly Report appended to the second EL-5
renewal application (at appendix 4) and its relevance in the context of
the second renewal of EL-5;
5. The new authorities and exhibits that were admitted into the record:

b. in the course of the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability; and
c. if and insofar as they will be admitted, the new authorities
and/or exhibits proposed by Respondent in its letter of 17 October
2014; and
6. Any other issues on which the Parties wish to elaborate in relation to
arguments that were raised by the other Party in its closing argument
or by the Tribunal at some point during the Hearing."

In addition, the Tribunal requested the Parties to limit their Post-Hearing Briefs to a
maximum of fifty pages and to inform the Tribunal of their agreement on the deadline for
the submission of the Post-Hearing Briefs, providing that if the Parties were unable to
reach agreement within ten days of the notification of the letter, the Tribunal would set
an appropriate time limit.

By letter dated 27 October 2014, Claimant:

(i) _ objected to Respondent's references to the legal authorities shown on Slide 94 of its
closing presentation and requested the Tribunal to disregard these references;

(ii) stated that it had no objection to admission of Respondent's additional legal
authorities, as long as Claimant was permitted to submit four additional authorities
in support of its arguments made in response to those authorities as part of its Post-
Hearing Brief;

(iii) stated that it had no objection to Respondent's proposed additional exhibits; and

(iv) in response to the Tribunal's inquiry in the course of the Hearing about the "2007
EL-5 Quarterly Report" cited in paragraph 3.23 of TCCP's Interim Response to the
Notice of Intent to Reject (Exhibit CE-8), submitted three additional exhibits.

After reviewing the Parties' further comments, set forth in Claimant's letter of 3 November
2014 and Respondent's letter of 7 November 2014, and their positions regarding the
timing of their Post-Hearing Briefs, set forth in their respective letters dated 3 November
2014, the Tribunal directed the Parties by letter dated 10 November 2014 as follows:

(i) | The Parties' Post-Hearing Briefs shall be submitted simultaneously on 15 January
2015. There will not be a second submission of rebuttal Post-Hearing Briefs;

(ii) As suggested in its letter of 3 November 2014, Claimant shall clarify its position on
its requested relief in writing, by 18 November 2014;

(iii) Slide 94 of Respondent's Closing Presentation is admitted into the record;

(iv) Respondent may submit the two additional legal authorities identified in its letter
of 17 October 2014, and Claimant may submit the four additional legal authorities
identified in its letter of 27 October 2014, both with their Post-Hearing Briefs; and

(v) The three additional exhibits proposed by Respondent in its letter of 17 October
2014 and the three additional exhibits proposed by Claimant in its letter of 27
October 2014 are admitted into the record.

174. In response to a question from the Tribunal at the Hearing, by letter dated 18 November
2014, Claimant stated the relief it seeks for Respondent's breaches of the fair and
equitable treatment obligation imposed by Article 3(2), as follows:

"For purposes of the liability phase of the arbitration, TCCA seeks
separate and independent declarations that:

(i) _ the denial of the Mining Lease Application breached Article
3(2);

(ii) the development and implementation of the plan to take
over the Reko Dig project breached Article 3(2); and

 

(iii) in addition to each ituting independ iolati the
foregoing breaches, together and along with other
Government conduct with respect to TCCA’s investment—
including, to the extent necessary to prove a composite
breach, the Governments’ conduct in the Mineral
Agreement negotiations and/or in the Pakistan Supreme
Court proceedings—constitute an overall course of action
that is a composite breach of Article 3(2).

 

(iv) TCCA does not seek a separate and _ independent
declaration that Pakistan breached Article 3(2) through
either the Governments’ bad-faith conduct in the Mineral
Agreement negotiations, or the conduct of the Governments
and the Supreme Court in the domestic constitutional
proceedings.

This statement of the relief requested is subject to two reservations.

First, while TCCA seeks separate and independent declarations only
with respect to the breaches set forth in paragraphs (i), (ii), and (iii)
above, the Tribunal may consider any of the evidence presented by the
Parties and adduced in the hearing in determining whether the conduct
in question violated Pakistan’s obligation to accord fair and equitable
treatment to TCCA’s investment by way of the conduct set forth in those
paragraphs.

Second, should the Tribunal reach causation and damages, TCCA
reserves the right to present any arguments, and to seek any rulings,
with respect to the conduct of the Governments in the Mineral
Agreement negotiations or the conduct of the Governments and the

Supreme Court in the domestic constitutional proceedings to the extent

relevant to causation and damages."
On 15 January 2015, Claimant filed its Post-Hearing Brief, together with new Exhibits
CE-417 to CE-419, new Legal Authorities CA-176 to CA-179 and updated indices of
exhibits and authorities, and Respondent filed its Post-Hearing Brief.

On 2 March 2015, in response to a request from the Tribunal, the Parties filed their
respective Statements of Costs in connection with the proceedings as of such date.

Respondent's Request to Submit New Evidence and Application to Dismiss the
Claims

On 22 June 2015, the firm of Allen & Overy informed the Tribunal and ICSID that it had
been appointed as counsel to act in the guantum phase of the proceedings and for all other
matters going forwards and was in the process of finalizing the formal arrangements of
its instruction by obtaining a power of attorney. It requested that the Tribunal and ICSID
enter Allen & Overy LLP on the record as counsel for Pakistan in place of existing
counsel.

In addition, Allen & Overy informed the Tribunal that "cogent new evidence of corruption
on the part of TCC" had very recently been brought to their attention by Pakistan and it
would shortly write to the Tribunal with further details, together with a proposed
timetable for addressing this evidence.

Finally, Allen & Overy requested that the Tribunal "cease all efforts towards finalising
the award."

By letter dated 23 June 2015, Claimant objected to Pakistan's attempt to introduce new
evidence and objected even more strongly to Pakistan's request that the Tribunal depart
from its mandate and cease its efforts towards finalizing the award. Claimant requested
the Tribunal to reject Pakistan's request.

By e-mail of 26 June 2015, the Tribunal noted the Parties' positions and informed the
Parties that "[flor the time being, the Tribunal sees no reason to discontinue its still
ongoing deliberations on this case."

By letter dated 21 July 2015, Allen & Overy submitted a power of attorney dated 6 July
2015 authorizing it to represent the Government of Pakistan and further submitted, on
behalf of Respondent, five witness statements signed by Messrs. Shehbaz Mandokhail,
Abdul Aziz, Muhammad Tahir and Masood Malik and Sheikh Asmatullah. Respondent
requested the Tribunal to admit this new evidence into the record and to determine the
effect of this evidence and any related further evidence in accordance with an enclosed
procedural timetable.

By letter dated 29 July 2015, Respondent submitted the Urdu translations of the five
English language witness statements provided under cover of its 21 July 2015 letter.

By letter dated 11 August 2015, at the Tribunal's invitation, Claimant objected to
Respondent's request to admit new evidence as well as its request to initiate a new phase
of the proceedings to determine the effect of this evidence, claiming that Respondent had
not satisfied the requirements for the admission of late evidence, namely, that the
proferred evidence was unavailable earlier and that it would have a decisive impact on
the outcome of the case.

By letter dated 17 August 2015, Respondent commented on Claimant's objections and
claimed that it was entitled to adduce the new evidence because the proceedings were not
closed pursuant to Rule 38 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, and even if the Rule 38
standard applied, the evidence satisfied it because the evidence was new and it was
relevant and material to the outcome of the case. Respondent requested the Tribunal to
adopt the timetable proposed in its 21 July 2015 letter and to consider the new evidence
presented in that letter.

By e-mail of 19 August 2015, Claimant requested leave to respond to Respondent's letter
of 17 August 2015.

By email dated 20 August 2015, the Tribunal granted Respondent leave to file a full
submission in relation to its request by 2 September 2015 and granted Claimant the
opportunity to reply to Respondent's submission and Respondent's 17 August 2015 letter,
both by 7 October 2015.

By letter dated 25 August 2015, addressed to Respondent, with a copy to the Tribunal,
Claimant requested that Respondent provide certain information as to the circumstances
under which the witness statements that Respondent seeks to submit into evidence were
obtained. In addition, in light of the on-going inquiry being conducted by the National
Accountability Bureau (NAB) under the National Accountability Ordinance 1999 in
Pakistan, Claimant requested "unequivocal assurance that the confidentiality of its
communications, in the form of emails, phone calls, in-person conversations, or otherwise
between and among TCC's personnel and its lawyers, both within and without Pakistan
has been strictly respected, and that those communications have not been and will not be
interfered with, monitored, taped, or otherwise compromised."

By letter dated 28 August 2015, addressed to the Claimant, with a copy to the Tribunal,
Respondent stated that it would provide the relevant information together with its full
submission on 2 September 2015. As to Claimant's second request, Respondent stated
that in case Claimant should have an application to make in this regard, it should do so,

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1

absent such an application, its statement had no place in international arbitration
proceedings.

190. On 31 August 2015, Claimant filed a request that the Tribunal:

"I. Direct Pakistan to provide unequivocal assurances that the
confidentiality of its communications, in the form of emails, phone
calls, in-person conversations, or otherwise between and among
TCC's personnel and its lawyers, both within and without
Pakistan, has been strictly respected, and that those
communications have not been and will not be monitored,
recorded, interfered with, or otherwise compromised; and

2. If Pakistan continued to refuse such assurances, direct Pakistan
to identify when, how, and which communications between and
among TCC's personnel and its attorneys, both within and
without Pakistan, have been monitored, recorded, intercepted, or
otherwise compromised."
191. On 2 September 2015, Respondent filed an Application to Dismiss the Claims
("Respondent's Application"), together with supporting witness statements and expert
opinions.

192. By letter dated 8 September 2015, upon invitation of the Tribunal, Respondent requested
the Tribunal to reject TCC's application, and concluded by stating that "the NAB has
requested counsel for Pakistan to convey to the Tribunal and to TCC that it has not and
will continue not to monitor/intercept any form of privileged ¢ ication (oral or

written) between TCC personnel and their legal counsel." (emphasis in original)

193. By e-mail of 10 September 2015, the Tribunal noted Respondent's statement quoted in
the previous paragraph and invited Claimant to clarify whether it wished to maintain its
request as set out in its letter of 31 August 2015.

194. By letter dated 15 September 2015, Claimant responded that Respondent's statement
"ha[d] no meaningful content" and requested that the Tribunal:

"1. Order Pakistan to refrain from monitoring, recording, interfering
with, or otherwise compromising the confidentiality of any
communications, in the form of emails, phone calls, in-person
conversations, or otherwise, between and among TCC's
personnel and its attorneys, both within and without Pakistan;
and

2. Direct Pakistan to identify when, how, and which
communications between and among TCC's personnel and its
attorneys, both within and without Pakistan, have been
monitored, recorded, intercepted, or otherwise compromised to
date."

By letter dated 18 September 2015, Respondent noted that Claimant, in its letter of 15
September 2015, had raised arguments in relation to Respondent's Application that should
have been contained in its reply to this Application due on 7 October 2015. Therefore,
Respondent sought guidance from the Tribunal as to the point in time at which it should
address Claimant's arguments.

By email of the same day, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it did not require any further
submissions from the Parties on Claimant's request dated 31 August 2015, as amended on 15
September 2015. The Tribunal further stated that, in case it decided to grant the Parties a
second round of submissions on Respondent's Application, Respondent could address any
contention contained in Claimant's letter of 15 September 2015 that relate to said Application
in its response submission to Claimant's reply due on 7 October 2015.

On 24 September 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, ordering Respondent
to:
"I. Ensure that neither the NAB nor any other agency of the Federal

or Provincial Governments monitor/intercept or record any

privileged or potentially privileged communication (oral or

written), between and among TCC’s personnel, including in-

house legal counsel, and its attorneys, both within and outside

Pakistan; and

Il. Identify whether and if so, when, how and which privileged or
potentially privileged communications (oral or written) between
and among TCC’s personnel, including in-house legal counsel,
and its attorneys, both within and outside Pakistan, have been
monitored/intercepted or recorded by the NAB or any other
agency of the Federal or Provincial Governments to date."
By letter dated 5 October 2015, Respondent submitted witness statements of Col. Sher
Khan and Mr. Muhammad Farooq, together with an Urdu translation of Mr. Bari Dad's
second witness statement.

By e-mail dated 6 October 2015, Mr. Makhdoom Ali Khan gave notice to the Tribunal
that he had withdrawn as TCCA's counsel in this case and that his withdrawal "was not
prompted by any doubts about TCCA's integrity."

On 16 October 2015, Claimant filed Claimant's Opposition to Respondent's Application
to Dismiss Claims ("Claimant's Opposition"), together with updated indices of
Claimant's Exhibits and Authorities and a courtesy copy of its simultaneous filing in the
ICC arbitration.

By e-mail of 20 October 2015, Respondent requested that it be granted an opportunity to
respond to Claimant's Opposition, in particular in respect of the alternative argument.

By letter dated 21 October 2015, Pakistan confirmed, after inquiry of potentially relevant
agencies, that "it has not monitored, intercepted or recorded any of the type of
communications referred to in paragraph 25 II of Procedural Order No. 5.""'

On 27 October 2015, the Tribunal (i) invited Respondent to comment on Claimant's
alternative argument as set out in Claimant's Opposition; (ii) requested the Parties to agree
on a time schedule to address the new issues raised in Respondent's Application; and (iii)
informed the Parties:

"The Tribunal would like to inform the Parties that it has almost concluded
its deliberations on the case and that the draft of its Decision on
Jurisdiction and Liability is in a very advanced stage. In light of the
circumstances, the Tribunal will finalize, and provide the Parties with, a
draft of the Decision that it would have rendered but for the issues raised
in Respondent’s Application. The Tribunal notes that, while this approach
is not provided for by ICSID, it is common practice in the WTO and also
provided for in Article 10.20(9) lit. a of the CAFTA. By analogy to the
latter provision, the Parties may submit their comments on the draft
Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability within 60 days of its transmission
by the Tribunal. Any such comments will be duly considered by the
Tribunal in its ultimate Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability."

. By letter of 6 November 2015 to Respondent and copied to the Tribunal, Claimant

referred to Respondent's declaration of 21 October 2015 and requested that Respondent:

"I. Inform TCCA and the Tribunal of the criteria it is using to
determine whether communications to, from, and within TCC are
privileged or potentially privileged;
2. Inform TCCA and the Tribunal who is responsible for applying
such criteria; and
3. Identify the agencies to which it has 'made . . . enquiries’
regarding potential monitoring, interception, or recording of
TCC’s communications, and the steps that it is taking to ensure
that all organs of the Federal and Provincial Governments are
complying with the terms of paragraph 25(I) of the Order."
On 10 November 2015, Respondent submitted its Reply to Claimant's Opposition to
Dismiss Claims ("Respondent's Reply"). On 11 November 2015, Respondent submitted
a slightly revised version of its Reply that substituted the previous one due to an omitted
sentence.

On 12 November 2015, the Tribunal issued the following directions to the Parties:

'! Paragraph 25 II of Procedural Order No. 5 refers to "privileged or potentially privileged communications (oral
or written) between and among TCC’s personnel, including in-house legal counsel, and its attorneys, both within
and outside Pakistan."

"1. As the next procedural step, Claimant should submit a substantive
response to Respondent's Application at the time agreed by the
Parties, or fixed by the Tribunal as indicated below.

2. For clarification purposes, all witness statements, including the two
witness statements from the witnesses Col. Sher Khan and Mr.
Muhammad Farooq submitted with Respondent's letter of 5 October
2015, as well as all other evidence submitted by Respondent in
relation to its Application are admitted into the record, de bene esse,
i.e., provisionally and without prejudice to Claimant’s right to apply
to have it struck out.

3. The Tribunal notes Respondent’s statement at para. 15 of its Reply
that it ‘has no present intention of submitting further witness
evidence in respect of the corruption allegations.' In case
Respondent wishes to submit any further witness statements and/or
any additional documents into record, it may do so only upon request
for, and grant of, leave from the Tribunal.

4. The Tribunal further notes Respondent’s undertakings offered at
para. 20 of its Reply and sees no need for additional orders relating
to safe-conduct guarantees for the time being.

5. Claimant's request for disclosure of documents as set out in the

Annex to its Opposition is denied for the time being. The Tribunal

will decide on the Parties’ requests for disclosure of documents in

accordance with the time schedule to be agreed by the Parties or

fixed by the Tribunal.
By letter of 13 November 2015, Respondent replied to Claimant's letter of 6 November
2015 and argued that it "complied with Procedural Order No. 5 in full, providing the
confirmation requested with regard to monitoring intercepting or recording any of the
types of communications referred to in paragraph 25(II) of Procedural Order No. 5."

On 24 November 2015, the Parties submitted their respective proposals for the procedural
timetable to address the new issues raised in Respondent's Application, together with
comments.

On 25 November 2015, the Parties submitted their respective alternative proposals for the
procedural timetable, together with comments.

On 27 November 2015, the Tribunal provided the Parties with possible dates for an oral
hearing in late 2016 and invited the Parties to agree on a procedural timetable leading up
to either of those hearing dates.

On 3 December 2015, Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Parties had been unable
to reach agreement on the procedural timetable and submitted its revised proposal,
together with comments. On 7 December 2015, Claimant submitted its revised proposal
for the procedural timetable, together with comments.

On 11 December 2015, the Tribunal issued the procedural timetable to address the new
issues raised in Respondent's Application.

On 3 February 2016 and having given advance notice to the Parties of its intention to do
so on 27 October 2015, the Tribunal provided the Parties with its Draft Decision on
Jurisdiction and Liability and invited them to provide comments on errors of fact,
misprints, etc. within 60 days of the decision’s transmission to the Parties.

On 4 April 2016, the Parties submitted their respective comments on the Tribunal’s Draft
Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability.

On 20 March 2017, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Respondent's Application to
Dismiss the Claims (with reasons to follow). For a summary of the procedural history
leading up to the Tribunal’s Decision on Respondent’s Application to Dismiss the Claims,

Pursuant to the 2006 Novation Agreement, Claimant replaced BHP as a party to the
CHEJVA with a 75% interest in the unincorporated contractual joint venture established
under the CHEJVA (the "Joint Venture").'* Under the terms of the 2006 Novation
Agreement, all references to BHP were to be read and construed as if they were references
to TCCA.'§

The Province of Balochistan ("GOB"), "in its capacity as a party to the CHEJVA,"
covenanted with TCC "to observe the terms and conditions of the [CHE]JVA which are
on its part required to be observed."'®

Reko Dig, in the Chagai District of the Province of Balochistan

Reko Digq is a small town in the Chagai District of the Province of Balochistan, Pakistan,
near the borders with Afghanistan and Iran.2> The Reko Dig area is part of the Tethyan
Magmatic Arc, known for its copper-gold mining potential.”° In the late 1960s and early
1970s, the Geological Survey of Pakistan ("GSP") performed preliminary surveying of
mineralization in the Chagai District and concluded that there was copper and gold

mineralization in the Reko Dig area.’

Reko Dig contains at least 13 principal mineralized deposits, the two largest of which are
copper-gold deposits called the Western Porphyries, also known by the designations H14
and H15,”8 a copper orebody called Tanjeel, also known by the designation H4,”? and
other orebodies in the vicinity of the Western Porphyries and Tanjeel, known as H13 and
H79, as well as H8 and H35, that show potential for development.*”

The Chagai Hills Joint Venture Agreement

i. The Object of the Joint Venture

The CHEJVA established the Joint Venture between BHP and the BDA "for the purpose
of conducting exploration for and, if warranted, developing any Mineral deposits lying
within the Exploration Area."*' The object of the Joint Venture was agreed in Clause 3.1,
which provided that

"[T]he Parties hereby establish a contractual joint venture the objects
of which are to explore for Mineral deposits in the Exploration Area
and to conduct Feasibility Studies so as to evaluate the economic

ii. The Parties' Obligations
229. Pursuant to Clause 3 of the CHEJVA, the BDA held a 25% Percentage Interest in the

Joint Venture, while BHP [TCCA]* was entitled to earn a 75% Percentage Interest by
conducting an agreed plan of exploration activities and related studies.**

230. Pursuant to Clauses 3.2 and 7, BHP [TCCA] had to cover all costs of exploration
activities. In addition, Clauses 10.2 and 10.3 provided that BHP [TCCA] would act as the
Manager for the Joint Venture, with the "day-to-day responsibility for conduct of the Joint

[TCCA] and the BDA.*° Among other duties, the Operating Committee (the "OC")
established the general policies of the Joint Venture, reviewed technical reports and

approved work programs and budgets submitted by the Manager.*”

232. The OC also had the power to direct BHP [TCCA] as the Manager to prepare pre-
feasibility and feasibility studies.** Pursuant to Clause 7.3, "in the event that the
Operating Committee decides to undertake a Feasibility Study, BHP [TCCA] shall fund

such Study provided always that BDA shall continue to provide,
39

among other things, the

Pursuant to sub-clause 24.6.1, the Parties covenanted "not to engage (whether alone or in
association with others), during the currency of this Agreement, in any activity in the
Exploration Area except as provided for and authorized by this Agreement or as expressly

agreed by the Parties."*!

Under sub-clauses 24.6.2 and 24.6.3, BHP [TCCA] and the BDA agreed to "be just and
faithful to one another," to "do all such acts as shall be reasonably required to give effect
to the purposes of [the] Agreement," and not to "do or omit to be done anything whereby
the interests of the Joint Venture contemplated herein are prejudiced."**

Clause 10.3 specifically required both BHP [TCCA] and the BDA to "use all reasonable
endeavors . . . to procure that [exploration licenses] are renewed or replaced by other
titles or rights in substitution for them on their expiration."**

iii. The Mining Lease and the Mining Venture

Sub-clause 11.3.1 of the CHEJVA provided that within 14 days of the completion of a
Feasibility Study, the Manager "shall serve a copy of the Study on each Party" and within
90 days of receiving such copy, "each Party shall advise the Manager whether it intends
to participate in development of said Mineral deposit as a Mining Area."* A party giving
notice of intention to participate in development was then referred to as a "Participating
Party:"

"The Parties (if any) giving notice of intention to participate in

development are hereinafter collectively referred to as 'Participating

Party.'"45
The CHEJVA also made clear that the BDA would not be required to participate in mine
development.*® Sub-clause 11.3.3 provided that if a party gave notice that it did not wish
to participate in development, or failed to provide notice of intention to proceed within
such 90-day period, it would be deemed to be a Non-participating Party.‘”

either "if the Parties so decide[d] pursuant to sub-clause 8.2.10(d)" (i.e., a resolution is

passed by the OC by unanimous votes of all Parties to "transfer the Joint Venture

Activities to the Mining Venture")* and/or if "pursuant to sub-clause 11.3.2 one or more

Participating Parties give notice of an intention that development is to proceed."*”

240. Sub-clause 11.4.2 clarified that "[w]here the BDA is a Non-participating Party, then
subject both to BHPM [TCCA] obtaining all routine Government approvals required and
to compliance with Clause 11.6, BHPM [TCCA] shall be entitled to undertake sole risk

investment . . . in a mining development within any of the relevant Prospecting
Licenses."*°
241. Clause 11.5 provided:

"11.5.1 If any notice of intention to participate in Mine Development is
given pursuant to sub-clause 11.3.2, within one hundred and twenty
(120) days of the Election Date, the Participating Party shall notify the
Non-participating Party, in writing, as to whether or not it intends to
purchase the Percentage Interest of the Non-participating Party
pertaining to the proposed Mining Area (hereinafter called the "Non-
participating Party's Transfer Interest").

11.5.2 If the Participating Party notifies the Non-participating Party
that it does not wish to purchase the Non-participating Party's Transfer
Interest, the Non-participating Party shall be entitled, subject to the
grant of the requisite consent of the Provincial Government, to sell and
transfer the Non-participating Party's Transfer Interest to a third party,
provided that such third party agrees to be bound by the provisions of
the JVA with respect to such Mining Area. The Participating Party shall
sign all documents, deeds, novations and consents necessary to give
effect to such sale and transfer, and for such third party to become a
party to the JVA with respect to such Mining Area.

242. The condition of compliance with Clause 11.6, referred to in sub-clause 11.4.2, related to
the determination of the fair value to be paid for the Non-participating Party's Percentage
Interest. Sub-clause 11.6.1 provided a simple formula for the parties' determination based
on the amount of exploration expense, with interest, contributed to work programs and
budgets (including those relating to the Feasibility Study) and a reasonable proportion of
overhead pertaining to Joint Venture Activities during the period the proposed Mining
Area was under investigation.*? Sub-clause 11.6.2 provided for referral of the question of
fair value to an expert (bound by the parameters referred to in sub-clause 11.6.1) if the
parties were unable to reach a mutually acceptable decision pursuant to Clause 11.5
within the 120-day period.**

243. Clause 11.7 established the time frame for establishment of the Mining Venture:

"Within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the Election Date or such
other period as may be agreed between all Participating Parties (‘the

Exploration Area boundaries of the Mining Area established by the said
Study and shall thereby establish a joint venture in respect of such area
(the "Mining Venture')."**

244. Sub-clause 11.8.1 defined the term "Mining Area," as follows:

"Unless otherwise unanimously agreed by all Parties, the boundaries
of the Mining Venture shall not contain a greater land area than is
necessary to encompass all ore resources which may be properly mined
as a single mining enterprise together with any necessary plant or
facilities for the milling and treatment of ore and other appropriate
infrastructure and, thereafter, a new joint venture shall be deemed to
exist between the Participating Parties in respect of that area (the
"Mining Area’)."

245. Sub-clause 11.8.2 of the CHEJVA provided that:

"[w]here the Joint Venture or, pursuant to sub-clause 11.3.2, a
Participating Party elects to develop a mine then, subject only to
compliance with routine Government requirements, it shall be entitled
to convert the relevant [Exploration] Licence(s) held by it into Mining
[Leases] so as to give secure title over the required Mining Area."*°

The Background of the CHEJVA

a. The CHEJVA Was Originally Entered into by BHP and the BDA in July 1993

After initial discussions with the BDA starting in May 1990, BHP submitted to the BDA
a draft agreement for the proposed joint venture between BHP and the "Government of
Baluchistan" on 8 May 1991. The BDA forwarded the draft to the Government of
Balochistan, Secretary Industries, Commerce and Mineral Resources, for onward
transmission to the Law Department for appraisement on 29 May 1991.° On 1 June 1991,
the Secretary consented, subject to concurrence by the Finance and Law Departments,
that the BDA be authorized to discuss further details with the foreign sponsors.

The draft joint venture agreement was reviewed by the law firm of Chima & Ibrahim, in
July 1991, and their comments were communicated to the Chief Secretary of
Balochistan. The law firm noted that the draft stipulated that "in the event of any
inconsistency between the Agreement and any laws of Baluchistan, the terms of the
Agreement shall prevail." The law firm questioned whether the GOB, acting within the
authority conferred on it by law, could enter into such an agreement.’ The firm further
noted that "if GOB were to opt out, for any reason, during or after the exploration and
feasibility stage, BHPM would still remain entitled to go through the various stages,
including development, envisaged by the Agreement, and there would remain an implied
undertaking on the part of GOB to render necessary approvals in this regard."® The law

firm commented: "Indeed it is only reasonable that this should be so."©

It appears from the correspondence, dated 29 September 1991, from Chima & Ibrahim to
the BDA that neither the Government of Balochistan nor the BDA wanted to participate
in the joint venture proposed by BHP. The letter stated that the Government and the BDA
"would be content to receiv[e] royalties for discovered minerals; thereby obviating the
need for contribution of funds to the project." For this reason, the law firm enclosed a

draft prospecting license but offered that if it was still desired that the GOB and/or BDA
enter into a joint venture with BHP, they would provide a draft joint venture agreement
as well or amend the draft provided by BHP.”!

In response to the BDA's comments of 16 October 1991 on the draft joint venture
agreement, BHP explained that "[i]t was our original intention that the Agreement be
entered into with the Government of Baluchistan. The purpose of such an arrangement
was to ensure that the effect of those provisions of the Mining Concession Rules which
cause BHP difficulty could be overridden. When we meet, perhaps we can discuss means
by which those concerns which we have in relation to certain aspects of the Mining
Concession Rules might be addressed."”? BHP's concerns were discussed in meetings
with the BDA, and on 4 December 1991, BHP's attorney communicated with Chima and
Ibrahim regarding the open issues and stated that it would re-draft the agreement once
BDA's position on these issues had been confirmed. The main outstanding issues were
the mining concession rules, taxation, area of interest, exploration programme, operating
committee, royalty and arbitration. With respect to the mining concession rules, BHP
commented that it "would expect that the Agreement will specifically address those rules
which are problematic and be the subject of a Notified Order so as to overcome the
Rules."

On 28 April 1992, the National Centre for Technology Transfer, Ministry of Science &
Technology advised the Chairman of the BDA that approval of the Federal Government
was not necessary and "it is the Government of Baluchistan and BDA to make decision at
their own accord as far as [the joint venture agreement] is concerned.""

The second draft was circulated on 3 August 1992.” This draft had been amended to
provide that the parties would be BHP Minerals Asia Pacific Limited and the Baluchistan
Development Authority.

In the Summary for the Chief Minister, dated 11 November 1992, regarding the proposed
joint venture agreement, the Additional Chief Secretary noted that:

"5. In consonance with the Government's clear policy of a 'roll-back' of
the Public Sector, we would have ordinarily opposed a Joint Venture
involving BDA/Government of Balochistan. We of course wish to
encourage foreign investment, particularly in the Mining Sector, but

ideally Foreign Investors should come in on their own without
expecting any equity participation from Government of Balochistan.

6. In this particular case, however, BDA's negotiations with BHP have
reached an advanced stage and BDA has already expended some
money on technical advice etc. Withdrawal of BDA at this stage may
convey the wrong signal to BHP.

7. We may, therefore, allow BDA to continue their negotiations with
BHP for a joint venture, subject to the following:-

i) Agreement should be got vetted by the P&DD, Finance Department,
Law Department and ofcourse [sic] the administrative department i.e.
Industries Department.

ii) Agreement should provide for transfer of BDA share-holding to the
domestic private sector/another department or agency of the
Government of Balochistan. This is important as one day Government
may decide to wind up BDA. (It also bears reiteration that dividends
coming directly to the Government from this Joint Venture would help
Provincial Revenue Generation; but if they go to BDA they will be used
[replacement for the word "asked" which is struck out by hand] upto

BDA's expenses."

. The next draft was circulated on 22 March 1993, but neither Party has produced a copy

of this draft.7”

In the continuing negotiations, BHP noted in its cover letter dated 2 April 1993 to the
Chairman of the BDA, enclosing draft no. 4, that BHP "holds to the view that for this
project a Joint Venture Agreement (in conjunction with requisite Notified Orders and
written assurances/rules from Government) will suffice.""* BHP noted in the enclosed
comments to those contained in correspondence from Chima & Ibrahim that the
agreement was between the BDA and BHP only, and that the Government of Balochistan
was not a party to the Agreement.”

On 13 July 1993, the final draft was submitted by Mr. Ata Mohammad Jafar, Chairman
of the BDA, to the Chief Minister of Balochistan for his approval for signing.*° Mr. Jafar
summarized briefly the background of the joint venture and the negotiation of the
agreement, noting that the agreement was proposed to be signed by the parties on 29 July
1993. He explained that since the agreement was only conditional, the BDA would have
six months' time, after signing, for obtaining consents and approvals from the Federal and

Provincial Governments in respect with legal and fiscal parameters; if the conditions
would not be acceptable within six months, the agreement would cease. Mr. Jafar also
noted that this draft had been approved by the BDA Board of Directors in its meeting of
3 July 1993.8!

The CHEJVA had been vetted by the Law Department of Balochistan on 24 July 1993.°?

On 27 July 1993, the Chief Secretary of Balochistan added his comment to the final draft,
namely that the BDA should have moved the P&D and Finance Department in time to
vet the agreement; this was not done. He noted that "P&D says it requires time to vet the
same. However, as the agreement is to be signed on the 29", it has been proposed to term
it ‘provisional’ so that amendments / modification, if any, could be made at a later stage.

CM may like to approve."*?

The CHEJVA was signed on 29 July 1993.** It is made between the "Governor of
Balochistan, through the Chairman, Balochistan Development Authority a statutory
corporation of Balochistan Province (hereinafter called the 'BDA')" and BHP. The
Agreement is signed by:

"THE BALOCHISTAN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY

By: /s/ ATA MOHAMMAD JAFAR

Title: CHAIRMAN,

Balochistan Development Authority"*>
As discussed at paragraph 291 below, the CHEJVA was made "conditional" upon the
Parties' receiving from the Federal and/or Provincial Governments within six months all
consents and approvals necessary under Pakistani law and all assurances as to fiscal
parameters for investment in any future mining venture which either of the parties might
need.*°

b. In March 2000, the CHEJVA Was Amended by BHP and the BDA

On 4 March 2000, BHP and the BDA entered into Addendum No. | to Chagai Hills
Exploration Joint Venture Agreement (the “2000 Addendum”) with "the GOVERNOR
OF BALOCHISTAN, for and on behalf of the Province of Balochistan" (the "GOB"). The

Chairman of the BDA [signature illegible] signed the 2000 Addendum on behalf of the
"Governor of Balochistan" and on behalf of the BDA.*”

According to Claimant, on 24 December 1999, based on a recommendation from the
Chief [Minister] that the proposal set forth in the summary "may kindly be approved," the
Governor of Balochistan expressly authorized the Chairman of the BDA to sign the 2000
Addendum "on behalf of the Government of Balochistan."** The Governor's authorization
letter read as follows:

"I, Justice (Retd) Amir ul Mulk Mengal, Governor Balochistan hereby

authorize Chairman, Balochistan Development Authority to sign

Addendum No. I to the Joint Venture Agreement dated July 29, 1993

between Government of Balochistan through Chairman, Balochistan

Development Authority and BHP Minerals International Exploration

Inc. for the Exploration of Copper, Gold and Associated Minerals in

Chagai (Balochistan) on behalf of the Government of Balochistan."*°
The Principal Secretary of the Governor's Secretariat had forwarded the authorization
letter to the BDA on 24 December 1999 through letter No. SO-59B-4-12/99/4725, noting
that "the Governor of Balochistan has been pleased to approve and sign the authorization
letter allowing the Chairman . . . to sign the subject addendum on behalf of the

Government of Balochistan."*°

On 28 December 1999, the Chairman of the BDA referred the draft Addendum to the
Law Department, GOB, for vetting?! On 31 December 1999, the Section Officer
(Legislation) in the Law Department returned the Addendum "duly vetted."*”

Pursuant to Clause 2.2 of the 2000 Addendum, the GOB appointed the BDA "to act as
its agent in connection with the [CHE]JVA and with full power and authority to bind the
GOB in all respects and with regard to all matters pertaining to or arising out of the
JVA."93

In the 2000 Addendum, BHP and the BDA confirmed their intention that "the GOB is the
party to the CHEJVA" and [alll references to the BDA's role and authority as agent for
the GOB, shall be deemed to mean the GOB."°**

subject to the amendments set out in the 2000 Addendum.*°

c. In April 2000, BHP Decided to Exit the Joint Venture and Granted Mincor an
Option to Enter into an Alliance for Exploration in Reko Diq

272. By letter dated 10 April 2000, BHP advised the Governor of Balochistan ("c/- Balochistan
Development Authority") that it wished to enter an Alliance Agreement with Mincor.””
Enclosing a copy of the Option Agreement, BHP further advised that Mincor "intends to
create a special company (to be known as the Tethyan Copper Company or TCC) to
finance and operate the Alliance Agreement and conduct exploration."** Receipt of the
letter was acknowledged on 12 April 2000 by the Balochistan Development Authority by
its Chairman Mr. Ameer Ali Burg.

273. On 28 April 2000, BHP and Mincor signed the Option Agreement (the “2000 Option
Agreement”), which granted Mincor an exclusive 180-day option to enter into the
Alliance Agreement with BHP regarding the exploration of Reko Dig.” In Clause 3, the
Option Agreement further set out the terms of the Alliance Agreement.

274. On 23 June 2000, BHP and "the GOVERNOR OF BALOCHISTAN, for and on behalf of
the Province of Balochistan (hereinafter referred to as 'GOB') acting through its agent,
THE BALOCHISTAN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY, statutory corporation created by
and existing under the Balochistan Development Authority Act 1974 (hereinafter referred
to as 'BDA‘')" entered into a Deed of Waiver and Consent ("Deed of Waiver") for BHP's
transaction with Mincor. The Deed of Waiver was signed by the Chairman of the BDA
on behalf of "THE GOVERNOR OF BALOCHISTAN through its agent, THE
BALOCHISTAN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY" and BHP!

275. Pursuant to the Deed of Waiver, the GOB waived any and all pre-emptive rights it had

under Clause 14.3 of the CHEJVA with respect to the transfers between BHP and Mincor

contemplated under the Option Agreement. '°!

The GOB further undertook to ensure that BHP would be able to transfer its interest in
any licenses effectively to Mincor.'°? BHP, in turn, agreed that it would remain liable in
case Mincor's actions or omissions caused BHP to breach any of its obligations under the
CHEJVA.'°

The GOB and BHP further confirmed the validity of the CHEJVA by agreeing that "all
the provisions of the [(CHEJVA] remain in full force and effect," and that the Deed of
Waiver was a "supplement to the [CHE]JVA."!%*

d. In October 2000, Claimant Exercised Mincor's Option and Entered into the
Alliance with BHP

On 24 October 2000, TCCA, as nominee of Mincor, exercised Mincor's option to enter
into the Alliance Agreement with BHP. !°

On 11 November 2000, the Government of Balochistan Industries Department confirmed
that BHP was "entitled to transfer its interest in their joint venture with Government of
Balochistan/B.D.A. including the interest in licenses to MINCOR Resources NL or its
nominee, under rules 12, 14 and 15."'°

On 30 November 2000, TCCA established Tethyan Copper Company Pakistan (""TCCP")
as its wholly-owned subsidiary in Pakistan.!°”

On 15 October 2002, Claimant entered into the Alliance Agreement (the "2002 Alliance
Agreement") with BHP, which would allow Claimant to earn a share of BHP's 75%
interest in the Chagai Hills joint venture by exploring and developing the Chagai Hills
mining area held by the joint venture.!°*

The purpose of the 2002 Alliance Agreement, according to Clause 2.1, was to "develop[]
the mineral potential of the [Chagai Hill Region of Pakistan] [and] enabi[e] BHP's
obligations under the CH{E]JV[A] to be fulfilled," while at the same time "allowing TCC
to become a party" to the CHEJVA.!°

The 2002 Alliance Agreement set forth in detail the expenditure and work requirements
through which TCCA would acquire BHP's interest in the Joint Venture.!'!° Pursuant to
Clause 12, BHP retained a "Clawback Right" by which it could partially re-acquire its

interests at Reko Dig in the event of a major mineral discovery. !'!

e. Exploration License EL-5

Exploration License EL-5 (“Exploration License EL-5”) had been granted by the
Balochistan Licensing Authority to the Joint Venture, “M/S. BDA/BHP Chagai Hills Joint
Venture”, on 18 May 2002 for a period of three years (21 February 2002 to 20 February
2005). It originally covered 973.75 square kilometers (240620.20 acres) in the Reko Diq

area, !!?

On 9 April 2005, Exploration License EL-5 was renewed for the reduced area of 482.72
square kilometers (119304.95) acres for a further period of three years (21 February 2005
to 20 February 2008). On 1 December 2007, it was renewed a second time for the reduced
area of 435.02 square kilometers (107516.65 acres) for the period 20 February 2008 to
19 February 2011.!!3

f. By July 2005, Claimant Had Earned the Right, pursuant to the 2002 Alliance
Agreement, to BHP's Interest in Exploration License EL-5

On 12 July 2005, BHP confirmed TCC's notification of 11 July 2005 that TCC had
completed all of its obligations under the 2002 Alliance Agreement with regard to the
Tanjeel project — including the expenditure of US$ 3 million in accordance with Section
7.2 thereof — and had consequently earned all of BHP's right, title and interest in the
Licenses as provided in the 2002 Alliance Agreement.!!*

On 23 November 2006, TCCA paid US$ 60 million to BHP to terminate BHP's clawback
right under Clause 12 of the 2002 Alliance Agreement.!!>

Pakistan's Federal and Provincial Regulatory System

Under the Pakistan Constitution, minerals are a provincial subject, except mineral oil,
natural gas and nuclear minerals and those occurring in certain special areas,'!° and the
Provincial Governments are responsible for development and exploitation of minerals

which fall in their domain.!!”

The Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970

At the time the CHEJVA was signed on 29 July 1993, the Mining Concession Rules, 1970
were in force in the Province of Balochistan (the "1970 BMC Rules")!!®

At the time of signature, BHP had identified certain consents, approvals and assurances
under the 1970 BMC Rules, which BHP, in its view, needed to seek from the Government
of Balochistan in order to secure rights necessary to implement the CHEJVA.'!° Rule 98
of the 1970 BMC Rules authorized the Government "to relax any or all of the provisions
of these Rules in cases of individual hardship and under special circumstances to be
recorded in writing and on terms and conditions to be fixed by it."'”°

The Parties agreed, in Clause 2.1, that the entry into force of the CHEJVA was conditional
upon their receiving from the Federal and/or Provincial Government all consents and
approvals necessary under Pakistani law within six months after signing:

"2.1 This Agreement shall be conditional upon the Parties receiving from the
Federal Government and/or the Provincial Government (as the case
may be) within six (6) months of the date of this Agreement or such
other period as the parties may agree:

J. all consents and approvals necessary under Pakistani law, and
2. allassurances as to fiscal parameters for investment in any future
mining venture which either of the Parties may have need for.. . .

2.3 If pursuant to Clause 2.1 any necessary or required Governmental
consent, approval or assurance is not obtained within six (6) months of
the date of this Agreement, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, this
Agreement shall absolutely cease and determine and neither Party shall
have any rights or claims against the other as a result thereof."!?!

292. Three months after the date of signing, on 16 September 1993, Mr. Martin Harris, Senior
Lawyer for BHP wrote to Mr. Ata Mohammad Jafar, the Chairman of the BDA, as
follows:

"In reviewing the Rules we have sought to identify the consents,
approvals and assurances which we must seek from the Government to
[illegible] the Joint Venture, as referred to in Article 2 of the Joint
Venture Agreement (the "Agreement"). We understand that this.
involves seeking Gazetted Notified Orders securing rights needed to
implement the Agreement to the extent such rights are not available
under or are inconsistent with the Rules.

Rule 98 allows the Government to relax the Rules on terms and
conditions. Primary responsibility for considering cases involving
relaxation of the Rules appears to lie with the Mines Committee (Rule
2(f)). Subject to any current delegation of the Mines Committee's
powers, we would suggest application be made to the Committee for
Notified Orders as described in the attachment to this letter... .

We envisage that once Notified Orders relaxing the Rules have been

made, these would be incorporated into a deed guaranteeing, inter alia,

that the Notified Orders would not be revoked or overridden. The

parties to the deed would be BHP Minerals, the Balochistan

Development Authority, the Balochistan Government and the Central

Government. The Central Government would have to be a party as,

although the Rules are promulgated by the Balochistan Government,

they are created pursuant to the Regulation of Mines Oilfields and

Mineral Development (Federal Control) Act, 1948, under which the

Central Government [illegible] overriding powers."'?>

293. Attachment "A" to the letter identified 13 provisions of the 1970 BMC Rules that

required relaxation to enable the Joint Venture to conduct its exploration activities. !7?
BHP listed the consents, approvals and assurances and described the "Application for
Mining Leases" in relevant part, as follows:

(1) Grant of Exploration Area.

(2) Area Available for Prospecting Licenses

(3) Application for Prospecting Licenses

"It is essential that the Joint Venture, or a sole ‘Participating Party’
under Clause 11 [of the CHEJVA], is entitled to convert the relevant
P{[rospecting] L[icense] into a M[ining] Lfease] if it wishes to develop
a mine. Currently, the right of a holder of a PL to receive a ML is
described in Rule 23 as a ‘preferential right’ only. The subjective
discretion of the licensing authority [under the 1970 BMC Rules] must
be waived in favour of an absolute right of the Joint Venture, or a sole
‘Participating Party’, to a M[ining] L[ease], provided they comply with
routine administrative requirements. Clause 11.8.2 of the Agreement
anticipates this right of transition.

International mining companies will view this aspect of a country's
mining regulations as one of the most important."!4

(10) Royalty

(11) Penalties, Compensation and Cancellation
(12) Employment and Training

(13) Mining Lease.

294. In response, on 23 October 1993, Mr. Jafar, as Chairman of the BDA, requested from the

295.

Secretary, Government of Balochistan, Industries, Commerce and Mineral Resources
Department, pursuant to rule 98 of the 1970 BMC Rules, the relaxation of the 13
provisions of the 1970 BMC Rules identified by BHP.!75

The request was discussed on 30 October 1993 at a meeting under the Chairmanship of
Additional Chief Secretary (Dev.) Mr. Ata Muhammad Jafar attended by representatives
of the Planning & Development Department, the Chief Minister's Inspection Team, the
Finance Department, the Industries Department, the BDA and BHP. 126

296. On 20 January 1994, by Order of the Governor of Balochistan, the Government of
Balochistan granted BHP the following relaxations (the "1994 Relaxations"):

"In exercise of the powers confirmed by rule 98 of the Mining
Concession Rules 1970, the Government of Balochistan is pleased to

297. When the CHEJVA was submitted to the Chief Minister of Balochistan for his approval
for the Chairman of the BDA to sign it, the Chief Secretary commented on 23 July 1993
that "as the date for signing the agreement has already been fixed (29n July), we may
authorize the Chairman B.D.A. to go ahead subject to the inclusion of a specific clause
that this agreement would be of a provisional nature and any reasonable additions /

agreement, shall be incorporated in the agreement."'?8 The Chief Minister agreed with

the views of the Chief Secretary.'°

298. Ata meeting of representatives of BHP and the BDA on 29 July 1993, this proviso was
discussed and the parties agreed that, first, this provision was already incorporated in the
agreement in Article 24.1 (amendment of the Agreement); second, since all proposed
amendments were subject to approval by the Provincial Government and related
departments, if there were any suggestions from the Planning and Development and
Finance Department, these would be automatically subject to further discussion and
would be incorporated in due course; and, third, the Agreement was in any case

provisional according to Clause 2.1. Both parties signed the minutes of this meeting. '*°

299. On 11 November 2000, after TCCA, as nominee of Mincor, exercised Mincor's option to
enter into the Alliance Agreement with BHP on 24 October 2000, the Government of
Balochistan, Industries Department, confirmed that the 1994 Relaxations of the 1970
BMC Rules it had granted to BHP "still h[e]ld good."'?!

2. The Pakistan National Mineral Policy, 1995

300. In 1995, two years after the CHEJVA was signed, Pakistan enacted the National Mineral
Policy, 1995 (the "1995 NMP") to guide the formulation of new provincial mineral rules
and regulations. In its Objectives, the 1995 NMP stated that "[t]he Government of
Pakistan is . . . launching a major policy initiative in order to expand mineral sector
activity mainly through private investment." >? The Objectives reiterated that minerals are
a provincial subject under the Constitution, except oil, gas and nuclear minerals and those
occurring in certain special areas, and that "the Provincial Government{s] are responsible

for development and exploitation of minerals which fall in their domain."'**

301.

Article 5.2 of the 1995 NMP provided that existing government corporations could
"retain a majority share in joint venture mineral projects to be managed by the private
sector: local or foreign."'*+ Article 11 stated that there would be no mandatory State
participation; however, the Governments would encourage joint ventures between foreign

and local private investors, and such joint ventures could be entered into with agencies of
the Federal and Provincial Governments. !°5
Article 8.1 of the 1995 NMP provided that the existing provincial mining statutes would

be replaced by new mining regimes, which would reflect modern international standards:

"The existing regulatory regime is being revised and updated to change
some features which have been considered unattractive to investors and
to put in place a set of rules which are internationally competitive. The
new rules would meet the concerns of the investors on such matters as
transparency, criteria for dealing with applications and the grant of
licenses and leases, expeditious decision making process, security of
tenure, provision of adequate information on mineral titles,
independent dispute resolution mechanism etc., and to equitably meet
the objectives of the investors as well as aspirations of the
Governments."°°

Article 8.6.1 of the 1995 NMP provided that the holder of an Exploration License could
apply for a mining lease over an area subject to a maximum of 250 square kilometers
within its Exploration License in respect of the minerals discovered.'*’ In addition,
Article 8.6.2 of the 1995 NMP provided:

"The Licensing Authority shall not unreasonably refuse an application

for the grant of an M[ining] L[ease]. Where the Licensing Authority
considers that the applicant has satisfied the specified criteria for
assessment and grant of an ML, the ML will be granted."!°*

Article 8.12.1 of the 1995 NMP confirmed the right of the Provincial Government to enter
into an agreement with a mining investor to provide the investor with additional legal
security. Article 8.12.1 provided:

base metals (which included copper). !47

The Balochistan Mineral Rules, 2002

a. Enactment of the Mineral Rules, 2002

On 8 March 2002, Balochistan implemented the 1995 NMP by enacting the Balochistan
Mineral Rules, 2002 (the "2002 BM Rules"). '** In the Foreword, the Director General of
Mines and Minerals stated that the rules, "being considered unattractive to investors,"
had been revised and updated "to put in place a set of rules internationally competitive"
and the 2002 BM Rules "attract the attention of the investors on such matters as
transparency, criteria for dealing with applications and the grant of Licenses and Leases,
expeditious decision making process, security of tenure, provision of adequate
information on mineral titles, independent resolution mechanism, etc., and to equitably
meet the objectives of the investors as well as aspirations of the Government." The
Province had enlisted the technical assistance of the Government of Australia in the
drafting of the rules.'4°

Rule 7 of the 2002 BM Rules provided:

"No person shall conduct exploration / prospecting operations, mining
operations or reconnaissance operations except under a mineral title

Rule 9(1) of the 2002 BM Rules followed Article 8.12 of the 1995 NMP!” and confirmed
the right of the Provincial Government to enter into an agreement with a mining investor.
Rule 9(1) provided as follows:

"The Government may, at the request of a person proposing to carry on
mineral operations, enter into an agreement with that person relating
to a mineral title, not inconsistent with these Rules or any other law, if
the Government is satisfied that substantial foreign investment is likely
to be made in mineral operations and that the carrying on of the
undertaking in question is desirable in the interest of the development
of the mineral resources of Balochistan."!°°

312. Rule 9(2) provided that the Federal Government could, at the request of the Government,
be a party to, and to the negotiation of, a mineral agreement.'*!

313. Rule 9(3) provided, in pertinent part, that a mineral agreement "may, in particular, make

provision with respect to... the grant... . of a mineral title."

314. Rules 9(5) and 9(6) provided for priority of the Rules over the provisions of a mineral
agreement. Rule 9(5) stated as follows:

"Any provision contained in a mineral agreement which is inconsistent
with any provision of these rules or any other law shall, to the extent of
the inconsistency, be of no force or effect.""">

b. Amendment of the 2002 BM Rules

On 1 October 2010, Balochistan amended the 2002 BM Rules to add a new sub-clause
(vii) to rule 48, sub-rule 3, clause (a), after sub-clause (vi), which required that a mining
lease application include “a concrete proposal for value addition of the ore to be

produced / exploited from the applicant’s mining lease within the country.”'

The New Pakistan National Mineral Policy, 2013

In February 2013, the Federal Government enacted the new National Mineral Policy (the
"2013 NMP"). Its objective was to extend the drive to ensure the modernization of the
mining sector regulatory instruments. This was to be done, inter alia, by:

"[p]roviding for mineral titles to be granted or renewed for sufficient
periods to allow for the full commercial exploration, development and
exploitation of any mineral deposit by the mineral title holders;
Eliminating discretionary powers, provide time frames and ensuring
simplicity of procedures and transparency of decisions; and

Updating the mining laws to deal with international mining practices
in Pakistan such as open pit mining and working practices."!

Article 7.8 of the 2013 NMP expanded on Article 8.12.1 of the 1995 NMP and provided
for the mineral agreement to have priority over any inconsistent law or rules subsequently
amended:

"7.8.1 The Provincial Governments may enter into an agreement with
an investor, within the framework of the law, to define the terms or to
predetermine procedures with respect to certain matters relating to the
carrying out of operations under license/lease, if government is
satisfied that ial foreign in in exploration and mining
operations is likely to be made and it is desirable in the interest of the
development of mineral resources, to do so. The Federal Government
may also become signatory to such an agreement, if so requested by a
Provincial Government, after independently examining viability of the
project and credit worthiness of the party. When the Federal
Government is requested, the terms of such mineral agreement would
be mutually agreed between the Federal Government, the respective
Provincial Government and the mining company.

7.8.2 In order to facilitate negotiations, the Federal Government will
develop a model mineral agreement designed to provide additional
comfort to a mining company and its lenders. The model mineral
agreement will contain terms, including without limitation, with respect
to the application, grant, duration, renewal, assignment and
termination of mineral titles and the rights and obligations of mineral
title holders that will protect the economic feasibility of the project and
stabilize the legal and fiscal regimes (taxes, fees and royalties) which
the mining company will be subject to over the life of the project with
necessary protection to the mining company in the event of changes
thereto. This will allow the mining company and its lenders to make the
necessary investment decisions. The model mineral agreement shall
form the basis of negotiations with a mining company for a mineral
agreement and may be varied for project specific reasons on a case to
case basis to deal with project specific issues. The Federal Government
will stand as guarantor of the Provincial Government’s obligations, if
so requested by the latter.

The existing Mineral Rules will be amended to remove any
conflict/overlapping with or other effect on, and to give effect to, the
rights and obligations of the mining company under the mineral
agreement in line with best international practices and in the meantime,
the respective Government shall pass an appropriate order through a
notification under the applicable law exempting the class of minerals
or the specific minerals covered by mineral agreements from the
application of the relevant provisions of the Mineral Rules until the
same are amended, such government will also give protection to the
incentives and concessions given to mining companies under a mineral
agreement through statutory amendments principally in line with those
of the mineral sector.

The mineral agreement would have an overriding effect in case
anything contained therein is inconsistent with any law or rules
subsequently amended."!4

From 1993 to 1995, based on satellite imaging and geochemical analysis, BHP identified
10 areas for further exploration, one of which included Reko Diq.'®

On 22 July 1996, the Joint Venture applied for 10 Prospecting Licenses, covering a total
of 1,000 square kilometers, for these 10 areas.'°° On 8 December 1996, the Licensing
Authority granted the requested Prospecting Licenses, including PL-4 covering the Reko
Dig, entitling the Joint Venture to conduct drilling and analysis work within the license
areas, 167

In 1997, BHP completed its first-phase drilling at Reko Dig and at five other prospecting

areas. Several early drill holes at Reko Digq indicated the presence of minerals.!*

On 19 November 1998, the Joint Venture sought the renewal of two Prospecting Licenses
for the Reko Dig area (PL-4) and the Koh-i-Sultan area and abolished the remaining eight
Prospecting Licenses.'® On 5 July 1999, the Joint Venture surrendered the Koh-i-Sultan
Prospecting License. !”°

On 28 July 1999, the Joint Venture applied for a new, larger Prospecting License for Reko
Dig covering an area of 973.75 square kilometers. !7! On 21 February 2000, the Licensing
Authority granted the new Prospecting License over the area requested and designated it
"PL-14." The Licensing Authority further approved the merger of the original Reko Diq
Prospecting License PL-4 with the new Reko Diq Prospecting License PL-14.'”

TCC's Initial Exploration Work (2002-2005)

After entering into the 2002 Alliance Agreement with BHP, TCC focused its exploration
work in the context of the Joint Venture primarily on the copper deposit called Tanjeel,
also known as H4, located approximately four kilometers east of the Western
Porphyries.'7? According to an Information Memorandum published by TCC in July 2005
(the "Information Memorandum"), TCC's objective was to become a major regional
supplier of copper to the Asian market. Its strategy was first to develop the Tanjeel

In July 2001, TCC completed a scoping study on the Tanjeel project.!7>

On 18 March 2002, the Government of Pakistan declared the H4 copper project an Export
Processing Zone ("EPZ"), which allowed TCC to enjoy favorable tax treatment, relaxed

import regulations and other benefits.'”®

In June 2003, the scoping study was updated on the basis of additional data obtained as a
result of TCC's exploration work, and a valuation study in relation to the Reko Dig project
was completed.!7”

In the Information Memorandum, TCC reported that a bankable feasibility study was
being prepared for the Tanjeel project, with a targeted completion date of December
2005.78

In the Quarterly Report for the period ended 31 December 2005,'”? TCCA reported that
it continued the exploration of EL-5, including ground magnetic surveys and drilling, and
progress of the Bankable Feasibility Study on Tanjeel (formerly known as H4), in
particular,

"[t]he initial results of the definitive engineering study on the Tanjeel
Project have identified significant capital cost increases. These suggest
that the development path for the project, on which the Feasibility Study
is based, may no longer be optimal.

TCC therefore decided to pause the definitive engineering study, while
the essential parameters of the project to take account of the new cost
structure were reviewed. This work should be completed by the end of
January 2006, after which, and subject to its outcome, the engineering
study would recommence. In the meantime, the other aspects of the
Bankable Feasibility Study are continuing.""°

Finally, TCCA reported its total expenditures (operating expenditures plus capital
expenditures) incurred up to 31 December 2005S since the grant of the Exploration License
EL-5, on 18 May 2002, as US$ 12.772 million, of which US$ 2.803 million had been

expended during the last quarter. '*°

Shortly before the 2006 Novation Agreement was signed on | April 2006, a meeting of
the OC was held on 11 February 2006. It was attended by Mr. Arbab Muhummad Yousaf,
Chairman, BDA; Mr. Muhammad Farooq, Director, BDA; Mr. Tim Hargreaves, CEO,
TCCP; Mr. Chris Arndt, Operations Manager, TCCA; and Mr. Zafar Iqbal, Finance
Manager TCCP. '*+

At this meeting, Mr. Hargreaves reported that, although the last meeting had been held
more than a year ago, on 16 December 2004, there had been frequent contacts and
dialogue within the joint venture, including key meetings on, inter alia, the proposed legal
structure and project agreements for the H4 (now Tanjeel) project; the development
concept, including necessary extension of the drilling program in light of recent
expansion of the resource estimate; the draft Shareholders Agreement and principles of
the 2006 Novation Agreement; and alternative commercial structures of the CHEJVA,

such as a net profit interest for the BDA instead of direct equity.!*°

Mr. Arndt then reported on the joint venture activities of 2005, a copy of which was
appended to the minutes of the meeting. '*° In response to the request from the Chairman
of BDA that for future meetings the reports be circulated in advance, Mr. Arndt agreed
and added that "the information contained was a summary of that contained in the
quarterly reports which had already been submitted."'*7

Mr. Arndt pointed out that 2005 had been the most active year of TCC's operations and
had included an unprecedented exploration drilling program of over 23,000 meters and
very extensive feasibility studies, demonstrating the potential of Reko Dig caldera with a
global resource of over 2 billion tons.'**

344. Mr. Iqbal also pointed out that over 50% of the total investment during the past five years
had been made during the year, reflected in the total expenditure for the year 2005 of US$
8.04 million. !*°

345. At the same meeting, TCCA reported on the status of the feasibility study on the Tanjeel
project. In response to a question from the Chairman of the BDA, Mr. Hargreaves noted
that at the previous OC meeting, it had been estimated that the feasibility study would be
completed by July 2005. However, as discussed at the 25 July 2005 meeting, by mid-
2005, it became clear that that schedule would not be met. He explained that the delay
was due to a number of reasons, including growth of the overall resource, requiring
additional drilling time; shortages of specialist engineering resources to complete the
engineering study; global increases in the costs of materials, equipment, labor and
specialist services, meaning that the overall project costs increased by more than 50%
from pre-feasibility estimates and required re-working of parts of the study; and
recognition of the need to broaden the original scope of the feasibility study to that of a
bankable feasibility study which required commencement and advancement of
negotiations with lenders for project financing, finalizing the structure for the mining
venture (being an incorporated joint venture) and negotiation of agreements, including a
Mineral Agreement, with the GOB and the Government of Pakistan (the "GOP") to
provide fiscal stability satisfactory to lenders. '°°

346. Further, Mr. Hargreaves noted that the cost estimates derived in the Engineering Design
and Cost Study were significantly higher than those anticipated in the earlier scoping
studies. He concluded:

"When these costs are considered in the context of the long term copper
price forecast in the Marketing Study the project, in its current scope
and form, is considered to be marginal. It is therefore appropriate to
seek alternative solutions involving the identification of a project with
more attractive economics."!?!

347. Mr. Hargreaves outlined potential alternative solutions, one of which was "consideration
of undertaking the development of the Reko Dig project as a whole, following further

exploration activity on Western Porphyries and completion of an appropriate bankable

feasibility study."'°? These options were to be considered after completion of the

Antofagasta transaction. !°?

At this meeting, it was resolved that "the term for completion of the feasibility study be
extended at least until the next Operating Committee to allow for a joint review of the
results and costs to date" and that "the scope of the feasibility study includes finance and
legal structures, including completion of the Shareholders Agreement and Mineral
Agreement and that these aspects of the study are delayed pending the outcome of the

Antofagasta transaction." +

As noted at paragraph 217 above, shortly before it was acquired by Atacama, TCCA
entered into the 2006 Novation Agreement with the Governor of Balochistan and BHP
on 1 April 2006.

TCC's Expanded Exploration Work (2006-2009)

a. The Scoping Work and Study

In May 2006, TCCA expanded the scope of its exploration program from Tanjeel to other
ore deposits within Reko Dig, in particular the H13, H14 and H15 orebodies at the
Western Porphyries. TCC also performed additional drilling at Tanjeel to explore the
hypogene copper orebody below the supergene copper body on which TCC’s exploration
work had focused so far.

In the Quarterly Report for the period ended 30 June 2006, TCCA reported:

"Work on the engineering aspects of the Tanjeel Bankable Feasibility
Study has been suspended, pending the completion of the drill out of the
Western Porphyries and further deeper drilling to test the hypogene
resource beneath the chalcocite blanket, which has yet to be
delineated."'”

TCCA listed the major milestones required to complete the Bankable Feasibility Study

as including a Shareholders Agreement with the BDA, a Mineral Agreement with the
GOB and GOP, obtaining required permits from the GOB and financing.

As for drilling, TCCA reported that the major drill out of the Western Porphyries (H-15)
was in progress. During the second quarter 2006, a total of 5,075.8 meters drilled in 15
drill holes (comprising 1,419 meters of RC and 3,656.8 meters of diamond core drilling)

was completed. !%°

355. An OC meeting was held on 15 July 2006. It was attended by Mr. Muhammad Farooq,
Chairman, BDA; Mr. Azim Nousherwani, General Manager Planning, BDA; Mr.
Eduardo Flores, CEO, TCCA; Mr. Tim Hargreaves, CEO, TCCP; Mr. Chris Arndt,
Operations Manager, TCCA; and Mr. Zafar Iqbal, Finance Manager, TCCP. 198

356. Mr. Arndt presented a summary of joint venture activities during the first half of 2006, a
copy of which was appended to the minutes of the meeting.!*? He reported that a major
drilling program had commenced during the past six months and that it was planned to
drill approximately 70,000 meters in the Western Porphyries on H-13, H-14 and H-15
and, in addition, to drill approximately 20,000 meters for H-4, H-35, H-36, H-8, Bukit
Bashir and possibly H-79. He reported, further, that in addition to the drillout of H-13, H-
14 and H-15, other work on the pre-feasibility study on the Western Porphyries had
commenced, or would commence shortly, including geotechnical studies, metallurgical
studs, hydrological studies and infrastructures studies.” Finally, Mr. Arndt reported on
the status of the Bankable Feasibility Study on the Tanjeel orebody and stated that work
had been suspended, pending the completion of the drill out of the Western Porphyries.”°!

357. Mr. Arndt reported that as a result of the drilling carried out at Reko Diq over the past
year, the global resource for Reko Dig had been calculated as follows:?°?

The Ore Reserve for the Tanjeel Project is a sub-set of the Mineral Resource for the Project:

Probable Ore Reserve (Tanjeel Project) 128.8 million tonnes @ 0.7% copper
(0.26% cvanide soluble conner cut-off)

358. At this meeting, Mr. Flores also gave a review of the pre-feasibility study. He stated that:

"the company wished to evaluate the potential of the Reko Diq caldera
as a whole rather than focus on individual ore bodies. In this context,
the Western Porphyries appeared likely to be the largest ore body but
the other ore bodies also needed additional drilling to confirm
resources including the Tanjeel ore body in which the supergene
deposit had been extensively drilled but the underlying hypogene ore
body still required further appraisal. He stated that the proposed 18
month program included 94,000 meters of additional drilling of which
70,000 would focus on the Western Porphyries."?°

359. At this OC meeting, the Joint Venture partners resolved that “the pre-feasibility studies
as outlined in the work program should commence immediately and that this program
should include both the drill out of the Western Porphyries as well as drilling to upgrade
the resources of the other significant ore bodies including the hypogene copper ore body

below the Tanjeel supergene deposit.” ”™*

360. On 18 July 2006, the Licensing Authority advised TCCA to apply for a mining lease of
H-4 (Tanjeel), stating:

“TCC in its progress reports and presentations had been informing of
preparing feasibility studies to launch H-4 (Tanjeel) project on
completion of ore reserves estimates. TCC has also reported to have
further proven the reserves at H-4 thus increasing the ore reserves
estimates. Consequent upon proving the reserves, no further
exploration at H-4 is warranted and the deposit is deemed to the ready
for commercial exploitation.

In pursuance to the Balochistan Mining Concession Rules no
Exploration Licence could be granted /renewed for more than 10 years.
Whereas, at H-4 exploration is underway since 1993. You are,
therefore, advised to apply for mining lease of H-4 deposits so that
mining operation could be launched, as the GOB as weil as
Government of Pakistan is taking keen interest in this project.”?°

361. On 12 September 2006, the Licensing Authority sent a reminder letter to TCCA, stating
that "[a]fter lapse of 5-years, we believe TCC must have finalized the feasibility study on
H4 prospect, incurring reported expenditure of US$ over 10 million" and requesting TCC
to provide a copy of the feasibility study of the H-4 project, in accordance with the
Balochistan Mineral Concession Rules, "on priority."°°

362. On 28 September 2006, TCCA responded to the Licensing Authority's request as follows:

"[P]lease note that TCC-BDA had earlier this year decided to re-scope
the feasibility study in order to include therein Western Porphyries and
other parts of the Reko Dig area and are currently undertaking pre-
feasibility work in respect of the Reko Dig area. As and when the
Feasibility Study is completed we will attach it with our application for
a mining lease for the area proposed to be mined.

Please note, however, that all preliminary engineering reports have
been provided to the Government of Balochistan and_ reports
comprising more than 3,000 pages were also delivered to BDA in early
2006. Please also note that in compliance with our obligations under
the Balochistan Mineral Rules 2002, we have been regularly providing
our quarterly reports, which contain full details of all work carried
out,"207

In the Quarterly Report for the period ended 31 December 2006, TCCA reported that
work on the Tanjeel Bankable Feasibility Study had been suspended pending the
completion of the drill-out of the Western Porphyries and the completion of a Pre-
Feasibility Study on the broader Reko Dig resource. It listed the major milestones to
complete the Bankable Feasibility Study as follows: Shareholders Agreement with the
BDA; Mineral Agreement with GOB and GOP; reaching agreement with the GOB and
the GOP on the implementation of modalities for critical infrastructure (e.g., power, roads
and training institutions); obtaining necessary permits and approvals from the GOP and
the GOP to implement the project; and completion of financing.?°°

TCCA reported that drilling continued on the Western Porphyries complex (H-13, H-14
and H-15) and recommenced on the Tanjeel deposit during the quarter; a total of 12,146.9
meters drilled in 32 drill-holes (comprising 5,069.5 meters of RC and 7,077.4 meters of
diamond core drilling) was completed.?”

According to the latest information, the current resource at the Western Porphyries (H-14
and H-15 only) stood at:

"Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource (0.3% copper-equivalent
cut-off grade):

1.61 billion tonnes © 0.54% copper and 0.30g/t gold

containing 8.69 million tonnes of copper (19 billion pounds) and 15.53

. At this meeting, Mr. Livesey gave a summary of joint venture activities during 2006, a

copy of which was appended to the minutes of the meeting.?!> He then presented an
outline of the 2007 work program, a copy of which was also attached to the minutes. Mr.
Livesey stated that "since the Tanjeel Feasibility Study was commenced in 2005 and its
suspension in early 2006, there had been major changes to the project including the
resource upgrade of the Western Porphyries as well as the increase in worldwide mining
costs which had increased the Tanjeel project costs and made the economics less
attractive. It was necessary to study a range of development options in light of the new
information."?'+ He explained that:

"a new scoping study of the global resource at Reko Dig was required
which would consider the early 2006 global resource upgrade to 2.4
billion tonnes and review a suite of options for development of a large
scale mine but would also include the concept of a smaller start up
project."7!°

Mr. Livesey stated that the object was to complete the study before the end of 2007.7!°

Mr. Livesey commented on what he called the "GOB's [expression of] concern at the lack
of submission of reports for the previous Tanjeel Feasibility Study."*"’ He stated that the
engineering reports, all of which were in draft form at the point of suspension, had been
delivered to the BDA in early 2006. He added that it could be misleading to submit these
draft reports to the GOB since they would effectively become public documents
containing outdated information, particularly on costs, and, given that they contained over
3,000 pages of information, there was a risk of extracts of information causing further
confusion. He stated that "this created a difficult situation for GOB, particularly in light
of the Constitutional Petition in which it was alleged that very little work had actually

371. The OC resolved that:

"the Work Program and Budget for 2007 as presented be approved,
including the exploration and scoping study, details of which is still
being finalized, subject to revision at the next Operating Committee
Meeting when the scoping study and air strip costs have been refined."

372. During the next three quarters, TCCA reported that drilling continued on the Western

Porphyries complex (H-14 and H-15). In the first quarter, TCCA reported that the aim of
its ground magnetic survey was to complete all of EL-5 on at least 100 meter spaced lines
to identify any areas worthy of prospecting outside the Reko Dig caldera and also to gain
an accurate visual appreciation for the structure of the Reko Diq caldera and to understand
the spatial distribution of the porphyry systems that were located within.” In addition,
in the second quarter, two concurrent geological mapping programs had identified two
new prospects, Siapat and Nawar, located approximately four kilometers from the Bukit
Pasir complex, and re-mapped the H-13 complex area for drilling in the coming
quarter.?”? In the third quarter, drilling was also conducted in the H-13 complex, and new
prospects were identified north of Koh-i-Dalil, near the Humai village and in the Sam
Koh area (southeast of Koh-i-Dalil). Samples were collected from these areas for
pathfinder assay.”

375. TCC prepared the Scoping Study jointly with Hatch Ltd., a leading engineering
consultancy. It aimed to build and evaluate a matrix of different project configurations
based on, inter alia, various locations, mine sizes, processing technologies, power
generation methods and transportation routes, and then to identify the most promising

options for the development of the Reko Diq project.?*°

376. Specifically, the Scoping Study examined thirteen final project development options,
each with estimated cost and revenue projections. The Final Scoping Study Report, dated
12 October 2007, recommended that four of the options examined be promoted for further
consideration: Three configurations at the Western Porphyries based on different

processing capacities, and one configuration at Tanjeel.??!

. At the meeting, TCCA, as Manager, represented by Mr. Flew and by Mr. Flores (for the

relevant period), presented a summary of activity carried out and expenditure incurred up
to September 2007. They highlighted that work had been continued to determine the
extent of reserves with the Western Porphyries as the "main prize" and, possibly, to
develop other ore bodies on a smaller scale as a starter project. Following detailed
mapping, the focus of the geological team had shifted primarily to the drill out of the
resource at the Western Porphyries. In addition, the scoping study for the pre-feasibility
and feasibility study had been carried out.?*3

According to the minutes of the meeting, the parties agreed that there was significant
evidence that ore discovered in EL-5 could lead to a larger mining project than the one
that was originally envisaged; however, the joint venture faced a number of technical and
other challenges which would affect its ability to complete a full feasibility study during
the first renewal period. These challenges included, inter alia:

"After new work and additional analysis the Tanjeel project found

not to be economic on its own.

- Only additional work outside the Tanjeel area by the JV
developed a play for a larger scale project based on the newly
discovered WP deposits, which discoveries also transformed the
Tanjeel ore deposits to a potential economic and value adding
activity.

- Progress on some pre-feasibility work was made during the first
renewal period but scoping study level analysis on WP could only
be completed in the Q3 of 2007 thus positioning the JV to
immediately proceed to the next step — commencement and
completion of a full feasibility study.

- Insufficient time available during the first renewal period for
completion of elements of a feasibility study of this type — such as
environmental impact assessments, sustainability of water
resources, availability of power, transport and logistics.

- Challenge to the JV's right to EL-5 which was subject to
proceedings in the Balochistan High Court and which is now
pending appeal in the Supreme Court.

- Inability to make progress on the Mineral Agreement over the
past four months.

- Delay in obtaining Government approvals for TCC to open its
branch office in Pakistan."34

. According to the minutes of the meeting, "[i]n view of the potential for developing the

project, TCC and BDA agreed that the JV through TCC as Manager should move

immediately to commence and complete feasibility study. In this connection TCC
presented a work plan and preliminary budget for full feasibility study on option 72 ktpd
and parallel pre-feasibility study on expansion options. The parties agreed the conceptual
preliminary budget of US$ 106.5 million TCC was authorized to make carry out the
feasibility."

At the meeting, TCC pointed out that Exploration License EL-5 was to expire in February
2008 and that an application for renewal of the license had to be filed with the
Government of Balochistan by 22 November 2007. TCC stated, inter alia, that "given the
wide area over which discoveries had been made and the time that would be needed to
carry out the feasibility study to tie all the deposits together, the ongoing challenges to
EL 5 in the Courts of Pakistan and the expected additional delays in finalization of the
Mineral Agreement," it recommended that the request for renewal be over 90% of the
existing EL-5 area and that the term of renewal be three years. According to the minutes,
BDA endorsed the recommendation and TCC was given "full authority" to apply for such
renewal. In addition, "BDA committed its full support to the JV's case before the

Government of Balochistan."**°

On 2 November 2007, TCCA, on behalf of the joint venture, applied to the Director
General, Mines & Minerals, GOB for a renewal of Exploration License EL-5 for revised/
reduced plans of 435.02 square kilometers (107516.65 acres) for a further period of three
years (20 February 2008 to 19 February 201 1).7°”

Rule 29(2)(c)(iii) of the 2002 BM Rules required that an application for the renewal of a
license shall not be made:

"in the case of a second renewal, unless the applicant can satisfy the
authority that such a renewal is necessary for the completion of a full
feasibility study of the discovered deposits and that the proposed
activities could not have been reasonably completed during the period
of the first renewal."?°>

In its application of 2 November 2007, TCCA enclosed a justification for its application,
summarizing its activities carried out during the first renewal period and explaining a
number of technical and other challenges which affected its ability to complete a full
feasibility study during the first renewal period. TCCA explained its request for the
extension as follows:

budget of over US$ 100 million in this regard.

With EL-5 to expire in February, 2008 the Applicant will be able to
commence activities for drawing up the Feasibility Study in the first
renewal period but will not be able to complete the same given the time
that will be needed to carry out the Feasibility Study to tie the
development of all the deposits, which are spread over a large area of
EL-5 (some of which are still being reviewed through further drilling
work) together into one mining project. Additional work is also
need{ed] to better understand the deep structure as possible
interconnection of deposits significantly increases the resource size.
This taken together with the ongoing challenges to EL 5 in the courts of
Pakistan and the expected additional delays in the finalization of the
Mineral Agreement, the Applicant considers that it requires a renewal
for the full three year period over 90% of the existing EL-5 area to be
in a position to fully develop the discoveries.

The Balochistan Development Authority is fully aware of the grounds
and reasons on which the renewal is being sought and fully endorses
the request.""°?

. TCCA also attached as Annexure C "Work Programme and Budget for Second Renewal

Period" outlining its proposal for the Feasibility Study and describing its Projected
Exploration Program for 2008 to 2011, which focused on the Reko Diq Complex, the
Kohi Dalil Complex, the infrastructure areas and the EL-5 Region. The proposed budget
for the second renewal period totaled US$ 106,500,500.74°

On 1 December 2007, the Licensing Authority granted the joint venture's application for
the second renewal of Exploration License EL-5.74!

ce. Continuing Exploration and Engineering Work in Support of the Pre-
Feasibility and Feasibility Studies

After the 26 October 2007 OC meeting, TCCA started work on a Pre-Feasibility Study
for Initial Mine Development for a base case project at the Western Porphyries and an
Expansion Pre-Feasibility Study for expansion of the project to include Tanjeel and other
deposits within Reko Diq.”*?

This represented a nearly 100% increase over the mineral resource estimate that TCC had

produced in early 2006.°°

After making application in February 2008, while it was still working on the Pre-
Feasibility Study, on 22 May 2008, TCC paid the Balochistan Board of Revenue over
US$ 11 million®° for a 30-year Surface Rights Lease, which secured its rights, as joint
venture partner, of access and occupation over an area of 147 square kilometers (144568
acres) that overlap with the area delineated by Exploration License EL-5.°! This land
would eventually be needed to construct facilities and other infrastructure to support
mining operations, including a tailings dam, a landfill, a waste-management facility, a

irstri A : 262
new airstrip, a construction camp, and a permanent village.

In July 2009, TCC completed the Pre-Feasibility Study for initial mine development. This
Pre-Feasibility Study, which had been prepared jointly with global engineering firm SNC-
Lavalin, totaled more than 1,500 pages. It confirmed that the recommended “base
case” configuration would entail processing 110,000 tons of ore per day from the main
Western Porphyries deposits, H14 and H15.7*

In November 2006, the Validity of the CHEJVA Was Challenged in the Balochistan
High Court

On 28 November 2006, on the basis of a news article reporting TCC’s acquisition by
Antofagasta and Barrick, three Pakistani politicians from the Jamaat E Islami Party and
National Workers Party filed a constitutional petition under Article 199 of the Pakistani
Constitution in the Balochistan High Court seeking invalidation of the CHEJVA.?°

The petitioners alleged, among other things, that (i) the 1970 BMC Rules did not
contemplate joint venture arrangements such as the CHEJVA,; (ii) the 1994 Relaxations
granted by Balochistan to the 1970 BMC Rules were illegal; (iii) the 2002 BM Rules were
adopted under improper influence from TCC; and (iv) “no real work” had been carried
out by TCC and BHP.*® The petitioners requested that the CHEJVA, and all actions taken
pursuant to it, be declared “illegal, ultra vires, unconstitutional and mala fides and liable
to be set aside.”?*’ The Provincial Government, the Federal Government, the BDA, BHP,
TCC, TCC’s owners, and a former director of TCC were all named as respondents in the
action.

In their submissions to the High Court, Pakistan and Balochistan defended the validity of
the CHEJVA and the work that TCC and BHP had conducted under the auspices of the
Joint Venture. The Provincial Government assured the High Court that Balochistan had
not “committed any illegality or done anything in bad faith” and that Balochistan “acted
in the best interest of the people of Balochistan and any suggestion to the contrary is

false.”?® Pakistan likewise submitted that the petitioners’ claims were
99270

‘not
maintainable” and should be “dismissed in the interest of justice.

On 26 June 2007, the Balochistan High Court issued a judgment upholding the validity
of the CHEJVA and dismissing the petitioners’ claims in their entirety.?”! Specifically,
the High Court rejected the petitioners’ arguments, holding that:

(i) (i) "[the] CHEJVA was rightly executed, as Article 173 of the
Constitution empowers the Provincial Government to enter into such
agreement and BDA has entered into the agreement as an Agent of

the Government of Balochistan; ua72

(ii) in the Relaxations to the 1970 BM Rules granted by Balochistan, "the
Government has exercised its powers Strictly in accordance with the
forecorner [four corners] of the Rules;”?”

(iii) “there is nothing on record to prove [that the 2002 BM Rules were
framed under the influence of TCC];” and the 2002 BM Rules “were
framed, after promulgation of Mineral Policy of 1995, wherein the
Mining Rules of all the Provinces were re-framed;”?”* and

(iv) considering BHP's exploration operation by which Reko Diq was
identified to have copper-gold deposits and license PL-4 covering this
area was retained and TCC's huge investment and extensive drilling,
“the question that no work was done is baseless.'””>

397. Further, with respect to the work carried out by BHP and TCC, the High Court observed
that:

"Tilt was due to the efforts of [BHP] that minerals were discovered,
whereas the same would remain hidden for unknown time and the
people of Balochistan would not be deriving any benefits.

[I]¢ is but natural that [TCC] would be keen in doing the mining at the
earliest. Since exploration is a time-consuming work, which involves

drilling, collection of samples and tests, . . . thus it can be safely
concluded that, lot has been done and efforts have been made to start
the mining, which ... is a slow and time consuming process

Suffice it to say that mining areas are not put to auction. Mining
licenses are issued at different stages, as it is a risky business and after
exploration by a party when the area is proved, then it becomes his
vested right to do mining."?”°

398. On 23 August 2007, the petitioners appealed the High Court’s judgment to the Pakistan
Supreme Court.?”’

Starting in 2007, Claimant Attempted to Negotiate a Mineral Agreement with the
Governments of Pakistan and Balochistan

While TCC was implementing its exploration program, it also sought to negotiate with
the Federal and Provincial Governments a mineral agreement, which would set forth the
basic economic and financial terms and certain stability provisions for a future mining
phase of the project (the “Mineral Agreement”).”” Mineral agreements are not
mandatory, but they are expressly contemplated in the 2002 BM Rules and Pakistan’s
1995 NMP.?”

In late January 2007, TCC met in Islamabad with representatives of Pakistan and
Balochistan to propose the negotiation of the Mineral Agreement.**? The two
Governments designated the Balochistan Chief Secretary and the Secretary of the Federal
Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources (the "MPNR") as the Government officials
responsible for conducting the negotiations. The parties agreed to defer the submission of
the draft agreement until the Balochistan High Court had ruled on the Article 199 petitions
referred to in paragraph 393 above.”*!

On 4 July 2007, TCC wrote to the Chief Minister of Balochistan and, on 5 July 2007, to
the Federal Minister of Petroleum and Natural Resources, requesting the start of
negotiations of the Mineral Agreement and enclosing a proposal on how the negotiations
could be organized and conducted so the agreement could be finalized in a timely
manner.”** In its letters, TCCA informed the GOB and the GOP that its proposed
agreement would include provisions dealing with the following areas:

(i) _ taxes — federal and provincial tax regime that would apply to the Project, including
the rate, calculation and payment of royalties to the GOB and taxes to the GOP;

(i) | mining and other commitments — commitments by the project company in respect
of development of the Project and social, employment and procurement matters;

(ii) infrastructure — provision of infrastructure (in particular roads, railway and power)
for the Project by the GOP and the GOB;

(iii) mineral titles and other property rights — the grant of and rights under mineral titles
as well as other property rights required for the development of the Project;

(iv) consents and other government obligations — various obligations on the GOP and
the GOB in respect of consents and other legislative protection and other assistance
that would be required by the project company in respect of the development of the
Project; and

(v) _ other areas — provisions dealing with other areas that have commonly been included
in stabilization agreements for mining projects and/or other state support

agreements for similar projects.?**

In its letters, TCCA stated that in order "[t]o underpin the legal framework set up by this
Mineral Agreement, it would be necessary to make certain changes to Pakistani federal
and provincial law" which would mainly relate to federal and provincial tax law, and the
Balochistan Mineral Rules.?*+ TCCA explained that it was requesting this agreement in
order to "create the necessary stability and certainty” for TCCA’s investment in the

construction and operation of the mine, once the mining lease had been granted.”*°

In its enclosed proposal for the organization and conduct of the negotiations, TCCA
recommended the establishment of a joint Pakistan-Balochistan Steering Committee,
which would negotiate the Mineral Agreement with TCCA.?*°

On 11 July 2007, Antofagasta’s chairman, Mr. Jean-Paul Luksic, and Barrick's then CEO,
Mr. Greg Wilkins, provided the Prime Minister of Pakistan with a proposed draft for the
Mineral Agreement as a basis for the negotiations.”*’ On 27 July 2007, TCC sent copies
of the proposed draft Mineral Agreement to the Governments of Pakistan and

Balochistan.”

On 3 September 2007, the Prime Minister of Pakistan established a “Steering Committee
for the Development of Reko Dig Copper — Gold Project” (the “Steering Committee”)
for the purpose of “finaliz[ing] the terms and conditions of the Mineral Agreement with
TCC” and “coordinat[ing] with the Federal & Provincial Governments.”?*? It was chaired
by the Minister of Petroleum & Natural Resources Mr. Amanullah Khan Jadoon and
consisted of thirteen high-level Federal and Provincial Government officials including,
among others, Balochistan’s Chief Secretary, the Chairman of the BDA (who represented
Balochistan at the Joint Venture’s OC), and the Secretary of the Balochistan Mines &

appeal authority for decisions of the Licensing Authority).?°°

The Federal Government also hired German consultants M/S RMG to advise it regarding

the Mineral Agreement.”*!

In mid-December 2007, TCCA met in Dubai with representatives of Pakistan and
Balochistan to formally kick off the Mineral Agreement negotiations and TCCA made a
full day presentation regarding TCCA, Reko Dig, the Project, the Pakistan Mineral Policy
and the draft Mineral Agreement.”

On 23 February 2008, the Steering Committee met for the first time to discuss the draft

Mineral Agreement.?°?

Five days earlier, on 18 February 2008, Pakistan had held general elections for the
Pakistan Parliament and the four Provincial assemblies, including that of Balochistan.
The elections resulted in the formation of a new Federal Government led by Prime
Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani and a new Government of Balochistan led by Mr. Aslam
Raisani, both of the Pakistan Peoples Party. The formation of the new Governments
resulted in a re-constitution of the Steering Committee and temporarily delayed the

Governments’ consideration of TCCA’s proposed draft Mineral Agreement.?”*

On 7 August 2008, Pakistan and Balochistan provided TCCA with their comments and

counterproposals to the Mineral Agreement.”

On 18 August 2008, TCCA wrote to the Federal MPNR to express its key concerns about
the counterproposal and to request further meetings to negotiate the Agreement.?*°
According to TCCA, the Governments’ joint draft provided, inter alia, for (i) the
application of the Pakistani income tax regime in place of the proposed expansion of the
existing EPZ regime granted in respect of the initial phase of the Reko Diq project; (ii)
an increase in the royalty rate to 5% from 2%, contrary to the 2002 BM Rules and the
1995 NMP; (iii) discretion on the part of the BDA in granting mineral titles, such as a
mining lease, reintroducing general legal and contractual uncertainty and denying TCCP.
security of tenure in respect of such mineral titles (key elements in creating a secure
regime to allow large scale projects); (iv) watering down of the territorial exclusivity over

mineral titles; and (iv) the Mineral Agreement being at all times subject to the 2002 BM
Rules in force at the time (rather than providing, as requested by TCCA, that the terms of
the Mineral Agreement override any inconsistency with the 2002 BM Rules, or amending
the 2002 BM Rules to ensure compatibility with the Mineral Agreement).”*” In addition,
the Governments’ counterproposal included provisions regarding the construction of
facilities for smelting and refining, as well as downstream facilities more generally —
neither of which, according to Claimant, was required by the CHEJVA or the 2002 BM
Rules.”

On 8-9 September and 15-24 October 2008, TCC held two rounds of negotiations with a
subcommittee of the Steering Committee.” By letter dated 24 October 2008 to Mr. G.A.
Sabri, Secretary, Federal MPNR, Ms. Catherine Boggs, the CEO of TCCP, listed the final
issues that needed to be resolved. These issues included:

1. Tax Regime — stability in regards to the tax regime that would be
applicable for the life of the project, in particular, reduction of the
corporate tax rate applicable to mining projects from 35% to 25%;
reduction from 5% to 0% of the customs duties, sales tax, excise duty
rates and other taxes on the importation of plant, machinery, equipment,
specialized motor vehicles and supplies applicable to Tethyan and its
contractors and subcontractors; reduction of the applicable tax on profit
on foreign debt from 10% to 0%; reduction of the dividend withholding
rate from 10% to 3.75%; extension of the concentrating/refining profits
exemption from 5 to 10 years; and confirmation through an Advisory
Opinion that any internal reorganizations within the group companies
of which TCC is relevant will not constitute an event subject to capital
gains taxes.

2. State Bank of Pakistan — authorization from the State Bank of
Pakistan that Tethyan can maintain the proceeds from sales of its copper
concentrate in bank accounts outside of Pakistan.

3. Applicable termination payment — proposed formula for use by either
party for calculating damages in the event of termination of the
agreement, i.e., the higher of the total investment or the discounted
future cash flow of the project, subject to such mitigation and
compensatory adjustments that the arbitration tribunal determines are
appropriate.

necessary for the project during its construction and operation
(Governments' agreement in principle to confirm that Tethyan would
receive these consents, subject to the company fulfilling the
requirements of the law for obtaining such consent or approvals).

5. Drafting issues - TCCA and Governments' apparent agreement in
principle, but subject to agreement on the final language, on (i)
uninsurable events; (ii) lapse of consent/change of law; (iii)
infrastructure and applicable tax credits; (iv) consideration of future

413. TCCP concluded that "as you can see, we believe that other than agreement on stability

of and the applicable tax regime, we are very close to reaching agreement on all of the
commercial terms of the agreement."*"!

414. The topics discussed were also confirmed by Mr. Muhammad Rashid, Section Officer, of
the Federal MPNR, in a draft Record Note on the negotiations 15-17 and 22-23 October
2008, as follows:

"The Additional Secretary M/o PNR while recapping the discussions of
first meeting held on 8-9" September 2008 highlighted the impotence
[sic] of the Reko Dig Copper Project (RDCP) for the mineral sector and
economy of Pakistan and mentioned that GOP and GOB were desirous
to conclude the DMA in accordance with exiting [sic] framework of
fiscal and legal regimes of the country in the shortest possible period
and will provide all the requisite support in this regard. The left over
negotiable issues such as tax and royalty regimes, authorization from
the State Bank of Pakistan, infrastructure provisions, compensation
formula for calculating damages in. the event of termination of the
agreement/project, schedule with an indicative list of the consents and
approvals, drafting issues such as (i) uninsurable events; (ii)
infrastructure and applicable tax credits; (iii) consideration of future

resolved, summarizing TCCP's proposals and attaching draft amendments to the 2002
BM Rules which she stated "would apply to all mining projects, not only to Tethyan, and
are designed to make consistent the manner in which the BMR are applied to a licensee
having a Mineral Agreement."* TCCP proposed the following amendments:

"Amendments to the BMR:

Similar to the Balochistan Mineral Rules 1970 which provided that the
Mineral Agreement provisions would take precedence over the rules in
the event of conflict or inconsistency, and Section 3A of the Regulation
of Mines and Oil-Fields and Mineral Development (Government
Control) Act, 1948, we would request the GOB to graciously consider
to introduce the following generally applicable amendments to the
BMR:

Rule 9 sub-rule (1): at line 3, delete the words ‘not
inconsistent with these Rules or any other law."

sub-rule (5): replace entirely by: 'The provisions of a
mineral agreement executed between the Government of
Balochistan and a mineral title holder, shall be considered
to be complementary to these Rules for the particular
mineral title holder and shall take precedence over the
provisions of these Rules in case of any inconsistency at any
given time.’

sub-rule (6): add "Except as provided in sub-rule 9(5),' at
the beginning of the Rule.

Rule 102 add ‘Subject to Rule 103' at the beginning of the Rule.

Rule 103: rename and replace entirely the Rule, as follows: '103
Mineral Agreement Royalty. Where pursuant to Rule 9, a mineral
agreement makes specific provision for the payment of royalty by the
holder of a mineral title, in respect of any mineral or group of minerals
won, mined or found, the rate of royalty shall be payable in accordance
with the provisions of the mineral agreement, notwithstanding the rate
from time to time stated in the accordance with these Rules. "7%

Chinese state-owned construction firm, China Metallurgical Group Corporation
(“MCC”), would present to the Steering Committee some competing “Financial and
Technical Proposals” for Reko Dig.*°° The agenda stated that the Steering Committee
would consider “the future course of actions on the proposals submitted by TCC and
MCC.”**’ MCC was invited to attend the Steering Committee meeting.**

On 22 January 2009, TCCP sent a letter of protest to Pakistan’s MPNR rejecting any
suggestion that TCC compete with MCC for a project to which TCC was contractually
entitled, in which it was a partner of the Provincial Government, and in which it had
already invested almost US$ 200 million for exploration and feasibility work.*” By the
same letter, TCC explained that it would “not be able to attend the proposed meeting,
because it is not in conformity of the terms of reference of the Steering Committee,” but
emphasized that TCC would otherwise be “prepared to meet with the Steering Committee
to continue [its] negotiations in good faith.”>"°

On 23 January 2009, the Steering Committee proceeded with its meeting in TCC’s
absence and rejected MCC’s proposal.*"! It was decided that:

"GOP/GOB to continue with TCC, as entertaining of MCC proposal at this
stage may lead to legal implications and affect creditability of Pakistan in the
International Mineral Sector."°'?

. The Working Paper for the Steering Committee meeting reasoned that:

"[ulnder the Balochistan Mineral Rules (BMR) 2002, the license holder
is legally entitled [to the] conversion of prospecting license into mining
lease, once the area is proved and certain laid down requirements
under the rules are fulfilled by the licensee. The project area of Reko
Dig Copper Project has been granted to TCC (Pvt) Ltd by the GOB who
carried out intensive exploration work and has spent about US$ 46
million on the establishment of over 4.0 billion tons of copper ore

reserves."3!3

discussion/finalization — which was similar to the list in Ms. Boggs' letter five months
earlier — included the following:

"(a) Stability/exemption in Tax Regime.

(b) Authorization from State Bank of Pakistan to maintain the
proceeds from sale.

(c) Drafting of legal issues relating to stability in royalty regime and
exemption from Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 2002 and stamp
duty on transfer etc.

(d) Value addition upto [sic] final refinery stage.

(e) Any other matter with the permission of the chair.°!+

. The working paper for the Steering Committee meeting noted that:

"The feasibility study is under way for a mega project involving an
investment of . . . over US$ 5 billion with the capacity to produce 0.45
million tonnes of copper concentrate annually by year 2013. On
commissioning the annual copper concentrate export from the project
would be more than US$ one billion (LME prices). This development
augurs well for the mining industry of Pakistan and place [sic] Pakistan
on the world map of copper and gold mining."*!*

. On 21 July 2011, a review meeting was held under the Chairmanship of Dr. Asim

Hussain, the Minister for Petroleum and Natural Resources/ Chairman Steering
Committee on Reko Dig Project to review the latest status of the project and formulation
of a joint strategy of the GOP and the GOB for a future course of action. The
representative of the GOB, Mr. Mushtaq Ahmad Raisani, Secretary, MMDD, informed
that the application of TCC for mining lease could not have been processed earlier
because the apex court had issued a restraining order on 3 February 2011 which had been
recalled on 25 May 2011. He declared that "the GOB will decide on the application of
TCC for mining lease to the true spirit of BMR, 2002 and the direction of the honorable

Supreme Court."?!°

At this review meeting, on a query from the Chair regarding value addition up to final
refining, TCC's CEO Mr. Livesey responded that TCC had ore processing capacity up to
concentrate stage and processing beyond that stage was not financially viable to it. TCC
mentioned that it would "provide financial assistance of US$ 1.000 million to carry out

technical feasibility study on smelting and refining."?""

424. When the Director General pointed out that Jinchuan Group China had offered to set up
a full facility for processing of concentrate up to final refining of gold and copper based
on the concentrate produced by TCC at Reko Digq, Mr. Livesey stated that "the company
will have no objection to this proposal. TCC are willing to negotiate an off take agreement

for the sale of concentrate within Balochistan."?'8

425. On5 August 2009, to address the issue that Balochistan wanted to provide in the Mineral
Agreement for a smelter at Reko Dig, TCCA submitted to Pakistan and Balochistan a
paper regarding copper smelting and refining. The paper explained, among other things,
that smelting was a low-margin business that typically depended on massive volume from
multiple sources.*!? The paper concluded that:

"Building a smelter and refinery as part of the Reko Dig Project (1) is
not economically justified; (2) the additional capital costs would make
the Reko Dig project unprofitable and therefore unviable; and (3) is not
necessary in order to ensure that TCC and the GOB are properly paid
for the metal content of the concentrate that is produced [by TCC’s
planned mining operation].

We have discussed with the GOB and the GOP the concept of either the
provincial or federal government constructing and operating a smelter
and refinery of its own to process concentrate from Reko Dig... . if
such a facility were built, TCC/GOB could sell a portion of its
concentrate to an in-country smelter at best international,
commercially negotiated prices."**°

426. On 2 September 2009, at a meeting of the Federal Board of Investment, the Director
General (Minerals) of the Federal MPNR indicated that Pakistan and Balochistan were
willing to negotiate the outstanding issues of the Mineral Agreement, including tax
exemptions and incentives and “[v]alue addition up to final refinery stage.”*?! TCCA
reiterated its commitment to the Reko Dig project, but emphasized that a smelter/refinery
at Reko Diq was not “financially viable.”*?? TCC suggested that the “Government of

Pakistan may buy the concentrate [from the Joint Venture’s mining operation] and build

their own smelter.”>°

On 2 December 2009, TCCA wrote to the Balochistan Chief Secretary, Mr. Nasir Khosa,
expressing concern that “it has been a number of months since TCCP received any formal
communication from the GOB,” in particular regarding the smelter paper submitted to the
GOB in August, and urged the Governments to resume the negotiations of the Mineral
Agreement in preparation for project financing and implementation.*”4 Although the issue of
agreeing the Mineral Agreement was subsequently discussed during meetings with
various officials of the Pakistan and Balochistan Governments, negotiations were not
resumed; the Mineral Agreement was never finalized.3?5

Starting in 2007, Claimant Attempted to Negotiate a Mining Venture Agreement>”°
with the Government of Balochistan in respect of Exploration License EL-5

Under Clause 11.7 of the CHEJVA, the Participating Parties were obligated to segregate
from the Exploration Area the Mining Area established by the Feasibility Study and
establish a joint venture (Mining Venture) with respect to such area. Under Clause 11.8.2
of the CHEJVA, the Joint Venture or a Participating Party was entitled to convert the
Prospecting License into a Mining Lease, but under rule 47(1) of the BM Rules, an
application for a mining lease could only be granted to a body corporate formed under
the Companies Ordinance 1984 and other provisions of the laws of Pakistan. For these
reasons, TCCA proposed using its wholly-owned subsidiary TCCP, which had been
established in Pakistan, as the vehicle for the Mining Venture.

Although TCCA had not yet delivered its Initial Mine Feasibility Study — and thus the
GOB had not yet been required to elect whether to become a Participating Party, TCCA
proposed to establish the new joint venture for Exploration License EL-5 by having the
parties transfer their interests in Exploration License EL-5 to TCCP in exchange for
shares of the corporation and enter into a project agreement to regulate their relationship
as shareholders in TCCP during the Mining Venture, replacing the CHEJVA in this
respect, in accordance with Article 12.7 of the CHEJVA.

Thus, for its part, TCCA would merge its branch office which held its 75% interest in
Exploration License EL-5 and other assets and rights related to the exploration work
undertaken pursuant to EL-5S to its subsidiary TCCP. On 16 January 2008, the TCCA
Pakistan branch office and TCCP petitioned the Lahore High Court to sanction a Scheme
of Arrangement for Amalgamation ("Amalgamation") by which the TCCA Pakistan
branch office's entire business, together with all the property, assets, rights, liabilities and
obligations of every description (including but not limited to the licenses) would be
amalgamated with and transferred to TCCP.*?”

In connection with the Amalgamation, TCCA was required to obtain the consent of the
Balochistan MMDD. The MMDD issued a "No Objection Certificate" dated 5 November
2007, subject to the following condition:

"There is no objection to the transfer-assignment of the area covered
by EL-5 by TCC to TCCP. Such no-objection is subject to registering
the shareholder status of the component companies including the 25%
share held by the Government of Balochistan (through BDA) and 75%
shareholding of TCC."

TCCA was also required to obtain the consent of the BDA, which issued its "No Objection
Certificate" on 3 January 2008, also subject to the condition:

"There is no objection to the transfer-assignment of the area covered
by Exploration License EL-5 by TCC to TCCP, such No-objection is
subject to registration of the share holding status of the component
Companies including the 25% share held by the Government of
Balochistan (through BDA) and 75% share holding of TCC."°??

The Amalgamation was approved by order of the Islamabad High Court on 11 April
2008.3°°

As stated above, TCCA had proposed that the GOB transfer its 25% interest in
Exploration License EL-5 to TCCP in exchange for a 25% share of TCCP and
simultaneously enter into a shareholders/project agreement with TCCA. TCCA had
delivered a draft shareholder/project agreement to the Secretary Law and Secretary

within a short time period.**?

435. On 24 October 2008, TCCP received comments to the draft Project Agreement from the
law firm of Hussain & Hussain on behalf of the GOB.*** The major issues for the GOB
related to shareholder funding and equity debt: The GOB proposed that all shareholder
funding would be provided by TCCA in the form of shareholder loans and that TCCA
would fund the GOB's share of all costs to be incurred by TCCP until the initial

commencement date (so-called equity debt amounts).***

436. On 23 May 2009, TCCP proposed alternative structures for the GOB's interest, whereby
instead of making an equity contribution, the GOB would have a free carry, i.e., it would
be a shareholder of TCCP and be entitled to receive dividends in proportion to its
(reduced) 6% interest and a 2% royalty, or, in the alternative, a net profit interest (NPI)
in an incorporated joint venture, i.e., it would not be required to make any contributions
to investment; it would receive 25% of net profits after payback of investment and, prior
to that date, if there were profits, it would receive advance minimum payments of PKR
800 million (then approximately US$ 10 million) per year credited against future
payments or, if there were no profits, it would receive minimum guaranteed payments of

PKR 400 million per year credited against future payments.**°

437. As stated at paragraph 427 above, on 2 December 2009, TCCA wrote to the Balochistan
Chief Secretary, Mr. Nasir Khosa, expressing concern that “it has been a number of
months since TCCP received any formal communication from the GOB,” in particular
regarding the proposals in June and again in August to change the 25% GOB equity to a 25%
Net Profit Interest, and urged the Governments to resume the negotiations of the Project

Agreement in preparation for project financing and implementation.**°

of the Federal Planning Commission. It proposed the processing of 5000 tons of copper
ore per day to produce copper metal and other valuables with a total expenditure of Rs

440. On 1 September 2009, Additional Chief Secretary Ahmad Bakhsh Lehri submitted on
behalf of Balochistan a request to Pakistan for funding of the Planning Commission's

proposed project.*?

Commission, making specific reference to Reko Diq orebodies, including the Western
Porphyries and Tanjeel, including a cost analysis for processing 15000 tons per day and

increasing the total expenditure to Rs 5892 million.*4!

443. On 27 October 2009, the Government of Balochistan constituted a Board of Governors
for the Reko-Diq Project consisting of seven members, including Dr. Mubarakmand,
Member, GOP Planning Commission, as Chairman, and the Secretary of the MMDD.*4?

On 24 December 2009, the Balochistan Cabinet decided "in principle," on the basis of
the PC-1 proposal approved by the Planning Commission, “to [take] over [the] Rekodiq
Copper & Gold Project from TCCP.” The Cabinet “further decided not to go ahead with
the proposed Mineral and Shareholders agreements with TCCP"; the “[flurther course
of action would be decided by the Chief Minister”>°

On 25 December 2009, the online edition of the Pakistani daily newspaper The Dawn
reported that the Balochistan Cabinet had unanimously decided to “cancel” TCC’s
“exploration contract” at Reko Diq. According to the article, Chief Minister Raisani had
told the press that the “[c]ancellation of the Reko Dik copper and gold project agreement
is a step towards getting control over provincial resources in accordance with the wishes
The article reported that:

of the people.”

"the provincial department of mines and mineral [development] had

submitted a PC-I for setting up a plant in Reko Dik for processing

15,000 tons of ore. .. Official sources said the Balochistan government

had handed over affairs of the project to the department of mines and

mineral development and acquired the services of eminent nuclear

scientist Dr Samar Mubarakmand who would head its board of

governors."*46
On 31 December 2009, the Secretary of the MMDD issued a memorandum to
Balochistan’s Chief Secretary commenting on TCC’s “tremendous efforts in discovering
and exploring the Reko-Dig Copper & Gold prospects” and observing that TCC’s project
would provide significant benefits to employees and the broader population in the areas
of education, health and sanitation.*4” Specifically, the Secretary of the MMDD pointed

out:

"Mining is one of the most difficult activities to be carried out requiring
huge amount of investment, rich expertise and skills, and very careful
planning and proper management to make it a success. The way of
[TCC’s] working and performance reflect that their attitude is serious
and they are committed to develop the project. They appear
professional businessmen with the required will, resources and rich
expertise in developing such kind of resources."**8

The memorandum further stated that, since “the Government of Balochistan has decided
to take over the project from TCCP,” the MMDD recommends “establish[{ing] a camp

After learning of the Cabinet’s decision from news sources, Antofagasta’s Chairman Mr.
Luksic traveled to Pakistan to discuss the news reports with Chief Minister Raisani. In a
13 January 2010 meeting, the Chief Minister assured Mr. Luksic and TCC that, contrary
to what had been reported in the press, the Provincial Government had not decided to take
over TCC’s project.*?

On 11 February 2010, the Secretary of the MMDD reported in a memorandum to Chief
Minister Raisani that:

"a committee under the Chairmanship of Dr. Samar Mubarak Mand
[sic] . . . had been constituted for negotiating the services of Legal
Expert for Reko-Diq Gold / Copper Project. In the aftermath of the
decision of the Provincial Cabinet to take over the Reko-Dig Project
from Tethyan Copper Company Pakistan (TCCP) . . . it was deemed
necessary to engage Legal Advisor / Consultant for advi[c]e before
issuing legal notice to TCC for cancellation of Exploration Agreement...

On 4 March 2010, TCC met with Chief Secretary Lehri to discuss its concerns about
Balochistan’s reported plans with regard to Reko Dig. According to contemporaneous
notes taken by TCC, Mr. Lehri assured TCC that “the PC-J project was not intended to
replace the TCC project” but “was designed to fill the gap created by TCC rejection of
smelter/refinery being a part of the TCC Reko Digq project.” He further reportedly stated
that “TCC (Antofagasta/Barrick) was the best company to implement the Reko Diq
project” and that it made “no sense for the Government trying to implement the mining
project itself.” >>?

(“ECNEC"), which is chaired by the Prime Minister, or, in his absence, the Federal
Minister of Finance, at an estimated cost of Rs 8698.70 million.*°

On 22 May 2010, Balochistan’s Directorate of Public Relations issued a press release
describing an “official handout” issued the day before, which reportedly stated that “the
foremost objective of the provincial government would be to take full control of Reko-Diq
Copper and Gold Project from its present operators . .. and thereafter . . . run the project
itself.”>>4

On 28 May 2010, a meeting of the Board of Governors was held under the chairmanship
of Chief Minister Raisani. Dr. Mubarakmand briefed the participants about the issues on
the agenda, as follows:

"[C]urrently the contracting company is undertaking exploration,

however they are not willing to refine the metals locally, instead they

plan to transport the concentrate offshore for its refining. With deposits

worth billions of dollars discovered till now, it is worth considering that

the ore may be kept within the country and refined locally. In this

regard, guidance of the Chief Minister is required."**>
The Board discussed various issues, such as: Whether there is enough expertise available
in Pakistan to design, implement and operate the refining plant; whether the GOB should
opt for a joint project with TCC on a profit-sharing basis in which plant design,
installation and operation will be GOB's equity and the remaining part (mining) can be
TCC's equity, most likely in the ratio of 80:20; whether only giving prospecting license
will earn a bad reputation for the country; whether local investors may be offered
investment opportunity in the project; whether the youth of the Province should be
trained; and whether arrangements could be made for electricity from Iran and the
availability of water. Then, the Board decided that:

"(i) The Government of Balochistan will fund the project from its own
resources.

(ii) Rupees one billion will be earmarked for the project by the
Balochistan Government in the next Provincial PSDP (2010-11).

(iii) The future role of Tithium Copper Company (TCC) will be
decided by the Government of Balochistan, after they apply for
mining lease.

(iv) Plants for refining and production of pure copper and gold will
be designed, developed and commissioned in Balochistan and
under no circumstances will the pure metals be allowed to leave
the country. Downstream industries for the manufacture of
copper wire, copper tubes, copper sheets and gold biscuits/bars
will be established subsequently.

(v) Arrangements for availability of electricity from Iran at the site
will be made by the Government of Balochistan."**°

. On31 May 2010, TCC wrote to Chief Secretary Lehri to express its concerns and request

confirmation that the statement in the press release, published on 22 May 2010, did not

in fact “represent the official position of the Government of Balochistan.”**"

On 2 June 2010, TCC met with Chief Secretary Lehri to discuss the press release.
According to TCC’s contemporaneous notes of the meeting, the Chief Secretary assured
TCC that there “has been some misunderstanding.” Mr. Lehri reportedly asserted that the
first meeting of the Board of Governors - Reko Dig Refinery ("BOG") had been held to
discuss the decision of the GOB to install a smelter/refinery which would be operated
through its own resources and would buy concentrates ore from Tethyan and Saindak. He
then exhorted TCC “to make efforts to satisfy the hostile cabinet and clarify their doubts
on the project and the agreement.”**

On the same day, TCC also met with the Secretary of the Federal Board of Investment,
who said that he had visited Balochistan a few weeks earlier and come back with the
positive impression that there was general support of the project and Mr. Lehri was quite
positive? In addition, TCC met with the Director General (Minerals) of the Federal
MPNR, Mr. Irshad Khokhar, who also informed the Tethyan team of the meeting of the
BOG for the Reko Diq Refinery. According to TCC's contemporaneous notes, Mr.
Khokhar assured TCC that Balochistan’s “refinery would get its concentrate / ore from
Tethyan and Saindak,” and that TCC’s application for a mining lease “would be
approved” under the Balochistan Mining Rules.*”

On 8 June 2010, the Federal MPNR denied TCC’s pending applications for security
clearances for its expatriate employees, which were required to obtain work visas.*°! At
the same time, Balochistan also began to deny TCC’s requests for No-Objection

Certificates (“NOCs”), which were required for expatriate workers to travel to the Reko

Dig site.*

On 2 July 2010, TCC met with Dr. Mubarakmand and Dr. Nadeem ul Haque, the Deputy
Chairman of the Planning Commission and a Minister of State in the Federal Government,
and Dr. Pervez Butt, the member (Energy) of the Planning Commission, to explain its
exploration work and plans to mine Reko Dig. According to TCC’s contemporaneous
notes of the meeting, the members of the Planning Commission did not disclose
information about the scope of Balochistan’s Reko Diq Copper & Gold Project at the
meeting, but they did express reservations of the GOB toward the TCC Project. Dr.
Mubarakmand commented as follows:

"a. The Royalty of 2% which they consider very low.

b. Why should Tethyan construct a pipeline to take the concentrate out
of the country?

c. Why should Tethyan spend so much money on the pipeline and road

to Gwadar from the mine when this money should be spent to refine the

copper and gold in the country?"
Mr. ul Haque said he understood that selling concentrate the seller gets the full price of
the valuable metals contained and that smelters get only a fee. Dr. Butt asked if any
representative of GOB was present when the drilling of core was in progress. At the end,
“Dr. Nadeem asked the CEO [of TCC] how the P{lanning] C[ommission] could help the
company in the progress of [TCC’s] project.”*® TCC's CEO Mr. Von Borries responded
by stating:

"- Help in providing tech assistance to GOB to understand such a
big and technical project.

- Help to start a conversation with GOB/GOP.

- The importance of the visit of CEO Barrick and his delegation to
the Chief Minister and Prime Minister."°*

. On 14 July 2010, executives from TCC and Barrick, including Barrick’s CEO Mr. Aaron

Regent, met with Chief Minister Raisani and Chief Secretary Lehri. According to
Claimant's witness Ms. Catherine Boggs, the Chief Minister told the delegation that he

wanted to develop Reko Diq exclusively with TCC, and not with any third parties; Mr.
Lehri, in turn, reiterated that the Government’s May 2010 press release, which described
Balochistan’s intention to take over the project from TCC, had been a
“misunderstanding” and did not reflect the official position of the Provincial
Government.**

On 14 July 2010, the TCC and Barrick executives met with then Prime Minister Gilani.
According to a press release issued on the same date by the Pakistan Government’s Press
Information Department:

"The Prime Minister said that Pakistan really want[s] foreign
investment and intends to encourage the best firms and companies
which can give the best results.

The Prime Minister informed the delegation which intends to invest in
exploration and development of Rekodiq Copper-Gold Mines Project
in Balochistan, that the Federal Government has discussed and decided
in principle to fully support the consortium and expects the project
would be launched at the earliest.

The Prime Minister directed the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of
Petroleum and Natural Resources to hold further discussions with the
consortium and to coordinate with the Government of Balochistan to
finalize the details."

. The same day, TCC and Barrick’s delegation also met with the Federal Minister of

Finance, Minister of Petroleum and Natural Resources, and Chairman of the Board of
Investment. Following the meetings, the Pakistani newspaper the Daily Times reported:

"Talking to media on the occasion Federal Minister for Finance said
that such a huge investment in Pakistan’s mining sector shows the
interest of the world-class investors in Pakistan. He said that the
government of Pakistan would provide maximum cooperation to the
investors to make this project a success.

Secretary Finance Salman Siddique expressed hope that the entry of the
world’s largest mining company in Pakistan’s mining sector would help
Pakistan attract more investment, transfer of technology and human
resource development within the country. He also extended full

assurance of cooperation to the investors for their success in Reko Dig
Project."°7
On 15 July 2010, Pakistan’s Planning Commission —which was chaired by the Prime
Minister — submitted Balochistan’s Reko Diq Copper & Gold project for approval to the
ECNEC - which was also chaired by the Prime Minister.**

On 4 November 2010, the Pakistani daily newspaper The Dawn reported that “[t]he chief
minister said the Rs1 billion PC-1 [for Reko Diq] was likely to be approved by the
Executive Committee of the National Economic Council at its next meeting and after that
the Balochistan government would start work on the project.” The Chief Minister further
reportedly stated that "all agreements which undermined the rights and interests of the
people of Balochistan would be scrapped.”*”

The same day, the Balochistan daily newspaper Balochistan Express reported that Chief
Minister Raisani stated:

"We, the government, are capable of exploring, exploiting and refining

the mineral wealth (gold, silver and copper) to international standards.

If Balochistan Government operates the Reko Dik project, it will benefit

the people and it will leave a good impact on the Pakistani economy."*”°
On 9 November 2010, TCC wrote to Chief Secretary Lehri protesting these statements,
pointing out that as the statements were made by the Chief Minister, they apparently
represented the official position of the Government of Balochistan and could not only
constitute a violation of Clause 24.6 of the CHEJVA but also harm the reputation of TCC
and the Government of Balochistan. He requested that the Chief Secretary advise the
company of his Government's official position.*”! It appears that TCC did not receive any
response.

On 3 December 2010, Dr. Mubarakmand discussed the gold and copper resources at Reko
Dig in a talk show on the Duniya television network. He stated that Pakistan possessed
the technical capability for the mining of copper and gold and it remained to be seen
whether the government of Balochistan would sanction the mining contract to Pakistan
or the foreign companies. In response to the interviewer's comment that the government
of Balochistan should give the contract to the local companies rather than the outsiders
so that the flow of the money remains in Pakistan rather than going to foreign companies,

Dr. Mubarakmand said that this was "the reason why [he] had developed a technical
project and presented it to the Chief Minister" and that "if the project [was] approved in
the ACNEC meeting on December 9, 2010, the Baluchistan government [had] the funds

for us to start work on this project." >”?

On 9 December 2010, the ECNEC considered the Summary dated 15 July 2010,
submitted by the Planning Commission on the Reko Diq Gold/Copper Project, approved
the project at the revised cost of Rs 8812.22 million (approximately US$ 102.7 million)
and “directed that if an agreement has not been signed with any firm for mining and
refining, etc, then Govt. of Balochistan may decide as to whether the project is to be

executed by them.”7

On 15 December 2010, Dr. Mubarakmand gave a telephone interview on Dawn television
about the project. The interviewer commented that "it is generally said that mining
contracts are awarded to those companies who do the exploration work"*"* and asked Dr.
Mubarakmand what the best international practices were in this regard. Dr. Mubarakmand
responded:

"Under the international best practices it is not necessary that one who
does exploration will also get the mining license. People initially enter
into an exploration contract with the Government which owns the
minerals. This contract contains terms and conditions whether or not
the exploration license will convert into a mining license and upon
which terms. So the exploration license which they [Tethyan Copper
Company] obtained from the Balochistan Government must in my
opinion contain such terms and conditions. The Balochistan
Government and this company must be aware of such terms and
conditions in accordance with which a mining license can or cannot be
awarded. This condition must be there."5”°

On 26 August 2010, Claimant Delivered the Feasibility Study

On 26 August 2010, Claimant delivered the Initial Mine Development Feasibility Study
(the "Feasibility Study") to the Government of Balochistan and triggered the period for
giving notice of intent to participate in the development of the mineral deposit as a Mining
Area under the CHEJVA.

1. The Feasibility Study

474. As stated at paragraph 377 above, TCC had presented the results of the scoping study at
the OC meeting held on 26 October 2007.

475. Also, as stated at paragraph 356 above, TCCA's work on the feasibility study for Tanjeel
(H-4) had been suspended in 2006.

476. Further, as stated at paragraph 392 above, TCCA had completed the Pre-Feasibility Study
for Initial Mine Development, focusing on H-14 and H-15, in July 2009.

477. Thereafter, TCCA had continued to work on the area within Exploration License EL-5,
as reported in the Quarterly Reports for the periods ended 30 September 2009,37° 31
December 2009,°”7 31 March 2010778 and 30 June 2010.5”

478. The Feasibility Study was completed in June 2010.°*° Then, the Expansion Pre-
Feasibility Study, expanding the mining project to other deposits, including Tanjeel (H-
4) and the H-8, H-13; H-35 and H-79 deposits, was completed in July 2010.38!

479. The Feasibility Study was presented at the OC meeting on 25 August 2010.°*? The
meeting was attended by Mr. Gerhard Von Borries, CEO (Chairman), TCCA; Mr. Gordon

was completed in September 2007 and in October 2007 the OCM approved the JV to
conduct a Feasibility Study on the Western Porphyries and Pre-Feasibility study on the
expansion phases."*** After updates on the site operations by Mr. McMahon, on the
community programs by Mr. Ahmed and on the exploration activities by Mr. Rehman,

Mr. Von Borries presented an extensive review of the Feasibility Study.**°

The PowerPoint presentation prepared for the meeting included a detailed discussion of
the mining operation contemplated by the Feasibility Study.**° Among other things, it
included a map of the area for which TCC proposed to apply for a mining lease: It
depicted the mineralized porphyry centers H-14 and H-15 as "Initial Mine;" Tanjeel (or
H-4) and H-13 as "Expansion;" and H-8, H-35 and H-79 as "Upside Potential."**" The
map also explained that the “Phased Approach to Development” would start with an
“Initial Mine Development” consisting of “110,00 tonnes per day milled from H14 and
H15,” and an “Expansion Project” entailing “220,000 tonnes per day, from H14, H14
[sic], H13 & Tanjeel.” It also showed an “Upside Potential” entailing “H8, H79, H35.”?°8

On 26 August 2010, TCCA formally submitted the Feasibility Study to the Government
of Balochistan.**° It comprised of 21 volumes and 235 appendices, and almost 18,000
pages in total. It assessed the economic, financial and technical feasibility of a base case
mining project centered on the Western Porphyries (H-14 and H-15) and also
contemplated its future expansion to Tanjeel (H-4) and other adjacent orebodies (H-8, H-
13, H-35 and H-79).3°

Balochistan Did Not Elect to Participate in the Mining Venture

The formal handover of the Feasibility Study on 26 August 2010 triggered the 90-day
period under Clause 11.3.1 of the CHEJVA, during which each party to the Joint Venture

was required to give notice of its decision regarding participation in mine development.*!

On 8 November 2010, TCC formally elected, in accordance with Clause 11.3.2 of the
CHEJVA, to participate in mine development and informed the MMDD of its decision
by copy of its letter to the Manager of the Joint Venture.**

485. An OC meeting was held on the same day. It was attended by Mr. Mushtaq Ahmed
Raisani, Secretary, MMDD; Mr. Mohammad Azam, Director General, MMDD; Mr.
Gerhard Von Borries, CEO (Chairman), TCCA; and Mr. Gordon Thorpe, CFO, TCCA.
The following persons also attended by invitation: Mr. Barry Flew, Finance Manager,
TCC; Mr. Sebastian Carmona, Mine Planning Engineer, TCC; Mr. Kalemullah, Deputy
Secretary, MMDD; and Mr. Mohammad Ali Kakar, Additional Secretary, MMDD.*?3

486. According to the minutes of the meeting, Mr. Von Borries "presented the key steps going
forward and whether the GOB was going to make their election to participate in the
project before the 24th November."*** Mr. Raisani said that the review of the Feasibility
Study required at least six months and mentioned that they intended to use external
advisors GTZ.*°> Mr. Von Borries explained that, assuming the GOB elected to
participate, both partners needed to form a Mining Venture in order to submit the Mining
Lease Application before the expiration of the Exploration License EL-5 on 19 February
2011. In response to the question whether the GOB would sign a Memorandum of
Understanding in order to file a Mining Lease Application, Mr. Raisani said that "the
GOB would agree with the MOU and make its election to participate after the

presentation to the cabinet."*°°

487. According to the record, the 24 November 2010 deadline passed without response from
the Provincial Government.*”” As a result, under CHEJVA Clause 11.3.3, Balochistan
was deemed to be a “Non-participating Party” with respect to the planned mining
venture. °°

488. By letter dated 30 November 2010, TCCA, as Manager of the Joint Venture, informed
the MMDD that, as no notification of intention to participate had been received from the
Government of Balochistan prior to the 24 November 2010 deadline, the Election Date,
as defined in the CHEJVA, was 8 November 2010, the date that TCC gave notice of its
intention to participate. TCCA suggested that the parties “should meet at the earliest
convenience to discuss and formulate the future course of action pursuant to the
CHEJVA.”>?

489. On 18 December 2010, four weeks after the election deadline had passed, Balochistan
requested an extension of the 90-day period for the election to participate in the mining
venture so that the as:

 

ssment of the Feasibility Study could be completed by the experts.
It also noted that, as will be discussed in detail beginning at paragraph 495 below, the

400

case was "subjudice to the Supreme Court of Pakistan as the result of petitions filed

at the beginning of November 2010.

490. On 29 December 2010, TCCA, as Manager, responded that the deadline for electing to
participate had expired on 24 November 2010. It reminded the GOB that the Exploration
License held by the Joint Venture expired on 19 February 2011 and requested
Balochistan’s “advice as to how to move forward in considering your request. Please
provide us with this suggestion so that we may respond promptly.’*! It appears that
TCCA received no response.*°”

491. On 3 March 2011, TCC formally notified Balochistan of its intention to purchase the
Provincial Government’s minority interest in the Joint Venture in accordance with Clause
11.5.1 of the CHEJVA and its wish to engage with the GOB in agreeing the fair value of
its Transfer Interest.4°° Under Clause 11.5.3 of the CHEJVA, the GOB was obligated “in
good faith [to] negotiate in order to agree upon the fair value to be paid” for its interest.4*

In this notice, TCC stated that “it is still the sincere wish of TCC and its shareholders to

have the GOB as a 25% partner in the Reko Dig project” and noted that “TCC would

welcome the opportunity to discuss how this can be achieved.”*°°

492. On 28 March 2011, and again on 9 May 2011, Balochistan’s MMDD requested that any
negotiations regarding Balochistan’s participation in the mining venture or the purchase
of Balochistan’s 25% stake be postponed as the matter was “subjudice in the Hon’ble
Supreme Court of Pakistan and the Provincial Government at this stage is not in a
position to negotiate / discuss the provisions of CHEJVA for becoming either a
participating or non-participating party, as well as consideration of Joint application for
mining lease till the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan is arrived.”*°®

493. On 29 April 2011, TCCA gave notice, pursuant to Clause 15.2 of the CHEJVA, of its
intent to submit the matter of the fair value of the Non-participating Party's Transfer
Interest to an independent expert and proposed the Deutsche Bank as an expert, requesting
the GOB's consent to such appointment.**

494. By letter dated 16 May 2011, TCCA referred to MMDD's reference to an order of the
Supreme Court dated 3 March 2011 and replied that it was not aware of any such order
passed by the Supreme Court.*” It requested the GOB to provide an answer to TCC's
proposal of the independent expert within the timeframe set forth in the CHEJVA.*!° It
appears that TCC received no response to this letter and no further response from
Balochistan.*!!

I. In November 2010, Petitions Were Filed with the Pakistan Supreme Court to Enjoin
the Governments of Pakistan and Balochistan from Issuing a Mining Lease and to
Direct that the Extraction and Refining Process Be Carried Out Within Pakistan

495. On 6 November 2010, a Pakistani attorney, Mr. M. Tariq Asad, filed a petition under
Article 184(3) of the Pakistani Constitution before the Pakistan Supreme Court against
the Federal Government, the Provincial Government and other respondents, including Dr.
Samar Mubarakmand.*!?

496. The petition requested the Court to, inter alia, (i) direct the Federal Government through
its MPNR, the Chief Secretary of Balochistan, the Head of the Department of Mines and
Mineral Development of Balochistan, the Steering Committee and the Board of Revenue
of Balochistan to refrain from issuing a mining license in an arbitrary and unlawful
manner and without the consultation of the Parliament of Balochistan; (ii) direct the
Federal Government, the Chief Secretary of Balochistan and the Head of the Department

499. On 4 January 2011, a third Article 184(3) petition regarding the Reko Diq project was

filed before the Supreme Court on behalf of the Sanjrani tribe of the Chagai Hills area.

The petition claimed, among other things, that the Federal and Provincial Governments

lacked authority to execute agreements or grant land rights in the Chagai district for

mining or exploration purposes without the tribe’s express permission.*!©

500. On 22 January 2011, the Government of Balochistan filed a new submission claiming

that TCC was not entitled to a mining lease and that the Provincial Government would

carry out the project on its own. Balochistan acknowledged that its position had changed

since its 22 November and 11 December 2010 submissions as a result of “certain

important developments [that] have taken place,” specifically that “very recently on
9.12.2010, the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) has
approved the Re[k]o Diq Gold / Copper Project to be effectively executed by the

Government of Balochistan itself.’*"’ An additional "important development" concerned

the Chief Minister of Balochistan having "taken note of certain information and directed

a special inquiry into relaxation of rules and related matters etc."*'*

501. Balochistan requested the Supreme Court to permit the Government of Balochistan to
execute the decision of the ECNEC dated 9 December 2010 while declaring that, in the

circumstances of the case, "no entity has any vested right for the mining concession" and

that "only the Government of Balochistan can take any decision in this regard in the best

national interest."*"

On 24 January 2011, 26 senators from the Parliament of Pakistan filed a fourth Article
184(3) petition regarding the Reko Diq project seeking, among other things, to enjoin the
Federal and Provincial Governments from entering into a mineral agreement with
Tcc.229

On 3 February 2011, the Supreme Court of Pakistan ordered that “no decision shall be
taken by the Government of Balochistan in respect of the grant of the mining lease on the
application submitted by any of the parties without prejudice to their legal rights till the

decision of the instant proceedings.” *?!

On 25 May 2011, the Supreme Court recalled its 3 February 2011 restraining order and
directed the Licensing Authority to “expeditiously decide TCC’s application for the grant
of mining lease transparently and fairly in accordance with the law and the rules.”*? At
the same time, the Court postponed its own proceedings until a decision regarding the
mining lease would be taken, noting that “it will not be proper for us to pre-empt the
decision of the Government of Balochistan by entering into the merits of the case at this
juncture.?3

On 15 February 2011, TCCP Applied for a Mining Lease and, on 15 November 2011,
Balochistan Rejected the Application

On 8 February 2011, TCCA, in its function as Manager of the Joint Venture, informed
the Secretary of the MMDD that the Mining Lease Application in relation to the Mining
Area had to be filed with the Licensing Authority ahead of the expiration of Exploration
License EL-5 on 19 February 2011 and that, in accordance with the requirements of rule
47(1) of the 2002 BM Rules, the application would be filed by TCCP which was a
company incorporated under the laws of Pakistan.4?* TCCA enclosed a letter for signature
by which MMDD would have requested TCCA, as Manager, to take all necessary steps
to file the Mining Lease Application by TCCP on behalf of the Joint Venture.*”° It appears
that TCCA received no response.

TCCP Filed the Mining Lease Application

On 15 February 2011, TCCP submitted to the Licensing Authority an Application for a
Mining Lease (the “Application") over an area of 99.473 square kilometers of Reko Diq
situated within the boundaries of Exploration License EL-5. The Application was
supported by the Feasibility Study and other documents required under rule 47 of the
2002 BM Rules.*?¢

On 21 July 2011, the Federal Minister, MPNR, Dr. Asim Hussain, as Chairman of the
Steering Committee on the Reko Diq project, held a meeting to review the status of the
project and to formulate a joint strategy of the GOP and the GOB for the future course of
action. The meeting was attended by representatives of the MPNR, the Secretary of the
BOI, Mr. Mushtaq Raisani, Secretary, MMDD, on behalf of the GOB, representatives of
TCC, including Mr. Livesey, CEO, and a Senior Trade Commissioner from the
Government of Canada. Secretary Raisani informed those present that the Mining Lease
Application could not be processed earlier because the Apex Court had issued a
restraining order on 3 February 2011, which had been recalled on 25 May 2011. He stated
that the "GOB will decide on the application of TCC for mining lease to the true spirit of
BMR, 2002 and the direction of the honorable Supreme Court."*?7

Upon inquiry from the Chair regarding value addition up to final refining*”* and the GOB
share in the profit, Mr. Livesey responded that the GOB would get a 25% share in the
profit over the life of the mine, provided that it invested as per its shareholding in
accordance with the joint venture agreement. Further, TCC would assist the GOB in
managing a loan from the financial institutions if the Government of Balochistan was unable
to arrange funds investment as per share. In addition, TCC would evaluate alternate proposals
to the current 25% equity and submit them to the GOB during the third quarter, 2011.4

As for the value addition, Mr. Livesey stated that TCC had ore processing capacity up to
the concentrate stage and processing beyond this stage was not financially viable to TCC;

Exploration Joint Venture with the licensing authority in relation to the Mining Area
(as defined in the Chagai Hills Exploration Joint Venture Agreement ("CHEJVA"))
for the Mining Operations (as defined in CHEJVA)of the Reko Dig project."

[Pursuant to Clause [] of the CHEJVA, the BDA was responsible for applying for mining leases.

however, TCC would provide financial assistance of US$ 1 million to carry out a
technical feasibility study on smelting and refining.*”°

Mr. Khokar, Director General (Minerals), MPNR, pointed out that the Jinchuan Group
China had offered the Ministry that they could set up a full facility for the processing of
concentrate up to the final refining of gold and copper based on the concentrate produced
by TCC at Reko Dig. Mr. Livesey responded that the company "will have no objection to
this proposal. TCC are willing to negotiate an off take agreement for the sale of

concentrate within Balochistan."*3!

At the end of the meeting, it was decided that the GOB would complete its review of the
Feasibility Study and decide the Mining Lease Application within a period of four
months, as per directions of the Supreme Court judgment dated 25 May 2011. In addition,
TCC would submit a detailed proposal regarding profit of the GOB over the life of the

mine and investment facilitation options.**”

On 12 September 2011, TCCA wrote to the Licensing Authority, offering to meet with
them if they had any questions or concerns about the Mining Lease Application.**?

Balochistan Rejected the Mining Lease Application

On 21 September 2011, the Licensing Authority issued a notice of its intent to reject the
Mining Lease Application (the “Notice of Intent to Reject’) as “not satisfactory,” stating
that it was not in the interest of the Government and people of Balochistan that the lease
be granted on documents which were "incomplete" and "sketchy."**4 The Notice of Intent
to Reject stated:

"1. That from the record, it appears that the Balochistan Development
Authority had signed a Chagai Hills Exploration Joint Venture
Agreement with BHP, thereafter M/S Tethyan Copper Company
Pakistan (Pvt) Ltd for exploration, evaluation of Gold, Copper and
Associated Minerals during the period Of license existing for
exploration and prospecting of the area. The record reflects that neither
any company was registered and incorporated under the Companies
Act 1984 with the registrar of Firm's nor in any other law;

430 Exhibit CE-118. In fact, the minutes state that TCC would provide financial assistance to "US$ 1.000 million";
it is undisputed between the Parties, however, that the amount offered was US$ | million, rather than US$ 1 billion.

2. That the company did not make proper feasibility or exploration of
the discovered deposits and achieve the targets required under the
rules.

3. That the second renewal application submitted by the applicant, had
given declaration that the applicant will submit the complete feasibility
of the entire lease/exploration area. The applicant has utterly failed to
submit the said feasibility report and meaning thereby that they have
failed to conduct and complete exploration in the exploration license /
granted area.

4. That on account of non-exploration and failure to explore the area
during the last 17 years, the Government of Balochistan and the local
inhabitants of the area has been deprived of the fruitful results.

5. That the present application has been filed on behalf of M/S Tethyan
Copper Company Pakistan (Pvt) Ltd and not on behalf of co sharer,
who was alleged to be co-associate in the working project under the
Rule -48 of the Balochistan Minerals Rule 2002. Since the applicant
alone was not allottee of exploration licence and thus legally applicant
is not competent to make application for grant of Mining lease.

6. That the Mines Committee has noted the fact that the application was
received on 18-02-2011 and the licence had expired on 19-02-2011
later on request was made to the Secretary, Mines & Mineral
Department, Government of Balochistan on 03-03-2011 for
participating in the mining lease. This fact indicates that the
application was filed alone by the company and co sharer was not made
party in it. In such circumstance, the application is incomplete and is
in violation of rule 48 of the Balochistan Minerals Rule, 2002.

7. The relevant portion on the feasibility study report submitted by the
expert committee was also examined by the Mines Committee and found
following observation:

(i) | That the Company has failed to comment or dilate upon rest of
discover deposits except H-14 and H-15;

(ii) |The proposed development, operation and scheme of the mines in
programme of the mining operation for the 11 other potential
resources is missing/omitted to be considered in feasibility
report;

(iii) That the information given by the company in all respect keeping
in to consideration the Balochistan Minerals Rule, 2002, the
Company has further failed to identify all the resources and
achievements of all the targets within stipulated time.

(iv) Misrepresentation for obtaining exploration licenses EL-6, EL-8,

being a world class Exploration/ Mining Company so called
partner has failed to submit the technical, financial, economical
viability report of the entire resources of EL-5 enjoying with

Government of Balochistan for the last 17 years.

(v) There is a default and violation committed under rule 29 (2) (c)
(iti) of Balochistan Minerals Rules, 2002 as well as failure to
provide the required information as contemplated under rule 47
of Balochistan Minerals Rules, 2002.

8. That the submission of the application relating to H-4, H-8, H-13, H-
35 and H-79 etc is in violation of rule-48 of Balochistan Minerals Rule,
2002.

9. That feasibility report is silent about the processing, smelting and
refining of the metals / minerals to be extracted from the mining area.

10. That in view of aforementioned reasons, the Committee found that
the application submitted by the applicant is not satisfactory. It is also
not in the interest of the Government and people of Balochistan that the
lease cannot be granted on a documents which is in complete and
sketchy.

Your reply to the aforementioned reasons / objections may be submitted
within a period of 30 days."**°
514. On 30 September 2011, TCCP requested the Licensing Authority to grant it an extension
of sixty days in addition to the thirty days to submit its representations and/ or proposals,
in consonance with the requirement of "reasonable period" for response as laid down in
rules 48(4) anf 48(5) of the 2002 BM Rules.**°

515. On 7 October 2011, the Licensing Authority informed TCCP that the Mines Committee
had turned down its request for extension and that its response was due by 20 October
2011.47

516. On 14 October 2011, TCCP informed the Licensing Authority that it considered its letter
to be unreasonable, given that an extension would cause it no prejudice; the matters
potentially in dispute were complex, of great value and highly important to the region;

and an extension of time might help the parties to better understand each other's positions.

TCCP suggested a meeting to discuss the issues and requested the Licensing Authority to

suggest suitable potential dates.+*

On 15 October 2011, TCCP filed a formal appeal against the denial of its request for an

extension of time before the Secretary, MMDD.*?

On 17 October 2011, the Licensing Authority informed TCCP that it might make its

representations within the stipulated time period, by 20 October 201

to the Notice of Intent to Reject, explaining, inter alia, that:

(i)

(iii)

(iv)

(v)

The Mining Lease Application contained documents showing that TCCP had been
validly registered and incorporated under the Pakistan Companies Ordinance 1984.

Clause 11.8.2 of the CHEJVA entitled TCC to submit the Mining Lease Application
on its own if Balochistan did not elect to participate in the mining venture.

Balochistan never expressed any concerns or reservations to TCC that the scope of
TCC's exploration or feasibility work was unsatisfactory or that the expected
Mining Lease was in jeopardy.

TCC had no obligation under contract or the 2002 BM Rules to smelt the copper-
gold concentrates that are produced.

Balochistan itself had advised the Pakistan Supreme Court in December 2010 —
some four months after receiving the Feasibility Study — that it had “been kept
abreast of all relevant development{s];” “[it is] constantly viewing that nothing is
done which will in any manner adversely affect the interest of province of
Balochistan;” and that the petitioners attacking the exploration and feasibility work
performed at Reko Dig “have failed to identify a single matter whereby the interest
of the province and the people [olf Balochistan have even remotely been adversely
affected.”4!

On the same date, Claimant also served a Notice of Dispute under the CHEJVA on the
Government of Balochistan, which invited the GOB to enter into discussions to reach an
amicable resolution of the dispute.*4”

By letter dated 15 November 2011, the Licensing Authority rejected Claimant’s
application for the grant of a Mining Lease, stating in a single sentence that its "reply was
found unsatisfactory under Rules 10, 29(2)(c)(iii)[,] 47, 48, 52 etc of Balochistan Mineral
Rules 2002."*

On 22 November 2011, the Pakistan news service PakTribune reported that the
Balochistan government had cancelled the license of the Reko Dig gold and copper mines
given to a foreign company, Tethyan Copper Company (TCC), and decided to run the
project itself. The report was based on comments Balochistan Mines Secretary Mr.
Mushtaq Raisani had made to a UK-based TV channel. He reportedly said that TCC had
submitted the feasibility report of a limited area and did not include the whole area in its
report and thus:

"[ulnder the law, the provincial government can cancel the contract of
a company that does not meet the criterion."*#4

Secretary Raisani reportedly added that the government had now decided to take forward

this project utilizing its own resources."*4°

One week later, on 30 November 2011, Secretary Raisani issued an official denial,

published in the Intekhab-Urdu, of this news item.“46

Balochistan Rejected TCCP's Administrative Appeal

On 28 November 2011, TCCP filed an administrative appeal under rule 70 of the 2002
BM Rules requesting the Secretary MMDD to set aside the order and to grant TCC's
Mining Lease Application.**”

On 22 December 2011, the MMDD gave notice of the hearing on TCCP's appeal,
scheduled for 31 December 2011.8

On 27 December 2011, counsel for TCCP requested the Secretary MMDD to direct the
Director General MMDD to provide a copy of its comments to TCCP and to change the
date of the hearing to give TCCP sufficient time to prepare a rejoinder/replication after
holding consultations with its management which was, at that time, out of Pakistan on
account of Christmas and winter vacations.*4? The late December hearing date was

adjourned.*°°

On 17 February 2012, the MMDD gave notice to TCCP that the hearing on its appeal
would be held on 27 February 2012.**!

On 22 February 2012, the Licensing Authority submitted its comments on TCCP's
appeal.*°?

On 28 February 2012, the MMDD gave notice to the parties that the appeal would be
heard on 12 March 2012.4

On 29 February 2012, the Supreme Court of Pakistan issued an order directing the
Secretary of the MMDD "vo dispose of the appeal by antedating the hearing to 3 March,
2012 and to decide the same on such date. The decision of the appeal at the earliest is
important for the reason that the International Chamber of Commerce has allowed 15

days time to the Government of Balochistan to nominate an Arbitrator."***

On the same day, the MMDD changed the hearing date to 2 and 3 March 2012.4

By letter dated 2 March 2012, TCCP objected to this sudden change of schedule, noting
that Mr. Livesey was out of the country; TCCP's senior counsel could not arrive in time
for the hearing; and the rescheduling would not allow TCCP sufficient time to prepare
and submit its written rejoinder.*°°

The hearing on TCCP's administrative appeal was held on 2 and 3 March 2012. On 3
March 2012, the MMDD issued its order that the decision of the Licensing Authority to
reject the Mining Lease Application of the TCCP was upheld as reasons for declining the

mining lease were duly examined by the concerned mines committee, and therefore the

appeal was dismissed.*°’

The media announced on the evening of 3 March 2012 that TCCP's appeal had been
rejected; TCCP received a copy of the decision of the MMDD on 5 March 2012 during

oral proceedings before the Supreme Court.*®

The MMDD order concluded that the rejection of the Mining Lease Application was an
appropriate exercise of the Licensing Authority’s obligation to enforce the 2002 BM
Rules because, among other things, the Scheme of Amalgamation approved by the
Islamabad High Court in 2008 had not effectively transferred TCCA’s majority interest
in Exploration License EL-5 to TCCP, and the Feasibility Study “covered only a small
area of 4.5 K.M” and assessed the “economic viability of only two deposits out of thirteen
(13) discovered.”*°

The denial of the administrative appeal was the final decision of the Government of
Balochistan on the Mining Lease Application.*© As a result, pursuant to rule 24(2)(b)(ii)
of the 2002 BM Rules, Exploration License EL-5 expired on the date of the rejection of
the appeal.*°!

On 10 March 2012, one week after Balochistan had denied the administrative appeal, the
Advocate General of Balochistan petitioned the Pakistan Supreme Court to declare the
2007 judgment of the Balochistan High Court, which upheld the validity of the CHEJVA
and found that TCC had a vested right to a mining lease,* as having “no legal effect” on
the Government of Balochistan.“

Events Following the Rejection of the Appeal

Following the denial of TCCP’s administrative appeal on 3 March 2012, Balochistan took
steps to implement its Reko Diq Copper & Gold Project.**

Balochistan Applied for a Mining Lease Over Reko Dig and Sought Relaxation of
the 2002 BM Rules

On 12 April 2012, the Express Tribune reported that, at the request of the Balochistan
government, the Export Processing Zone Authority had declared the Reko Diq mining
area an export processing zone which would provide favorable tax treatment, relaxed

import regulations and other benefits.**

On 19 April 2012, Balochistan requested the Licensing Authority to relax rule 48(1) of
the 2002 BM Rules for the grant of a mining lease over an area of “99.63 square
kilometer” to the Reko Dig Copper & Gold Project. In its letter to the Licensing Authority,
the Government reasoned that “under rule 48(1) of [the BM Rules], the only E/L
(Exploration License) holder can submit application for the grant of M/L. under 3(c) [of
the BM Rules].”*°

On 25 April 2012, Balochistan prepared, but did not file, an application for a mining lease
for an area identical to the Mining Area that TCCP applied for in its Mining Lease

Application of 15 February 2011. 467

Sometime in May or June 2012, Chief Minister Raisani “instructed [Dr. Mubarakmand]

to go ahead with the project.”*%

On 20 May 2012, Balochistan submitted a PC-1 project proposal to Pakistan’s Planning
Commission regarding a water supply project for its Reko Diq Copper & Gold Project.”
The project envisaged supplying the water from the “Baghicha Site” — the same
underground water source that TCC discovered and identified in its Feasibility Study as

the water source for TCC’s proposed mining operation.*””

On 30 May 2012, Balochistan also applied for surface rights at Reko Dig. The surface
rights application covers an area of 20.42 square kilometers overlapping TCC’s exclusive

Surface Rights Lease and proposed Mining Area.*7!

546. In July 2012, employees of MCC’s Saindak mine and Balochistan officials reportedly
succeeded in entering Reko Dig to take samples from the Western Porphyries and Tanjeel,

as well as from other locations within the Reko Diq Mining Area.*””

547. On 13 August 2012, a meeting chaired by Chief Secretary Babar Yaqoob Fateh
Muhammad recommended that, because the Reko Diq Copper & Gold Project was a
“component of Gov[ernmen]t of Balochistan,” it did not require a mining lease and should
“be permitted to start physical activities at site, initially at Tanjeel.” The meeting further
decided that the “[a]rea specified in [the Project’s] mining/exploration applications may
not be allotted to any other party.’*?

2. The Reko Diq Board of Governors Granted Permission to Start Balochistan's
Project

548. On 12 September 2012, the Reko Diq Board of Governors met in Islamabad and “resolved
to grant permission for the project to begin operations” at Tanjeel. Specifically, the Reko
Dig Board of Governors decided:

(i) | The Reko Diq Copper & Gold Project — now renamed the “Balochistan Copper
Gold Project” — would not require a mining lease since it was “an implementation
unit of the Government of Balochistan.” Instead, the MMDD would “initiate a
summary for approval of the [Balochistan] Chief Minister” based on the work and
site plan submitted by Balochistan’s project.

(ii) | The Government of Balochistan “will grant permission to [the Balochistan Copper
Gold Project] to start their operations at the designated sites, including
exploration, mining and refining.”

(iii) The 99.63-square kilometer mining area “may be reserved for the [Balochistan]
project for their future activities and that the same may not be allotted to any other
agency or organization.”

(iv) The PC-1 proposal and feasibility study for the water project from Baghicha Site
would be “worked out within the next two/three days and _ finalized

expeditiously.”474

void and non est; it fell outside the powers granted to State authorities under, inter alia,
the 1948 State Act and the 1970 BMC Rules which were promulgated pursuant to that
statute. In addition, the Supreme Court held that the CHEJVA was invalid because it was
opposed to public policy in terms of Section 23 of the Pakistani Contract Act, 1872.
Similarly, the “relaxations” of the 1970 BMC Rules were not made in accordance with
Pakistani law, which requires that such relaxations be granted only once “hardship” is
established — which it had not been in the present circumstances. The Court found that,
as a matter of Pakistani law, the CHEJVA did not confer any rights on BHP, Mincor,
Claimant, TCCP, Antofagasta or Barrick. Further, each element of the contractual regime
premised on the CHEJVA, including the 2000 Addendum, the 2000 Option Agreement,
the 2000 Alliance Agreement and the 2006 Novation Agreement, was also void.***

the conclusion of and became a party to the CHEJVA,**> the 2000 Addendum**° and the
2006 Novation Agreement;**” (ii) whether the 1994 Relaxations of the 1970 BMC Rules

party to the CHEJVA after the Amalgamation in 2008;** (iv) whether the Governments
encouraged, then thwarted, TCCA's attempts to negotiate a Mineral Agreement;*”° (v)
whether Pakistan and Balochistan officials actively sought out investment from MCC?!

project, even as they developed and executed a plan to oust TCC from Reko Diq.*””

its investments. Such alleged actions include, in particular, developing and executing a
scheme to take over TCCA's Reko Dig project, denying the Mining Lease Application in
pursuit of that scheme and using TCCA's exploration and feasibility work product in its
own project, which allegedly amounted to a breach of the fair and equal treatment
obligation under Article 3(2), an expropriation of TCCA's investment without
compensation in violation of Article 7(1) and an impairment of TCCA's investment in
violation of Article 3(3) of the Treaty.

Claimant's Request for Relief

In its Post-Hearing Brief, Claimant requests an award:*°

(i) dismissing all of Pakistan's objections to jurisdiction and admissibility;

(ii) declaring that through the measures taken against TCCA's investments, including
arbitrarily and unlawfully denying the Mining Lease Application, and developing
and executing a plan to take over the Reko Diq project, Pakistan has breached
Articles 3(2), 7(1) and 3(3) of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty;

(iii) dismissing all of Pakistan's counterclaims;

(iv) awarding TCCA full compensation for all damages and losses resulting from
Pakistan's breaches of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty, including future lost profits,
in an amount to be determined in a later phase of this proceeding;

(v) awarding TCCA interest on all sums awarded, in an amount to be determined in a
later phase of this proceeding;

(vi) awarding TCCA its costs and expenses of this proceeding, including attorneys’ fees,
in an amount to be determined in a later phase of this proceeding by such means as
the Tribunal may direct; and

Lease Application. In addition, Respondent claims that neither Pakistan nor Balochistan
had a plan to "oust TCCA" from Reko Digq in order to implement Balochistan's project.
Further, Respondent claims that TCCA did not have property rights under Pakistani law.
The Supreme Court held that the CHEJVA was illegal, void and non est, and furthermore,
that even if it were valid, neither the CHEJVA nor the 2002 BM Rules conferred a
guaranteed "right to mine" Reko Dig on Claimant. Finally, Respondent claims that the
information and data arising from the exploration of the area covered by Exploration
License EL-5 is Joint Venture Property which is not subject to an exclusivity requirement.
Respondent denies that it has taken any actions which constitute a breach of Article 3(2),
Article 7(1) and or Article 3(3) of the Treaty.

Tf and to the extent that the Tribunal finds that Claimant had a qualifying investment and
upholds the relevant premises of jurisdiction for purposes of the Treaty, Respondent
asserts the following counterclaims: (i) Claimant's alleged "investment" was not made "in
accordance with [Pakistan's] laws and investment policies" as set out in Article 1(1)(a) of
the Treaty; (ii) Claimant breached Clauses 11, 15 and 24.6 of the CHEJVA because it did
not even attempt to comply with the contractual pre-conditions set out in the CHEJVA
before filing its Mining Lease Application, and because it prepared a "secret" Expansion
Pre-Feasibility Study; and (iii) Claimant violated rule 29(2)(c)(iii) of the 2002 BM Rules
because it failed to complete "a full feasibility study of the discovered deposits" in the
area covered by Exploration License EL-5, despite the fact that it had undertaken to do
so in its application for a second renewal of EL-5.

Respondent's Request for Relief

In its Post Hearing Brief,*°* Respondent requests the Tribunal to:

(i) decline jurisdiction or declare Claimant's claims inadmissible;

(ii) alternatively, stay these proceedings pending resolution of the ICC arbitration;

(iii) alternatively, to the extent that the Tribunal proceeds to examine the merits of the
case, declare that Respondent has not breached the BIT and dismiss Claimant's
claims in their entirety;

(iv) alternatively, to the extent that the Tribunal finds that Respondent has breached the
BIT, dismiss Claimant's claims for failure to establish causation;

be determined at a later stage in these proceedings; and

arbitration.“

CLAIMANT'S CONTENTIONS AND RELIEF SOUGHT ON RESPONDENT'S
COUNTERCLAIMS

Summary of Claimant's Contentions

Claimant submits that the Treaty does not authorize Respondent to raise counterclaims in
ICSID proceedings. In any event, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear Respondent's
non-Treaty counterclaims based on alleged violations of the CHEJVA and the 2002 BM
Rules. Claimant notes that Balochistan has raised identical counterclaims in the ICC
Proceedings, which Claimant considers to be proper forum for non-Treaty claims. As to
Respondent's counterclaims based on the Treaty, Claimant argues that Article 1(1)(a)
contains only a definition and does not give rise to any obligations of the investor. In
Claimant's view, Respondent's counterclaims "represent the flipside of [its] defences to
[TCCA's] claims in this arbitration"; therefore, Claimant will defeat the counterclaims if
it succeeds in defeating those defenses.

Claimant's Relief Sought

In its Post-Hearing Brief, Claimant requests the Tribunal to dismiss all of Respondent's
counterclaims. 1°°

THE TRIBUNAL'S REASONING

By way of introduction, the Tribunal wishes to emphasize that it has carefully reviewed
all of the arguments and evidence presented by the Parties during the course of these
proceedings. Although the Tribunal may not address all such arguments and evidence in
full detail in its reasoning below, the Tribunal has nevertheless considered and taken them
into account in arriving at its decision.

The Tribunal's reasoning is structured as follows: As a first step, the Tribunal will assess
whether the general jurisdictional requirements are met and decide on Respondent's
further objections to jurisdiction and admissibility. In case the Tribunal's jurisdiction is
established and Claimant's claims are admissible, the Tribunal will, as a second step,
examine whether and to what extent the conduct that Claimant relies on is attributable to
Respondent. As a third step, the Tribunal will analyze whether Respondent in fact
breached Articles 3(2), 7(1) and 3(3) of the Treaty.

JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY

General Jurisdictional Requirements

It is undisputed between the Parties that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is based on Article
13 of the Treaty and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.*”

Article 13 of the Treaty provides in relevant part:

"1. In the event of a dispute between a Party and an investor of the other
Party relating to an investment, the parties to the dispute shall initially
seek to resolve the dispute by consultations and negotiations.

2. If the dispute in question cannot be resolved through consultations
and negotiations, either party to the dispute may:

(b) if both Parties are at that time party to the 1965 Convention on the
Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of
other States (‘the Convention’), refer the dispute to the International
Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (‘the Centre’) for
conciliation or arbitration pursuant to Articles 28 or 36 of the
Convention."48

Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability
ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1

568. Article 25 of the ICSID Convention provides in relevant part:

“(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute
arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or
any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated
to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State,
which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the
Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may
withdraw its consent unilaterally.

(2) ‘National of another Contracting State’ means:

(a) any natural person who had the nationality of a Contracting
State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which
the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or
arbitration as well as on the date on which the request was
registered pursuant to paragraph (3) of Article 28 or paragraph
(3) of Article 36, but does not include any person who on either
date also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the
dispute; and

(b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a
Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the
date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to
conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person which had
the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on
that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have
agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting
State for the purposes of this Convention.”

569. Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention sets out four requirements for the Tribunal to have
jurisdiction: (a) the existence of a legal dispute; (b) a dispute arising directly out of an
“investment;” (c) a dispute between a Contracting State and a national of another
Contracting State; and (d) the existence of the written consent of both Parties.

a. _ Existence of a Legal Dispute

570. Claimant submits,‘

between the Parties relating to Claimant's alleged investment in Pakistan. The existence

and Respondent does not contest, that there is a legal dispute

of a legal dispute within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention is thus
common ground.

b. Dispute Arising Directly Out of an Investment

571. The Tribunal notes that Article 25 of the ICSID Convention does not define the term
"investment"; however, it is undisputed between the Parties that the relevant definition

can be found in Article 1(1) of the Treaty,°° which reads in relevant part:

"1. For the purposes of this Agreement:

(a) ‘investment’ means every kind of asset, owned or controlled by
investors of one Party and admitted by the other Party subject to its law
and investment policies applicable from time to time and includes:

(i) tangible and intangible property, including rights such as
mortgages, liens and other pledges,

(ii) shares, stocks, bonds and debentures and any other form of
participation in a company,

(iii) a loan or other claim to money or a claim to performance having
economic value,

(iv) intellectual and industrial property rights, including rights with
respect to copyright, patents, trademarks, trade names, industrial
designs, trade secrets, knowhow and goodwill,

(v) business concessions and any other rights required to conduct
economic activity and having economic value conferred by law or
under a contract, including rights to engage in agriculture, forestry,
fisheries and animal husbandry, to search for, extract or exploit natural
resources and to manufacture, use and sell products, and

(vi) activities associated with investments, such as the organisation
and operation of business facilities, the acquisition, exercise and
disposition of property rights including intellectual property rights, the
raising of funds and the purchase and sale of foreign exchange."*°!

572. Article 1(3) of the Treaty provides:

"For the purposes of this Agreement, a natural person or company shall
be regarded as controlling a company or an investment if the person or
company has a substantial interest in the company or the investment."

In addition, Article 2(3) of the Treaty provides:

"A company duly organised under the law of a Party shall not be treated

as an investor of the other Party, but any investments in that company

by investors of that other Party shall be protected by this

Agreement."*°>
The Parties are in dispute as to whether TCCA had a qualifying investment under the
Treaty, in particular: (i) whether TCCA had an "asset" in Pakistan; (ii) whether TCCA
owned or controlled its investment; and (iii) whether the investment was "admitted by
[Pakistan] subject to its law and investment policies."*°? Respondent further contests that

the dispute "relates to" an investment within the meaning of Article 13 of the Treaty.°™

i. Summary of Claimant's Position

Claimant claims that TCCA has made substantial “investments” within the meaning of
Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty, which include, inter alia, capital investments for exploration
and feasibility activities in the Reko Diq project in an amount that exceeded US$ 240
million. Claimant further states that the Government of Balochistan expressly agreed in
Clause 15.4.7 of the CHEJVA that “the transactions to which this Agreement relates

constitute an investment within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.”°°°

(a) TCCA Had "Assets" and Related "Activities" in Pakistan

Claimant submits that the Treaty defines the term "investment" to mean "every kind of
asset," which is recognized as "possibly the broadest" phrase used in treaties and includes
“everything of economic value, virtually without limitation."*® Claimant further argues
that the term is not confined to the list of investments in Article 1(1)(a), which is "merely"
illustrative of the kinds of investments that qualify for protection, as made clear by the
Treaty's use of the word "including."*""

Claimant submits that TCCA's investment was "the mining business it developed in
Pakistan," which business was comprised of a "bundle of other assets, including but by
no means limited to TCCA's interest in the CHEJVA, TCCP, EL-5 and the right to convert
EL-5 into a mining lease so as to mine Reko Dig."** Claimant claims that an investment

in the development of a host State's natural resources is the "quintessential example" of
an activity protected by the Treaty.°° Claimant also notes that the Federal Board of
Investment repeatedly acknowledged in official communications that TCCA's efforts and

expenditures were investments.*!°

578. According to Claimant, TCCA's assets and activities in Pakistan included virtually all of
the items enumerated on the list in Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty, inter alia, “shares” in
TCCP; a “form of participation” in the Chagai Hills Joint Venture; a “claim to
performance [of the CHEJVA and other contracts] having economic value”; “intellectual
and industrial property rights” in the Feasibility Study and other work; “trade secrets,
know-how and goodwill” acquired in the course of the business; “business concessions”
including rights “to search for, extract or exploit natural resources” such as Exploration
License EL-5; and many varied “activities associated with investments,” such as leasing
office space, purchasing vehicles and equipment and hiring employees.>!!

579. Referring to Pakistan's argument that TCCA did not have any "assets" but only
“purported rights, which do not even exist,” Claimant argues that Pakistan conflates the
analysis of the Tribunal's jurisdiction with the decision on the merits, while in fact the
Tribunal should determine its jurisdiction to hear Claimant's claims "assuming pro tem
that they may be sustained on the facts.">'? Claimant argues that Pakistan’s merits
arguments about the alleged invalidity of the CHEJVA, Exploration License EL-5 and

other instruments are therefore irrelevant to the Tribunal’s analysis of its jurisdiction.>'*

580. In any event, Claimant submits that its investment included, but was not limited to, its
rights under the CHEJVA, its ownership of TCCP and its investment of approximately
US$ 264,578,000 in the Reko Diq Project, but also numerous tangible and intangible
assets which it had acquired in order to be able to run a business with over 500 employees
and independent contractors in Pakistan.>!* In addition, Claimant argues that TCCP had
aright to a mining lease even in the absence of the CHEJVA, i.e., under the 2002 BM
Rules.>!5

the 2000 Addendum and the 2006 Novation Agreement are valid" and binding on

Claimant further contends that, regardless of its validity under Pakistani law, the
CHEJVA is in any event part of Claimant's investment as Balochistan's conduct over the
years led TCCA to believe, and thereby created a legitimate expectation, that the
CHEJVA was valid and would be followed.*!’? In Claimant's view, the fact that
Balochistan and Pakistan subsequently reversed course and, following Balochistan's
request, the Supreme Court ultimately declared the CHEJVA and related agreements void
is relevant only insofar as this conduct in itself amounts to part of Pakistan's denial of fair
and equitable treatment of Claimant's investment.*!*

Finally, Claimant argues that the Supreme Court's decision cannot deprive the Tribunal
of its jurisdiction to determine the facts relevant to the Treaty claim, to interpret the Treaty
provisions and to apply the Treaty to the facts found by the Tribunal, as the Constitutional
questions before the Supreme Court were "fundamentally distinct" from the Treaty
questions before this Tribunal and the Treaty was specifically designed to insulate

investors from the jurisdiction of the courts of the host State.>!?

(b) TCCA Owned and Controlled Its Investment

Claimant argues that even if, as alleged by Respondent, all of TCCA’s assets underlying
its claims had been transferred to TCCP in the Amalgamation transaction in 2008, this
would not have any effect on either TCCA’s standing or this Tribunal’s jurisdiction.
Claimant asserts that it is immaterial whether the assets were held directly by TCCA or
indirectly through its wholly-owned subsidiary TCCP, given that Article 2(3) of the
Treaty extends the protection of investments to those held indirectly through ownership
of a locally incorporated company.°”°

Claimant further contests Pakistan’s assertion that TCCA “transferred all rights, assets
and obligations,” including the CHEJVA, to TCCP by means of the Amalgamation.
Claimant submits that the Amalgamation was merely a merger of TCCA's Pakistan
branch into TCCP and notes that the order by which the Islamabad High Court endorsed
the Amalgamation defines the petitioners as TCCP and the Pakistan branch of TCCA.*!
Claimant argues that, while the Amalgamation transferred all contracts "entered into by

or subsisting in favour of" the Pakistan branch, this did not include the CHEJVA which
was "entered into by and subsisted in favour of' TCCA.>

According to Claimant, at the time of the Amalgamation, TCCP and Balochistan intended
that Balochistan would acquire 25% of TCCP’s shares, with TCCA owning the remaining
75%. Claimant argues that it would not have made any sense for TCCA to transfer its
rights under the CHEJVA to a company in which its CHEJVA counterparty held 25% of

the shares.°73

(c) TCCA's Investment Was Duly "Admitted" by Pakistan

Claimant submits that Article 1 of the Treaty does not require that investments be made
“in accordance with” Pakistani law in general, but rather provides that to qualify for
protection under the terms of the Treaty, an investment must have been "admitted by

[Pakistan] subject to its law and investment policies applicable from time to time."***

Claimant submits that the term "Jaw" in admission clauses refers to the host State's
investment laws in particular, rather than its general laws. Claimant quotes the tribunal's
explanation in Saba Fakes v. Turkey:

"{I]t would run counter to the object and purpose of investment
protection treaties to deny substantive protection to those investments
that would violate domestic laws that are unrelated to the very nature
of investment regulation . . . [U]nless specifically stated in the
investment treaty under consideration, a host State should not be in a
position to rely on its domestic legislation beyond the sphere of
investment regime to escape its international undertakings vis-a-vis
investments made in its territory."°7>

Claimant notes that the Supreme Court decision did not consider Pakistan's investment
regime.*7°

Claimant further claims that "the critical time period for determining an investment's
legality" for the purposes of an admission clause is "the time the investment was made"
and argues that the Supreme Court judgment of May 2013 could not have had any
relevance to the legality of TCCA's investments in Pakistan at the time they were
"admitted," given that it was rendered 20 years after the CHEJVA was signed, 13 years

after TCCA first began exploration work at Reko Dig, 7 years after TCCA became a party
to the Joint Venture, and 3 years after the Feasibility Study was completed.*?” In
Claimant's view, Pakistan cannot retroactively deprive investors of their rights by
declaring their contracts void ab initio.°?*

Claimant further refers to the tribunal in Desert Line Projects v. Yemen, which observed
that admission clauses are "intended to ensure the legality of the investment by excluding
investments made in breach of fundamental principles of the host State's law, e.g., by

fraudul:

f misrepr i or the dissimul

of true ownership."*”? Claimant
argues that the Supreme Court judgment does not establish a breach of any "fundamental

principles," as its grounds for voiding the CHEJVA do not meet this standard.**?

Claimant contends that there is no requirement that investments be formally "admitted,"
but even if this were the case, Claimant refers to numerous occasions on which the
competent Pakistani officials "repeatedly granted TCCA permission to operate and invest
in Pakistan."**' In Claimant's view, despite its finding as regards the CHEJVA and related
agreements, the Supreme Court never invalidated such permission or the investment as a
whole.*? In particular, Claimant emphasizes that the Supreme Court did not find that the

approvals were invalidated by fraud, corruption or other "fundamental misconduct."**3

In Claimant's view, the Tribunal is in any event not bound to accept the Supreme Court's
conclusions on the legality of the CHEJVA and subsequent agreements because such an
approach would give the State unilateral power to redefine the scope and content of, and
even to withdraw, its consent, once a dispute arises out of an investment.>*4 Claimant
emphasizes that it is not asking that the Tribunal act as a court of appeal, but rather to
exercise its exclusive competence to rule on its own jurisdiction.**>

Claimant further argues that the Supreme Court’s judgment would not even have res
judicata effect in relation to any alleged breaches of the CHEJVA, as the judgment did
not resolve a bilateral contractual dispute between the parties to the CHEJVA, but rather
public interest petitions brought by third parties, under the Pakistan Constitution, seeking
relief for alleged misconduct by the Government. According to Claimant, the judgment

would therefore not have res judicata effect even in a commercial dispute under Pakistani

law. 536

Claimant also refers to the ICC Rulings in which the ICC Tribunal ruled that any authority
of the Supreme Court judgment would be limited to "findings of law," while "[t]he
application of the law to the facts is for the Tribunal."**" In Claimant's view, the judgment
does not contain any rules of law that, when applied to the facts presented in this
arbitration, establish the invalidity of the CHEJVA.>°8

In addition, Claimant submits that Pakistan cannot be allowed to rely on its own breaches
of Pakistani law, in particular taking into account that they are "technical missteps
purportedly discovered twenty years later.">*? Claimant refers to the tribunal in
Kardassopoulos v. Georgia, which held that admission clauses do "not allow a State to
preclude an investor from seeking protection under the BIT on the ground that its own

actions are illegal under its own laws.”>*°

Claimant further contests Respondent's submission that Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty
provides for discretion of the State to admit investments, arguing that this interpretation

is unsupported by the text of the Treaty provision and would exceed its scope.*#!

Finally, Claimant claims that Respondent cannot credibly argue that this dispute does not
"relate to" an investment. Claimant refers in particular to its shareholding in TCCP and
notes that TCCP was created specifically to carry out exploration and feasibility activities
and, eventually, also mining operations at Reko Diq and it was TCCP's Mining Lease

Application that was rejected by the Licensing Authority.*4?

ii. Summary of Respondent's Position

Respondent submits that Claimant is unable to show an “investment” that could meet the
requirements of Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty, namely (a) an asset owned or controlled by
an Australian investor; and (b) an asset admitted subject to Pakistani law and policies
applicable from time to time.**? According to Respondent, it thus follows that the dispute

submitted by Claimant does not "relate to" an "investment," which also results in a lack
of jurisdiction under Article 13 of the Treaty.*“4

Respondent contends that the question whether Claimant has an investment under the
ICSID Convention therefore does not even arise, so Claimant's reliance on Article 15.4.7
of the CHEJVA, quoted at paragraph 575 above, is misplaced.*45

(a) Claimant Does Not Have an "Asset" within the Meaning of Article

1()(a)

Respondent submits that the first limb of the definition of "investment" is that the
purported rights must constitute an "asset"; in accordance with Article 31(1) of the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties (the "Vienna Convention"), both terms must be given

their ordinary meaning read in their context.*#°

Respondent refers to the Oxford English Dictionary definition of an "asset" as:

“A financial contract or physical object with value that is owned by an
individual, company, or sovereign, which can be used to generate
additional value or provide liquidity.”>*7

In Respondent's view, the correctness of this ordinary meaning is confirmed by reading
the term “assef” in the context of Article 1(1)(a) as a whole, as each of the enumerated
examples of assets in sub-paragraphs (i) to (iv) relates to rights, entitlements or claims
having an economic value.*4* Respondent concludes that, by definition, rights that do not

exist cannot have “economic value.”>”

Respondent refers to the tribunal in Nagel v. Czech Republic, which held that the terms
"asset" and "investment" refer to rights having a "financial value" to their holder and
stated: "This creates a link with domestic law, since it is to a large extent the rules of
domestic law that determine whether or not there is a financial value." The tribunal
therefore held that the terms under the treaty "cannot be understood independently of the
rights that may exist under Czech law."*°° Respondent also refers to the tribunal's

statement in EnCana v. Ecuador that "the rights affected must exist under the law which
creates them, in this case, the law of Ecuador."*>!

In Respondent's view, the source of all the rights that Claimant purports to have —
including those arising under the 2002 BM Rules, exploration licenses, the Surface Rights
Lease and the comprehensive plan to mine Reko Dig — is the CHEJVA, and in particular
its Article 11.8.2.°°?

Respondent argues that, regardless of whether the CHEJVA was valid, the right to a
mining lease under Article 11.8.2 does not constitute an "investment" because this right
was subject to the fulfilment of the conditions precedent set out in Articles 11.4.2 and
11.6, which Claimant failed to satisfy before Exploration License EL-5 expired on 19
February 2011. In Respondent's view, the right therefore never came into existence and

thus cannot qualify as an investment under the Treaty.>>*

With regard to Claimant's purported rights under the 2002 BM Rules, Respondent asserts
that Claimant was not the holder of Exploration License EL-5 (and neither was TCCP)
and thus had no standing to apply for a mining lease pursuant to rule 48; rather, the 2002
BM Rules only recognize the unincorporated Joint Venture as exploration license holder,
as was made clear by the Licensing Authority in its Notice of Intent to Reject.*>+

As regards Claimant's plan to mine Reko Diq and the related expenditures, Respondent
asserts that TCCA did not perform any of the activities on its own and claims that they
were undertaken by the Joint Venture pursuant to the terms of the CHEJVA. Respondent
further argues that Claimant's expenditures cannot qualify as an "asset," as they were
made on the express understanding that the BDA could withdraw from the Joint Venture;
thus, they can only be categorized as pre-investment expenditure.’ Respondent also
refers to Article 1(1)(a)(v) of the Treaty pursuant to which the right to explore must be
distinguished from the right to extract or exploit. Respondent argues that there was no
interference with the right to explore and Claimant never had a right to extract or exploit,
but only a right to apply for a license subject to the "ordinary, regular and established

procedures."*°

609. Respondent claims that, in order to establish the economic value of its alleged contract-
based rights, Claimant must therefore prove that they exist under Pakistani law as the
governing law of both the 2006 Novation Agreement and the CHEJVA.>°’ Respondent
submits that, similarly, Exploration License EL-5 can only have been created by Pakistani
law, as confirmed by Clause 9 of the 2006 Novation Agreement pursuant to which the
transfer of EL-5 was governed by Pakistani law.*** Respondent argues that Claimant
disregards this fact when it claims that Pakistani law is irrelevant because "this is not a

contract case."*°

610. Respondent contests Claimant's submission that the Tribunal should determine its
jurisdiction "assuming pro tem that [Claimant's account of the facts] may be sustained,"
but argues that the Tribunal, now having the benefit of the Parties' full pleadings, must

make a dispositive ruling on the facts that are relevant to its jurisdiction.°”

6ll.

According to Respondent, the Tribunal "need look no further" than the judgment of the
Supreme Court of Pakistan, which was seized under Clause 11 of the 2006 Novation
Agreement and concluded that the 2006 Novation Agreement is void ab initio, as a
consequence of which Claimant never became a party to the CHEJVA. Respondent
further refers to the Supreme Court's finding that the CHEJVA Agreements were void
and claims that, as a result, the Joint Venture ceased to exist and could not be the holder
of any rights in Exploration License EL-5.*°!

612. According to Respondent, the Supreme Court's judgment constitutes a binding statement
of Pakistani law; Respondent refers to Article 198 of the Pakistani Constitution which
provides:

"Decisions of Supreme Court binding on other Courts

Any decision of the Supreme Court shall, to the extent that it decides a
question of law or is based upon or enunciates a principle of law, be
binding on all other courts in Pakistan."°°

613. In Respondent's view, the Tribunal must defer to the conclusion of the Supreme Court
that the CHEJVA Agreements and Exploration License EL-S are invalid, void ab initio
and illegal, as international arbitral tribunals lack competence to act as appellate bodies

when it comes to the interpretation or application of domestic law.* Given that
Claimant's purported contractual rights as well as its alleged right under Exploration
License EL-5 thus did not exist, none of them can constitute an "asset" within the meaning
of Article 1(1)(a).>™

614. In relation to the ICC Rulings, Respondent submits that the Tribunal is required to
determine for itself whether Claimant has satisfied all of the jurisdictional conditions
under the Treaty and argues that the ICC Rulings do not detract from Claimant's failure
to meet those requirements. In addition, Respondent submits that the ICC Rulings do not
bind this Tribunal or Respondent, as the latter was not party to the ICC Proceedings.*®

615. Respondent maintains that the relevant principles of Pakistani law are set out in the
judgment of the Supreme Court as the final arbiter of Pakistani law and claims that,
although the ICC Tribunal found that it must not second-guess the Supreme Court's
findings of Pakistani law, it failed to adhere to its own statement of principle.* To the
extent that, contrary to Respondent's position, this Tribunal considers the ICC Rulings
relevant, it should bear in mind that the ICC Tribunal failed to apply the Supreme Court's
first critical ruling under section 23 of the Contract Act 1872, namely that the conclusion
of contracts such as the CHEJVA and the 2006 Novation Agreement must be transparent
and competitive.*°’ Respondent contends that it is common ground that such transparency
and competition were not observed when the CHEJVA and the 2006 Novation Agreement
were concluded; as the ICC Tribunal simply failed to address this issue, its conclusion
that the contracts are valid is "unsound" and “incorrect” as a matter of Pakistani law.>®

(b) The Alleged Assets Are Not Owned or Controlled by Claimant

616. Respondent claims that the alleged assets are not "owned or controlled" by Claimant, but
rather belong to TCCP to whom Claimant transferred all of its rights, assets and
obligations pursuant to the Amalgamation. Respondent asserts that in the order by which
it approved the Scheme of Arrangement, the Islamabad High Court referred to TCCA and

TCCP as the participants in the Amalgamation. In addition, Respondent notes that it was
TCCP who filed the Mining Lease Application.>®

617. Respondent refers to Article 13(3)(c) of the Treaty which provides that:

"a company which is constituted or incorporated under the law in force

in the territory of one Party and in which before the dispute arises the

majority of the shares are owned by investors of the other Party shall,

in accordance with Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention, be treated for

the purposes of the Convention as a company of the other Party."*7°

618. Respondent claims that the Treaty "draws a bright line" between investors and locally

incorporated companies in which they hold the majority of the shares and argues that
Claimant thus has no standing to bring a claim that belongs to TCCP.*”!

(c) The Alleged Assets Were Not Admitted "Subject to [the] Laws and
Investment Policies" of Pakistan

619. Respondent submits that even if Claimant establishes the existence of an "asset," the
second limb of the definition of "investment" under Article 1(1)(a) requires that the asset
be "admitted by the other Party subject to its laws and investment policies applicable

from time to time."°”"

620. Respondent submits that such clauses are commonly referred to as "legality
requirements" and notes that, pursuant to Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, Article
1(1)(a) must be interpreted in good faith according to the ordinary meaning of the text in

light of the BIT's object and purpose.*”?
621.

According to Respondent, the legality requirement in Article 1(1)(a) of the BIT must be
read as imposing an "absolute requirement" that Claimant's assets must have been legal
at the time of their “admission” and must have been created or acquired in compliance
with the entirety of the "Jaws" and the "investment policies" of Pakistan.>”*

622. Respondent submits that the ordinary meaning of the term "Jaws" is confirmed by the
BIT's object and purpose, as recognized in its Preamble:

economic activity and development and aware of its role in expanding

economic relations and technical co-operation between them,
particularly with respect to investment by investors of one Party in the
territory of the other Party.

ACKNOWLEDGING that investments of investors of one Party in the
territory of the other Party would be made within the framework of the
laws of that other Party.”>”>

. Respondent claims that the object and purpose of the Treaty is not the promotion and

protection of investments per se, but only within the framework of the host State's laws
and investment policies, in order to aid the development of the domestic economy.>”°
Respondent argues that the contracting parties incorporated the legality requirement in
the definition of "investment" in order to "allay the important public policy concern that
investments be made within the confines of the host State's domestic legal framework."*"

Respondent argues that, in this case, the Supreme Court has already determined — binding
as a matter of Pakistani law — that Claimant's alleged assets were illegal, void and non est
from their inception and claims that the Tribunal must apply this judgment.*”* In
Respondent's view, the judgment amounted to a declaration of what had always been the
position under Pakistani law at all relevant times; therefore, the judgment did not
"retrospectively affect" the admission of the alleged investment.>”?

With regard to Claimant's allegation that only "investment laws" are referred to in Article
1(1)(a) of the Treaty, Respondent claims that the tribunal in Saba Fakes v. Turkey, which
Claimant relies on, was considering a different treaty which did not reflect the legality
requirement in its preamble. According to Respondent, the tribunal also held in that case
that there had been no investment at all, so the question of legality did not arise and the
section quoted by Claimant was only an obiter remark.**°

In relation to Claimant's position that only "fundamental principles" are relevant in the
context of the admission requirement, Respondent refers to Claimant's reliance on the
case of Desert Line v. Yemen and argues that the tribunal in that case had to consider a
provision with different wording. In any event, Respondent submits that this limitation
was explicitly rejected by the Quiboras v. Bolivia tribunal, stating: "The interpretation of

the Claimants [is] too narrow [and] goes beyond the terms of the BIT, in an attempt to

further the investor's protection without due regard for the State's interest."**'

627. Respondent notes that, even if there was a "fundamental principles" qualification, the
Supreme Court found that the CHEJVA Agreements were unlawful and void ab initio
because they were contrary to public policy; in Respondent's view, sections 20 and 23 of
the Contract Act 1872 embody "fundamental principles" of Pakistani law.>**

628. With regard to Claimant's argument that a State may not rely upon its own wrongdoing,
Respondent claims that there is no indication that the legality requirement applies only to
the investor's own illegal conduct. Respondent notes that in the case of Kardassopoulos
v. Georgia the clause that Claimant relies on in this regard expressly refers to the
investor's conduct, while Article 1(1)(a) of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty does not.>*?
Respondent argues that the tribunal in that case even stated that the ordinary meaning of
the clause included a reference to Georgian contract law, but held that the particular object
and purpose of the Greece-Georgia BIT, which the preamble set out to be broad protection

for investors and investments,°**

would be frustrated if the State were allowed to rely on
the illegality of its own actions under its own laws. Respondent emphasizes that that the
object and purpose of the Treaty in the present case is very different and expressly refers

to the legality requirement.**>

629. According to Respondent, Claimant's attempt to narrow the scope of the legality
requirement in Article 1(1)(a) is contrary to the ordinary meaning and the object and
purpose of the Treaty; thus, Claimant has not satisfied the legality requirement, with the
result that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction.>*°

630. Finally, Respondent argues that, due to fact that none of Claimant's alleged assets meet
the definition of "investment" in Article 1(1)(a), Claimant also failed to show that the
dispute "relates to" an "investment." In addition, Respondent contends that, even if,

contrary to the Respondent’s case, Claimant did have an “investment," it has failed to
prove the necessary link between such investment and the dispute it has submitted to this
Tribunal.°*’ Therefore, the Tribunal also lacks jurisdiction under Article 13 of the
Treaty.>88

iii. The Tribunal's Analysis

Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention requires that the legal dispute "aris[es] directly
out of an investment." The disagreement between the Parties as to whether Claimant had
an "investment" within the meaning of Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty is divided into three
sub-questions: (i) whether Claimant had an "asset"; (ii) whether such asset was "owned
or controlled" by TCCA; and (iii) whether the asset was "admitted by [Pakistan] subject
to its law and investment policies applicable from time to time." In addition, Respondent
contests that the dispute "relates to" an investment under Article 13 of the Treaty.

As to the first question whether Claimant had an "assert," the Tribunal is of the view that
Claimant's activities in Pakistan were primarily based on two pillars: (i) TCCA's own
direct 75% interest in the CHEJVA and the Joint Venture that was thereby established;
and (ii) its 100% interest in its Pakistani subsidiary TCCP, which was established for the
exclusive purpose of carrying out Claimant's activities in Pakistan. Through TCCP,
Claimant indirectly held all further rights in the Reko Diq Project that were not held by
the Joint Venture.

The Tribunal considers that both pillars constitute "assets" within the meaning of Article
1(1)(a) of the Treaty. While the enumeration in this provision is not exhaustive
("includes"), the Tribunal does not have to go beyond the list in the present case.
Claimant's interest in the CHEJVA, the Joint Venture and its property qualifies as an asset
because it includes, inter alia, "tangible and intangible property" (Article 1(1)(a)(i) of
the Treaty); "intellectual and industrial property rights" (Article 1(1)(a)(iv) of the
Treaty); "business concessions and other rights required to conduct economic activity
and having economic value conferred by law or under a contract, including rights ... to
search for, extract or exploit natural resources" (Article 1(1)(a)(v) of the Treaty); and
“activities associated with investments, such as the organisation and operation of
business facilities" (Article 1(1)(a)(vi) of the Treaty).

The second pillar, i.e., Claimant's interest in TCCP, likewise constitutes an asset, given
that it qualifies as "shares ... and any other form of participation in a company" (Article
1(1)(a)(ii) of the Treaty). In addition, Article 2(3) of the Treaty clarifies that, even though

companies established under the law of the host State are not themselves treated as
investors under the Treaty, investments in such companies made by an investor of the
Contracting Party are protected by the Treaty. As a result, the Tribunal considers that
Claimant had an "asset" within the meaning of the "investment" definition contained in
Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty.

As to the second issue whether the assets were "owned or controlled" by TCCA, the
Tribunal notes that Article 1(3) of the Treaty defines "controlling a company or_an
investment" for the purposes of the Treaty as having a "substantial interest in the company
or the investment."** In the present case, Claimant was and remained party to the
CHEJVA after the Amalgamation in 2008 because it is clear from the record that only
TCCA's "PAKISTAN BRANCH" was amalgamated with TCCP, which resulted in the
"consolidation of two wholly owned entities of TCCA," and Claimant thus continued to
hold ("owned") a direct interest in the CHEJVA and its related agreements and the Joint
Venture.>” As to Claimant's interest in TCCP, it is undisputed that Claimant always held,
and still holds, 100% of the shares and thus a "substantial interest" in TCCP.
Consequently, it "controls" TCCP and its investment in that company within the meaning
of Article 1(3) of the Treaty.

Finally, the Tribunal will address the third issue, i.e., whether the assets that Claimant
owned or controlled were "admitted by [Pakistan] subject to its law and investment
policies applicable from time to time." In accordance with Article 31(1) of the Vienna
Convention, this phrase has to be interpreted "in good faith in accordance with the
ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of

its object and purpose."*?!

In the Tribunal's view, the ordinary meaning of the phrase does not impose a strict legality
or a formal admission requirement upon the asset but rather implies that, at the time the
investment is made, it must be accepted by the relevant authorities or officials
representing the host State. If such an acceptance could later be revoked retroactively, the
host State could unilaterally deprive an initially "admitted" investment of its protection
under the Treaty.

This interpretation is also in conformity with the context as well as the object and purpose
of the Treaty. While the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that the Preamble to the Treaty
is relevant in this regard, it cannot follow Respondent's argument that the recital
"ACKNOWLEDGING that investments of investors of one Party in the territory of the

other Party would be made within the framework of the laws of that other Party" implies
the intent of the Contracting Parties to make the protection of investments subject to their
strict compliance with all applicable laws of the host State. In the view of the Tribunal, it
rather appears from the Preamble, which contains an aggregate of four recitals, that the
Contracting Parties recognized the importance of foreign investments for the economic
activity of the States and of providing a clear set of principles to protect such investments
in order to promote them. In this context, the Contracting States then acknowledge that
investments would be made "within the framework of the laws" of the host State.

The recital that Respondent relies on therefore underlines the requirements contained in
various provisions of the Treaty, such as Article 1(1)(a) and Article 3(1), but it was not
intended to raise the threshold for the recognition of investments that are protected under
the Treaty. A different interpretation would be contrary to the Contracting Parties’ intent
— on which they put repeated emphasis — to foster such foreign investments in order to
promote the economic development in their territory. Therefore, the Tribunal considers
that the admission requirement is met if the investment was accepted by the host State at
the time it was made.

In the present case, the Tribunal considers that the relevant point in time when TCCA
made its investment was the conclusion of the Novation Agreement in 2006 because
TCCA thereby became party to the CHEJVA and took over BHP's rights and obligations
vis-a-vis its Joint Venture partner. At that time, the record clearly establishes that TCCA's
activities in Pakistan were not only accepted, but highly welcomed and encouraged on
every level of the GOB and the GOP. Even if there was an internal issue within the GOB
regarding the proper authorization for signing the CHEJVA, there is no evidence that any
Government representative suggested at the time that the CHEJVA and its related
agreements were null and void. To the contrary, it appears that such issues were first
raised in the proceedings before the Balochistan High Court and then the Supreme Court,
in which the GOB defended the validity of the CHEJVA until early 2011.

In addition, the Tribunal notes that the reasons for which the Supreme Court ultimately
declared the CHEJVA invalid — seven years after TCCA had replaced BHP as a party —
did not concern any illegal conduct on the part of Claimant, but rather failures on the part
of the GOB and the BDA to comply with their internal laws. Even though the Treaty does
not link the admission requirement exclusively to the conduct of the investor, it is a
general principle that the State cannot rely on its own failure to escape its liabilities under
international law. Reasons that are not within the investor's sphere of responsibility
therefore cannot deprive an investment of its protection under the Treaty.

Consequently, the Tribunal considers that Claimant's investment was also "admitted by
[Pakistan] subject to its law and investment policies" applicable at the time the investment

was made. In conclusion, the Tribunal therefore finds that Claimant had an "investment"
within the meaning of Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty.

Finally, the dispute between the Parties also "relates to" Claimant's investment within the
meaning of Article 13 of the Treaty, given that Claimant's claims, which are based on the
denial of the Mining Lease Application and the alleged takeover of the Reko Dig Project
by the GOB, specifically relate to Claimant's interest in the CHEJVA and the Joint
Venture as well as to TCCP, which was created exclusively to carry out the exploration,
feasibility and eventual mining operations at Reko Diq.

c. Dispute between a Contracting State and a National of Another Contracting
State

It is common ground between the Parties that the dispute is between a Contracting State
to the ICSID Convention and a national of another Contracting State. Pakistan is a
Contracting State for the purposes of Article 25(1) because Pakistan ratified the ICSID
Convention on 15 September 1966 and the Convention entered into force for Pakistan on
15 October 1966. Australia ratified the ICSID Convention on 2 May 1991, and it came
into force for Australia on 1 June 1991.

The Agreement between Australia and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan on the Promotion
and Protection of Investment was signed on 7 February 1998 and entered into force on 14
October 1998. TCCA is a "national of another Contracting State" within the meaning of
Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, and is an "investor" pursuant to Article 1(1)(c)
and (d) of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty because it is a company constituted under the
laws of Australia.°°?

d. Existence of Written Consent of Both Parties

In Article 13(2)(b) of the Treaty, Pakistan has given its consent to submit disputes relating
to an investment to the jurisdiction of the Centre.*°* As stated above, the present dispute
relates to Claimant's alleged investment in Pakistan; thus, it is covered by Respondent's
consent given in Article 13(2)(b).

Claimant expressly consented to submit this dispute to the jurisdiction of the Centre in its
Request for Arbitration.***

Respondent's Further Objections to Jurisdiction and Admissibility

a. Are Claimant's Claims Contractual in Nature and Is Claimant Barred from
Re-Litigating Contractual Issues?

i. Summary of Respondent's Position

Respondent claims that "Claimant's vague articulation of its investment boils down to its
alleged contract-based rights" under the CHEJVA Agreements and refers in particular to
the purported "right to mine." In Respondent's view, the Treaty breaches that Claimant
alleges are based on a purported breach of contract, namely the rejection of the Mining
Lease Application by the Licensing Authority; thus, Claimant's Treaty case in fact rests
on a contractual foundation.*°>

Respondent further submits that Exploration License EL-5 was granted to the Joint
Venture "under the auspices of the CHEJVA agreements" and, in general, all of
Claimant's purported rights have their source in the CHEJVA, via the gateway of the 2006
Novation Agreement.*’® According to Respondent, Claimant's core claim is therefore a
"claim to performance" of the CHEJVA and related agreements.*””

Respondent claims that this is a "classic" joint venture contract dispute between two joint
venture partners, which is before the ICC Tribunal and is not subject to the jurisdiction
of this Tribunal. Respondent requests that the choice-of-forum clause in the CHEJVA be
given effect and that the scope of Pakistan's consent to jurisdiction under the Treaty be
respected.*’* Respondent argues that, in the absence of a specific treaty provision, a State
should not be presumed to have consented to submit purely contractual disputes to
international jurisdiction.*””

According to Respondent, a treaty claim must be "sel/f-standing"; Respondent refers to
Judge Georges Abi-Saab's Concurring Opinion in TSA Spectrum v. Argentina in which

he held that this was not a case where alleged treaty breaches "necessarily pass by or posit
a contract violation as a fundamental element of or premise of its cause of action."°°
Respondent argues that the entirety of Claimant's claims are premised on violations of the
CHEJVA; thus, those claims are "no more than a contractual claim . . . dressed up as a

Treaty case."!

Respondent submits that in a case where the basis of a claim is contractual, an exclusive
choice-of-law clause in that contract must be honored in order to respect the original
bargain between the parties and the principle of pacta sunt servanda.®? Respondent
asserts that in light of the dispute resolution mechanism provided in Article 15.4, the
Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over Claimant's claims arising out of the CHEJVA,
as Claimant has initiated the ICC arbitration prior to these ICSID proceedings.°?

In Respondent's view, it is clear that in the context of Claimant's Treaty claims, the
Tribunal is required to rule on the same contractual issues as the ICC Tribunal, including
(a) whether the alleged "assets" exist and are lawful under Pakistani law; (b) whether any
rights under the CHEJVA Agreements can be invoked against Respondent; and (c)
whether Claimant has a right to a mining lease pursuant to the terms of the CHEJVA.
Respondent argues that Claimant itself has elected to submit those issues to the ICC
Tribunal and must be held to its choice.

Respondent further submits that the well-established general principle of issue estoppel
(also known as “collateral estoppel’) precludes Claimant from re-litigating the
contractual issues, which have already been determined by the Supreme Court of
Pakistan.

. Respondent relies on the holding of the tribunal in RSM v Grenada:

“The disputing parties... agree that a finding concerning a right,
question or fact may not be relitigated (and, thus, is binding on a
subsequent tribunal), if, in a prior proceeding: (a) it was distinctly put
in issue; (b) the court or tribunal actually decided it; and (c) the

resolution of the question was necessary to resolving the claims before
that court or tribunal.

It is also not disputed that the doctrine of collateral estoppel is now well
established as a general principle of law applicable in international
courts and tribunals such as this one.”©°

657. Respondent argues that the test for estoppel under international law is clearly met in this

case, as Claimant voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, which

determined the very same contractual issues that are now before this Tribunal.”

ii, Summary of Claimant's Position

658. Claimant recognizes that this Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to decide on contractual

claims arising from the CHEJVA, emphasizing however that "this is not a contract case"

and that TCCA's claims relate to breaches of the Treaty and general international law.°°*

659. Claimant argues that treaty claims are distinct from contractual claims and submits that

in assessing Claimant's Treaty claims, the Tribunal will not determine whether under

Pakistani law "the contractual rights or entitlements asserted by Claimant have been

breached under the contract," but it may rather consider, inter alia, the conduct of the

organs and officials of both the GOP and the GOB in relation to the CHEJVA.%

660. Claimant refers to the tribunal in Vivendi v. Argentina IT, which held:

"A state may breach a treaty without breaching a contract; it may also
breach a treaty at the same time it breaches a contract. And, in the latter
case it is permissible for the Tribunal to consider such alleged
contractual breaches, not for the purpose of determining whether a
party has incurred liability under domestic law, but to the extent
necessary to analyse and determine whether there has been a breach of
the Treaty. In doing so, the Tribunal would in no way be exercising
jurisdiction over the contract, it would simply be taking into account
the parties behavior under and in relation to the terms of the contract
in determining whether there has been a breach of a distinct standard
of international law."°'°

661. Claimant submits that Respondent attempts to conflate the Treaty claims to be decided

by this Tribunal with the contract claims that are at issue before the ICC Tribunal.

Claimant recognizes that its Treaty claims derive in part from its rights under the
CHEJVA, but submits that this cannot prevent this Tribunal from hearing those claims.
Claimant again refers to the ad hoc Committee in Vivendi v. Argentina I which stated
that:

"it is one thing to exercise contractual jurisdiction . .. and another to
take into account the terms of a contract in determining whether there
has been a breach of a distinct standard of international law."°!'!

662. Claimant asserts that it is irrelevant that the dispute against Balochistan arising under the
CHEJVA will be decided before a different forum.®'? In Claimant's view, the fact that
some of the acts to be assessed by this Tribunal may also be considered a breach of the
CHEJVA by Balochistan does not deprive TCCA of its rights and remedies under the

Treaty.°!?

663. Claimant also emphasizes that apart from the fact that both arbitrations were filed
simultaneously and only registered on different dates, TCCA tried to register the
Balochistan arbitration with ICSID but was forced to resort to the ICC fallback
mechanism because Pakistan failed to authorize the Province of Balochistan to participate

in ICSID arbitration (despite a commitment to do so in the 2006 Novation Agreement).°!*

iii. The Tribunal's Analysis

664. There is common ground between the Parties that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction
to decide on claims that are based on breaches of contract, but only on claims that are
based on violations of the Treaty.°'> However, this does not mean that the Tribunal may
not take into account the terms of the CHEJVA in its analysis of whether Respondent in
fact breached any of its obligations under the Treaty.

665. In this regard, the Tribunal agrees with the ad hoc Committee in Vivendi v. Argentina that
"it is one thing to exercise contractual jurisdiction ... and another to take into account

the terms of a contract in determining whether there has been a breach of a distinct

standard of international law."°'®

. It has to be emphasized that the Tribunal does not wish to interfere with the exclusive

jurisdiction of the ICC Tribunal to decide on claims arising out of the CHEJVA and,
therefore, it will not express an opinion on whether any provisions of the CHEJVA have
been breached — which in any event would be something that Claimant has not asked this
Tribunal to do. In the present proceedings, Claimant has not raised any such claims based
on breaches of contract, but it has rather claimed that Respondent violated certain
standards of protection under the Treaty. Given that Claimant's investment includes its
interest in the Joint Venture that was established under the CHEJVA, the Tribunal
necessarily has to look at the CHEJVA and its related agreements in order to be in a
position to assess whether Respondent violated its obligations under the Treaty.

The question whether Respondent's conduct amounted to a violation of the Treaty has
not, and will not, be decided by either the Supreme Court or the ICC Tribunal; therefore,
there can be no "collateral estoppel" with regard to the Treaty claims that Claimant has
raised in the present proceedings.

b. Are Claimant's Claims Inadmissible?
i. Summary of Respondent's Position

(a) Claimant's Claims Are Inadmissible Ratione Materiae

Respondent submits that Claimant's claims are inadmissible due to the fact that its
purported right to mine Reko Dig pursuant to Article 11.8.2 of the CHEJVA never arose.
It is Respondent's position that Article 11.8.2 did not bestow on Claimant any rights to
mine, but only entitled it to convert a prospecting license into a mining lease "subject to
routine Government requirements." In addition, Respondent asserts that Articles 11.4.2
and 11.6 constitute conditions precedent to be fulfilled before any entitlement to
undertake mine development could arise and claims that these conditions were never
satisfied.°!”

Respondent argues that it is clearly set out in the CHEJVA that the transfer of the Non-
participating Party's interest in the Joint Venture Property, such as the Exploration
License EL-S5 and the Feasibility Study, necessarily had to occur before the Participating
Party could assert a right over such Property.°'® Respondent further claims that the
procedure set out in the CHEJVA, which was to be followed for the acquisition of the
interest, was "flagrant[ly] disregard[ed]" by Claimant when it denied the BDA an

opportunity to decide whether it wished to develop the (at least) fourteen mineral deposits

over which Claimant sought a lease in its Mining Lease Application.°!?

Respondent argues that a right that had not yet arisen at the date of the Mining Lease
Application cannot be interfered with; thus, Claimant's claim is inadmissible.

(b) Claimant's Claims Are Inadmissible Ratione Personae

Respondent further submits that Claimant's claims are inadmissible because Claimant
comes to this Tribunal with "unclean hands," referring to the doctrine of "clean hands"
as a general principle regarding claims tainted by corruption.”

Respondent contends that Claimant's role in procuring the illegality of its investment is
evident from the record.®! According to Respondent, the Supreme Court judgment
reveals "very serious irregularities committed by TCC's predecessor" and further
illustrates the role of Claimant, given that it was incorporated by Mincor, the company
which "orchestrated" the 2000 Addendum and thus must have been aware that BHP's and
BDA's counsel had considered the CHEJVA void for uncertainty.°”

Respondent further asserts that Claimant was aware of the CHEJVA's illegality and knew
that it would only be a matter of time before it became public, given that Mincor and BHP
agreed in the Option Agreement that the existence of a binding Addendum to the
CHEJVA would be one of the conditions precedent for the Mincor Option to become
binding. In Respondent's view, Claimant was therefore not an unsuspecting or innocent
party, but rather used the 2000 Addendum to "bolster" its case.°

In addition, Respondent alleges that Claimant "sponsored numerous all-expenses-paid
trips for various BDA and Government of Balochistan officials."°** Respondent also
refers to the Supreme Court's finding that officials involved in the conclusion of the
CHEJVA violated their public duties under Pakistani law by offering advantages and
benefits to Claimant's predecessor. Respondent refers to international law and policy on
anti-corruption pursuant to which the prohibition of corruption forms part of public policy
and submits that investments in violation of public policy are not accorded treaty

protection.°>

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1

ii, Summary of Claimant's Position

(a) Respondent's Ratione Materiae Objection

675. In the context of jurisdiction, Claimant submits that Respondent conflates the Tribunal's

jurisdiction, which should be determined "assuming pro tem that [the claims] may be

sustained on the facts," with the decision on the merits.

676. On the merits, Claimant contends that the CHEJVA did not require the sole Participating

Party to acquire the interest of the Non-participating Party before it could apply for a

Mining Lease. Claimant notes that pursuant to rule 47(1), the unincorporated Joint

Venture would not even have qualified to file the application; therefore, only TCCP could

do so.” In addition, Claimant submits that TCCP "repeatedly encouraged" Balochistan

to join the mining venture in order to file a joint application and, when Balochistan failed

to do so, it sought to buy out Balochistan's share pursuant to Clause 11.5 of the CHEJVA,

but Balochistan refused to negotiate with TCCP.°*

(b) Respondent's Ratione Personae Objection

677. Claimant claims that Pakistan's contention that the Tribunal should dismiss TCCA’s

claims because “it comes to this Tribunal with ‘unclean hands',” due to an alleged “role

in procuring [the] illegality” of its investments, or because its claims are “tainted by

corruption” is ascandalous and false accusation" for which Pakistan does not offer any

proof. Claimant asserts that Respondent's allegations are rather based on alleged

"technical defects" in relation to the conclusion of the CHEJVA, or on "pure speculation."

629

678. Claimant emphasizes that, as the ICC Tribunal has observed in its decision on

Respondent's document production requests,°°

the Supreme Court does not make any

findings of corruption in its judgment and did not invalidate the CHEJVA on that basis.

Claimant submits that the Supreme Court only repeated, verbatim, Balochistan’s

submission that there were “shocking disclosures of extensive irregularities and

corruption” in the record that the Provincial Government provided, but did not give any

examples of such disclosures and did not draw any conclusions from this observation with

regard to the validity or effectiveness of the CHEJVA and related agreements.*!

Claimant further submits that, contrary to Respondent's allegation, the Supreme Court
does not state in its judgment that any “officials involved in [the] conclusion” of the
CHEIJVA “violated their public duties under Pakistani law by offering advantages and
benefits to the Claimant’s predecessor related to the CHEJVA.” Claimant states that the
paragraphs cited by Pakistan rather relate to (i) the validity of the 1994 Relaxations that
Balochistan granted in 1994, and (ii) the fact that the Chairman of the BDA (at the time
the CHEJVA was concluded) was convicted several years later of a corruption-related
offence, which was, however, not related to the CHEJVA or the Joint Venture.°?

Claimant concludes that Respondent did not present any evidence either in the Supreme
Court proceeding or in this or the ICC arbitration that the CHEJVA was procured by
corruption and that there is thus no factual support for Respondent's allegation.°*

iii. The Tribunal's Analysis

As to Respondent's ratione materiae objection, the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that
the arguments raised by Respondent in this regard relate to the merits of the claim. Even
if the Tribunal were to find that the right that is claimed to have been violated does not
exist, this would not, in itself, lead to the inadmissibility of the claim. While there may
be an exception for a right that evidently, i.e., without the need for any analysis of the
merits, does not exist and therefore cannot form the basis for the claim, the Tribunal
considers that no such exception is applicable in the present case.

Further, contrary to Respondent's allegation, Claimant does not base its claims
exclusively on Clause 11.8.2 of the CHEJVA but also on rule 48 of the 2002 BM Rules
and the assurances that it claims to have received from Government officials. In addition,
the Tribunal does not agree with Respondent that Claimant "flagrant[ly] disregard[ed]"
the procedure set out in Clause 11 of the CHEJVA, given that Claimant attempted to
acquire the 25% interest of its Joint Venture partner. The question whether such
acquisition had to be completed before TCCP would be eligible to apply for a mining
lease on its own, despite the fact that the Joint Venture itself was not eligible to do so
under the 2002 BM Rules and the Expiration License EL-5 was about to expire in
February 2011, does not yield the obvious result that Respondent alleges and therefore
remains a question for the merits.

Respondent's ratione materiae objection is therefore dismissed.

With regard to Respondent's ratione personae objection, the Tribunal notes that there is
no evidence in the record that would support Respondent's allegations of corruption in

connection with Claimant's investment at Reko Diq. This applies both to the conduct of
TCCA or TCCP itself and to any conduct of BHP of which Claimant should have been

aware.

In particular, the Supreme Court judgment on which Respondent relies does not include
any finding on corruption; it further does not indicate that there is any evidence for the
existence of corruption in connection with Claimant's investment. While the Supreme
Court notes that the dual office held by Mr. Jaffar, Chairman of the BDA and Additional
Chief Secretary at the time the CHEJVA was signed, presented a "clear conflict of
interest," it does not make a finding that Mr. Jaffar's conduct in connection with the
CHEJVA constituted an act of corruption and it does not mention any corresponding
conduct of the investor (then BHP). The Supreme Court further adopts the GOB's
formulation that, in the course of reviewing the record to the CHEJVA, "[i]t made
shocking disclosures of extensive irregularities and corruption." However, the
Supreme Court does not give any examples of such disclosures, nor does it specify what
kind of disclosures were made. Therefore, the Tribunal does not have any evidence before
it that would establish or even indicate any acts of corruption on the part of TCCA/TCCP.
or its predecessor BHP.

Finally, the Tribunal considers that Mincor/TCCA's insistence on the conclusion of the
2000 Addendum as a condition to taking over BHP's role as a party to the CHEJ VA does
not constitute evidence of Claimant's awareness of corruption, or in fact any illegal
conduct, when the CHEJVA was concluded. This condition is rather a reaction to the
uncertainties that had come up in 1999 as to whether the GOB had validly become a party
to the CHEJVA pursuant to the applicable internal laws in 1993.

As a result, Respondent's ratione personae objection is likewise dismissed. As noted in
the Tribunal's Draft Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability dated 3 February 2016, the
findings above on Respondent's ratione personae objection are based upon the evidence
as it stood before Respondent's Application and do not account for any of the
developments set out in paragraphs 177 through 212 above. Before filing its Application,
Respondent submitted, inter alia, that Claimant's claims were inadmissible because it had
participated in administrative irregularities and acts of corruption in consequence of
which it came to the Tribunal with 'unclean hands’. Claimant denied the allegation. At the
time of the original hearing, there was nothing which could be described as evidence of
any act of corruption. However, as the Tribunal has stated, it subsequently gave leave to
Respondent to introduce new evidence of alleged acts of corruption in support of an

application to dismiss the claims. The Tribunal has dismissed this application and deals
with the allegations of corruption in its Decision on Respondent's Application to Dismiss
the Claims (with reasons), which is issued together with the present Decision on
Jurisdiction and Liability (see paragraph 215 above).

3. The Tribunal's Conclusion on Jurisdiction and Admissibility

688. In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction to hear Claimant's claims and that
the claims are admissible.

B. ATTRIBUTION

1. Summary of Claimant’s Position

689. Claimant submits that Respondent is liable for the alleged breaches of the Treaty not only
on account of its own conduct, but also on account of the conduct of Balochistan and its
organs, including the BDA, whose acts, Claimant claims, are fully attributable to

Respondent.°*°

a. The Conduct of the GOB Is Attributable to Respondent

690. Claimant refers to Article 4 of the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally
Wrongful Acts of the International Law Commission (the “ILC Articles”) which
provides that:

“Tt]he conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that
State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative,
executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in
the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of
the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State.”°"

691. Claimant submits that it is recognized that, in Federal States like Pakistan, this rule applies

to all organs “at provincial or even local level,” irrespective of whether the organ is under
the control of the central government pursuant to the State’s domestic laws.°* Claimant
refers to the ILC Commentary to Article 4, which states that “the principle in article 4
applies equally to organs of the central government and to those of regional or local
units” and further that “it does not matter for this purpose whether the territorial unit in

question is a component unit of a Federal State or a specific autonomous area.” °°

Claimant also refers to the tribunal in Vivendi v. Argentina I, which observed that the
“internal constitutional structure of a country” cannot be used to deny responsibility, nor
can a federal state “rely on the federal or decentralized character of its constitution to

limit the scope of its international responsibilities.”°°

In Claimant's view, Pakistan is therefore fully liable for the conduct of the Licensing
Authority, the Secretary of the MMDD and any other organ or official of the GOB.“

In relation to Respondent's argument that the conduct on which TCCA bases its claims
exceeded the authority of the State organ, Claimant refers to Article 7 of the ILC Articles
which provides that:

“Tt]he conduct of an organ of a State or of a person or entity empowered
to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered
an act of the State under international law if the organ, person or entity
acts in that capacity, even if it exceeds its authority or contravenes
instructions. ”°?

 

Claimant further submits that the State also bears responsibility for the conduct of its
judiciary and claims that ICSID tribunals have recognized that an investor's treaty-

protected rights can also be impaired or deprived by a judicial act.

As to Respondent's argument that the conduct of the Government of Balochistan is not
attributable to Pakistan because Annex B of the Treaty provides for the application of
domestic law, Claimant notes that Annex B applies only to an "Arbitral Tribunal referred
to in paragraph 2(c) of Article 13" of the Treaty, i.e., an ad hoc tribunal constituted in the
event that Australia and Pakistan are not both ICSID Member States at the time an
investor-state dispute is submitted to arbitration. Claimant argues that this dispute has
been filed in accordance with paragraph 2(b) of Article 13 of the Treaty as both Australia
and Pakistan were ICSID Member States at the time the Request for Arbitration was filed;
thus, Annex B of the Treaty is inapplicable in this arbitration.+

697. Claimant argues that, in the absence of a provision in the Treaty dealing with the question
whether the acts of federal provinces can be attributed to the State, the rules of

international law as reflected in Article 4 of the ILC Articles have to be applied.

698. Regarding Respondent's further argument that Pakistan was not a party to the CHEJVA,
Claimant emphasizes that TCCA's claims are not based on "a contractual breach of the
CHEJVA," but rather on violations of the Treaty by the conduct of high-ranking organs
and officials of both the GOP and the GOB over a period of more than 20 years. Claimant
refers to, inter alia, (i) their repeated representations and assurances that TCCA is entitled
to a mining lease subject only to routine requirements; (ii) their ousting of TCCA from
the project in order to replace it with the “Balochistan Copper Gold Project”; and (iii) the

Supreme Court proceedings and judgment.

699. Claimant asserts that the 1929 Harvard Draft Convention on State Responsibility (the
"Harvard Articles") relied on by Respondent does not reflect international law because
those Articles "contravene the international consensus that the conduct of even minor
organs can be regarded as an act of State."**" Claimant further argues that in any event,
even under the Harvard Articles, Pakistan would be liable for the Supreme Court's
judgment as it constitutes "a violation by the State of a treaty" pursuant to Article 12(4)(c)
of the Harvard Articles.

700. With respect to Respondent's argument that Balochistan acted in its commercial capacity,
Claimant submits that, under international law, a State is responsible for the conduct of
its organs, irrespective of whether they act in a governmental or a commercial function.
Claimant again relies on the ILC Commentary to Article 4, which states that “it is
irrelevant for the purposes of attribution that the conduct of a State organ may be
classified as ‘commercial’ or as acta iure gestionis," and further that “the entry into or

breach of a contract by a State organ is... an act of a State for the purposes of article
47649

701.

In addition, Claimant argues that the record clearly establishes that Balochistan acted in
its official capacity when it engaged in the conduct described above.°?

b. The Conduct of the BDA Is Attributable to Respondent

. In relation to the attribution of the conduct of the BDA, Claimant first submits that the

record shows that (i) the GOB was the original party to the CHEJVA and consistently
represented itself as such — to TCCA, to the Pakistani courts and in internal
communications; and (ii) the BDA acted under the instructions of the GOB until it was
replaced by the MMDD in December 2009.°°!

Claimant further argues that in any event, the BDA is a State organ for purposes of State
responsibility and cites the ILC Commentary to Article 4 pursuant to which the term
“state organ” under international law encompasses “all the individual or collective
entities which make up the organization of the State and act on its behalf.”°? In relation
to Respondent's reliance on Article 4(2), Claimant again refers to the ILC Commentary
stating that "it is not sufficient to refer to internal law for the status of State organs" and

that “internal law will not itself perform the task of classification." °°

Claimant also claims that, as the BDA Act clearly shows, the BDA exercises public
authority and acts on behalf of the GOB, given that (i) the BDA's function is the
“promotion of the economic and industrial development of Baluchistan"; (ii) almost all of
its functions depend on previous approval or directions by the Government; (iii) all of its
employees are deemed to be public servants; (iv) its Board members are appointed by the
Government and may be removed for failure to comply with any direction received from
the Government; and (v) its annual budget requires Government approval.°*

Finally, Claimant argues that, even if the BDA did not qualify as an organ under ILC
Article 4, its conduct would still be attributable to Respondent under ILC Articles 5 and
8, given that Pakistani law “empowered” the BDA “to exercise elements of the
governmental authority” and the BDA was acting “on the instructions of’ and “under the
direction or control of’ the GOB.®> Claimant asserts that: (i) the Chief Minister
authorized the BDA to sign the CHEJVA on behalf of Balochistan;°° (ii) during the
negotiations of the CHEJVA and its related agreements, the BDA regularly sought and
received guidance from the Chief Minister, the Chief Secretary, the Secretary Industries,
Commerce and Mining, the Law Department and the Finance Department; and (iii) the

GOB repeatedly represented that the BDA was acting on its behalf and, in December
2009, replaced the BDA with the MMDD as the responsible entity for Joint Venture
operations, thus acknowledging that the Government was TCCA's true joint venture
partner.°7

Summary of Respondent’s Position

Respondent asserts that there are two types of actions that form the basis of Claimant's
claims: (a) a contractual breach of the CHEJVA, and (b) a breach of the 2002 BM Rules
by the Licensing Authority. Respondent claims that it is not liable for either of them,
noting that Claimant does not specify which Federal organ committed those actions.°*

a. The ILC Articles Do Not Apply to Claimant's Alleged Contract-Based Claims

Respondent contends that it is Claimant's case that the conduct of the GOB, or
alternatively the BDA, in entering into the CHEJVA is attributable to Pakistan, which in
turn creates contractual rights against Pakistan. Respondent argues that Claimant thereby
seeks to inappropriately extend the scope of the ILC Articles to purely contractual
issues. Respondent refers to the tribunal in Jmpregilo v. Pakistan, which stated:

"Much of Impregilo's argument on this issue rested upon international
law principles of state responsibility and attribution. However, a clear
distinction exists between the responsibility of a State for the conduct
of an entity that violates international law (e.g. a breach of the BIT)
and the responsibility of a State for the conduct of an entity that
breaches a municipal law contract (i.e. Impregilo's Contract
Claims)."°

. Respondent notes that the tribunal in that case also referred to the following statement of

the ad hoc Committee in the case of Vivendi v. Argentina I Annulment Decision:

"[I]n the case of a claim based on a treaty, international law rules of
attribution apply, with the result that the state of Argentina is
internationally responsible for the acts of its provincial authorities. By
contrast, the state of Argentina is not liable for the performance of
contracts entered into by Tucumdn, which possesses separate legal
personality under its own law and is responsible for the performance of
its own contracts."°°!

Respondent argues that, for the same reasons, the ILC Articles do not apply to contractual
issues arising in the context of treaty claims; in particular, they cannot be invoked to join
a third party State to a contract. Respondent refers to the following statement of Professor

Crawford:

"It is often assumed that because a State organ has entered into a

contract, the State is therefore responsible for compliance with the

contract. This depends, however, on what is specified in the proper law

of the contract. In most cases, it is the individual legal entity that has

entered into the contract that is responsible for breach. The rules of

attribution have nothing to do with questions of contractual

responsibility."°*
Respondent asserts that Claimant's investment relates to its alleged contract-based rights
under the CHEJVA Agreements to which neither Pakistan nor Balochistan is a party;
according to Respondent, Claimant cannot invoke such contract-based rights against

Respondent as part of its Treaty claim.°*

b. Even Under the ILC Articles, the Alleged Violations of the CHEJVA Are Not
Attributable to the GOP

Respondent submits that the CHEJVA was concluded with the BDA, a statutory entity
that is legally distinct from the GOB and the GOP and not a State organ of Balochistan
under Pakistani law. Respondent claims that the BDA is not empowered to act, or to enter
into agreements, on behalf of the GOB.®* Thus, according to Respondent, the question

whether its acts are attributable to Pakistan does not arise.

Respondent claims that the BDA is not a State organ under the law of Pakistan and argues
that its acts therefore fall outside the scope of Article 4 of the ILC Articles.® Respondent
refers to the tribunal in Noble Ventures, Inc. v. Romania, which stated that Article 4
applies to acts of "de jure organs which have been expressly entitled to act for the State

within the limits of their competence" and held that for "legal entities separate from the

Respondent, it is not possible to regard them as de jure organs."°°"

Respondent submits that the BDA does not have legal capacity to act for the State of
Pakistan, and refers to the Supreme Court judgment stating:

“Tt is clear that CHEJVA was made between BDA and BHP alone for
all practical purposes, and not between GOB through BDA and
BHP."8

Respondent submits that, rather than Article 4, Article 5 of the ILC Articles is relevant in
the present case as it sets out the circumstances in which the acts of State entities which
are not State organs can be attributed to the State.® Article 5 provides:

“The conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State
under Article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to
exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an
act of the State under international law, provided the person or entity
is acing in that capacity in the particular instance.”°”°

Respondent submits that the following two requirements have to be met in order for the
BDA’s acts to be attributable to the State of Pakistan: (i) the BDA must be empowered
by Pakistani law to exercise elements of governmental authority; and (ii) the BDA must

be acting in that capacity in the particular instance.°”!

Respondent argues that those requirements are not met because the BDA does not
exercise governmental authority on behalf of either Pakistan or Balochistan as a matter
of Pakistani law. In addition, Respondent claims that in this particular case, the BDA was
a partner in a joint venture agreement, i.e., a commercial transaction.”

Respondent further contends that, even if the GOB was a party to the CHEJVA, the GOP
was not and Claimant has not shown how the acts of the GOP have interfered with the
CHEJVA.°” Respondent quotes Professor Mayer, who states:

"As regards contracts concluded by the sovereign State as such (State
contracts in the strict sense) the applicable principles are those of

contract or procedural law . . .; when the contract is concluded by a
separate entity, the applicable principles are those for extra-
contractual liability."°"*

718. Respondent submits that Article 12 of the Harvard Articles, which it claims to be "the
most comprehensive attempt at codifying this issue," draws the same distinction and, in
case of a contract with a State entity, provides for one of the following additional
requirements: (i) "a clear and discriminatory departure from the proper law of the
contract"; (ii) "an unreasonable departure from the principles recognized by the principal
legal systems of the world as applicable to such contracts"; or (iii) "a violation by the

State of a treaty."

719. Respondent claims that, in order for Pakistan to incur international responsibility in the
present case where the contract was concluded with the BDA as a separate entity, the
"traditional test" for internationally wrongful conduct set out in Article 12 must be

applied.°”°

720. Finally, Respondent argues that even if it were assumed that the GOB was a party to the

CHEJVA, it would not have acted as a governmental authority but only in its commercial
capacity; thus, any breach of contract could not amount to a Treaty violation.°””

c. The Alleged Breaches of the 2002 BM Rules Are Not Attributable to the GOP

721. In relation to the acts of the Licensing Authority and the Secretary of the MMDD,
Respondent submits that, pursuant to Annex B of the Treaty, the attribution of acts to the
GOP is governed by the provisions of the Treaty, the provisions of any agreement
between the parties and Pakistani law. Respondent argues that, while the Treaty itself
does not contain any provision on this issue, Pakistani law clearly provides that the GOP
is not responsible for the conduct of its provinces, as Balochistan can sue and be sued in
its own name.°7

722. In Respondent's view, Claimant cannot escape the risk allocation provided for in the
CHEJVA by laying blame on the Licensing Authority for "acts attributable to the
Respondent State as a sovereign"; rather, it must establish that the conduct of its
contracting partner and the Licensing Authority was in violation of both the CHEJVA

and the 2002 BM Rules and, in addition, that this amounted to a violation of Respondent's

obligations under the Treaty.°”?

The Tribunal’s Analysis

At the outset, the Tribunal recalls its finding above that it is not for this Tribunal to make
a determination on whether Claimant has any contractual claims against Respondent, but
the Tribunal's jurisdiction is rather limited to the assessment of whether the conduct of
Respondent (or any conduct that is attributable to Respondent) amounts to a violation of
its obligation under the Treaty and thus under international law. Even though some of
these actions may well be relevant to both Claimant's contractual claims and its claims
arising under the Treaty, this does not mean that, irrespective of the context in which the
actions are analyzed, there is a uniform answer as to the applicable rules of attribution.

In the Tribunal's view, because this Tribunal will assess whether any conduct of
Respondent gives rise to liability under the Treaty and thus under international law, it is
the customary international law of attribution, as reflected in the ILC Articles, that applies
in determining which conduct is attributable to Respondent.

a. The Conduct of Government Officials

First of all, it is undisputed that the conduct of Federal officials and of the Supreme Court
is attributable to Respondent under Article 4 of the ILC Articles.

The Tribunal considers that the same must apply to the conduct of the GOB and its
provincial officials because a Federal State may not use its internal organization to escape
liability under international law. The Tribunal notes that this corresponds to what is
expressed in the final part of Article 4(1) ("whatever its character as an organ of the
central Government or of a territorial unit of the State") and in the Commentary to Article
4:

"[T]he principle in article 4 applies equally to organs of the central

government and those of regional or local units. This principle has long

been recognized. ... It does not matter for this purpose whether the

territorial unit in question is a component unit of a federal State or a

specific autonomous area, and it is equally irrelevant whether the

internal law of the State in question gives the federal parliament power

INT’

to compel the component unit to abide by the State's international
obligations. ... That rule has since been consistently applied."

. The Tribunal agrees with the ILC Commentary that this principle is justified because,

even if the component units, i.e., in this case the provinces, have a separate legal
personality under domestic law, they do not have a separate international legal personality
and they do not have the power to enter into international treaties.**! If this principle were
not applied, it would be impossible to make the conduct of provincial units subject to
international obligations, which would in turn discourage investments in areas that are
governed by provincial law and/or in which investors have to deal with provincial
authorities. It is clear that this cannot have been the intent of either the Contracting Parties
in concluding the Treaty or the authors of the ILC Articles.

As a result, the Tribunal considers that the conduct of the GOB and its officials is
attributable to Respondent despite the fact that under Pakistani law, Balochistan can sue
and be sued in its own name. As to Respondent's reference to Annex B of the Treaty,
pursuant to which a tribunal shall apply the domestic law of the host State, the Tribunal
agrees with Claimant that this Annex applies only in case neither Contracting Party is
party to the ICSID Convention at the time the dispute is submitted to arbitration (Article
13(2)(c) of the Treaty) and therefore does not support Respondent's position in the present

case.°*?

In light of the fact that the Licensing Authority, the Secretary of the MMDD and further
Government officials of the GOB on whose assurances Claimant relies in these
proceedings thus qualify as State organs within the meaning of Article 4 of the ILC
Articles, their conduct is to be considered an act of Respondent. Pursuant to Article 7,
this applies regardless of whether any of those State organs exceeded their authority or
contravened instructions. ? Pursuant to the Commentary on Article 4, it is further
"irrelevant for the purposes of attribution that the conduct of a State organ may be
cl
officials are attributable to Respondent even if they were carried out in performance of

‘sified as ‘commercial’ or as acta iure gestionis."*** Therefore, acts of the GOB and its

  

the CHEJVA rather than in an executive function.

b. The Conduct of the BDA

730. Finally, the Tribunal has to determine whether the conduct of the BDA can be attributed
to Respondent as well. In the Tribunal's view, there is no need to decide whether the BDA
as an autonomous legal entity is a State organ under Article 4, if its conduct is in any

event attributable to Respondent under Article 5 or Article 8.

731.

According to Article 5 of the ILC Articles, the conduct of an entity that does not qualify
as a State organ under Article 4 is nevertheless considered an act of the State, if (i) it is
empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of governmental authority; and
(ii) it is acting in that capacity in the particular instance. At this stage, the Tribunal
considers it relevant whether the GOB was party to the CHEJVA because, if that were
indeed the case, it would be clear that the BDA was empowered to exercise governmental
authority and acted in that capacity in representing the GOB, in particular on the Joint
Venture's Operating Committee, until December 2009.

732. The Tribunal is aware that the question whether the GOB or the BDA itself was party to
the CHEJVA was analyzed by both the Supreme Court and the ICC Tribunal. In its 2013
judgment, the Supreme Court considered it "clear that CHEJVA was made between BDA
and BHP alone for all practical purposes, and not between GOB through BDA and BHP"
and stated that the BDA Act 1974 does not authorize the BDA to act as an agent of the
GOB.** The ICC Tribunal disagreed in its 2014 Preliminary Rulings with the view of
the Supreme Court and, after having analyzed the relevant provisions of the Pakistani
Constitution, the 1976 Rules of Business and the BDA Act 1974 as well as the language
used in the CHEJVA, the 2000 Addendum and the 2006 Novation Agreement, concluded
that the BDA was authorized to enter into the CHEJVA on behalf of the GOB, i.e., with
the result that the GOB became a party to the CHEJVA in 1993, as confirmed by the 2000
Addendum.°*°

733. While this Tribunal will of course give due consideration to the findings of the Supreme
Court, the Tribunal does not consider itself bound by them in the context of its analysis
of whether the actions of the BDA can be attributed to Respondent under international
law. The Tribunal will therefore give the same due consideration to the findings of the
ICC Tribunal and will form its own judgment as to whether the GOB became a party to
the CHEJVA in 1993 or by means of the 2000 Addendum.

734. Both the Supreme Court and the ICC Tribunal referred to Articles 173(3) and 139(2) of
the Pakistani Constitution.®*’ Article 173(3) of the Constitution provides:

"All contracts made in the exercise of the executive authority of the
Federation or of a Province shall be expressed to be made in the name
of the President or, as the case may be, the Governor of the Province,
and all such contracts and all assurances of property made in the
exercise of that authority shall be executed on behalf of the President
or Governor by such persons and in such manner as he may direct or
authorize."°*

735. Article 139(2) of the Constitution reads:

"The [Provincial Government] shall by rules specify the manner in
which orders and instruments made and executive actions [in the name
of the Governor] shall be authenticated, and the validity of any order
or instrument so authenticated shall not be questioned in any court on
the ground that it was not made or executed by the Governor."°*°

736. The ICC Tribunal further agreed with the Supreme Court that Balochistan implemented
Article 139(2) of the Constitution by enacting the 1976 Rules of Business, of which rule
7 is of particular relevance in the present case. However, while the Supreme Court
referred to the requirements of both rules 7(2) and 7(3),°”° the ICC Tribunal distinguished
between the requirements for orders and instruments in rule 7(2) and those for contracts
in rule 7(3) and considered that only the latter had to be satisfied in the present case.®!
Rule 7 is entitled "Orders and instruments, agreements and contracts" and provides:

"(1) As provided for in the Constitution, all executive action of
Government shall be expressed in the name of the Governor.

(2) Save in cases where an officer has been specifically empowered
to sign an order or instrument of Government, every such order or
instrument shall be signed by the Secretary[,] the Additional Secretary,
the Joint Secretary, the Deputy Secretary or the Section Officer to the

deemed to be the proper authentication of such order or instrument.

(3) Instructions for the making of contracts on behalf of the Governor
and the execution of such contracts and all assurances of property shall
be issued by the Law Department."

737. The Tribunal notes that the Supreme Court's judgment does not contain any reasoning as
to the applicability of rules 7(2) and/or (3) of the 1976 Business Rules to the conclusion
of the CHEJVA; the ICC Tribunal on the other hand held that rule 7(2) of the 1976
Business Rules applies only to instruments and orders and considered that, in the context
of Article 139 of the Constitution, these terms refer to legislative and quasi legislative
acts but not to contracts. As to rule 7(3), the ICC Tribunal noted that no specific
instructions had been issued for the execution for the CHEJVA but considered it sufficient

that it had been "vetted" by the Law Department.*?

738. With regard to the CHEJVA itself, the Supreme Court relied on the wording of the title
page and in particular the reference to approvals from the GOP and/or GOB to be
sought under Clause 2.1 of the CHEJVA,°> which, in its view, made clear that the GOB
was an "entit[y] outside the ambit of 'Part[y]" under the CHEJVA.°° The ICC Tribunal
on the other hand referred to the wording on the opening page of the CHEJVA°” and the
authorization of the Chairman by the Additional Chief Secretary, the Chief Secretary and
the Chief Minister. In addition, the ICC Tribunal noted that the Law Department had
vetted the CHEJVA before its execution and had further considered it unnecessary in
1999 to clarify the role of the BDA as agent of the GOB by an addendum.°”?

739. As to the 2000 Addendum, the Supreme Court reasoned that the assumption of the parties
involved that the GOB was made party to the CHEJVA was a mistake of fact because this
would have required "an affirming signature under the hand of a duly authorized
representative or agent of GOB in terms of Rule 7."7°° According to the Supreme Court,
the signature of the Chairman of the BDA under the 2000 Addendum did not fulfill this
requirement because the authorization letter from the Governor was "not printed on the
Governor's letterhead, carrie[{d] no date, notification number, nor [was] it addressed to
any office or authority or even stamped. Neither [was] there any supporting
documentation, nor [did] the letter provide a reference to a decision of the Cabinet on the
matter.""' The ICC Tribunal held that the 2000 Addendum confirmed that the GOB was
party to the CHEJVA and referred to the authorization letter as having been sent by the
Principal Secretary to the Chairman on 27 December 1999; in addition, the ICC Tribunal
emphasized that the Law Department had returned the 2000 Addendum "duly vetted."""

740. The Supreme Court further held that that GOB could not have validly appointed the BDA
or its Chairman as its agent because rule 7 required that the agreement would be executed

through the respective department and signed by the Secretary, Additional Secretary, etc.

of that department, whereas the BDA was not a department but a separate legal entity.’°°

By contrast, the ICC Tribunal noted that the BDA was authorized under the BDA Act
1974 to enter into joint venture contracts (as recognized by the Supreme Court) and
further that, while it was not expressly authorized to act as agent of the GOB, the BDA
Act gave the BDA broad powers to carry out the purposes of the Act.”°* Therefore, the
ICC Tribunal considered that there was no legal basis for Balochistan's argument that the
GOB could not authorize a legal person such as the BDA to act on its behalf. Finally, the
ICC Tribunal held that even if rule 7(2) were to be applied, the Chairman of the BDA
also qualified as an "officer" under the 1976 Business Rules.”

. This Tribunal agrees with the ICC Tribunal that there is no support in the BDA Act 1974

or the 1976 Business Rules for Respondent's argument that the GOB could not have
validly authorized the BDA, i.e., a separate legal entity rather than a department of the
GOB itself, as its agent. In addition, the Tribunal considers it established that the GOB
did in fact authorize the Chairman of the BDA in July 1993 to enter into the CHEJVA on
its behalf.7°° Given that the Law Department further vetted the CHEJVA before it was
executed on 29 July 1993,”” the requirements under both rules 7(2) and (3) were fulfilled
so that it is not necessary to decide on whether they both apply to the execution of
contracts. In conclusion, this Tribunal therefore agrees with the conclusion of the ICC
Tribunal that the BDA was authorized to sign the CHEJVA on behalf of the GOB and
that, as a result, the GOB was a party to the CHEJVA as of 1993.

In addition, the Tribunal considers that, even if there had been an authorization issue that
prevented the GOB from becoming a party in 1993, it would have become a party in any
event by means of the 2000 Addendum, which was concluded to "clarify the role of the
BDA under the JVA as agent of the GOB and the scope of its authority to act on behalf of
the GOB." In addition, the GOB confirmed and ratified "all past actions, matters and
things done by the BDA in connection with the JVA.""°* Even though the 2000 Addendum
was again signed by the Chairman of the BDA on behalf of the GOB, this time the
Chairman was expressly authorized by the Governor to sign the Addendum on behalf of
the GOB.””

While Respondent initially maintained the position of the Supreme Court that the
authorization letter from the Governor was improper because it was unsigned and was not
prepared on the Governor's letterhead, it was clarified during the Hearing that the letter
was attached to an official communication, which has also been submitted to the Tribunal
in the present proceedings.”'° During the Hearing, Respondent rather argued that the
Governor did not have the power to bind the GOB under the 1976 Rules of Business and

of the Board, who shall be the chief executive of the Authority." Exhibits RE-20, Schedules IV and III, and RE-

claimed that "[t]hat's something which is in the hands of the Cabinet and the Chief
Minister and authorized officials.""'! The Tribunal is not convinced by this argument
because rule 7(1) expressly states that contracts shall be executed in the name of the
Governor and there is no indication that the Governor himself did not have the power to
authorize a third party to act on his behalf.

In addition, the Tribunal notes that Respondent stated during the Hearing that from
October 1999 through November 2002, the Governor of Balochistan ruled under martial
law so that during the relevant time period in which the authorization letter and the 2000
Addendum were signed, "there was no Chief Minister and no Parliament. There was only
a Governor.""'? Thus, if one were to follow Respondent's argument, there would have
been no official at the time who could have validly bound the GOB.7" In light of these
particular circumstances, the Tribunal considers it sufficient for the purposes of rule 7 of
the 1976 Business Rules that the Governor himself signed the authorization letter and,
apparently, authorized his Principal Secretary to deliver it to the Chairman of the BDA
on his behalf.7!

Finally, the Tribunal notes that contemporaneous documents establish that at the time the
GOB itself considered that it was a party to the CHEJVA. In particular, the GOB decided
to replace the BDA as representative on the Operating Committee by the MMDD on 12
December 2009.”'5 If the BDA itself had been party to the CHEJVA, the GOB would not
have had any authority to replace it with the MMDD,; therefore, this decision clearly
demonstrates that the GOB considered the BDA to be an agent that could be replaced.
The 24 December 2009 Working Paper prepared by the MMDD further expressly states
that BHP entered into the CHEJVA with the GOB "through B.D.A." and repeatedly refers
to the GOB's 25% equity share in the Joint Venture.”!° These documents strongly
indicates that the GOB itself was of the view at the time that the BDA had acted as its
representative under the CHEJVA until December 2009 when the BDA was replaced by
the MMDD.

In light of the fact that the BDA acted as agent of the GOB in connection with the
CHEJVA, it was clearly empowered to exercise governmental authority and also acted in

Cf. Respondent's further statement during the Hearing: "Now, there was a procedure under which the Governor

can act, but it wasn't followed in this case, and he can only act where there has been a decision of the Cabinet or
the Chief Minister and he's implementing that decision. And there was no Cabinet or Chief Minister for him to
implement their decision." Transcript (Day 2), p. 274 lines 14-19.

that capacity, in particular when it represented the GOB on the Operating Committee.
The conduct of the BDA is thus attributable to Respondent under Article 5 of the ILC
Articles.

747. In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the actions of all provincial agencies and
departments and in particular of the BDA can be attributed to Balochistan and in turn to
Respondent. The Tribunal will rely on this finding in its further analysis and consider all
of these actions as acts of Respondent.

C. DID PAKISTAN BREACH ARTICLE 3(2) OF THE TREATY?

748. Claimant claims that the following conduct constitutes a violation of the fair and equitable
treatment (sometimes referred to as "FET") obligation under Article 3(2) of the Treaty:
(i) the denial of the Mining Lease Application; (ii) the development and implementation
of the plan to take over the Reko Diq project; and (iii) together with the foregoing
breaches, other Government conduct, including the conduct during the Mineral
Agreement negotiations and/or in the Pakistan Supreme Court proceedings which,
according to Claimant, constitutes an overall course of action that is a composite breach
of Article 3(2).7!7

749. In its analysis, the Tribunal will first determine the precise scope of the FET standard
under Article 3(2) of the Treaty. As a second step, the Tribunal will assess whether this
particular standard has been breached by Respondent's actions, insofar as they are
established by the record.

 

1. The Standard of Fair and Equitable Tr Pr ion under Article 3(2) of the
Treaty

750. Article 3(2) of the Treaty provides as follows:

"Each Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment in its own
territory to investments."

a. Summary of Claimant's Position

751. Claimant submits that the obligation under Article 3(2) of the Treaty to provide fair and
equitable treatment constitutes an autonomous requirement, which, contrary to
Respondent's allegation, is not confined to the minimum standard of treatment under

customary international law as embodied in the 1926 case of Neer v. Mexico.”

i. The Scope of the Autonomous FET Standard Under Article 3(2)

752. Claimant submits that there are several inter-related principles embodied within an FET
obligation, which set a standard for the host State's conduct towards the investor.
According to Claimant, these principles include: (a) protection of the reasonable
legitimate expectations of foreign investors; (b) conduct in good faith; (c) procedural
propriety and due process; (d) non-discrimination; and (e) no arbitrariness in decision-
making. ”° Claimant claims that a host State's failure to conform to any of these principles
may result in a breach of the FET standard.7”!

(a) Protection of Reasonable Legitimate Expectations

753. In Claimant's view, the "dominant" element of these principles is the protection of an
investor's legitimate expectations.’? Claimant refers to what it claims is "a widely-
accepted formulation" of the standard in the case of Tecmed v. Mexico:

"[The fair and equitable treatment obligation] requires the Contracting
Parties to provide to international investments treatment that does not
affect the basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign
investor to make the investment. The foreign investor expects the host
State to act in a consistent manner, free from ambiguity and totally
transparently in its relations with the foreign investor, so that it may
know beforehand any and all rules and regulations that will govern its
investments, as well as the goals of the relevant policies and
administrative practices or directives, to be able to plan its investment
and comply with such regulations."">

754. In relation to Respondent's criticism of the Tecmed standard, Claimant notes that the
tribunal in Saluka v. Czech Republic, which Respondent relies on in this regard, agreed
with the Tecmed tribunal that the protection of an investor's legitimate expectations is the
"dominant element" of FET.’ Claimant further notes that the article from Professor
Muchlinski, which Respondent also relies on, refers to the standard set out in Tecmed as
a "now reasonably well settled" proposition, without citing any other authority.’°

Claimant also asserts that Respondent adopted the application of the legitimate
expectations standard in its Closing.”

755. Claimant further refers to the tribunal in Kardassopoulos v. Georgia, which stated that an
investor may reasonably hold the legitimate expectation that the host State would
"conduct itself vis-a-vis [the] investment in a manner that was reasonably justifiable and

did not manifestly violate basic requirements of consistency, transparency, even-
handedness and non-discrimination."7"

756. In addition, Claimant relies on the tribunal's observation in Frontier Petroleum v. Czech
Republic that "[w]hile the host state is entitled to determine its legal and economic order,
the investor also has a legitimate expectation in the system's stability to facilitate rational

planning and decision making." Claimant notes that the tribunal further stated that "an

arbitrary reversal of such undertakings will constitute a violation of fair and equitable

treatment."78

757. Claimant acknowledges that the expectations of the investor have to be reasonable and

submits that they must be based "on assurances explicit or implicit, or on representations,

made by the state which the investor took into account in making the investment.""”

Claimant again refers to the tribunal in Frontier Petroleum v. Czech Republic, which
stated that an investor is entitled to "rely on [the State's] legal framework as well as on

representations and undertakings made by the host state including those in legislation,

treaties, decrees, licenses and contracts."

758. Claimant emphasizes that contractual commitments may form part of the investor's
legitimate expectations and relies on the case of Bayindir v. Pakistan in which the tribunal
stated that, even in a case where the tribunal does not have jurisdiction to decide on

breaches of the contract itself, "the Tribunal must nevertheless take into account the terms

of the [clontract as a factual element reflecting the expectations of Claimant."”!

(b) Conduct in Good Faith

. Claimant further submits that the FET standard is breached in case the State fails to act

in good faith and thereby affects the investment.’*? Claimant again relies on the case of
Frontier Petroleum v. Czech Republic in which the tribunal stated that the obligation to
act in good faith may be breached by "the use of legal instruments for purposes other than
those for which they created" as well as by "a conspiracy by state organs to inflict damage
upon or to defeat the investment, the termination of the investment for reasons other than
the one put forth by the government, and expulsion of an investment based on local
favouritism" and by "[rleliance by a government on its internal structures to excuse non-

compliance with contractual obligations.""°

Claimant emphasizes that, while a violation of the good faith principle results in a breach
of the FET obligation, the former is not a necessary element of the latter; according to
Claimant, even if the minimum standard of treatment were to be applied, the FET standard
may also be violated without the State acting in subjective bad faith,.”**

(c) Procedural Propriety and Due Process

Claimant further states that a denial of fair and equitable treatment may result from "an
absence of fair procedure or a finding of serious procedural shortcomings," such as
defects in an administrative process (e.g., absence of transparency and candor) and defects
in judicial proceedings (e.g., undue influence of State political initiatives, unreasoned and
arbitrary judicial decision).’°°

Claimant argues that due process requires "an actual and substantive legal procedure,
which provides the investor with "basic legal mechanisms, such as reasonable advance
notice, a fair hearing and an unbiased and impartial adjudicator to assess the actions in
dispute" and grants the investor "a reasonable chance within a reasonable time to claim
its legitimate rights and have its claims heard.""*°

(d) Non-Discrimination

763. Claimant submits that a State further breaches its FET obligation if it engages in
discriminatory treatment.”*” Claimant refers to the tribunal in Saluka v. Czech Republic,
which held that "differential treatment of a foreign investor . . . must be justified by
showing that it bears a reasonable relationship to rational policies not motivated by a

preference for other investments over the foreign-owned investment."7*

764. Claimant also notes that pursuant to the Preamble of the Treaty, Pakistan and Australia
concluded the Treaty to promote investment relations in accordance with "internationally
accepted principles"; according to Claimant, this includes the principle of "non-

discrimination."7°

(e) No Arbitrariness in Decision-Making

765. Finally, Claimant states that the host State breaches the FET standard if it treats the
foreign investment in an arbitrary manner, which has been found to be the case when a

measure is "not founded on reason or fact, nor on the law, . .. but on mere fear reflecting

"740

national preference" ’™” or when there is "a willful disregard of due process of law, an act

which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial propriety."""!

ii. The Standard under Article 3(2) Is Not Limited to the Minimum
Standard of Tr under C 'y International Law

 

766. Claimant rejects Respondent's contention that fair and equitable treatment is "generally

understood to impose [an] ‘international minimum. standar of treatment under

customary international law and Respondent's conclusion that its treatment of TCCA's
investment may violate Article 3(2) of the Treaty only if it “amount[ed] to an outrage, to
bad faith, to willful neglect of duty, or to an insufficiency of governmental action so far

short of international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily

recognize its insufficiency.”™

Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability
ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1

767. In Claimant's view, Respondent’s contention that the Treaty imposes the minimum
standard of treatment is contrary to Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention pursuant to
which a treaty must be interpreted “in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning
to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in light of its object and

purpose.”"

768. Claimant argues that Respondent's argument is not supported by the text of Article 3(2)
and notes that, unlike the North American Free Trade Agreement ("NAFTA"), which is
at issue in the cases of Glamis Gold and Waste Management that Respondent relies on,
the Australia-Pakistan Treaty does not link the FET standard to the minimum standard
under customary international law.”

769. Claimant submits that the tribunal in Jnmaris v. Ukraine had to interpret a provision
similar to Article 3(2) and concluded that, in the absence of any language "in the BIT that
limits [the FET provision] to the standard required by customary international law, . . .
the Tribunal interprets the language as written," so that "[a]ny government act that is

unfair or inequitable with respect to a covered investment breaches that obligation."">

770. Claimant further asserts that Respondent's argument is not supported by the context of
Article 3(2) or the object and purpose of the Treaty. In particular, Claimant claims that
the “internationally accepted principles of mutual respect for sovereignty, equality,
mutual benefit, non-discrimination and mutual confidence” that Respondent refers to in
the Preamble to the Treaty cannot be read as indicating an intent to limit the FET
obligation to the minimum standard of treatment.”4° Claimant refers to the tribunal in
Vivendi v. Argentina II, which held that “the reference to principles of international law
supports a broader reading that invites consideration of a wider range of international

law principles than the minimum standard alone.”™"

Claimant maintains that the FET standard has "an autonomous meaning" that "is not to

international law.""**8 Claimant again refers to the tribunal in Vivendi v. Argentina II,
which quoted a statement from Dr. F.A. Mann:

"[T]he terms ‘fair and equitable treatment’ envisage conduct which goes

far beyond the minimum standard and afford protection to a greater
extent and according to a much more objective standard than any
previously employed form of words. A Tribunal would not be concerned
with a minimum, maximum or average standard. It will have to decide
whether in all circumstances the conduct in issue is fair and equitable
or unfair and inequitable. No standard defined by any other words is
likely to be material. The terms are to be understood and implied
independently and autonomously.""°

772. Claimant further argues that the UNCTAD survey on practice regarding the fair and

773.

774.

equitable treatment obligation, which Respondent relies on, distinguishes between
“formulations of the FET standard” that are “linked to the minimum standard of treatment
of aliens under customary international law,” such as NAFTA, and those treaties which
impose an FET obligation “without any reference to international law or any further
criteria,” such as the Treaty in this case. Claimant submits that the survey describes the
latter as imposing an “unqualified, autonomous or self-standing FET standard.”
Finally, in relation to Respondent's reliance on the 1926 case of Neer v. Mexico, Claimant
claims that the minimum standard of treatment has evolved significantly since that
decision and argues that, even if the minimum standard were to be applied, it would not
be the standard of 1926 but rather the one existing under customary law today.’>!

b. Summary of Respondent's Position
i. The Standard of Article 3(2) Is Equivalent to the Minimum Standard of
Treatment under Customary International Law

Respondent submits that Article 3(2) of the Treaty is "no ordinary ‘fair and equitable
treatment’ provision," as it has to be read with the preceding Article 3(1), which together
provide:

"1. Each Party shall encourage and promote investments in its territory
by investors of the other Party and shall, in accordance with its laws
and investment policies applicable from time to time, admit
investments.

2. Each Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment in its own
territory to Investments.”

According to Respondent, Article 3(2) of the Treaty is equivalent to the minimum
standard for the treatment of aliens under customary international law.’**

Respondent submits that the requirement to treat investments in a fair and equitable
manner as set out in Article 3(2) is generally understood to impose an “international
minimum standard." According to Respondent, this standard is breached only if "based
on the totality of the circumstances of the case, the Government would have acted in such
a manner that every reasonable and impartial man or woman would recognise its
insufficiency."**

Respondent argues that Claimant's interpretation of Article 3(2) would "inappropriately
limit{] the exercise of sovereign regulatory authority and discretion," as illustrated by

Claimant's allegation of a "myriad of violations" of "stability," "transparency," legitimate

expectations," "procedural propriety," "consistency" and "good faith."">

Respondent submits that in accordance with Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention, the
FET obligation of the Treaty has to be interpreted "in light of [the Treaty's] object and
purpose."”*© According to Respondent, the object and purpose of the Treaty are contained
in the Preamble, which states that "investment relations should be promoted and
economic co-operation strengthened in accordance with internationally accepted
principles of mutual respect for sovereignty.""*” Respondent argues that, unlike other
treaties, the Australia-Pakistan Treaty does not solely aim at promoting and protecting
investment, but rather at "promoting the flow of capital for economic activity and

development."7°*

Respondent argues that, in light of the contextual guidance provided by the Preamble, the
provisions of the Treaty, including the FET obligation under Article 3(2), should be

interpreted in accordance with standards set by international law.” Respondent refers to
the Notes and Comments to Article 1 of the OECD Draft Convention in which the
Committee responsible for the Draft stated:

“The phrase ‘fair and equitable treatment’, customary in relevant

bilateral agreements, indicates the standard set by international law for
the treatment due by each State with regard to the property of foreign

nationals. . . . The standard required conforms in effect to the
‘minimum standard’ which forms part of customary international
law."™

780. In Respondent's view, the "authoritative articulation" of the FET standard as "the
functional equivalent" of the minimum standard of treatment under customary
international law has been provided by the tribunal in Neer v. Mexico:

"[T]he treatment of an alien, in order to constitute an international
delinquency, should amount to an outrage, to bad faith, to wilful neglect
of duty, or to an insufficiency of governmental action so far short of
international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would
readily recognize its insufficiency.""!

781.

Respondent contends that the Neer tribunal set forth a very high threshold that has been
adopted by subsequent tribunals and still remains applicable today; according to
Respondent, it is the appropriate standard for compliance with Article 3(2).’

782. Respondent refers to the tribunal in Glamis Gold v. USA, which held that in order to
constitute a breach of the FET obligation:

"[a]n act must be sufficiently egregious and shocking — a gross denial
of justice, manifest arbitrariness, blatant unfairness, a complete lack of
due process, evident discrimination, or a manifest lack of reasons — so
as to fall below accepted international standards and constitute a
breach.""

"Acts that would violate this minimum standard would include acts

showing a wilful neglect of duty, an insufficiency of action falling far

below international standards, or even subjective bad faith.""
Respondent claims that the circumstances in Genin v. Estonia were similar to the present
case. The tribunal stated that the Estonian Central Bank's decision to revoke a license
"invites criticism," in particular, the reasoning in the notice was "formalistic" and did not
fully express all the "not unsound" reasons underlying its decision. The tribunal found
that "ample grounds existed for the action taken" by the Bank and, despite the poor form
of and non-exhaustive reasons in the revocation decision, such matters "do[] not rise to
the level of a violation of any provision of the BIT.""

Respondent also cites the interpretation given by the tribunal in Lauder v. Czech Republic:

"Fair and equitable treatment is related to the traditional standard of

due diligence and provides a ‘minimum international standard which

forms part of customary international law'."7°

Finally, Respondent refers to the case of El Paso v Argentina in which the tribunal was
of the view that:

"the position according to which FET is equivalent to the international
minimum standard is more in line with the evolution of investment law
and international law and with the identical role assigned to FET and
to the international minimum standard."""

ii. Even If Considered a Self-Standing Standard, the Threshold for Breach
of the FET Obligation Would Be Higher Than Alleged by Claimant

Respondent contends that even if the Tribunal were to follow Claimant's interpretation of
Article 3(2) as a self-standing FET standard that is not connected to the international
minimum standard, the standard would be stricter than alleged by Claimant.”

In relation to Claimant's reliance on the articulation of the FET standard in Tecmed v.

Mexico, Respondent submits that this articulation has been criticized in scholarship and
has also been "heavily qualified" by subsequent case law. Respondent cites the tribunal

in Saluka v. Czech Republic, which stated in relation to the Tecmed v. Mexico standard:
"If their terms were to be taken too literally, they would impose upon host States

obligations which would be inappropriate and unrealistic.""

Respondent further contends that other tribunals have imposed limitations on the standard
focusing on the extent to which the frustration of an investor's expectations may constitute
a breach of the FET obligation.’” Respondent submits that there are five relevant
limitations:’”! (a) the reasonableness and legitimacy of an investor's expectations must
not be assessed in isolation, but rather in the context of all the surrounding circumstances;
(b) the expectations must be based on a representation made by the State specifically to
the investor regarding specific commitments, or a representation or rule that is not
specifically addressed to a particular investor but which was made with a specific aim to
induce foreign investments and on which the foreign investor relied; (c) the representation
must be "crucial for the investment decision"; (d) the expectations must be balanced
against legitimate regulatory goals of the host State; and (e) the investor's conduct must
be taken into account.

(a) R bl and Legitimacy of the Expectati

With regard to the first limitation, Respondent contends that, as the general factor,
reasonableness is a key aspect both in terms of the investor's expectations and the host

State's conduct.”

According to Respondent, the extent to which the expectations of the investor are
reasonable and legitimate must be considered in the context of all the surrounding
circumstances. Respondent refers to the tribunal in Duke Energy v. Ecuador, which stated
that:

"the assessment of the reasonableness or legitimacy must take into
account all circumstances, including not only the facts surrounding the
investment, but also the political, socioeconomic, cultural and
historical conditions prevailing in the host State."""°

Respondent further asserts that if the relevant conduct of the host State is reasonable in
all the circumstances (and thus to be expected), no liability under the FET standard can

of the Mining Lease Application by the Licensing Authority was not unreasonable.’”*

793. Respondent submits that investors must also take into consideration the level of
development and administrative standards in the host State; they have to conduct their
own due diligence and may not rely on the terms of an investment treaty if they failed to
do so.775

794. Respondent further contends that Claimant's focus on "whether its own (subjective)
expectations were frustrated" is misconceived and refers to the statement of the tribunal
in EDF v. Romania:

"Legitimate expectations cannot be solely the subjective expectations of
the investor. They must be examined as the expectations at the time the
investment is made, as they may be deduced from all the circumstances
of the case, due regard being paid to the host State’s power to regulate
its economic life in the public interest."""°

795. Respondent argues that the hopes and wishes of an investor do not form the basis of the
State's liability under Article 3(2); to the contrary, Respondent considers the concept of
"legitimate expectations" to be a "jurisprudential construct" designed to assist in deciding
whether the FET obligation was breached. Respondent asserts that there is no

freestanding obligation to respect such expectations and also emphasizes that not all

expectations can be considered "Jegitimate.""""

(b) Specific Representation Made by the State

. As to the second limitation, Respondent contends that a legitimate expectation must be

based either on a representation made by the State specifically to the investor regarding
specific commitments or on a representation or rule which was not specifically addressed
to a particular investor but which was made with a specific aim to induce foreign
investments and on which the investor relied.”

Respondent acknowledges that assurances or representations from the Government can
form the basis of legitimate expectations, but argues that they must have "a certain grade
of precision." Respondent refers to the tribunal in Frontier Petroleum v. Czech Republic,
which rejected an FET claim that was based on assurances and representations from the
host Government because they did "not exhibit the level of specificity to generate

legitimate expectations.""””

Respondent further acknowledges that the legal and regulatory framework may form the
basis of legitimate expectations, but argues that this is subject to the following
qualifications: (i) investors take the law of the host State as they find it; and (ii) the
framework must contain some specific basis for a legitimate expectation. Respondent
refers to the EDF v. Romania tribunal, which stated:

"Except where specific promises or representations are made by the

State to the investor, the latter may not rely on a bilateral investment
treaty as a kind of insurance policy against the risk of any changes in
the host State's legal and economic framework. Such expectation would
be neither legitimate nor reasonable.""°°

(c) "Crucial for the Investment Decision"

In relation to the third limitation, i.e., that the representation must be "crucial for the
investment decision," Respondent refers in particular to the frequent allegation of
investors that they legitimately expected that their contract would be properly performed
by the State and relies on the tribunal's finding in Parkerings v. Lithuania that "not every

hope amounts to an expectation under international law. . . . [C]ontracts involve intrinsic
expectations from each party that do not amount to expectations as understood in
international law.""*! Respondent further refers to the case of Hamester v. Ghana in
which the tribunal stated that "it is not sufficient for a claimant to invoke contractual
rights that have allegedly been infringed to sustain a claim for a violation of the FET

standard."

(d) Balance of Interests

According to Respondent, the fourth limitation, i.e., a balance between the expectations
of the investor and the legitimate regulatory goals of the host State, ensures that a State is
not prevented from acting in the public interest, even if such conduct adversely affects
the operations of an investor.’*? Respondent cites the tribunal in Saluka v. Czech
Republic:

"In order to determine whether frustration of the foreign investor's
expectations was justified and reasonable, the host State's legitimate
right subsequently to regulate domestic matters in the public interest
must be taken into consideration as well. . . . The determination of a
breach of {the FET standard] by the Czech Republic therefore requires
a weighing of the Claimant's legitimate and reasonable expectations on
the one hand and the Respondent's legitimate regulatory interests on
the other."7*4

(e) The Investor's Conduct

. Finally, with regard to the last limitation, Respondent submits that the Tribunal must take

into consideration whether Claimant has satisfied the following three duties set out by
Professor Muchlinski:

"[A] duty to refrain from unconscionable conduct, a duty to engage in
the investment in light of an adequate knowledge of its risks, and a duty
to conduct its investment in a reasonable manner.""*°

ec. The Tribunal's Analysis

Article 3(2) of the Treaty provides that "[e]ach Party shall ensure fair and equitable
treatment in its own territory to investments.""*" The dispute between the Parties as to the
applicable FET standard relates primarily to the question whether this provision refers to
the minimum standard under customary international law or whether it rather contains an
autonomous standard, as it has been developed by case law on similar provisions.

i. The Minimum Standard under Customary International Law

The Tribunal will interpret the FET obligation of Respondent pursuant to Article 31(1) of
the Vienna Convention, i.e., "in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to
be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and
purpose."”*® First of all, the Tribunal notes that Article 3(2) of the Treaty does not contain
any (express) reference to the minimum standard or even to principles of international
law. Therefore, Respondent's interpretation would reflect the ordinary meaning of this
provision only if it can be established that the Contracting Parties considered that the
words "fair and equitable treatment" in themselves imply a reference to the minimum
standard.

In the Tribunal's view, there is no indication that this was indeed the case, in particular
taking into account that there are examples of FET provisions in which the Contracting
States expressly included a reference to the minimum standard. For example, Article
1105(1) of the NAFTA provides that "[e]ach party shall accord to investments of
investors of another Party treatment in accordance with international law, including fair

and equitable treatment and full protection and security."

The UNCTAD Report of 2007 on trends in investment rulemaking from 1995-2006, i.e.,
covering the time period in which the Australia-Pakistan BIT was concluded in 1998,
confirms that the level of protection agreed on by the various contracting States differed
during that time. The Report distinguishes between seven groups of FET standards: (i)
standards that do not make any reference to international law or any other criteria to
determine their content; (ii) standards that link fair and equitable treatment to a treatment

no less favorable than that accorded to the host State's own investors or investors of third
States; (iii) standards that combine FET with a duty to abstain from impairing the
investment through unreasonable or discriminatory measures; (iv) standards that link FET
to the principles of international law; (v) standards that likewise link FET to the principles
of international law but additionally include broad examples of which conduct qualifies
as a violation of the FET standard; (vi) standards that make FET contingent on the
domestic legislation of the host State; and (vii) standards that explicitly refer to the
minimum standard of customary international law.”°°

The Tribunal notes that Article 3(2) of the Treaty forms part of the first group of standards
that do not make any reference to international law or any criteria pursuant to which their
content shall be determined. While the UNCTAD Report states that the specific content
of these provisions remains open and has to be determined on a case-by-case basis, the
Tribunal is of the view that the comparison to the other groups of standards set out by the
Report demonstrates that contracting States that intended to limit the FET standard in
their treaty to the minimum standard had means to express such intent through clarifying
language. As a result, the Tribunal considers the absence of any reference to international
Jaw in Article 3(2) as a strong indication that the Contracting Parties did not intend to
limit the FET standard contained therein to the minimum standard.

In the Tribunal's view, this indication is not rebutted by the context and/or the object and
purpose of the Treaty as expressed in its Preamble. Respondent relies in particular on the
second recital pursuant to which "investment relations should be promoted and economic
co-operation strengthened in accordance with the internationally accepted principles of
mutual respect for sovereignty, equality, mutual benefit, non-discrimination and mutual
confidence."”®' However, the Tribunal does not agree with Respondent that this reference
to "internationally accepted principles" indicates an intent of the Contracting Parties to
limit the FET standard to the minimum standard.

First, most of the international principles referred to in the recital ("sovereignty, equality,
mutual benefit, non-discrimination and mutual confidence") do not concern what is
understood as the minimum standard under customary international law. Second, the
immediate context of Article 3(2) shows that, where the Contracting Parties indeed
intended to qualify an obligation, they did so through express language. Article 3(1),
which contains an obligation to encourage and promote investments, includes the
qualifier "in accordance with its laws and investment policies."””? Similarly, Article 3(3),

which sets out an obligation to accord protection and security, is qualified by the words

"subject to its laws."7°

The Tribunal therefore considers that the context and the object and purpose of the Treaty
in fact confirm that, in the absence of any qualifier in Article 3(2), there is no indication
that the Contracting Parties intended to limit the FET standard to the minimum standard
under customary international law, but it rather appears that they intended to agree on an
autonomous standard, as it has been developed in case law.

ii, The Autonomous FET Standard as Developed by Case Law

What, then, is the content of this autonomous FET standard? In the Tribunal's view, a
dominant principle of the FET standard is the protection of the investor's legitimate,
investment-backed expectations. The Parties both accept this obligation, although
Respondent emphasizes that the concept of legitimate expectations does not simply
correspond to any subjective hopes of the investor, but is rather qualified by objective
requirements, such as reasonableness, existence of specific representations made by the
State, causality for the investment decision, balance of interests and the investor's
conduct. Claimant agrees that expectations deserve protection only if they are reasonable
and does not expressly dispute the other qualifiers.

The Tribunal agrees with the Parties and the case law they rely on that the protection of
legitimate expectations is an important element of the FET standard. In the Tribunal's
view, the term "/egitimate" further embodies the concept that the expectations must be
reasonable, i.e., based on assurances that are attributable to Respondent and that an
investor acting reasonably would have relied on in making its investment decision. The
Tribunal further considers that the concept of "Jegitimate expectations" includes an
assessment of all circumstances of the individual case. As part of this analysis, the

   

Tribunal will take into account these further criteria set out by the Parties, such as (i)

whether Respondent's conduct was justified by a legitimate purpose or whether it was

rather arbitrary and/or discriminatory; (ii) whether Respondent accorded Claimant
procedural propriety and due process in the course of its decision-making process; and
(iii) whether Claimant conducted its investment in a reasonable manner.

In the following analysis of whether Article 3(2) has been breached, the Tribunal will first
determine whether and to what extent Respondent's actions created a legitimate
expectation on the part of Claimant that it would be entitled to mine Reko Diq. As a

second step, the Tribunal will assess whether the actions referred to in Claimant's 18
November 2014 letter breached such legitimate expectations.”*

Did Respondent Create a Legitimate Expectation That Claimant Would Be Entitled
to Mine Reko Diq?

a. Summary of Claimant's Position

Claimant submits that over a period of more than fifteen years, both Pakistan and
Balochistan repeatedly affirmed in contracts, laws, communications, official statements,
meetings, court submissions and court rulings that TCC — BHP's successor as of 2006 —
would receive a mining lease for Reko Dig, once TCC had successfully completed its
exploration and feasibility work and submitted an application and feasibility study

"795 Claimant contends that these

meeting "routine Government requirements.
affirmations that TCCA reasonably relied on when it invested more than US$ 240 million
in exploration and feasibility activities in the Reko Diq area created a legitimate
expectation that, after having successfully completed the work, it would be granted a

Mining Lease over Reko Diq.””°

Claimant refers to two "basic expectations" that it considers to be legitimate under the
circumstances:

(i) TCCA would have "security of tenure," meaning that if it did its work and
succeeded in proving a viable mine, it would be entitled to convert its exploration
license into a mining lease; and

(ii) both the GOB and the GOP would support and facilitate TCCA's investment.79”

Claimant claims that TCCA's expectations were fostered by three categories of
Government assurances: (i) Balochistan's specific representations in the CHEJVA and
related agreements; (ii) representations made through the federal and the provincial
regulatory framework; and (iii) specific assurances made by both Governments at
“critical junctures."”°8 Claimant claims that in its Closing Respondent did not dispute, as
a matter of law, that these three categories of assurances could give rise to legitimate
expectations.”?

i. Assurances Under the CHEJVA and Related Agreements

817. Claimant submits that Balochistan assured TCC under the CHEJVA, specifically its
Clause 11.8.2, that it had the "right to mine Reko Dig," once TCC had successfully
completed its exploration and development activities. Article 11.8.2 provides that TCC
"shall be entitled to convert the relevant [Exploration] Licence(s) held by it into Mining
[Leases] so as to give secure title over the required Mining Area," subject only to
"compliance with routine Government requirements."* According to Claimant, this
provision specifically provided for security of tenure.°”!

818. Claimant further submits that pursuant to Clauses 7.2(a), 10.3 and 24.6.3 of the CHEJVA,
Balochistan undertook to assist TCC by providing "appropriate administrative support"
in obtaining all requisite licenses and permits, including the mining lease, and performing
“all such acts as shall be reasonably required to give effect to the purposes of [the
CHEJVA]."8°2

819. According to Claimant, Balochistan repeatedly affirmed the validity of the CHEJVA and

the "finders-keepers" principle embodied in Clause 11.8.2. Claimant refers in particular
to:83

(i) the 2000 Addendum to the CHEJVA by which Balochistan "acknowledge[d] and
agree[d] that the Agreement is in full force and effect";

(ii) the 23 June 2000 Deed of Waiver in which Balochistan agreed that "all the
provisions of the [CHEJVA] remain in full force and effect";®>

(iii) the 2006 Novation Agreement in which Balochistan agreed that TCCA "shall enjoy
all rights and benefits accorded to BHP{] under the [CHE]JVA," and assured that
it would "observe the terms and conditions of the [CHE]JVA which are on its part
required to be observed" ;8

(iv) Balochistan's 2007 submissions to the Balochistan High Court in which it
"specifically denied that the CHE|[JVA] was in any manner illegal," and the
statement of Balochistan's Advocate General at the hearing before the Court that
"the Government of Balochistan has rightly entered into CHEJVA and it is in the

best interest of the people of Balochistan that [the Joint Venture's] project should

continue" 35°"

(v) the 26 June 2007 judgment of the Balochistan High Court, which states that "it can
be safely held that CHEJVA has been executed legally and the interest of the people
of Balochistan has been very well taken care of";5°8 and

(vi) Balochistan's 11 December 2010 submission to the Pakistan Supreme Court in
which it stated that the CHEJVA was "made in accordance with the existing laws /
rules" and "is not illegal."*°°

In Claimant's view, Balochistan thereby created the legitimate expectation that it would
"comply with its contractual obligation to grant TCC the Mining Lease" once TCC had
successfully completed the exploration program at Reko Diq.*!°

In reference to Respondent's argument that TCCA never received an "express assurance"
from the Government in relation to "the specific [mining area of] . . . over 99,453 square
kilometres containing at least 14 mineral deposits" that it applied for, Claimant
emphasizes that it never claimed an "automatic right" to mine a specific, predetermined
area; rather, it claims the right to receive a mining lease upon the submission of an
application meeting all applicable requirements, which includes the identification of the

area to be covered by the Mining Lease.*!!

Claimant also refers to Respondent's argument that the Mining Area identified in TCCP’s
Mining Lease Application “[did] not match the scope of [the] [Feasibility [S]tudy” and
that under Clause 11.8.1 of the CHEJVA, a Participating Party does not have a right to
apply for a mining lease in respect of "a greater land area than is necessary to encompass
all ore resources which may be properly mined as a single mining enterprise." Claimant
notes that Clause 11.8.1 of the CHEJVA expressly includes “any necessary plan or
facilities for the milling and treatment of ore and other appropriate infrastructure” in the
definition of the “Mining Area.” *'? In Claimant's view, the Mining Area identified in the
Feasibility Study and the Mining Lease Application was in full compliance with Clause
11.8.1, as it was large enough for TCCA to efficiently mine several deposits while using
the same infrastructure and processing facilities and yet even smaller than contemplated
by the CHEJVA.*!3

. In relation to Respondent's argument that TCCA failed to “fulfil the condition precedent

of acquiring the BDA’s interest’ before TCCP filed its Mining Lease Application,
Claimant submits that the language of the CHEJVA and the parties’ intent confirm that
the acquisition of the non-participating party’s interest (pursuant to the process set out in
Clause 11.6) is not a condition for the grant of a mining lease, but has to be completed
only before the start of any mining project. Claimant notes that Clause 11.4.2 of the
CHEJVA provides that “[w]here the BDA is a Non-participating Party, then subject both
to [TCCA] obtaining all routine Government approvals required and to compliance with
Clause 11.6, [TCCA] shall be entitled to undertake sole risk investment . . . in a mining

development within any of the relevant Prospecting Licences.”*'*

Claimant also refers to Respondent's argument that the CHEJVA and related agreements
were invalid under Pakistani law and claims that the question is not whether TCCA now
has a valid contractual right to mine, but rather whether TCCA had a legitimate
expectation of a right to mine; therefore, even if, contrary to Claimant's position, the
Supreme Court's judgment were authoritative as regards the contractual validity of the
CHEJVA, it would nevertheless be irrelevant to the analysis whether Respondent has
breached Article 3(2) of the Treaty. °!>

Claimant contends that acts or representations will give rise to liability under international
law even if they are “considered legally nonexistent or null and void or susceptible to
invalidation” as a matter of domestic law.*!® Claimant refers to the tribunal in
Kardassopoulos v. Georgia which found that, even though the joint venture agreement of
the claimant with a state-owned corporation was void ab initio (due to the fact that the
latter had exceeded its authority when it concluded the agreement), the respondent
"created a legitimate expectation for Claimant that his investment was, indeed, made in
accordance with Georgian law and, in the event of breach, would be entitled to treaty
protection," based on "[t]he assurances given to Claimant regarding the validity of the
JVA [that] were endorsed by the Government itself, and some of the most senior officials

of Georgia."*""

In reference to Pakistan's argument that “the mere frustration of contractual expectations
without something further will not automatically become a legitimate expectation
protected under fair and equitable treatment,” Claimant acknowledges that a breach of

contract does not always give rise to an FET breach but emphasizes that this is due to the
fact that a Treaty breach requires sovereign conduct; it does not preclude a contract from

being the foundation of legitimate expectations.*!*

827. Claimant also refers to Pakistan's allegation that "the first time that the contractual right
to a mining lease emerged" was in TCCs response to Balochistan’s Notice of Intent to
Reject, filed on 19 October 2011, and submits that: This right was expressly provided for
in the CHEJVA,; it had been confirmed by Balochistan when it relaxed the 1970 BM Rules
to provide the contractor the "absolute right" to a Mining Lease, subject only to routine
Government requirements (Clause 11.8.2); it was expressly reaffirmed when TCCA first
began investing in Pakistan in 2000; it formed a part of the due diligence when Barrick
and Antofagasta purchased TCCA in 2006; and TCCA again invoked its security of
tenure when the Steering Committee considered an alternative proposal from MCC.*!”
According to Claimant, TCCA's right to security of tenure was recognized by the
Governments given that they declined to consider MCC's proposal in order to avoid "legal
implications."*”° Claimant also submits that the MMDD acknowledged in the 24
December 2009 Working Paper for the Balochistan Cabinet that pursuant to the
CHEIVA, "if a suitable discovery [was] made[,] the area was to be converted into a

Mining Lease,"*"' and claims that the Planning Commission also recognized that the
"Government of Balochistan [was] legally bound to convert [TCC's] Exploration License

into long term renewable mining lease."*”

ii. Assurances in Provincial and Federal Law

828. Claimant submits that further assurances of Balochistan were contained in the 1994
Relaxations decision and the 2002 BM Rules.”

(a) The 1994 Relaxations

829. Claimant asserts that by granting the 1994 Relaxations, specifically the relaxation of the
“preferential right" provided for in rule 23 of the 1970 BMC Rules, Balochistan
undertook to grant TCC a mining lease. Claimant refers to BHP's request that "the

subjective discretion of the licensing authority . .. must be waived in favour of an absolute
right" of the license holder "to a M[ining] L[ease], provided they comply with routine

administrative _requirements."**4

Claimant notes that BHP emphasized _ that
"[i]nternational mining companies will view this aspect of a country's mining regulations
as one of the most important."**> Given that Balochistan granted the relaxations as
requested to enable BHP "to carry out its exploration work without any complication,"
Claimant claims that Balochistan also granted BHP the requested "absolute right" to a
Mining Lease subject only to “routine administrative requirements.”**> Claimant further
notes that in the context of its consent to the transfer of BHP's interest in the Joint Venture
to TCC in 2000, Balochistan expressly reaffirmed that the 1994 Relaxations "still h[e]ld
good."827

Claimant refers to Respondent's argument that the assurances provided to BHP in the
1994 Relaxations "were of no effect" after the 2002 BM Rules entered into force and that
the 1994 Relaxations could not have given rise to any legitimate expectations of TCCA
because, in particular, TCCA had provided "an express Undertaking to comply with the
regular procedures under the 2002 BM Rules."*** Claimant argues that, in the context of
the assessing Pakistan’s liability under Article 3(2) of the Treaty, it is irrelevant whether
the 2002 BM Rules replaced the 1994 Relaxations as a matter of Pakistani law. In
Claimant's view, the assurance provided in the 1994 Relaxations, i.e., that BHP would
receive a mining lease subject only to "routine administrative requirements," created
legitimate expectations on the part of BHP and later TCCA that it would be granted the
right to mine Reko Dig once it had successfully completed its exploration and feasibility
work. °?9

In any event, Claimant claims that, even under Pakistani law, the 1994 Relaxations were
not affected by the entry into force of the 2002 BM Rules. Claimant asserts that Pakistani
courts have repeatedly held that rights that were obtained under rules that were later
repealed are protected from impairment through the enactment of new rules.**°

As regards the 2006 Undertaking that Respondent relies on, Claimant notes that it merely
states that TCCA “shall abide by all other conditions of [the] National Mineral Policy
read with [the] Balochistan Mineral Rules, 2002 as approved / amended from time to

time,” but does not refer to the 1994 Relaxations. According to Claimant, the 2006
Undertaking therefore does not constitute a waiver of the assurances provided in the 1994

Relaxations.**!

(b) The 2002 BM Rules (Implementing the 1995 NMP)

Claimant submits that under the 2002 BM Rules, specifically its rule 48(1), Balochistan
further undertook that "where the holder of an exploration license . . . makes an
application for a mining lease . . . the licensing authority shall grant the mining lease"
subject only to certain requirements set out in rule 48 of the 2002 BM Rules that Claimant

claims to be "routine."**

In Claimant's view, this language, together with rule 45(1) which provides that a mining
lease grants the holder a right to mine, contradicts Respondent's contention that the 2002

BM Rules provided TCCA only with a "right to apply for a mining lease," but not with a

right to mine**

Claimant submits that the 2002 BM Rules reflected international standards and refers to
the foreword pursuant to which Balochistan intended to provide a "set of rules
internationally competitive" that would "attract the interest of investors on such matters
as transparency, criteria for dealing with applications and the grant of Licenses and
Leases, expeditious decision making process, security of tenure, provision of adequate

information on mineral titles, independent resolution mechanism etc." a4

Claimant further emphasizes that the 2002 BM Rules implemented the 1995 NMP, which
provided in Article 8.6.2 that "[t]he Licensing Authority shall not unreasonably refuse an
application for the grant of an ML. Where the Licensing Authority considers that the
applicant has satisfied the specified criteria for assessment and grant of an ML, the ML
will be granted."**

Claimant refers to rules 9(1) and 9(3)(a) of the 2002 BM Rules pursuant to which
Balochistan could conclude agreements which "make provision with respect to the grant,
renewal, cancellation or transfer of a mineral title" to a mining company.**° Claimant
states that these provisions implemented the policy directive of the 1995 NMP that

Provincial Governments could "enter into an agreement with an investor, within the
framework of the law," that covered "the right of the licensee to obtain a mining lease."*°"
In Claimant's view, the 2002 BM Rules therefore "expressly affirmed" that Balochistan's

contractual promise under Clause 11.8.2 of the CHEJVA was valid.***

Claimant claims that Pakistan conceded in its Closing that the 1995 NMP and the 2002
BM Rules were "key factual elements in assessing [TCCA's] legitimate expectations"*”
and notes that Respondent's witness Mr. Khokhar testified during the Hearing that the
1995 NMP was specifically intended to "attract private investment in the mineral sector

of Pakistan."**°

Claimant contends that, while Pakistan attempts to "manufacture an inconsistency"
between the CHEJVA and the 2002 BM Rules in terms of the Licensing Authority's
discretion and the resulting (lack of) security of tenure, the 2002 BM Rules and the 1995
NMP were, in fact, specifically intended to provide investors with security of tenure as
an improvement over the wide discretion in the 1970 BMC Rules.**! Claimant argues that
it was therefore legitimate for TCC to expect that Balochistan would not undermine the
goal of the regulatory reform, which made security of tenure "the premise for all future
investments," by exercising whatever discretion it retained under the 2002 BM Rules to
subvert security of tenure.*4? Claimant quotes its witness Ms. Boggs, who stated during
the Hearing that “[TCC] believed, to the extent the Government had that discretion, [that
it was] constrained by terms that are known in the mining business” and that the

requirements of rule 48 could all “be demonstrated objectively.”*

Referring to Respondent's argument that TCCA's conduct in the negotiation of the
Mineral Agreement demonstrates its awareness of the fact that it did not have a right to a
mining lease under the CHEJVA or the 2002 BM Rules, Claimant contends that, in these
negotiations, TCCA was not concerned with the scope of the Licensing Authority’s
discretion to grant or deny a Mining Lease Application. It had already received assurances
that the Mining Lease Application would be approved subject to routine Government
requirements.*“* According to Claimant, its principal concern in the negotiation of the
Mineral Agreement was rather the impact that future amendments to the 2002 BM Rules

could have on “the certainty and security of tenure required for investment and financing
on the scale of Reko Dig,” given that rule 9 of the 2002 BM Rules provided for the
precedence of the 2002 BM Rules over the terms of any mineral agreement.*4°

Claimant emphasizes that it did not attempt to exempt itself from the requirements of rule
48, as it believed that Balochistan would apply this rule "objectively, fairly and consistent
with its security-of-tenure assurances." It intended rather to ensure that the Mineral
Agreement could not be "negated by any changes to the BM Rules in the future."**°
Claimant submits that TCCP therefore proposed to assure legal certainty either by
including a statement in the Mineral Agreement that the agreement would prevail in case
of inconsistency, or by amending certain provisions of the 2002 BM Rules "to further

strengthen security of tenure."**7

Contrary to Respondent's arguments, Claimant stresses that its 2006 Undertaking did not
alter its expectations, as it was part of the novation of the CHEJVA, which Claimant
considers to be a single transaction in which the parties affirmed both the validity of the
CHEJVA and the applicability of the 2002 BM Rules. According to Claimant, this
demonstrates that the parties did not believe there was any inconsistency between the

two.848

Claimant contests Respondent's allegation that TCC's proposed amendments to the 2002
BM Rules violated the 2006 Undertaking and argues that while the 2002 BM Rules
expressly allowed mineral agreements, they made such agreements pointless given that
the Province could unilaterally override the agreement by amending the Rules. According
to Claimant, the proposed amendments were intended to "bring the Rules more closely in

line with their express purpose."*

Claimant also refers to Respondent's reliance on the 1995 NMP requirement that mineral
agreements be "within the framework of the law"®*° and notes that, while the 2013 NMP
still provides that “[t]he Provincial Governments may enter into an agreement with an
investor, within the framework of the law,” the new policy also states that “[t]he mineral

agreement would have an overriding effect in case anything contained therein is
inconsistent with any law or rules subsequently amended.”**! Claimant concludes that a
mineral agreement can therefore override certain aspects of the 2002 BM Rules and still

be "within the framework of the law." *°*

Claimant further refers to Respondent's argument that “the 2002 BM Rules confer a broad
discretion upon the Licensing Authority” and asserts that this argument is based on rule
48(3)(a)(vi) of the 2002 BM Rules, which provides that “[s]ubject to sub-rules (4) and
(5), amining lease shall not be granted... unless... it is in the interest of the development

of the mineral resources of Balochistan to grant the lease.”**

Claimant argues that, by entering into the CHEJVA and the 2006 Novation Agreement
and by agreeing that TCCA would receive a mining lease "subject only to routine
Government requirements," Balochistan already exercised any discretion it may have had
pursuant to the 2002 BM Rules. Claimant notes that rule 9(1) specifically authorizes the
GOB to “enter into an agreement .. . relating to a mineral title” with a party proposing
to carry on mineral operations “if the Government is satisfied that . . . the carrying on of
the undertaking in question is desirable in the interest of the development of the mineral
resources of Balochistan.”** In Claimant's view, Balochistan determined that any project
would be “in the interest of the development of the mineral resources of Balochistan"
when it entered into the 2006 Novation Agreement with TCCA.*>

In addition, Claimant asserts that Pakistan and Balochistan repeatedly assured TCCA that
the project was indeed "in the interest of the development of mineral resources of
Balochistan" and refers to the following occasions:**°

(i) January 2006: Pakistan's Prime Minister stated that Pakistan needs foreign
investment in order to develop the mining sector, which would boost economic
growth and exports of the country;®*”

(ii) 10 July 2007: Balochistan's Chief Minister stated that the Reko Diq project would
play an important role in the development of the Province; ***

(iii) 14 July 2007: The Board of Investment stated in a letter to TCC's CEO that it
"appreciates your endeavours and feels indebted to you for your contribution in the

development of Pakistan through your investment in 'Copper Mining";**?

(iv) 2007: Balochistan stated before the Balochistan High Court that the constitutional

petitions “wndermin{ed] the interest of the Province by [jleopardizing such a

profitable project of national importance" 3°

(v) 14 July 2010: The Chairman of the Board of Investment stated that he "appreciated
the work of [TCC] on producing employment to the locals and also . . . attract[ing]
more investment in mining of other natural resources in the remote province of
Pakistan";®°! and

(vi) 25 October 2010: The Chairman of the Board of Investment stated that "foreign
investors and companies are encouraged to invest in exploiting the riches of the

Balochistan province."*

Claimant also refers to the 31 December 2009 note to the Chief Secretary in which the
MMDD reported that TCC was providing "health, education, sanitation and drinking
water facilities to the residents of the nearby villages and communities" as well as
"training to their employees using latest scientific knowledge, technology, equipments
and computer softwares to build / enhance the capacity of their employees" and that its
project would provide "8000+ employment opportunities during construction phase
while during operation phase it will provide 3000+ direct and about 30,000 indirect

employment opportunities."°

Finally, Claimant claims that international law and Pakistani law did not permit the
Licensing Authority to exercise any remaining discretion in bad faith, in an arbitrary and
discriminatory manner, or without providing adequate reasoning. Nevertheless, Claimant
asserts that the Licensing Authority did not deny the Mining Lease Application because
it thought that TCCA's mining project would not be "in the interest of the development of
the mineral resources of Balochistan," but because it was implementing the decision of
the GOB to "oust" TCCA from Reko Diq.**

iii. Direct Affirmations by the Government

850. Claimant submits that Pakistan and Balochistan affirmed the undertakings they had given
in the CHEJVA, the 1995 NMP and the 2002 BM Rules on various occasions during the
time period in which TCC performed its exploration and feasibility work.**° Claimant

cites the following examples as "express affirmations

1, 866

2007: In its submissions to the Balochistan High Court, Balochistan argued that
TCC “is entitled to retain the benefit’ of its mineral discovery, because “if this was
not so [,] then no one would come forward to invest millions of dollars in

exploration/prospecting;”°""

26 June 2007: The judgment of the Balochistan High Court upheld the validity of
the CHEJVA, stating that mining “is a risky business and after exploration by a

party when the area is proved, then it becomes his vested right to do mining;”**

23 January 2009: Pakistan and Balochistan stated in a Working Paper of the
Steering Committee that "[u]nder the Balochistan Mineral Rules (BMR) 2002, the
license holder is legally entitled [to the] conversion of prospecting license into
mining lease, once the area is proved and certain laid down requirements under
the rules are fulfilled by the licensee. The project area of Reko Dig Copper Project
has been granted to TCC (Pvt) Ltd by GOB who carried out intensive exploration
work and has spent about US$ 46 million on the establishment of over 4.0 billion

tons of copper ore reserves";

23 November 2010: In its submission to the Supreme Court, Pakistan asserted that
“the ‘finders — keepers’ principle ... is fundamental for the development of the
mining industry and is recognized by the National Mineral Policy and by the 2002
BMC Rules.”8”

they intended TCC to mine Reko Digq. Claimant refers, inter alia, to:

Finance Secretary stated after the meeting, that he would extend "full assurance of
cooperation to the [TCC and Barrick delegation] for their success in [the] Reko Dig

Project.”*°°

853. In relation to Respondent's argument that the officials of the GOP exceeded their powers
when they provided assurances regarding Balochistan's disposal of mineral titles to TCC,
Claimant claims that Pakistan is liable for the conduct of all its organs and officials under
international law; thus, it is irrelevant for the purposes of determining Pakistan’s liability
under Article 3(2) of the Treaty whether these officials were authorized to provide such

assurances under domestic law.**!

854. Claimant emphasizes that, contrary to Respondent's allegations, TCC did not rely on
general statements, but rather on "specific representations made by high-level officials of
both Governments in face-to-face meetings with leaders of major international companies
on the verge of investing hundreds of millions of dollars." Claimant argues that such
meetings were not intended to discuss details, but rather an opportunity to receive
assurance directly from the Governments that they would provide the required support
for TCCA's project. Claimant further states that these representations were made at
"critical moments," i.e., prior to the initial investment decision and each further infusion
of capital, following rumors of a takeover and proposals of other investors like MCC and,
similarly, before the Feasibility Study was delivered and the Mining Lease Application
was filed.**?

855. Claimant claims that it was deliberately led to believe that the Governments were
supporting the proposed mining venture and refers to Chief Minister Raisani's assurance
that the press reports about the takeover decision were inaccurate even though he had
presided over the meeting of the Balochistan Cabinet in which this decision was taken.**?

856. In addition to these specific representations, Claimant argues that the fact that Balochistan
supported and facilitated the Joint Venture for many years gave rise to a legitimate
expectation that it would continue to do so and fulfill its contractual obligations. Claimant
refers in particular to Balochistan's approval of the shift in focus to the Western
Porphyries, which gave rise to a legitimate expectation that the Government would not
later deny the Mining Lease on the grounds that TCCA had done precisely what had been
approved.®*4

iv. TCCA Relied on These Assurances

857. Finally, Claimant submits that, in reliance on the assurances given by Pakistan and
Balochistan, TCCA spent more than US$ 240 million on the Reko Dig project and thereby
"transformed a barren strip of land into one of the world's largest copper-gold

 

deposits."*®> Claimant claims that it relied on the Governments’ assurances specifically

when making the following decisions:**°

(i) 2000 to 2005: investment of over US$ 23 million in the exploration of Reko Diq
and the preparation of a scoping and draft feasibility study on the Tanjeel deposit;**”

(ii) October 2002: entry into the Alliance Agreement with BHP in order to assume
BHP's obligations under the CHEJVA and to step into the Joint Venture;***

(iii) mid-2006 to end of 2007: investment of over US$ 45 million in expanded drilling
and work on the Scoping Study;**?

(iv) 2008 and 2009: investment of an additional US$ 150 million in work on the Pre-
Feasibility Study and the Feasibility Study for initial mine development at the
Western Porphyries and the Expansion Study for Tanjeel and further satellite
deposits;*”° and

(v) 2010: investment of an additional US$ 22 million in work to finalize the Feasibility

Study and the Expansion Study.**!

b. Summary of Respondent's Position

858. Respondent submits that no legitimate expectation of a "right to mine" Reko Dig could
arise from the so-called "assurances" and, in fact, any conduct of the Governments
because (i) Respondent cannot be bound by any alleged representations arising out of the
CHEJVA and related agreements; (ii) the CHEJVA does not confer a right to a mining
lease on Claimant; (iii) there were no representations reducing the "routine Government
requirements" referred to in the CHEJVA to "mere administrative niceties"; and (iv) none
of the alleged "assurances" could be construed as "trumping" the 2002 BM Rules.*”?

i. Respondent Cannot Be Bound by Expectations Arising Out of the
CHEJVA and Related Agreements

. Respondent submits that it was not a party to the CHEJVA, the 2000 Addendum or the

2006 Novation Agreement and refers to the Supreme Court's finding that the GOB was
also not a party to the CHEJVA, which was rather "made between BDA and BHP alone
for all practical purposes, and not between GO[B] through BDA and BHP."*? In
Respondent's view, it cannot be bound by an expectation that arises from an agreement
to which it was not a party; therefore, the CHEJVA and related agreements could not have
given rise to any legitimate expectations.***

Respondent further contends that pursuant to the Supreme Court judgment, the CHEJVA,
and consequently also the 2000 Addendum and the 2006 Novation Agreement, were
illegal and void ab initio, with the result that the Joint Venture ceased to exist and could
not be the holder of any rights under Exploration License EL-5. Respondent asserts that
the same applies to the 1994 Relaxations, which the Supreme Court held were illegal
under rule 98 of the 1970 BMC Rules.*”

Respondent refers to Claimant's argument that the Supreme Court's holding is irrelevant
in the context of the assessment whether the Governments’ assurances gave rise to
legitimate expectations. Respondent contests Claimant's submission that liability under
international law will arise even if the acts or representations are considered illegal as a
matter of domestic law, but acknowledges that in such cases liability may nevertheless
arise. Respondent notes that in the present case, it was the Supreme Court (and not a court
of first instance) which made the finding of voidness and illegality, and Claimant has not
raised a claim for denial of justice with regard to the substance of the decision.**°

ii. The CHEJVA Does Not Confer a Right to Mine on Claimant

Respondent contends that the CHEJVA and the 2006 Novation Agreement per se could
not give rise to any legitimate expectations and refers to the tribunal in Parkerings v.
Lithuania, which stated "contracts involve intrinsic expectations from each party that do
not amount to expectations as understood in international law" and to the tribunal in
Hamester v. Ghana, which held that "it is not sufficient for a claim to invoke contractual

rights that have allegedly been infringed to sustain a claim for a violation of the FET
standard."*°"

Respondent further argues that even if the CHEJVA and related agreements could be a
source of legitimate expectations, the only expectation that Claimant could have had in
this case was that it would need to fulfil "routine Government requirements" before it
would be granted a Mining Lease. According to Respondent, this is "an important caveat"
which precludes the agreements, without more, from generating a "legitimate
expectation" sufficient to found a breach of the FET obligation.***

Respondent notes that Claimant cannot point to any provision of the CHEJVA stipulating
that it would be granted a mining lease or that it would be entitled to mine 99.4 square
kilometers of Reko Diq.*” Respondent further argues that if the CHEJVA had in fact
given such a right, thereby effectively overriding and circumventing the provisions of the
licensing regime, it would have been invalid pursuant to section 23 of the Pakistan
Contract Act 1872.°°

Respondent also refers to Article 5.2 of the CHEJVA pursuant to which Claimant did not
even have the right to conduct exploration activities without obtaining a license from the
Licensing Authority; much less did it have the right to mine.””! Similarly, Respondent
argues that Article 11.8.2, which Claimant primarily relies on, did not entail a right to
mine and refers to the preamble to the CHEJVA in which the parties stated their intention
to "enter into a joint venture for the purpose of conducting exploration for and, if

warranted, developing any Mineral deposits within the Exploration Area."°°

Respondent submits that the text of Article 11.8.2, as well as the context in which it is
located, confirms that the CHEJVA granted only a right to apply for a mining lease,
subject to the satisfaction of "routine Government requirements," i.e., those under the
2002 BM Rules, and further contractual preconditions, but did not guarantee a "right to
mine."°® Respondent argues that Article 11.8.2 refers to the standing of the Joint Venture
or the sole Participating Party to apply for a mining lease, but does not contain a promise
by the BDA (or Balochistan) to grant a mining lease; in Respondent's view, it rather

clarifies "how the relations between the parties will operate in the event the Joint Venture

or a Participating Party elects to develop a mine."?*

Respondent claims that, contrary to Claimant's allegation, the word "routine" does not
only entail administrative tasks, but is rather meant to refer to "regularly followed
procedures," as defined in the Oxford English Dictionary. In Respondent's view, the term
demonstrates that Claimant would not receive any special or preferential treatment, but
would be subject to the regular procedures under the 2002 BM Rules, without any
variation or change.?°>

As to the context of Article 11.8.2, Respondent notes that Article 11 is entitled "Decision
as to Mine Development," and sets out the procedure for taking a decision to develop a
"Mining Area" in relation to a specific "Mineral deposit." Article 11.8.2 in turn refers to
a "secure title over the required Mining Area" and therefore limits the scope of the lease
that can be sought to a specific mineral deposit located within the identified "Mining
Area."*°® Respondent argues that Article 11.8.2 thus applies only to a mining lease in

respect of the "Mining Area," i.e., as defined and limited by the feasibility study.?”

Respondent contends that a mining lease cannot be validly sought if the procedure set out
in Article 11 has not been followed.*”* Further, any rights of a single Participating Party
under Article 11.8.2 are conditional upon compliance with Article 11.6, i.e., the
acquisition of the Non-participating Party's interest, before any mining lease application
can be filed.°

Respondent also refers to the broader context of the CHEJVA, i.e., its Articles 12, 17(a)
and 5.9, and clauses 5.2-5.4, 5.7 and 13.2-13.3, and argues that those provisions further
support Respondent's argument that the CHEJVA did not confer any right to receive a
mining lease on Claimant, even if the requirements of Article 11 had been met.?!°
According to Respondent, however, those requirements were not met in the present case,
as the condition precedent set out in Article 11.4.2 (acquisition of Balochistan's interest

by TCCP) was never satisfied so that any right under Article 11.8.2 never arose.°!!

. Respondent claims that the "routine Government requirements" referred to in Clause

11.8.2 of the CHEJVA are "entrenched" in the 2002 BM Rules, which Claimant
undertook to abide by in its 2006 Undertaking.®'* Respondent argues that pursuant to
tules 47 and 48, the Licensing Authority is obliged to reject mining lease applications
unless the application satisfies various objective (e.g., the failure to show that a mine
could be "profitably developed and operated" and the failure to address "value addition")
and subjective requirements (e.g., that the mining lease application is "satisfactory" and

"in the interest of the development of the mineral resources of Balochistan").°'

In addition, Respondent refers to rules 9(5) and (6) of the 2002 BM Rules, which provide:

5) Any provision contained in a mineral agreement which is

inconsistent with any provision of these rules or any other law shall, to

the extent of the inconsistency, be of no force or effect.

(6) Nothing contained in a mineral agreement shall be construed as

absolving any party thereto from complying with any requirement laid

down by law or from applying for, and obtaining, any licence, approval,

permission or other document required by law.?!+
Respondent submits that these provisions invalidate any agreement contrary to the 2002
BM Rules, a fact of which Claimant was or should have been aware, as it was part of the
legal framework in which Claimant was operating. Respondent concludes that, as a
consequence, the CHEJVA could not give rise to a legitimate expectation of a guaranteed
right to mine.?!>

iii. No Representations Were Made That Reduced "Routine Government
Requirements" in the CHEJVA to Mere Administrative Niceties

Respondent contends that, even though Claimant attempts to reduce "routine Government
requirements" to an "administrative rubber stamp," the following conduct of Claimant
illustrates that it was aware of the fact that any mining lease application would have to
comply with the 2002 BM Rules:?!¢

(i) Claimant attempted to obtain a guaranteed right to mine through a Mineral
Agreement, which would not have been necessary if it already had such a right

under the CHEJVA or if an application to obtain a mining lease under the 2002 BM
Rules were a mere formality;

Claimant's stated reasons for its desire to amend the 2002 BM Rules during the
Mineral Agreement negotiations included avoiding any "discretionary actions"
under the 2002 BM Rules, which demonstrates that it was aware that there were
discretionary and subjective elements in the 2002 BM Rules that could be used to
reject a mining lease application;?!”

Claimant gave the Undertaking to abide by the 2002 BM Rules "as
" which confirms that it regarded the 2002
BM Rules as one of the Government requirements to be complied with; and

approved/amended from time to time,

Claimant did not consider that it had a guaranteed "right to mine" under the
CHEJVA; otherwise, it would have referred to that right in the Mining Lease
Application.

875. Respondent further refers to rule 48(3) of the 2002 BM Rules, which provides:

“(a) A mining lease shall not be granted unless —

(i) the feasibility studies show that the mine can be profitably
developed;

(ii) the proposed plan for development and operation of the
mine and the programme of the mining operations of the
application will ensure the efficient, beneficial and timely use of
mineral resources;

(iii) the applicant in question has or can obtain the technical
and financial resources and experience to carry out mining
operations effectively;

(iv) the applicant is a fit and proper person to hold the lease;

(v) the proposals submitted with the application are
satisfactory;

(vi) it is in the interests of the development of the mineral
resources of Balochistan to grant the lease; and

(vii)a concrete proposal for value addition for the Ore to be
produced/exploited from the applicant’s mining ease within the
country is submitted, or if the facility is not available in the
province, the Ore could be taken out of the province with the prior
approval of the Provincial Government;

. In Respondent's view, Claimant was aware that a mining lease would not be granted

unless its application satisfied all of the requirements in rule 48(3). Respondent claims
that Claimant's witness Ms. Boggs accepted this during the Hearing, including that it was
legitimate for the GOB to desire local smelting/refining and that the Licensing Authority
was entitled to take the Governments’ value addition objectives into account when

deciding whether the Application was satisfactory.°!°

According to Respondent, rule 48(3) contains "significant, mandatory and in some
instances subjective Government requirements" to be satisfied before a mining lease can
be granted.°”? Respondent contends that even if the objective criteria were satisfied, the
Licensing Authority still had "a wide margin of discretion" under rule 48(3)(a)(vi) to deny
a mining lease which it considered not to be in the "interest" of Balochistan in terms of
"the development of its mineral resources." As a result, Respondent claims that an
applicant could not maintain that it had an unqualified "right" to receive an approval of

its application.°?!

Respondent asserts that TCCP acknowledged this discretion when, in the context of
negotiating the Mineral Agreement, it stated that "[t]he BMR include a number of powers
and discretions that are inconsistent with creating the certainty and security of tenure
required for investment and financing on the scale for Reko Dig" and therefore proposed
to amend the 2002 BM Rules.°

Respondent further contends that it is widely known that the 2002 BM Rules confer upon
the Licensing Authority broad discretion whether to grant or refuse a mining lease.
Respondent refers to the 2003 World Bank report on Pakistan's policy on the development
of its mineral sector in which it concluded that "provincial rules" such as the 2002 BM
Rules:

"include as a criteria [sic] for the grant of a mining lease that it must
be ‘in the best interest of the development of the mineral resources of
[the province] to grant the lease.’ This criterion introduces a
discretionary element into the procedure for granting mining rights
to an investor who has completed a successful exploration program. .

best interests of the province. That determination is essentially a
political one.”°”

880. Respondent claims that the 2002 BM Rules reflect the political and socio-economic
conditions prevailing in Pakistan and, specifically, Balochistan and argues that
Balochistan's power to regulate its economic life in the public interest is clearly expressed
in rule 48(3) aiming to enhance the "development of the mineral resources of Balochistan"

and to ensure "the efficient, beneficial and timely use of mineral resources."°**

881. Respondent also refers to its witness Mr. Khohkar who explained that:

"[t]he Licensing Authority's discretion under the BM Rules 2002 is
broader than that provided for under the Punjab Mining Rules. We
were conscious of the need to ensure that mineral development takes
place while keeping in view of [sic] unique socio-economic scenario of
Balochistan. A quick comparison of Article 48 in each of the Punjab
and Balochistan Rules makes it plain that the latter was crafted to
maintain greater regulatory discretion for the Balochistan Licensing
Authority."

882. Respondent contends that Claimant was aware of the applicable rules when it allegedly
invested in Balochistan and argues that it is irrelevant whether Claimant considers it
“unjust, unfair or inconvenient" that such discretion is included in the 2002 BM Rules.°7°
Respondent emphasizes that the Governments adopted the firm position in all of their
statements, and in particular in the Mineral Agreement negotiations, that the 2002 BM
Rules would apply in their entirety and that no exemptions would be granted to Claimant's

project.°”

883. Respondent submits that Claimant relies on the 1994 Relaxations to argue that it had a
guaranteed "right to mine," despite the fact that the 2002 BM Rules intentionally did not
provide for the power to relax the Rules which existed under rule 98 of the 1970 BMC
Rules.*”* Respondent claims that, apart from the fact that they were declared illegal by
the Supreme Court, the 1994 Relaxations were of no effect once the 2002 BM Rules had
entered into force and, in addition, Claimant provided its 2006 Undertaking to comply
with the regular procedures under the 2002 BM Rules.°”° Respondent also argues that by

providing the 2006 Undertaking, Claimant accepted that the Licensing Authority could
cancel any mineral title on the basis of any breach of conditions for the transfer of
Exploration License EL-5 from BHP to TCCA.?”

In any event, Respondent argues that the 1994 Relaxations do not support Claimant's
position as (a) the notification by which the relaxations were granted did not itself grant
BHP any right to convert its exploration license into a mining lease (Claimant's quotes
are rather derived from BHP’s request); (b) the notification did not "vitiate" the provisions
of the CHEJVA, which contains a provision dealing with changes in legislation in its
Article 17; (c) the 1994 Relaxations were no longer applicable under the 2002 BM Rules
given that only leases and licenses granted or renewed under the 1970 BMC Rules were
saved; and (d) the 1994 Relaxations did not benefit Claimant since they were specifically
granted to BHP and lapsed with the introduction of the 2002 BM Rules; in addition,
Claimant became a party to the CHEJVA (via the 2006 Novation Agreement) in the
knowledge that the grant of all mineral titles would take place pursuant to the 2002 BM

Rules and undertook to comply with them, without seeking any relaxations.*!

Finally, Respondent claims that Claimant concedes in its Reply, the Feasibility Study
“and elsewhere" that it only had a right to apply for a mining lease pursuant to the
CHEJVA, rather than a guaranteed "right to mine."°*? According to Respondent,
Claimant further conceded during the Hearing that it did not receive any assurance from
Respondent it would be exempted from the requirements of the 2002 BM Rules when
making its Mining Lease Application.?*

iv. No Purported "Assurance" Could Have Legitimately Been Construed as
Trumping the 2002 BM Rules

Respondent claims that Claimant seeks to establish that its alleged expectations in respect
of mining in the Reko Dig area "trumped" the routine, i.e., the usual, application of the
Government requirements in the 2002 BM Rules; nevertheless, Respondent maintains

that its actions did not give rise to a legitimate expectation of a guaranteed "right to

mine."°*4

Respondent refers to the "mandatory legislative status" of the requirements under the
2002 BM Rules and notes that pursuant to rule 9, not even a Mineral Agreement could
dispense with these requirements, making it "/egally impossible" to "override" the 2002
BM Rules. Therefore, Respondent argues that Claimant could not have legitimately relied
on purported assurances that these requirements would be waived in relation to Claimant's
project. In any event, Respondent emphasizes that it was under no obligation to conclude

a Mineral Agreement and that none was ever, in fact, concluded. 935

Respondent again quotes the World Bank report of 2003, which referred to a
"discretionary element" in the procedure for granting mining rights to an investor,”*° and
notes that this was a Joint Policy Note co-authored by the MPNR. In Respondent's view,
Claimant could not reasonably have held a legitimate expectation that satisfying these
requirements "would be a given" in light of this contrary representation from the
MPNR.??”

In light of the clear terms of the 2002 BM Rules and the Joint Policy Note of 2003,
Respondent claims that Mr. van Borries' expectation as expressed in his presentation to
" that "at the

  

the Supreme Court in 2011 in which he spoke of "a certain sense of securit
end of the day, if [they] were successful, [they] would have the certainty to be awarded
the right to shape a mining-processing business" is not realistic.”* Respondent also
argues that Mr. van Borries' position is contradicted by Claimant's stated objective during
the Mineral Agreement negotiations, i.e, "avoidance of damaging discretionary

actions."°?

In Respondent's view, Claimant therefore either failed to notice the obvious subjective
requirements in the 2002 BM Rules, which would result from a lack of due diligence, or
it knew the potential impact of those requirements and thus the unreasonableness of its

expectation.**°

With regard to Claimant's reliance on the 1995 NMP, which states that "[w]here the
Licensing Authority considers that the applicant has satisfied the specified criteria for
assessment and grant of an ML, the ML will be granted," Respondent argues that this
statement does not support Claimant's position on legitimate expectations, but rather
reiterates Respondent's point that there was no guaranteed "right to mine" because a
mining lease could only be granted after the Licensing Authority had determined whether
the criteria of rule 48(3) have been satisfied.°*!

Respondent also refers to Claimant's reliance on the fact that prior to the decision on the
Mining Lease Application, Balochistan took some regulatory steps, such as renewing
Exploration License EL-5. Respondent argues that such actions could not give rise to a
legitimate expectation that Claimant would also receive a mining lease, which would have

been an entirely different and much longer-lasting title than EL-5.°*

In relation to Claimant's reliance on "extended negotiations" with Respondent and
Balochistan regarding a Project/Shareholders Agreement and the Mineral Agreement,
Respondent emphasizes that those negotiations ultimately failed because the parties were
not able to agree on critical issues, such as value addition in the form of a smelter/refinery
within the country. In Respondent's view, the failure of the negotiations, which Claimant
had pursued in order to avoid having to submit a mining lease application, demonstrates
that Claimant never had a right to mine.°*

Respondent further refers to Claimant's reliance on Pakistan's and Balochistan's
"affirmations" made in the proceedings before the Balochistan High Court and the
Pakistan Supreme Court and contends that these do not represent or waive the
qualification contained in the CHEJVA or the conditions imposed by the 2002 BM
Rules.

In addition, Respondent submits that the officials of the GOP whose "assurances"
Claimant relies on had no power to give any assurances in relation to mineral titles, which
are within the competence of the Provincial Governments, and contends that Claimant
must have been aware of this. Respondent further argues that even if the officials had
power to intervene or opine on the grant of mineral titles, their statements do not contain

Paper of the Steering Committee, which Claimant relies on, does

state that "[the license holder is] legally entitled

 

[to the] conversion of prospecting license into mining lease," the same sentence qualifies the same statement by
adding "once the area is proved" and "certain laid down requirements under the rules are fulfilled by the licence."

a representation that Claimant would have a right to mine, as they were only "general
statements" encouraging Claimant to invest in Pakistan.°4°

Respondent also claims that there is a "Jack of specificity" in all of the assurances that
were allegedly given, as Claimant cannot point to any specific assurance or affirmation
that the subjective requirements in rule 48(3) of the 2002 BM Rules would not apply. In
Respondent's view, all of the alleged assurances and affirmations are general in nature
and "non-committal"; thus, it is "inconceivable" that Claimant would rely on them as the

basis of its "right to mine."**°

Respondent refers to the case of Noble Ventures Inc. v. Romania in which the tribunal
found that the claimant could not establish that Romania had breached the FET standard
under the applicable US-Romania BIT, as it was clear on the evidence that without the
satisfaction of key requirements, the failure of the claimant's project was "all too readily

foreseeable."°*"

In conclusion, Respondent argues that Claimant rather made its investment: (i) in
awareness of the terms of the 1995 NMP; (ii) knowing that the 2002 BM Rules, which
were adopted following the publication of the 1995 NMP, would be applicable to its
investment; (iii) on giving the 2006 Undertaking that it would comply with the 2002 BM
Rules "as approved/amended from time to time"; and (iv) knowing that BM Rule 48(3)
left to the Licensing Authority "some discretion and subjective latitude" in respect to its
power to grant or reject a mining lease application.*#*

ec. The Tribunal's Analysis

The Tribunal will now determine the scope of Claimant's legitimate expectations that will
form the basis of the subsequent analysis of whether such expectations were violated by
Respondent's conduct. Given that legitimate expectations may vary over time, the
Tribunal first has to define the relevant point in time for its analysis.

An investor's legitimate expectations have to be determined as of the date of the
investment decision. In the present case, the Tribunal considers the conclusion of the 2006
Novation Agreement by which Claimant, on 1 April 2006, replaced BHP as a party to,
and thereby acquired the rights and obligations under, the CHEJVA as the main
investment decision.

In principle, Respondent's conduct after 1 April 2006 would therefore be irrelevant
because it could not have influenced Claimant's decision to enter into the 2006 Novation
Agreement. However, in light of the fact that Claimant incurred the major part of its
exploration expenditures only after it had become party to the CHEJVA, the Tribunal
considers that Respondent's conduct in the years following the 2006 Novation Agreement
has to be taken into account as well — to the extent that it encouraged Claimant to continue
investing in the Reko Diq Project and thereby to repeatedly confirm its investment
decision.

Claimant claims that Respondent's conduct created a legitimate expectation that, after
having successfully completed the exploration work, Claimant would be granted a mining
lease over Reko Diq. More specifically, Claimant refers to the following two “basic

expectations": (i) "security of tenure," meaning that if it succeeded in proving a viable
mine, Claimant would be entitled to convert its exploration license into a mining lease;

and (ii) both the GOB and the GOP would support and facilitate its investment.°#

In support of this claim, Claimant relies on three different categories of assurances: (i)
the contractual framework contained in the CHEJVA and its related agreements; (ii) the
federal and provincial regulatory framework; and (iii) direct assurances made by
Government officials.” The Tribunal will follow this structure in its analysis of whether
Respondent indeed created legitimate expectations, in particular the two “basic
expectations" referred to by Claimant above.

At the outset, the Tribunal notes that, contrary to Respondent's argument, Claimant does
not claim that it had an "automatic right to mine," but rather that it legitimately expected
that it would be granted a mining lease upon the submission of an application that met all
"routine Government requirements." Therefore, the Tribunal will not analyze whether
there should have been such automatic right to mine, but only deal with Claimant's actual
allegation and in particular on the meaning of the term "routine Government
requirements."

i. The Contractual Framework for Claimant's Expectations

The first category of assurances that Claimant relies on is contained in the CHEJVA and
its related agreements, to which TCCA became a party by means of the 2006 Novation
Agreement. While the Tribunal is aware that the Supreme Court has declared that the
CHEJVA and its related agreements are null and void ab initio, the Tribunal considers
that this is not relevant to the question as to whether the conclusion and performance of

the CHEJVA gave rise to legitimate expectations under Article 3(2) of the Treaty.
Respondent acknowledges that acts or representations "may" give rise to liability under
international law "even if the acts or representations are considered legally non-existent
or null and void or susceptible to invalidation as a matter of domestic law."**' In light of
the fact that, up to early 2011, all parties involved in the conclusion and performance of
the CHEJVA acted on the assumption that it was valid and there was no indication that
the GOB thought otherwise, the Tribunal is of the view that the declaration of the
Supreme Court in 2013 cannot have any effect on Claimant's legitimate expectations in
2006.

906. Therefore, the Tribunal will now turn to Clause 11.8.2 of the CHEJVA and its reasonable
interpretation, while taking into account the negotiation history of the CHEJVA and the
events that were closely related to its conclusion. In light of its overarching significance
for Claimant's case, Clause 11.8.2 may first be quoted again:

"Where the Joint Venture or, pursuant to sub-clause 11.3.2, a
Participating Party elects to develop a mine then, subject only to
compliance with routine Government requirements, it shall be entitled
to convert the relevant Prospecting Licence(s) held by it into Mining
Licences so as to give secure title over the required Mining Area."***

907. The dispute between the Parties relates in particular to the meaning of the words "subject
only to compliance with routine Government requirements." In this regard, the Tribunal
considers it indicative that, in a letter of 16 September 1993 by which it sought relaxations
of the 1970 BMC Rules, BHP gave the following interpretation of this phrase:

"9. Application for Mining Leases

It is essential that the Joint Venture, or a sole 'Participating Party' under
Clause 11, is entitled to convert the relevant PL into a ML if it wishes
to develop a mine. Currently, the right of a holder of a PL to receive a
ML is described in Rule 23 as a ‘preferential right’ only. The subjective
discretion of the licensing authority here and under Rules 31(2), 38, 62
and 63 must be waived in favour of an absolute right of the Joint
Venture, or a sole ‘Participating Party’, to a ML, provided that they
comply with routine administrative requirements. Clause 11.8.2 of the
Agreement anticipates this right of transition.

International mining companies will view this aspect of a country's

mining regulations as one of the most important. The necessary rights
can be secured by appropriate Notified Orders.

... The unqualified discretion of the licensing authority to void a ML
application for failure to furnish evidence 'to the satisfaction of the
licensing authority’ must be removed in favour of defined requirements.

1953

908. In light of the fact that the relaxations that BHP sought by means of this letter were
granted by the GOB by simply reproducing the headings of BHP's request, including the
heading "9. Application for Mining Leases,"*™ the Tribunal is of the view that the 1994
Relaxations must be construed as giving effect to the points made in BHP's letter.
Likewise, it can be assumed that the interpretation given by BHP that Clause 11.8.2
"anticipates" the requested "absolute right" subject to compliance with "routine
administrative requirements" corresponded to the common understanding of the
contracting parties to the CHEJVA at the time with regard to the meaning of the disputed
phrase in Clause 11.8.2.

909. The Tribunal is aware of Respondent's argument that the 1994 Relaxations were not
validly granted because the requirements of rule 98 of the 1970 BMC Rules had not been
fulfilled, as declared by the Supreme Court in its 2013 judgment. While the ICC Tribunal
has taken a different view on the interpretation of rule 98 and consequently the validity
of the 1994 Relaxations, this Tribunal is of the view that it does not need to express an
opinion on their validity under Pakistani law. The Tribunal recalls its observation above
that, despite its potential illegality, the CHEJVA may give rise to legitimate expectations
because all parties acted on the assumption that it was valid and therefore performed it
for many years. Likewise, the GOB (at least) created the impression that the 1994
Relaxations had been validly granted and even confirmed in a letter dated 11 November
2000, issued in connection with its consent to BHP's transfer of its interest to TCCA, that
they "still h[elld good."°*>

910. In addition, the Tribunal is of the view that, for purposes of the FET obligation,
Respondent could in any event not rely on a failure on the part of the GOB to comply
with its own rules. As a result, the Tribunal considers that, irrespective whether they were
in fact validly granted under Pakistani law, the 1994 Relaxations could in any case inform
the scope of Claimant's legitimate expectations.

°53 Exhibit CE-187, p. 7.

°54 The Notification states: "In exercise of the powers confirmed by rule 98 of Mining Concession Rules 1970, the
Government of Balochistan is pleased to grant the following relaxations as a special case in fav
Company enabling the company to carry out its exploration work with out [sic] any complication:
Application for Mining Lease, 10. ... ." Cf, Exhibit CE-189.

. As to Respondent's further arguments that the 1994 Relaxations were in any event

superseded by the entry into force of the 2002 BM Rules (which did not contain an option
to relax the rules similar to that under the 1970 BMC Rules) and the 2006 Undertaking in
which Claimant undertook to abide by the 2002 BM Rules, the Tribunal is not convinced
that those events should have any effect on the relevance of the 1994 Relaxations for
Claimant's legitimate expectations. The 2002 BM Rules do not contain a provision
relating to the future status of relaxations that had previously been granted under the 1970
BMC Rules,?®° and the 2006 Undertaking also does not contain an indication that TCCA
thereby intended to waive its rights under the 1994 Relaxations.

It has to be noted that the 2006 Undertaking was given in the context of TCCA's becoming
party to the CHEJVA by means of the 2006 Novation Agreement. At that time, the main
focus of the parties was on the reaffirmation of the CHEJVA, and the GOB knew that it
was on that basis, especially the security of tenure it conferred, that Claimant was going
to raise money and invest in exploration; therefore, the 2006 Undertaking did not affect
Claimant's legitimate expectation.

It appears that Respondent's argument that the 1994 Relaxations ceased to have any effect
also does not correspond to the contemporaneous understanding of the GOB, given that
it stated in its submission to the Pakistan Supreme Court on 15 December 2010 that the
“enactment of Rules is within the legislative competence of the Government from securing
for the Province of Balochistan a better deal that [sic] one prescribed in the 1970 Rules
or the 2002 Rules."°°7

Therefore, the Tribunal considers that the 1994 Relaxations, granted as requested in
BHP's 16 September 1993 letter, support Claimant's understanding that Clause 11.8.2 was
intended to give BHP, and later TCCA, security of tenure in the form of a right to convert
its exploration license into a mining lease, provided that it would submit an application
meeting the routine requirements.

This understanding of Clause 11.8.2 is further confirmed by the submission of the GOB
to the Balochistan High Court in 2007 in which the GOB repeatedly emphasized that it
had secured the "best deal possible" for Balochistan that would allow the Province to
receive a 25% share in profits in addition to the royalty payments.”** In its 11 December

Rule 125 of the 2002 BM Rules provides only for the continued validity of licenses and leases that were granted,

renewed or saved under the 1970 BMC Rules (or any other law in force before the 2002 BM Rules), but does not
refer to relaxations granted under the 1970 BMC Rules. Exhibit RE-1, rule 125.

°57 Exhibit CE-107, pp. 11-12. Respondent does not contest Claimant's submission that, in this context, the
“enactment of Rules" refers to the 1994 Relaxations. See Reply, { 83.

2010 submission to the Supreme Court, the GOB emphasized that the 25% profit share
would come into play once the mining operations started, which would be the case once
the review of the Feasibility Study was complete and the mineral agreement was
executed.®°? In the Tribunal's view, the GOB thereby demonstrated that it considered it a
given that Claimant would be granted the mining lease that it required in order to proceed
to the mining of the explored area.

However, in light of the fact that Clause 11.8.2 conferred a right "subject to compliance
with routine Government requirements," the Tribunal considers that the scope of
Claimant's expectation cannot be evaluated without taking into account the regulatory
framework that shaped these requirements. This consideration therefore leads to the
second category of alleged assurances, i.e., the federal and provincial regulatory
framework as it was in place at the time Claimant made its investment.

ii. The Regulatory Framework for Claimant's Expectations

While the minerals that Claimant sought to exploit through its investment are under the
ownership of the Province of Balochistan, which therefore enacts the immediate
regulatory framework that the investment and the investor is subject to, the federal law,
the 1995 National Mineral Policy, sets out the overall directives on the regulation of the
mineral sector.

With regard to the application for a mining lease, the 1995 NMP provides in its Article
8.6.2 (in relevant part):

"The Licensing Authority shall not unreasonably refuse an application

for the grant of an ML. Where the Licensing Authority considers that
the applicant has satisfied the specified criteria for assessment and
grant of an ML, the ML will be granted."°°

The 2002 BM Rules through which the 1995 NMP was implemented in the territory of
Balochistan provide in their rule 48 (in relevant part):

"(1) Subject to these Rules, where the holder of exploration licence or
a mineral deposit retention licence, makes an application for a mining
lease in respect of —

(a) an area of land in, or which constitutes, the exploitation
area or, as the case may be, the retention area; and

(b) any mineral or group of minerals included in such
exploration licence or such mineral deposit retention licence, as

the case may be, the licensing authority shall grant the mining
lease.
L..]
(3) Subject to sub-rules (4) and (5), a mining lease shall not be
granted —
(a) unless —
(i) the feasibility studies show that the mine can be
profitably developed and operated;

(ii) the proposed plans for development and operation of
the mine and the programme of the mining operations of the
applicant will ensure the efficient, beneficial and timely use
of the mineral resources;
(iii) the applicant in question has or can obtain the
technical and financial resources and experience to carry
out mining operations effectively;
(iv) the applicant is a fit and proper person to hold the
lease;
(v) the proposals submitted with the application are
satisfactory; and
(vi) it is in the interest of the development of the mineral
resources of Balochistan to grant the lease;
(b) if at the time of the application the applicant in question is
in default."°°!

920. As of 1 October 2010, Rule 48(3)(a) was amended to include a new sub-clause (vii):°™
"(vii) a concrete proposal for value addition of the Ore to
be produced / exploited from the applicant's mining lease
within the country is submitted, or if the facility is not
available in the province, the Ore could be taken out of

province with the prior approval of the Provincial
Government."

921. The Tribunal notes that Article 8.6.2 of the 1995 NMP provides that, in case the applicant
satisfies the specified criteria, the application will be granted. Similarly, rule 48(1) of the
2002 BM Rules provides that, in case the applicant makes an application subject to the
Rules, the Licensing Authority shall grant the mining lease. This language indicates that
the Licensing Authority does not have any discretion, but is bound to grant a mining lease
if the applicant satisfies the criteria specified in the 2002 BM Rules.

. However, the Tribunal also notes that the substantive criteria to be met by the application

are spelled out in rule 48(3) of the 2002 BM Rules, which provides that the mining lease
shall not be granted unless all six criteria are satisfied. In addition, the criteria spelled out
in rule 48(3)(a)(v) and (vi), i.e., that the proposals submitted with the application have to
be satisfactory and that the mining lease has to be in the interest of the development of
the mineral resources of Balochistan, contain discretionary elements, which have to be
assessed by the Licensing Authority. The 1995 NMP states in this regard that the
Licensing Authority shall not unreasonably refuse an application and thereby also
recognizes a certain amount of discretion in the assessment of the application.

Claimant acknowledges that the "routine Government requirements" referred to in Clause
11.8.2 of the CHEJVA were shaped by the criteria set out in rule 48(3)(a) of the 2002 BM
Rules.*°? The GOB likewise made clear during the negotiations of the Mineral Agreement
that any application for a mining lease would be subject to these requirements. However,
the Tribunal considers that it was reasonable for Claimant to expect that the assessment
of these criteria would be made in light of the contractual agreement in the CHEJVA, in
particular its Clause 11.8.2, which provided Claimant with security of tenure, i.e., the
comfort that its application would be granted if it met all routine requirements.

In the Tribunal's view, the existence of discretionary elements as such does not come into
conflict with the expectation created under Clause 11.8.2 of the CHEJVA. In particular,
the Tribunal considers that the discretion of the Licensing Authority under rule
48(3)(a)(vi) of the 2002 BM Rules is not so broad as to make unreasonable an expectation
of security of tenure. Given the mandatory character of the 2002 BM Rules as provided
for in rules 9(5) and (6), the criteria set out in rule 48(3)(a) of the 2002 BM Rules would
prevail over any conflicting contractual criteria; however, this does not exclude that the
exercise of the Licensing Authority's discretion can be informed by the existence of such
contractual provisions.

In the present case, the Tribunal is of the view that there is no inconsistency between rule
48 of the 2002 BM Rules (implementing Article 8.6.2 of the 1995 NMP) and Clause
11.8.2 of the CHEJVA. Rules 9(1) and (3)(a) and (c) of the 2002 BM Rules
(implementing Articles 8.12.1 and 8.12.2 of the 1995 NMP) confirm that the Provincial
Government, in this case the GOB, may enter into contracts that contain provisions on
the grant of mineral titles and in particular the mining lease, such as Clause 11.8.2 of the
CHEJVA.

to submit an Application that met these criteria [under rule 48(3)(a) of the 2002 BM Rules]." Transcript (Day 3),

926. Article 8.12 of the 1995 NMP provides in relevant part:

"8.121 The Provincial Government may enter into an agreement
with an investor, within the framework of the law, to stabilize the terms
or to predetermine procedures with respect to certain matters relating
to the carrying out of operations under a license/lease, if government is
satisfied that ial foreign in in expl ion and mining
operations is likely to be made and it is desirable in the interest of the
development of mineral resources, to do so. [...]

 

8.12.2 The agreement may cover, for example, the right of the
licensee to obtain a mining lease, assignment rights ... ."°%*

927. Rule 9 of the 2002 BM Rules provides in relevant part:

"(1) The Government may, at the request of a person proposing to
carry on mineral operations, enter into an agreement, with that person
relating to a mineral title, not inconsistent with these Rules or any other
law, if the G is satisfied that ial foreign ii

is likely to be made in mineral operations and that the carrying on of
the undertaking in question is desirable in the interest of the
development of the mineral resources of Balochistan.[...]

 

(3) A mineral agreement may, in particular, make provision with
respect to all or any other following matters —

(a) _ the grant, renewal, cancellation or transfer of a mineral title;
L..]

(c) _ the formation of joint ventures;

[...]."9%

928. In light of these provisions, the Tribunal considers that Clause 11.8.2 of the CHEJVA
serves as a provision that specifies the procedure for granting a mineral lease to the Joint
Venture, or as the case may be, the sole Participating Party, as it was permitted and in
fact later specifically provided for in the 1995 NMP and the 2002 BM Rules. At this point,
the Tribunal also notes that both the 1995 NMP and the 2002 BM Rules state that
agreements such as the CHEJVA shall be entered only if the Provincial Government
considers it to be "in the interest of the development of [the] mineral resources" of the
province, i.e., they contain the same language that embodies the main discretionary

element of the Licensing Authority's decision on the grant of the mineral lease in rule
48(3)(a)(vi).

Therefore, the fact the GOB entered into the CHEJVA with BHP (and later into the 2006
Novation Agreement with TCCA) implies that the GOB at those points considered that it
was in the interest of the development of its mineral resources to have TCCA explore and
eventually exploit its mineral resources. In this context, the words "only" and "routine"
in Clause 11.8.2 indicate that they were intended to limit the Licensing Authority's
discretion because the assessment whether such collaboration would be in the interest of
the development of Balochistan's mineral resources had already been made by the GOB
when it decided to collaborate with BHP and later TCCA. In the Tribunal's view, this
consideration applies not only to the requirements provided for in the 1995 NMP and the
2002 BM Rules, which were not yet in force when the CHEJVA was concluded, but also
to the discretion granted to the Licensing Authority under the 1970 BMC Rules.

In the Tribunal's view, such an interpretation is not in conflict with the mandatory
character of the 2002 BM Rules as prescribed in rules 9(5) and (6). Apart from the above
quoted provisions in Article 8.12 of the 1995 NMP and in the very same rule 9 of the
2002 BM Rules, the Foreword of the 2002 BM Rules states that the rules were enacted
with the aim "to put in place a set of rules internationally competitive" and to "attract the
interest of the investors on such matters as ... criteria for dealing with applications and
the grant of Licences and Leases, ... security of tenure, and to equitably meet the
objectives of the investors as well as aspirations of the Government."®® Therefore, it was
apparently not the aim of the legislator to prevent agreements that would give investors
the comfort they required in order to invest considerable amounts of money in exploration
before being granted the mining lease that would secure their right to ultimately benefit
from the findings they had made through their expenditures.

The GOB's contemporaneous understanding of the regulatory framework is expressed in
its submission to the Balochistan High Court in 2007, in which the GOB stated:

"It seems that the Petitioners have not bothered to read the law and the
Rules because if they had they would not have made statements about
inviting bids after the copper/gold had been discovered as the
discoverer is entitled to retain the benefits thereof. It is submitted that
if this was not so then no one would come forward to invest millions of
dollar in exploration/prospecting when no benefit or advantage would
accrue to them."°°"

932. The GOB further stated in a Working Paper that was prepared for the second meeting of
the Steering Committee on 23 January 2009:

"Under the Balochistan Mining Rules (BMR) 2002, the license holder
is legally entitled for conversion of prospecting license into mining
lease, once the area is proved and certain laid down requirements
under the rules are fulfilled by the licensee."°*

933. The GOP appears to have shared this understanding, given that it stated in its 23
November 2010 submission to the Supreme Court:

"Mineral Exploration is a high risk capital investment with a success

ratio of less than 1:10. This is known as the ‘finders — keepers' principle

which is fundamental for the development of the mining industry and is

recognized by the National Mineral Policy and the 2002 BMC

Rules.°°

934. In the Tribunal’'s view, both Governments thereby acknowledged Claimant's need for

security of tenure in light of the "high risk capital investment" that was required for the
exploration operations and, more importantly, expressed the opinion that such security of
tenure was reflected in the 1995 NMP and the 2002 BM Rules.

935. In addition, the Tribunal notes that Claimant's witness Ms. Boggs testified in her written
witness statement that the requirements set out in rules 47 and 48 of the 2002 BM Rules
were "in line with standard industry practice, as reflected in contemporaneous mining
regulations."*”° She further stated:

"It would make no sense for a major international mining company to
undertake the substantial investments required to conduct exploration
and feasibility activities on this scale if the requirements for obtaining
the lease to actually mine the deposits were not clear and objective or
if the government could simply refuse to grant the mining lease even if
the company met those objective criteria."*"'

936. During the Hearing, Ms. Boggs qualified her initial statement to the extent that such
requirements were "in line with what [she] would expect to see in a jurisdiction such as
Pakistan that was in the process of developing a mining sector."*"* Nevertheless, Ms.
Boggs maintained that the requirements set out in rule 48(3)(a) of the 2002 BM Rules
were objective criteria and, in answer to the proposition that the terms "efficient,

beneficial and timely use of mineral resources" give rise to "judgmental, subjective
questions for the Licensing Authority to take a view on," she gave the following
explanation:

"No. I think in the mining world, these terms all have meaning, meaning
that can be demonstrated by very objective evidence. So, an efficient
Mine Development Plan, particularly one that you can demonstrate as
being developed in accordance with international standards. Efficient,
beneficial, and timely, those are criteria that you can establish by
objective evidence."*”*

. Specifically with regard to the terms "satisfactory" and "in the interest of the development

of the mineral resource of Balochistan," Ms. Boggs was asked whether these were
"matters on which reasonable people might disagree on the same set of facts." She
answered:

"No, I don't think I would agree on that. I think professionals in the
mining sector, people who understand what these terms mean, would
come to a general agreement around that. ... They [i.e., all mining
companies] don't have exactly the same view, but I think they are able
to demonstrate objectively that they've met these criteria."°"4

In the Tribunal's view, Ms. Boggs' testimony confirms that requirements such as the ones
set out in rules 47 and 48, and in particular in rule 48(3)(a), of the 2002 BM Rules were
not understood in the industry as providing for unrestrained discretion of the licensing
authorities, but rather they were attributed a certain meaning that allowed the mining
company to demonstrate the satisfaction of those requirements in an objectively
comprehensible manner. According to their Foreword, the 2002 BM Rules were
specifically intended to create an "internationally competitive" set of rules that was meant
to "attract the interest of the investors on such matters as transparency, criteria for
dealing with applications and the grant of Licenses and Leases, expeditious decision
making process, security of tenure, provision of adequate information on mineral titles,
independent resolution mechanism [illegible] and to equitably meet the objectives of the

investors as well as aspirations of the Government."°”°

Therefore, it is apparent that the criteria in rule 48(3)(a) were intended to have the
meaning attributed to such criteria according to the practice in the industry and thereby

also to constitute the "specified criteria for assessment and grant" of a mining lease that
the 1995 NMP had envisaged.°”®

In any event, Claimant reasonably expected that the Licensing Authority would comply
with the due process requirements set out in rule 48(4) and (5) of the 2002 BM Rules:

"(4) The licensing authority shall not refuse to grant a mining lease to
the holder of a mineral title referred to in sub-rule (1) —

(a) in accordance with sub-rule (3) (a), unless the licensing authority
has —

(i) _ by notice in writing informed the applicant, of its intended refusal
and the reasons therefor;

(ii) afforded the applicant an opportunity to make, within such
reasonable period as may be specified in the notice, representations in
relation to all matters relating to its intention and, if the applicant so
desires, to make proposals in relation to any such matters; and

(iii) taken any such representations into consideration.

L..]

(5) The licensing authority shall not refuse to grant a mining lease on
the ground that any proposals submitted with the application are
inadequate or unsatisfactory unless the licensing authority has, by
notice in writing, informed the applicant accordingly and afforded the
applicant a reasonable opportunity to modify those proposals."°""

. The Tribunal is of the view that, together with the manner in which matters had previously
been handled between Claimant and the Governments over the course of Claimant's
exploration activities at Reko Dig, these procedural requirements support Claimant's
expectation that any concerns of the Licensing Authority with regard to its Mining Lease
Application would be subject to a fair discussion between the parties. In particular,
Claimant reasonably expected that, in light of the security of tenure that had been
promised to Claimant by means of the CHEJVA, the Licensing Authority would (a) spell

 

out any concerns in a manner sufficiently clear for Claimant to be able to address them;
(b) give Claimant a fair opportunity to give explanations and/or make proposals in relation
to these concerns; and (c) take any such explanations and/or proposals into consideration

in making its decision on the Mining Lease Application.

In light of the above, the Tribunal is of the view that the discretionary elements contained
within the criteria in rule 48(3)(a) of the 2002 BM Rules do not exclude a legitimate
expectation on the part of Claimant; they rather shape the scope of such expectation to

the effect that Claimant could expect that the Licensing Authority's discretion was limited
as described above and that any remaining discretion would be exercised in a reasonable
manner. In addition, Claimant could expect that the Licensing Authority would take into
account the representations made by officials from both Governments in the relevant time
period, as they will be examined as part of the third category of assurances that Claimant
invokes.

iii. Expectations Based on Direct Assurances from Government Officials

Finally, the Tribunal will examine whether Claimant's expectations were further shaped
by direct assurances given by officials from the GOB and/or GOP, in particular as regards
the second "basic expectation" on which Claimant relies, i.e., that both Governments
would support and facilitate the investment.

With regard to the role of the GOB in the context of the Joint Venture, Clause 7.2(a) of
the CHEJVA provides that the GOB (through the BDA) shall provide at its own expense,
inter alia,

"appropriate administrative support as required for the obtaining of all
leases, licences, claims, permits or other authorities of any kind
whatsoever being necessary for the conduct of Joint Venture
Activities."°"*

Clause 5.7.1 of the CHEJVA further provides that the GOB (through the BDA), if directed
by the Manager of the Joint Venture, is responsible for making applications, inter alia,
for Mining Leases. Pursuant to Clause 5.7.2 of the CHEJVA, the GOB is further
responsible for

"liaising with relevant Provincial Government and local government
authorities and with affected landholders to ensure that good relations
are maintained between the Joint Venture and other persons during the
conduct of Joint Venture Activities."°”

. Finally, Clauses 24.6.2 and 24.6.3 of the CHEJVA provide:

"The Parties shall be just and faithful to one another and will not do or
omit to be done anything whereby the interests of the Joint Venture
contemplated herein as a whole are prejudiced.

°79 Exhibit CE-1, Clauses 5.7.1 and 5.7.2.

Each Party shall execute all necessary additional documents and do all
such acts as shall be reasonably required to give effect to the purposes
of this Agreement."*°

. Pursuant to these provisions, the GOB was under an obligation to provide administrative

support in procuring the required licenses and permits and to perform all reasonable acts
to give effect to the purposes of the CHEJVA and the interests of the Joint Venture as a
whole, i.e., to the exploration and exploitation of the mineral resources at Reko Dig. It is
undisputed between the Parties that the GOB did provide such support for, and thus
facilitated, Claimant's investment over a period of many years, including the time period
in which the 2006 Novation Agreement was signed. Specifically on the Operating
Committee, the GOB (through the BDA) encouraged Claimant to carry on its exploration
activities and to prepare a feasibility study for the Western Porphyries, as evidenced by
the following documents.

In its meeting on 15 July 2006, the Operating Meeting passed the resolution that "the pre-
feasibility studies as outlined in the work program should commence immediately and
that this program should include both the drill out of the Western Porphyries as well as
the drilling to upgrade the resources of the other significant ore bodies including the

hypogene copper ore body below the Tanjeel supergene deposit."**!

. During the meeting on 26 October 2007, both parties on the Operating Committee agreed:

"After new work and additional analysis the Tanjeel project found not
to be economic on its own.

Only additional work outside the Tanjeel area by the JV developed a
play for a larger scale project based on the newly discovered WP
deposits, which discoveries also transformed the Tanjeel ore deposits
to a potential economic and value adding activity.

L..]

In view of the potential for developing the project TCC and BDA agreed
that the JV through TCC as Manager should move immediately to
commence and complete feasibility study. In this connection TCC
presented a work plan and preliminary budget for full feasibility study
on option 72 kptd and parallel pre-feasibility study on expansion
options. The parties agreed the conceptual preliminary budget of US$
106.5 million TCC was authorized to make carry out the feasibility."

In this regard, it has to be noted that Respondent does not contest Claimant's submission
that "option 72 kptd" refers to the deposits at the Western Porphyries,”*? and thus that the
Operating Committee expressly authorized the preparation of a full feasibility study that
focused on the Western Porphyries and in parallel a pre-feasibility study focusing on
expansion options.

Beyond its actions on the Operating Committee, it is undisputed that the GOB twice
renewed Exploration License EL-5 in 2005 and in 2008, and in general granted all
required permits for the continuing exploration activities.°** The GOB further started to
negotiate with Claimant on the terms of the Mineral Agreement and the Project
Agreement.

Shortly after a Constitutional petition was filed seeking the invalidation of the CHEJVA,
the Operating Committee passed a resolution in its 24 February 2007 meeting that "both
parties of the joint venture have examined the Constitutional Petition in detail and have
come to the conclusion that the case is without any merit[,] that it will be defending the
challenge to their title to EL-5 and Tethyan is authorized to take steps as may be expedient
to defend the same."**

In its 2007 submission to the Balochistan High Court, the GOB defended the validity of
the CHEJVA and submitted that Claimant, being the one that discovered the copper and
gold deposits, "is entitled to retain the benefits thereof." The GOB further argued:

"[I]f this was not so then no one would come forward to invest millions
in exploration/prospecting when no benefit or advantage would accrue
to them. The benefits are earned by the Province of Balochistan are
[sic] through Royalty payments, licence fees and the extraordinary
benefit of retaining 25% of the profits.

The answering Respondents have been kept abreast of all relevant
developments and are constantly viewing that nothing is done which
will in any manner adversely affect the interest [of] the Province of
Balochistan."°8°

. The GOP, in its 23 November 2010 submission to the Supreme Court, likewise stated that

the "finders-keepers" principle is "fundamental for the development of the mining industry
and is recognized by the National Mineral Policy and by the 2002 BMC Rules."°°7

. Finally, Respondent does not contest the submission of Claimant's witnesses Mr. Luksic

and Ms. Boggs that various officials on the highest levels of both GOB and the GOP,
including the President and Prime Minister of Pakistan as well as the Chief Minister and
Chief Secretary of Balochistan, assured Claimant of their support for its investment.***
Respondent rather argues that those assurances were far too general and non-committal
as to constitute a specific representation capable of giving rise to a legitimate
expectation.”*? While this might be true if one were to look at some of the respective
statements in isolation, the Tribunal is of the view that, together with the GOB's conduct
both on the Operating Committee and in relation to the granting of permits required to
conduct the exploration activities as well as the Governments’ submissions in the High
Court and Supreme Court proceedings (up to early 2011), those assurances contributed
to the expectation that the Governments would support and facilitate Claimant's
investment.

In addition, such conduct created the impression that the Governments considered
Claimant's investment to be in the interest of the development of the mineral resources of
Balochistan so that the Licensing Authority would assess this element under rule
48(3)(a)(vi) of the 2002 BM Rules in a positive manner.

Finally, the Tribunal notes that the assurances given by officials from both the GOB and
the GOP continued when rumors started to emerge in 2010 that Balochistan was planning
its own project at Reko Diq.*”° Even though this occurred at a time when the Novation
Agreement had long been concluded, the Tribunal considers this conduct particularly
relevant because at that time, Claimant was still to finish its Feasibility Study, which
constitutes a significant part of the investment in light of the costs and efforts that were
continuously put into this Study until it was presented to the GOB in August 2010.

In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that by means of both the contractual and the regulatory
framework of Claimant's investment as well as the conduct of the GOB and the GOP
during the time period in which Claimant explored the area at Reko Diq, Respondent
created the legitimate expectation that Claimant would be entitled to a mining lease upon
submission of an application that met the routine requirements as set out in rule 48(3)(a)
of the 2002 BM Rules. Even though these requirements contained certain discretionary
elements, the Governments created the impression that such discretion had either already
been exercised or that it would be exercised in Claimant's favor because they recognized
the general principle that, after having invested millions of dollars into the exploration of

the area, Claimant should also be the one that would later reap the benefit of its
exploitation together with its Joint Venture partner. Finally, both the GOB and the GOP
repeatedly assured Claimant that they would support and facilitate Claimant's investment.

iv. Causality for Claimant's Investment Decision

As a final step, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that Claimant's legitimate
expectations are relevant only to the extent that they formed the basis for Claimant's
investment decision. In this regard, Respondent claims that Claimant itself did not believe
that it had security of tenure on the basis of the contractual and regulatory framework
because it sought to obtain such security of tenure through the Mineral Agreement
negotiations.**! Respondent refers in particular to the 27 October 2008 letter that Ms.
Boggs sent to Mr. Lehri, then Additional Chief Secretary of the GOB, in which TCCP.
proposed amendments to the 2002 BM Rules in order to avoid "damaging discretionary

actions."°”?

However, the Tribunal notes that Claimant argues that TCCP was not concerned with the
Licensing Authority's scope of discretion to grant TCCP's future mining lease application,
but rather with future amendments to the 2002 BM Rules that might change Claimant's
rights.°°? This argument is supported by the same 27 October 2008 letter that Respondent
relies on, given that Ms. Boggs in fact refers to the fact that "any future amendment of the
BMR would be mandatory and applicable to TCC notwithstanding any stability
provisions of the Mineral Agreement."*™ In its 18 August 2008 letter, by which TCCP
replied to the revised proposal for the Mineral Agreement that it had received from GOB
and the GOP, TCCP likewise stated that their "primary concern" was that agreements
creating the certainty and security of tenure required for the investment in, and financing
of, the Reko Dig project would be "negated by any changes to the BMR in the future" and
therefore, they proposed amendments to the 2002 BM Rules.°°

The Tribunal is further convinced by Claimant's explanation that they sought to correct a
"defect" in the 2002 BM Rules, which on the one hand intended to provide security of
tenure (as expressly stated in the Foreword) and provided for the possibility of entering
into mineral agreements, but on the other hand stipulated that any future amendment to
the Rules would prevail over the terms of a mineral agreement (rules 9(5) and (6)). In the

964.

Tribunal's view, this is supported by the fact that Pakistan identified and corrected this
"defect" in 2013 NMP, which provides in its Article 7.8.2:

"The Mineral Agreement would have an overriding effect in case

anything contained therein is inconsistent with any law or rules

subsequently amended."°*°
In light of the above, the Tribunal considers that Claimant's request for amendments to
the 2002 BM Rules does not exclude a finding that Claimant nevertheless relied on the
legitimate expectation that it benefitted from security of tenure as regards the granting of
the mining lease under the current contractual and regulatory framework. To the contrary,
it appears rather obvious to the Tribunal that Claimant's decision to invest more than US$
240 million and more than eight years of work in the exploration at Reko Diq®?”” was
based on the legitimate expectation that it would be granted the mining lease required to
benefit from its exploration results thereafter and that the Governments would support
and facilitate its investment.

Did Respondent Breach Its Obligation to Provide Fair and Equitable Treatment
under the Treaty?

a. Summary of Claimant's Position

Claimant claims that Respondent breached the FET obligation imposed by Article 3(2)
of the Treaty by: (i) denying the Mining Lease Application; (ii) developing and
implementing a plan to take over the Reko Diq project; and (iii) together with the
foregoing breaches, which also constitute independent violations, other Government
conduct relating to TCCA's investment, including the conduct of both Governments
during the Mineral Agreement negotiations and/or in the Pakistan Supreme Court
proceedings which, according to Claimant, constitutes an overall course of action that is
a composite breach of Article 3(2).°8

i. Pakistan Breached Article 3(2) by Denying TCC's Mining Lease
Application

Claimant contends that the Licensing Authority denied the Mining Lease on "spurious
and pretextual grounds" and argues that Pakistan cannot rely on new grounds that were
not specified in the Licensing Authority's Notice of Intent to Reject.°”

965. Claimant rejects Respondent's argument that only one of the grounds set out in the Notice

of Intent to Reject has to be reasonable in order for TCCA's claim to fail and argues that
the FET standard rather requires taking into account the State’s overall course of conduct
and thus assessing whether the Licensing Authority was acting as a "normal, independent,
good-faith regulator," i.e., in a way that TCCA should have expected, or instead in a

manner that was “arbitrary, partial, or aimed at achieving a particular end."'°°

966. Claimant further argues that States must act in a proportional manner, while

disproportionate action is held to be unfair and inequitable under international law.
Therefore, Claimant argues that even if some of the grounds for the denial of the Mining

Lease Application "were arguably applicable," the summary denial and thereby

"complete destruction" of TCC's investment was disproportionate in light of the

“extraordinary time, effort, expertise and capital TCC had devoted to Reko Dig." !°°!

(a) Pakistan's Conduct in Denying the Mining Lease Breached Basic
Notions of Fairness and Due Process

967. Claimant claims that Pakistan failed to treat TCC fairly and to observe its due process

rights because it (i) did not provide TCC with adequate notice and explanation of the
grounds for the rejection; (ii) failed to discuss with TCC the alleged concerns regarding
the Application with a view to enabling the project to go forward; and (iii) violated TCC’s
basic due process rights on appeal given that the hearing date of the appeal was advanced

on short notice and the decision was issued without appropriate reasoning. !°°?

968. Claimant submits that the FET standard as well as rules 48(4) and (5) of the 2002 BM

Rules and Pakistani law in general required the Licensing Authority to identify clearly all
the grounds for rejection and provide adequate reasoning explaining why TCC had failed
to meet each in the Notice of Intent to Reject. 10% In Claimant's view, the Notice of Intent
to Reject did not meet these requirements because: !0*

(i) _ the ten grounds for denial were "confusing and vague";

(ii) the reasoning was not "commensurate with the size of the investment, the amount at
stake, and the volume of material submitted in support" (e.g., no reference to any
section of the Feasibility Study); and

(iii) three of the grounds now raised by Respondent (i.e., the alleged failure to show that
the mining project was economically viable; the alleged security risks relating to
the slurry pipeline; and the alleged failure to prove the sufficiency of the water
source) were not contained in the Notice.

969. These shortcomings were compounded by the rejection decision of 15 November 2011,
which contained only a single sentence of reasoning (“[YJlour reply was found
unsatisfactory under Rules 10, 29(2)(c)(iii) 47, 48, 52 etc of Balochistan Mineral Rules
2002”) and did not refer at all to TCC’s Interim Response. !°°°

970. Claimant argues that, in particular, the "vague und overly broad allegations" contained
in the Notice of Intent to Reject and the mere reference to a variety of provisions of the
2002 BM Rules made it "difficult if not impossible" for TCC to respond to the stated
concerns and draft its appeal. !°°

971. Claimant further submits that the Licensing Authority did not really intend to consider
the Mining Lease Application fairly because it refused to meet with TCC and to discuss
its concerns regarding the Application during the months preceding the denial, even
though the MMDD (i.e., the Licensing Authority) was the GOB's representative on the
Operating Committee. !°°’ Claimant notes that neither the Supreme Court nor the 2002
BM Rules precluded the Licensing Authority from discussing the grounds of denial with
TCC and contends that Respondent's witness Mr. Khokhar acknowledged during the
Hearing that the Licensing Authority can provide clarification if the grounds for denial
are unclear. 10

972. Claimant further asserts that the "flaws of the denial process" were compounded by the

following events during the appeal process: !°

(i) on the instructions of the Pakistan Supreme Court, the hearing date for TCC’s
appeal was advanced on two days’ notice (to 2/3 March 2012 from 12 March 2012),

issue; following the Notice, the Licensing Authority refused to meet with TCC, despite TCC's repeated requests

as a result of which TCCP's senior counsel could not be present during the hearing
and TCCP did not have an appropriate opportunity to respond to the submission
filed by the Licensing Authority on 22 February 2012;!0!°

(ii) on 3 March 2012, TCCP’s counsel was not allowed to conclude his arguments
because the Secretary of the MMDD announced that he had to leave to travel
abroad; !0!!

(iii) as instructed by the Supreme Court, the Secretary of the MMDD rendered his
decision immediately after the conclusion of the hearing on 3 March 2012;

(iv) the decision was not communicated directly to TCCP, but TCCP’s counsel learned
of the rejection from the media and had to request a copy of the written decision at
the next session of the Pakistan Supreme Court on 5 March 2012; and

(v) the decision’s reasoning was contained in a single conclusory paragraph, which
stated that "the decision of the Licensing Authority to reject the Mining Lease
application of the TCCP, is up-held as reasons of declining mining lease were duly
examined by the concerned mines committee, being consonant with settled

law/prevailing rules, therefore, no interference is called for.”'°'

In relation to Pakistan's argument that Claimant did not raise any lack of due process
complaints in the Supreme Court proceedings, Claimant emphasizes that this Tribunal
has exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether the conduct of the MMDD violated the
Treaty and that the ICC Tribunal has exclusive jurisdiction to decide whether the same
conduct violated the CHEJVA. Claimant argues that there is no requirement that local
remedies have to be exhausted and notes that the Supreme Court did not act as appellate
authority for the MMDD.!°!

(b) The Grounds Stated in the Notice of Intent to Reject Provide No
Rational Basis for Denial of the Mining Lease Application

Claimant claims that the grounds of rejection stated in the Notice of Intent to Reject were
"baseless and arbitrary" and cites as an example the Fourth Ground, i.e., that no
exploration had taken place in Reko Dig in the past seventeen years, despite the fact that
Balochistan as TCC's joint venture partner had participated in all important decisions
regarding the exploration work and had received quarterly reports on the progress of the

exploration activities and an 18,000-page Feasibility Study.!°'* Claimant notes that
Balochistan itself stated before the Balochistan High Court in 2007 that (i) "BHP carried
out reconnaissance and detailed work upto [sic] 1999"; (ii) "TCC continued the work and
carried out extensive exploration activities at Reko Dig"; and (iii) following its
acquisition by Barrick and Antofagasta in 2006, TCC "started a very huge advanced

drilling and exploration programme at Reko Dig."

975. Claimant also refers to the First Ground, i.e., that TCCP was not incorporated in Pakistan,
and notes that TCCP’s certificate of incorporation was attached to the Application and

the Licensing Authority thus must have been aware of TCCP's valid registration. !°!

976. Claimant claims that the other grounds for denial are likewise not sufficient to justify the
decision of the Licensing Authority to deprive Claimant of its right to mine Reko Diq and
groups them into three sets: (i) TCCP held only 75%, rather than 100%, of the interest in
Exploration License EL-5 and thus could not apply for a Mining Lease; (ii) the proposed
Mining Lease Area included deposits and ore bodies that were not covered by the
Feasibility Study; and (iii) TCC’s planned project did not provide for smelting or

refining. !°!7

(i) | TCC Was a Proper Applicant for the Mining Lease

977. With regard to the first set of grounds set out in the Notice of Intent to Reject, i.e., that
TCCP was “not competent to make application for grant of Mining lease,” because “the
applicant alone was not allottee of exploration license,’'®'® Claimant refers to
Respondent's argument that pursuant to rule 48(2)(a) of the 2002 BM Rules, TCCP could
apply for a Mining Lease only in conjunction with its Joint Venture partner or after buying
out its partner's interest.!°!? Claimant notes that rule 48(2)(a) prohibits the Licensing
Authority from granting a mining lease where “any person other than the applicant holds
any exploration license conferring an exclusive right to carry on exploration operations”
and argues that Balochistan never had an exclusive right to exploration, as this right was

for the mining lease. '°?!

978. Claimant also notes that pursuant to rule 47(1) which requires that an applicant be a "body
corporate" under Pakistani law, the unincorporated Joint Venture could not have
submitted the Application as only TCCP was a Pakistani corporation, and further claims
that it was agreed in the CHEJVA that TCC alone would be able to apply for the Mining

Lease in case Balochistan decided not to participate in the mining venture. !°??

979. Finally, Claimant claims that it would be "manifestly unfair" if TCCP were required to
buy out Balochistan's interest before being eligible to file the Application on its own,
given that it was Balochistan which refused to engage in negotiations regarding the
transfer of its interest, even though it was required to do so under the CHEJVA.'°

(ii) The Scope of the Feasibility Study and the Mining Lease Area
Complied with the Applicable Rules

980. In relation to the second set of grounds set out in the Notice of Intent to Reject,!°*
Claimant refers to Pakistan's argument that the Application did not comply with rules 47
and 48 because the requested Mining Area did not cover only deposits H14 and H15, for
which a feasibility study had been submitted, but also several other deposits and ore

bodies that were not included in the Feasibility Study’s initial mine development. !°7>

981. Claimant argues that TCC was not required under the 2002 BM Rules or the CHEJVA,

nor did it undertake, to conduct a "complete feasibility" study of all mineral deposits

within the Mining Area.'

982. Claimant claims that pursuant to rules 47(2)(c) and 48(1), a mining lease application is
made “in respect of an area of land,” not exceeding 100 square kilometers, and must
“identify the mineral or group of minerals in respect of which the lease is sought.” In
Claimant's view, these requirements were fully complied with as TCCP requested a

Mining Area of 99.473 square kilometers and identified copper and gold as the minerals

for which it sought the mining lease. !°””

With regard to the scope of the Feasibility Study, Claimant refers to rule 47(2)(f), which
provides that the feasibility study shall include “detailed plans for [the] development and
operation of the mine and the programme of proposed mining operations," and rule
48(3)(a)(i), which requires the feasibility study to “show that the mine can be profitably
developed and operated.” '°?8 Claimant emphasizes that those provisions do not limit the
Mining Area to a single deposit and notes that Clause 11.8.1 of the CHEJVA also refers
to "all ore resources which may be properly mined as a single mining enterprise" and
submits that a "mining enterprise" usually includes several deposits.!°”? Therefore,
Claimant argues that the “mining operation” set out in the Feasibility Study was the initial

mine development comprising H14 and H15.'°°

Claimant further contends that the BM Rules accord with industry practice regarding
mine development: It is standard industry practice for mining companies to start a project
with an initial mining operation and then use the revenues from that development to
finance future expansions in order to increase the profitability of the project at economies
of scale derived from additional volume. !%! According to Claimant, it is also standard
industry practice to prepare a feasibility study for initial mine development (the "base
case") and then prepare additional feasibility studies if a decision is made to proceed with
mine expansion, as TCC had done in preparing, with the consent and approval of its Joint
Venture partner, a pre-feasibility study for an expansion in the present case.!°?? Claimant
contends that, consistent with this practice, the Feasibility Study demonstrated, through
the use of base case focused on the Western Porphyries, that mining operations at Reko

Diq would be both technically viable and profitable. '**

Claimant emphasizes that without this phased development, mining companies would
have to waste their resources on feasibility studies for secondary and tertiary deposits,
which would lead to prohibitive costs and also significant delays in the development of

Pakistan's mineral resources and limit exploration.'°*4 According to Claimant, this is also
reflected in the 2002 BM Rules, specifically in rules 45(1)(b) and 56(1)(a) pursuant to
which the mining lease holder may carry out “exploration operations” within the mining
area (in addition to the “mining operations”) and must provide periodic summaries of that
exploration work. !°7>

With regard to Pakistan's reliance on the Joint Venture's request for a second renewal of
EL-5 pursuant to rule 29(2)(c)(iii), in which it was stated that the extension was needed
to complete a “full feasibility study” in order to “tie together all the deposits, which are
spread over a large area of EL-5,”'°® and its contention that Balochistan understood this
statement to be an undertaking by TCC to prepare a feasibility study covering all deposits
and ore bodies within the EL-5 area, Claimant stresses that TCC and Balochistan decided
at the 26 October 2007 OC Meeting that “the JV through TCC as Manager” should
prepare a “full feasibility study on option 72 ktpd,” i.e., the Western Porphyries, and

“parallel pre-feasibility study on the expansion options.”!"

Claimant submits that the 31 December 2009 memo to the Chief Secretary confirms that
Balochistan's MMDD understood that TCC would "develop both 'Tanjeel' (H4) and
western porphyry (H-14 and H-15) deposits" and would do so in a phased manner
whereby TCC would "produce 110,000 tons of ore and 2000 tons of concentrate per day
at the initial stage and .. . increase it to the maximum of 220,000 tons of ore and 4000
tons of concentrate per day at a later stage."'°?* According to Claimant, the Feasibility
Study presented to Balochistan's MMDD on 25 August 2010 also makes clear that it
covers "an initial mining project designed to account for future expansion projects." !°
Claimant argues that the Governments therefore cannot fault TCC for doing what was
agreed. !04°

Finally, Claimant argues that in relation to its own Reko Diq project, Balochistan: (a)
copied TCC’s proposed Mining Lease Area — coordinate by coordinate; (b) did not
perform any feasibility work of its own that would cover all the deposits and ore bodies
within the Mining Area; and (c) also considered a phased development of its mining

project, which would have started at the Tanjeel deposit and then have expanded to the
Western Porphyries and other ore bodies. !*!

(iii) ~ZTCCP Was Not Required to Provide for Smelting or Refining

989. With regard to the third set of grounds set out in the Notice of Intent to Reject, i.e., that

the Feasibility Study “is silent about the processing, smelting and refining of the

> 1042

metals/minerals to be extracted from the mining area, Claimant notes that Chapter 6

of the Feasibility Study, entitled “Metallurgy and Process Development,” and also several
other chapters deal with, or relate to, the processing of the mined ore into concentrate.
Claimant claims that TCC was not required to address smelting or refining of the

extracted minerals in its Feasibility Study or to actually construct such a smelter and
refinery. !°
990. Referring to Pakistan's argument that Claimant's failure to address the “Governments’

desire for a smelter/refinery” in the Feasibility Study violated the “value addition”

requirements in rules 47(2)(n) and 48(3)(a)(vii), Claimant notes that the “value addition”
requirement was added to the 2002 BM Rules on 1 October 2010, i.e., after TCC had
submitted the Feasibility Study to Balochistan. Claimant further claims that, in any event,
the Feasibility Study met the “value addition” requirement and refers to its witnesses Mr.

Livesey and Ms. Boggs, who testified during the Hearing that the transformation of the

w1044

ore into concentrate is in fact "the most important link of the value chain, as well as

to Respondent's witness Mr. Khokhar, who agreed that treatment of the ore creates value

addition.

991. Claimant points out that on 5 August 2009, TCC provided Balochistan with a detailed
study on the construction of a smelter at Reko Dig, which was prepared by TCC “in light
of the results of its current feasibility studies” and concluded that a smelter would not be

you have immediately added value to the ore by creating the concentrate. ...In the case of this porphyry system,

economically feasible. At the same time, Claimant notes that it offered to provide an
amount of up to US$ 1 million to assist Balochistan in preparing its own smelter

feasibility study.!°

992. In relation to Respondent's argument that it was within the Licensing Authority's
discretion to impose the obligation to construct a smelter on TCC, Claimant argues that
if this were the case, Balochistan could deny the mining lease on the sole ground that
TCC was not willing to spend a billion dollars on loss-making facilities, which do not
even form part of the industry sector in which TCC’s parent companies are experienced.
In Claimant's view, such an exercise of discretion would not only be "wholly arbitrary,"
but would also contradict the purpose of rules 47 and 48, i.e., to ensure that mining
operations are profitable and efficient, and further would violate Clause 11.8.2 of the
CHEJVA, since the construction of a smelter is not a routine requirement. 1047

993. As to Pakistan's argument that TCC's Feasibility Study should have discussed allocating
ore for the Government's planned smelter, Claimant contends that besides there being no
requirement under the 2002 BM Rules to do so, Balochistan never responded to TCC's
offer on 5 October 2010 to provide concentrate to a Government smelter at internationally

accepted commercial terms. !*

(c) Pakistan's New Grounds Are Irrelevant and Without Merit

994. Claimant submits that the three additional grounds raised by Pakistan in these
proceedings, i.e., that the Project was not economically viable, that the proposed slurry
pipeline was infeasible, and that the water supply was insufficient, are irrelevant to the
Tribunal’s evaluation of the Licensing Authority’s rejection of the Mining Lease
Application, as they were not raised in the Notice of Intent to Reject or at any other
occasion prior to the rejection. In any event, Claimant contends that those grounds are

also without merit. !°

(i) | The Proposed Project Was Economically Viable

995. In relation to Respondent's contention that the Feasibility Study failed to show that “the
mine can be profitably developed and operated” as required under rule 48(3)(a)(i),
Claimant refers to the Feasibility Study stating that “given its strong economic results,
and its strategic fit for the owners, it is recommended that the project advances to the

commitment phase” and to its witness Mr. Williams’ testimony that "a major mining
house is not going to put a feasibility study out if they don't believe the project is

economic." 10°

996. Claimant rejects Pakistan's assertion that the 10% discount rate used for the “base case”
in the Feasibility Study was too low “in this sort of part of the world” and claims that the
discount rate was selected by the highly experienced mining industry professionals on
TCC's Board of Directors, most of whom also served on the boards of Barrick Gold or
Antofagasta who were planning to contribute to the project US$ 1.5 billion of their own

funds as equity. !°>!

997. Claimant also argues that the IRR of 12.3% in the base case scenario was not “worryingly
low” as alleged by Respondent, since Barrick and Antofagasta did not require a
particularly high rate of return, given their very low cost of capital and easy access to debt
capital as a result of long track records in conducting successful mining ventures. !°°?

Claimant emphasizes that the project was highly sensitive to metals prices and refers to

the statement in the Feasibility Study that "there is significant upside considering current

trend on metal prices," which would have resulted in a considerably higher IRR at the
time the Application was rejected. !°?

998. With regard to the tax regime, Claimant asserts that it was reasonable to assume that the
project would be granted EPZ status for at least part of the project life, given that (a) this
status has been regularly granted to major investments in the mining sector, including the
mining projects at Saindak and Duddar in Balochistan and, in 2002, TCC’s own Tanjeel
project; and (b) TCC expected to have Balochistan's support in the negotiations with the
GOP once the Mining Lease was granted, as this would have been in Balochistan's own
interest. !°4 In any event, Claimant claims that the project would have remained profitable
even without EPZ status and cites the Feasibility Study, which noted that “even in the

you took today's long-term metal price predictions over the ones we put into the study here, the IRR would be
virtually double what it is in this study." Transcript (Day 4), p. 1094 lines 16-22. Mr. Livesey further stated that
"if you were to take today's prices on copper and gold, you would actually be off the chart ... and your IRR would
be somewhere close to 20 percent." Transcript (Day 5), p. 1415 lines 16-19. Claimant further contends that IRR
and Net Present Value (NPV) are generally not considered to be useful measures for a long-term project (in this
case, 56 years) and refers to its witness Mr. Luksic testifying that the expansions of a mine, which were not taken
into account in the Feasibility Study, tended to produce even more substantial returns than the starter project.

case that TCC is not granted certain tax incentives requested, the project still show

attractive economic results in the Normal tax regime.”!°>

In relation to the royalty rate, Claimant states that TCC assumed a 2% rate because, as
explained in the Feasibility Study, the increase to a 5% rate adopted in July 2009 had not
yet entered into force and there were still ongoing negotiations regarding the royalty rate.
In addition, Claimant refers to its witness Mr. Livesey who stated that, while a 5% royalty
rate would have had a “‘substantial impact” on the project, it would not have resulted in

negative cash flows. !°°

1000. Claimant further rejects Respondent's allegation that TCC would not have been able to

obtain third-party funding for the project and notes that TCC’s owners are "two of the

world's leading mining companies," which have access to substantial debt capital.
Claimant submits that, while it expected the Governments to resume negotiations once
the mining lease was granted and ultimately to enter into a Mineral Agreement, the project
could also potentially have been financed without a Mineral Agreement, as testified by

its witness Mr. Livesey during the Hearing. !°°”

1001. With regard to security risks, Claimant notes that, besides a chapter on security and

another one on risk, the Feasibility Study contains a risk register in which the risks are
catalogued, assigned a mitigation strategy and tracked with respect to progress and
mitigation level. In addition, Claimant submits that the costs associated with the security
plans were included in the project's finances as part of the operating and capital expense
estimates, including contingencies amounting to more than half a billion dollars in the

capital expense estimates. !°*

(ii) The Pipeline Plan Was Sensible and Feasible

1002. Claimant submits that TCC's decision to transport the concentrate from Reko Dig to the

port of Gwadar through a slurry pipeline was taken only after extensive studies had been
conducted, which compared the costs and benefits of a pipeline to those of road transport
and rail and concluded that the pipeline was the "safest and most economical option,"
inter alia, because of "several distinct security advantages" over the other options: (a)
securing operations required less manpower; (b) the transport via pipeline was less

susceptible to theft; and (c) it involved and benefited local residents.!°?

1003. Claimant further states that it informed the GOB as early as December 2007 that a pipeline

was one of the transport options and repeatedly raised the option thereafter. !°°° While
Claimant acknowledges that the GOB expressed its interest in having TCC build a road
to Gwadar, it claims that the GOB never raised any concerns that a pipeline would be
unviable for any reason, including security concerns. Claimant also notes that Pakistan’s
witness Mr. Yaqoob admitted during the Hearing that he was not aware of any discussions
within the GOB regarding security concerns relating to TCC's project. !°!

1004. Claimant contends that TCC had prepared "detailed plans to provide adequate security

during both the construction and operation phases," the costs of which were included in
the project’s operating and capital expense estimates. Claimant refers, inter alia, to its
intention to create incentives for local tribes and communities to become involved in the

pipeline's maintenance and security. !°

1005.In Claimant's view, the Reko Diq pipeline cannot be compared to the "politically

charged" Sui gas pipeline, as it would have measured only eight inches in diameter, would
have been buried several feet underground and would have transported non-flammable
slurry. In addition, Claimant notes that the pipeline would have transported the slurry of
a project in which Balochistan held a 25% interest and emphasizes that there have not
been any major security incidents at Reko Diq during the years of exploration activities

or even after TCC had to abandon its assets at the project site. !°

(iii) TCC's Water Source Selection Was Based on Sound Analysis

1006. As to the water source for the project, Claimant submits that, contrary to Respondent's

allegation, the water study was investigated to full feasibility level, except for the areas

located outside of Pakistan. !0

1007.Claimant states that it selected the fan sediments (also known as “Baghicha”) as the

1060

project’s water source because there were no competing users and TCC's testing revealed
that it contained "ample quantities" of water. Claimant emphasizes that the largest part of

the water is located on the Pakistani side of the border and claims that any impact on the

Afghan side would be minimal.!°°

1008. Finally, Claimant notes that for its own Reko Dig project, Balochistan also selected the
Baghicha aquifer for the same reasons: “No other groundwater user,” a “[l]arge volume
of groundwater storage” and “[mJost [of the] area of resource is [located] in
Pakistan.”

ii. Pakistan Breached Article 3(2) by the Takeover of Reko Diq

1009. Claimant asserts that Balochistan's decision to deny the Mining Lease Application can
only be explained by Balochistan's plan to take over TCC's project and develop a
Balochistan-only project, which started in early 2009. Claimant submits that, contrary to
Respondent’s allegation, Balochistan's project was in direct conflict with TCC’s project.
According to Claimant, Balochistan knew it had to overcome TCC’s right to mine Reko
Diq and therefore instructed the Licensing Authority to deny TCC’s Mining Lease

Application so that Balochistan could implement its own project. !°°

1010.In Claimant's view, the Governments’ repeated assurances to TCC that Balochistan's
project would be complementary to that of TCC until the submission of TCC's Feasibility
Study in August 2010, while Balochistan was already planning to take over the Project,
constitute a "flagrant violation" of Respondent's good faith obligation under the FET
standard.'° Claimant further argues that Balochistan's preference for its own
"indigenous" project constitutes "differential treatment" of TCC “motivated by a
preference for other investments over foreign-owned investments" and therefore violates
Article 3(2). 1°

1011.In addition, Claimant asserts that Pakistan and Balochistan started in 2008 to solicit and
entertain a competing offer from MCC, as part of which they invited MCC to the Steering
Committee meeting in January 2009. Claimant contends that despite the assurances
following this meeting that it was "officially decided to decline the proposal of MCC,"
the Governments continued their negotiations with MCC in 2009, and refers to (a) a letter
sent by MCC to the Embassy of Pakistan; (b) local media reports according to which
MCC made an additional proposal in 2010; and (c) attempts of MCC employees to enter
the Reko Dig site in 2012.'°

(a) With Federal Assistance, Balochistan Developed a PC-1 Proposal
for a Balochistan-Only Project at Reko Diq

1012.Claimant submits that between May and December 2009, Pakistan's Planning
Commission developed a "proposal for mining and refining copper in the Reko Dig area
of Balochistan" and, even though TCC had been performing exploration work at Reko
Dig for more than eight years, the Governments initially did not inform TCC about this
proposal. !07!

under Balochistan Mining Concession Rules 2002 or not. If so, then what would be their

strategy to implement the subject project?" °°

1014. According to Claimant, the final PC-1 proposal, which was approved by the Federal
Planning Commission on 9 December 2009 and by the Federal ECNEC on 9 December
2010, included a budget of 2.7 billion rupees (i.e., US$ 57.1 million — approximately 30%
of the overall budget) to mine at a rate of 15,000 tons of ore per day, which confirms that

the "mining of ore" would be the "principal activity" of the project.'!0*

1015.Claimant further refers to a Working Paper titled “Taking Over of Reko-Diq Copper &
Gold Mining Project From TCCP by the Government of Balochistan,” which was
prepared by the MMDD for a meeting of the Balochistan Cabinet on 24 December
2009.!°75 Claimant submits that pursuant to the "Background" section, it was the common
understanding of the parties that TCC would have a right to a mining lease “ifa suitable
discovery [was] made,” and notes that the section styled “Work done by TCCP” describes
the extensive work undertaken by TCC at Reko Dig and reports expenditures for that
work of US$ 200 million by October 2009.!°7° Claimant then refers to the 13 purported

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

1077

the MMDD asked the Cabinet for “approval for awarding the mining rights of
Reko-Diqg Copper / Gold Project to Mines & Mineral Development

Department,” 1078

the MMDD assured the Government of its technical expertise to “run mining
activities efficiently” and referred to technical assistance "in mining copper / gold
in Reko Diq"; 1079

the MMDD understood the proposal to encompass “carrying out mining activities
in the mine areas of Reko Dig” and stated that in order to pursue the PC-1 proposal,
“the mining activities are also required to be undertaken by the Provincial
Government";'®®° and

the MMDD took the view that “the Licensing Authority can exercise his power to

reject [TCCP's ] Mining Lease for the better interest of the province.”

1016. Claimant also refers to the PowerPoint presentation given at the Cabinet meeting on 24

December 2009 and claims that this presentation makes clear that the PC-1 proposal

contemplated a phased mining scheme, by which Balochistan would start by mining 5,000

tons per day and expand to 60,000 tons by the project’s tenth year.

(b) Chief Minister Raisani's Cabinet Decided to Take Over Reko Diq

1017. With regard to the 24 December 2009 Cabinet meeting, Claimant refers to Agenda Item
No. 4, i.e., the “Taking over of Rekodiq Copper & Gold Project from TCCP by the
Government of Balochistan,” in relation to which the minutes of the meeting record:

"The agenda was approved in principle. It was further decided not to
go ahead with the proposed Mineral and Shareholder agreements with
TCCP. Further course of action would be decided by the Chief
Minister."

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1

1018.Claimant submits that Respondent's witness Mr. Lehri testified at the Hearing that
Balochistan had thereby decided what to do, i.e., to take over TCC's project, but had left
the implementation of the decision to the Chief Minister.'°** Claimant argues that the
decision "not to go ahead" with the negotiations of the Mineral and Shareholder
Agreements was "the natural and immediate consequence" of the takeover decision, as
there was no reason to negotiate them if TCC were not to be permitted to go forward with
its own project. !°8

1019.In addition, Claimant refers to a “Note for Chief Secretary” dated 31 December 2009 in
which employees of the MMDD reported on a site visit to TCC’s project at Reko Diq,
highlighting its value and the expertise TCC had brought to it, but also stating that the
“Government of Balochistan has decided to take over the project from TCCP;” therefore,
they advised that “it is utmost important to establish a camp office of the Mines & Mineral
Development Department at the site to closely monitor the project till proper taking /
handing-over the project.” Claimant notes that this Note was signed and thus approved
by the Chief Secretary. !°°°

(c) Balochistan and Pakistan Took Steps to Eliminate TCC's Rights
and Secure Funding for Their Project

1020. Claimant submits that immediately thereafter, Balochistan undertook to eliminate TCC’s
rights and to obtain funding for its own project.!°8’ Claimant cites a “Summary for the
Honorable Chief Minister” dated 11 February 2010 in which the MMDD reported that
“with the consent of the Ex-Chief Secretary Balochistan” and under the chairmanship of
Dr. Mubarakmand, a committee “had been constituted for negotiating the services of
Legal Expert for Reko-Digq Gold/Copper Project.” The Summary continued:

1021.In Claimant's view, this Summary "conclusively demonstrates" that the decision of the

Cabinet decision was "definitive" and further shows that the people in charge of

implementing this decision knew that they had to "terminate TCC's rights in order to do

SO.

1022.Claimant points to the minutes of a 28 May 2010 meeting of the Board of Governors of

Balochistan's project at which "various issues relating to mining of gold and copper at

Reko Diq, Balochistan" were discussed, which included, according to Respondent's

witness Mr. Lehri, "whether Balochistan would mine at Reko Dig, or take ore and turn it

into concentrate, or take concentrate and smelt it."'°°° Claimant also highlights the

Dr. Mubarakmand observed that litigation might be avoided if TCC agreed to do
only the mining and leave the refining to Balochistan and suggested that the
“Government of Balochistan may opt for a joint project with TCC on profit sharing
basis in which plant design, installation and operation will be our equity and the
remaining part (mining) can be TCC equity,” predicting that the split would then
be 80:20 in favor of Balochistan. !°

In response to the concern raised by a Board member that “only giving prospecting
license will earn a bad reputation for the country,” the Chief Minister stated that
“national interest is above all” and observed that “if TCC is keen on a mining
license, then they can have it. We will buy the ore from them and do the refining

and metal production ourselves.” ©

According to the summary of decisions taken at the meeting, it was decided that
“Tt]he future role of [TCC] will be decided by the Government of Balochistan, after
they apply for a mining lease”; the “refining and production of pure copper and
gold will be [done] in Balochistan"; and “under no circumstances will the pure

metals be allowed to leave the country.” !°%*

1023. According to Claimant, the minutes demonstrate that the Chief Minister, who had been
given a "free hand" by the Cabinet, would not decide on TCC's Application on the basis
of TCC’s legal rights, but rather "on the determination of [Balochistan's] own best

interests," 105

1024. Claimant further cites a 3 December 2010 interview of Dr. Mubarakmand in which he
stated in response to an observation that “the government of Baluchistan should give the
contract to the local companies . . . [s]o that the flow of the money remains in Pakistan
rather than going to foreign companies” that:

"This is the reason why I had developed a technical project and
presented it to the Chief Minister of Baluchistan. He appreciated my
efforts and endorsed that this project should be handled by Pakistani
scientists and engineers. If our project is approved in the [EJCNEC
meeting on December 9, 2010, the Baluchistan government has the
funds for us to start work on this project."'!®

1025.Claimant also refers to an interview on 15 December 2010 in which Dr. Mubarakmand
recognized that TCC had “done the exploration work expecting that the mining license
will be awarded to them,” but stated that “this decision will be taken by the Government

of Balochistan as these deposits belong to them.” 1°"

1026.Finally, Claimant argues that Pakistan cannot hide behind the smaller scale of the
Balochistan-only project in light of Balochistan's apparent belief that TCC's project stood
in the way of its own project and its corresponding actions to "remove that obstacle."!°8

(d) The Governments Sought the Supreme Court's Assistance in
Implementing the Balochistan Project

1027. Claimant submits that, while Balochistan had defended the CHEJVA and its own pursuit
of the Joint Venture project in the Supreme Court proceedings up to and including its 11
December 2010 submission, Balochistan changed its position in early 2011.!°°

1028.Claimant contends that in its 22 January 2011 submission, Balochistan repudiated the
position it had taken since 2006, stating that "certain important developments have taken

place that are necessary to be brought on the record," namely, that (i) ECNEC had
approved Balochistan's project; (ii) a Board of Governors had been established; (iii) Dr.
Mubarakmand was to give a briefing to ECNEC on Pakistan's technical capability to
implement the project; and (iv) the ECNEC decision was consistent with the 26 December
2009 decision of the Balochistan Cabinet. !!°

1029. Claimant further cites Balochistan's concluding request that the Court

"permit the Government of Balochistan to execute the decision of the
ECNEC dated 9.12.2010 while declaring that in the circumstances of
the case, no entity has any vested right for the mining concession and
that only the Government of Balochistan can take any decision in this
regard in the national interest."''°!

 

1030.In Claimant's view, Balochistan thereby asked the Supreme Court to release it from its
obligation to grant TCC a mining lease, which derived from the 2002 BM Rules and the
CHEJVA, in order for Balochistan to be able carry out the project on its own.!!

(e) On the Chief Minister's Instructions, the Licensing Authority
Denied TCC's Mining Lease Application so that the Balochistan
Project Could Go Forward

1031.Claimant submits that despite an order of the Supreme Court dated 25 May 2011 by which
it directed the Licensing Authority to evaluate the application "transparently and fairly
in accordance with the law and the rules," no action was taken by the Licensing Authority
until 12 September 2011 when the Director General of the MMDD wrote to the Secretary
of the MMDD, i.e., the appellate authority, noting that he had received the “following
remarks” from the Chief Minister:!!°

"It was decided by the Board of Governors that:
i) We will do the mining
ii) We will do the refining."

1032. The Director General requested the Secretary "[i]n light of said decision by the Board of
Governors," that the "future line of action in the matter may kindly be conveyed whether
the TCC be refused Mining Lease for Reko-Dig Copper-Gold Project or otherwise.” !!°4

Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability
ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1

1033.Claimant claims that the Chief Minister's interference with the Licensing Authority’s
decision for the stated reason that he desired to do a Balochistan-only project, constitutes
a "fundamental violation of TCC’s rights under the BM Rules and the CHEJVA."
Claimant refers to Respondent's witness Mr. Lehri who confirmed that both the Licensing
Authority and the Secretary of the MMDD (acting as the appellate authority) had an
obligation to decide the applicant’s entitlement "impartially" and "tak[ing] into account
only the merits of the Application" itself.!!°°

1034. Claimant further argues that by providing the Director General with these instructions,
the Chief Minister implemented the 24 December 2009 Cabinet decision to take over the

Reko Diq project from TCC, and contends that, knowing that those instructions were

improper, the Director General did not want to assume this responsibility on his own.!!0°

Claimant submits that on 13 September 2011, the Secretary of the MMDD directed his
Section Officer to “ask the DG to dispose off the M.L. application,” i.e., to follow the
Chief Minister's instructions, which the Section Officer did on 16 September 2011, to be
followed by the two-page Notice of Intent to Reject on 21 September 2011.!!°7 Claimant

further notes that this Notice reproduced verbatim the grounds that the Mines Committee

had identified during its meeting on 19 and 20 September 201 1.!!°8

1035.Claimant also argues in this context that Respondent breached Article 3(2) of the Treaty
because the Licensing Authority and Secretary of the MMDD were not independent and
impartial decision makers, but rather organs of the GOB meant to implement the
Governments' decision to "oust" TCC. Claimant emphasizes that the Licensing Authority
as well as the appellate authority were offices held by the Director General, respectively

the Secretary, of the MMDD, i.e., the same department that was involved in the

implementation of Balochistan's project. |!

(f) Having Ousted TCC, Balochistan Completed the Takeover by
Replicating TCC's Project

1036. Claimant submits that in 2012, the Governments began to implement their own project
and contends that this project "replicated the very project set forth in the Mining Lease
Application Balochistan denied." Claimant refers to the following facts:!!!° (i) the area
over which Balochistan sought rights was identical in size, shape and location to the
mining area proposed by TCC;!'"'! (ii) Balochistan expressly reserved not only Tanjeel,
but also H14 and H15;!''? (iii) Balochistan planned to use the same water source that
TCC had chosen for its project; and (iv) Balochistan originally contemplated requesting
a relaxation of rule 48(1) given that it did not hold an exploration license. !!!3

iii, The Mineral Agreement Negotiations and Supreme Court Proceedings
Provide No Defense and Further Demonstrate the Governments' Treaty
Breaches

1037. Claimant claims that the Mineral Agreement negotiations and the Supreme Court decision
confirm the Governments' intent to take over Reko Diq and demonstrate the unfair and
inequitable treatment that TCC was accorded. !!!4

(a) The Absence of a Mineral Agreement Does Not Excuse Pakistan's
Breaches

1038.Claimant submits that the failure to agree on the terms of a Mineral Agreement was not a
valid basis for denying TCC's application, as TCC’'s right to obtain a mining lease did not
depend on the issues discussed at the negotiations for the Mineral Agreement. Claimant
argues that TCC was not required to agree to the additional benefits that the Governments
sought in these negotiations, in particular to construct a billion-dollar smelter, and points
out that, under the 2002 BM Rules, a mineral agreement is not mandatory and its absence
is not listed in rule 48 (nor is it mentioned in the Notice of Intent to Reject) as a reason

for denying the mining lease application.!!!°

1039.In addition, Claimant claims that the Governments’ conduct during the negotiations
“underscores the overall unfair and inequitable treatment TCC received," given that at

least by December 2009, Balochistan had decided not to conclude a mineral agreement
with TCC, as a consequence of its decision to take over the project rather than of its

opposition to TCC's negotiation position in principle.!!!°

1040. Claimant asserts that there was no ju:

 

ification for the Government's refusal to engage in
further good-faith negotiations. With regard to Pakistan's argument that TCC attempted
to "exempt itself entirely" from the 2002 BM Rules relying on TCC's first 2007 draft of
the Mineral Agreement and its definition of the "Overall Development Plan," Claimant
contends that the purpose of this clause was to make it unnecessary to obtain further
regulatory approvals in the future so long as the activity was contemplated by an overall
plan to be agreed jointly by TCC and Balochistan. In any event, neither the Overall
Development Plan nor "an automatic right to mine" was mentioned in any of the follow-
up correspondence about the Mineral Agreement and thus dropped out of the negotiations

after the parties’ initial drafts. !!!7

1041. Claimant argues that TCC rather continued to pursue the "concept of stability" and sought
to correct a "defect" in the 2002 BM Rules, which, while providing for mineral
agreements, rendered them ineffective by having later changes in the rules take
precedence over their terms. Claimant submits that Balochistan agreed to this point in
principle and refers to a working paper prepared by Mr. Khokhar for the third Steering
Committee meeting in which he noted that the parties “have resolved main issues of DMA
ie. regulatory issues, infrastructure, stability provisions, fiscal system and dispute
resolution” and listed as one of the remaining issues to be discussed: “drafting of legal
issues relating to exemption from Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 2002.”!!18

1042. Claimant claims that the reasonableness of TCC’s proposal is further confirmed by the
fact that Pakistan subsequently adopted that proposal in its 2013 NMP, which provides
that the “existing Mineral Rules will be amended to remove any conflict/overlapping with
or other effect on, and to give effect to, the rights and obligations of the mining company

under the mineral agreement in line with best international practices.”!!!

1043. Referring to Pakistan's allegation that TCC was not willing to accept anything other than
a 2% royalty rate, Claimant submits that, to the contrary, in October 2008 when
Balochistan still had a royalty rate of 2% on copper and gold, TCC offered a rate that
would increase over time from 2% to 4%, but instead of negotiating the issue, Balochistan

rather amended the 2002 BM Rules, raising the royalty to 5%.!!?° Claimant claims that
its subsequent return to the 2% proposal was due to the fact that it also offered an overall
fiscal package to the Governments, including "other substantial financial benefits,"
favorable financing on Balochistan's equity interest, social investment, etc., to which the
Governments never responded. !!?!

1044. With regard to Respondent's arguments that TCC was not willing to build a smelter or
provide some comparable large-scale infrastructure development in Pakistan, Claimant
argues that it repeatedly explained to the Governments that it was not in the smelter
business and that it would cost approximately US$ 1 billion to build a smelter, which was
“unprofitable and environmentally risky." TCC also refers to the technical "white paper"
about smelting that it provided to Balochistan and its offer to pay US$ 1 million in order
to assist Balochistan in conducting its own smelter feasibility study to which Balochistan
never responded. !!72

1045. Claimant concludes that the Government's refusal to further negotiate with TCC was thus
not caused by TCC's allegedly unreasonable demands, but rather was part of the "pattern
of unfair and inequitable treatment towards TCC."''

(b) Balochistan Cannot Use the Supreme Court Proceedings to Avoid
International Liability

1046. Claimant submits that Balochistan's conduct in "procuring" the Supreme Court judgment
provides further evidence of its attempt to defeat TCCA's legal rights and international
arbitration remedies and thus of Pakistan's Treaty breach. 1124 Ty Claimant's view, Pakistan
and Balochistan intended to deprive this Tribunal as well as the ICC Tribunal of

jurisdiction in an attempt to escape liability under international law.!!?°

1047.Claimant refers to (i) Balochistan's 18 February 2012 submission in which, for the first
time, it took the position that the CHEJVA violated the 2002 BM Rules and that the
Supreme Court had the power to declare it void ab initio; and (ii) Balochistan's March
2012 request that the Supreme Court overturn the judgment of the Balochistan High
Court, which had upheld the validity of the CHEJVA.!!?6

1048. In relation to Pakistan's argument that Balochistan's reversed position was based on the
conclusion of former Advocate General Kanrani that the record of the GOB's actions
concerning the CHEJVA was “riddled with discrepancies and irregularities,” Claimant
notes that Respondent cannot explain (i) why this evidence of invalidity was discovered
only after TCC had initiated the arbitrations against the Governments, even though
litigation on these issues had been ongoing for years before the Pakistani courts; (ii) why
no other Government official ever came to the same conclusion during the twenty-year
history of the CHEJVA Agreements; and (iii) why Mr. Kanrani filed only one-sentence
submissions, stating that the Petitioners' arguments about the invalidity of the CHEJVA
were correct even though they had not had access to the record he reviewed. !!?7

1049. Claimant argues that Balochistan instead hoped that the Supreme Court "would find a
way to eviscerate TCC's rights" that were to be vindicated by this Tribunal as well as by
the ICC Tribunal.'!?* Claimant refers to Balochistan's 20 December 2012 submission to
the Supreme Court:

“If this Honourable Court upholds the CHEJVA and_ other
documentation, then the Memorial will state accordingly and the
Government of Balochistan and the Government of Pakistan shall
proceed to contest the matter on the merits on CHEJVA and other
agreements. On the other hand if this Honourable Court declares
CHEJVA void ab init[i]o, then the Government will argue before ICSID
that an illegal investment is not protected by BIT and before ICC that
arbitrations should end since the agreement from which it derives its
jurisdiction has been struck down.”'!?9

1050. According to Claimant, the Supreme Court "heeded Balochistan's request" when it issued
a short Order on 7 January 2013 and invalidated every agreement that Balochistan had
said gave TCC rights at Reko Dig. Claimant notes that this invalidation included two
contracts to which neither Pakistan nor Balochistan were parties, as they were concluded
between Australian entities and were governed by Australian law.!!?°

1051. As regards the reasoned Supreme Court judgment issued on 10 May 2013, Claimant notes
that the Court copied entire passages verbatim from Balochistan’s pleadings, including
issues that it should have properly assessed for itself, such as the alleged improper intent

approach" to cross-examination, the Tribunal received no explanation from Mr. Kanrani so the record must speak
for itself.

of GOB officials or private parties.!!7! According to Claimant, the judgment was rendered
based on "a cold, incomplete record and without the benefit of any contemporaneous
testimony" as well as "a number of technicalities" and disregarded undertakings and
assurances given by Pakistan and Balochistan over a fifteen-year period that the CHEJVA.

was valid and enforceable and TCC was entitled to mine Reko Digq.!!*?

1052.Claimant rejects Respondent's allegation that TCCA is bound by the Supreme Court
judgment and submits that only TCCP appeared before the Supreme Court. Claimant
argues that despite Balochistan's attempts to convince them otherwise, both the Supreme
Court and the ICC Tribunal confirmed that TCCA was not present in the Supreme Court
proceedings.''*? In relation to the "Chronological Overview of Pakistan Court
Proceedings" provided by Respondent during the Hearing, Claimant notes that each of
the four submissions listed as allegedly filed by TCCA was in fact filed by Respondent
No. 4, which was TCCP. !!34

b. Summary of Respondent's Position

1053.Respondent submits that there were legitimate reasons for the Licensing Authority to
reject the Mining Lease Application and asserts that Claimant was not denied any due

process rights. In addition, Respondent claims that neither Pakistan nor Balochistan had

a plan to "oust TCCA" from Reko Dig in order to implement Balochistan's project.!!7°

Finally, Respondent rejects Claimant's allegation that the Governments’ conduct in the
Mineral Agreement negotiations and in the Supreme Court proceedings adds to a
composite breach of the FET obligation under Article 3(2) of the Treaty. !!°

i. The Rejection of the Mining Lease Application Was in Accordance with
the 2002 BM Rules

1054.Respondent submits that, in its analysis whether the rejection of the Mining Lease
Application constituted a breach of Respondent's FET obligation, "it is no part of the

Licensing Authority on any given ground within the framework of the BMR."!!37

According to Respondent, Claimant has to prove that the Licensing Authority exercised
its discretion "outrageously, in bad faith or in neglect of duty, or at a minimum
unreasonably" in respect of each of the grounds for its decision. Respondent claims that
in case Claimant fails to discharge this burden of proof on any one single ground, its claim
must fail.!!8

1055.Referring to Claimant's allegation that the Licensing Authority arbitrarily rejected the
Mining Lease Application, Respondent submits that the term "arbitrary" has been
described by the tribunal in Lauder v. Czech Republic as "founded on prejudice or
preference rather than on reason or fact."''° Respondent also claims that the
International Court of Justice stated in the ELSI case that even if a measure is unwise,
inefficient or not the best course of action in the circumstances, it is not arbitrary if there

is some rational relationship to the alleged objective of the measure. !!#°

1056. Respondent notes that in the present case, the Licensing Authority was prohibited by rule
48(3) of the 2002 BM Rules from granting the mining lease unless the various subjective
and objective requirements set out in this provision had been satisfied by the applicant.
In Respondent's view, the Feasibility Study that TCCP submitted as part of its Application
was "manifestly deficient"; therefore, the Licensing Authority was in fact bound to reject,
but in any event did not act arbitrarily when it did reject, the Application. !'+!

(a) The Five Grounds for Rejection Identified in the Notice of Intent to
Reject

1057.Respondent submits that the Notice of Intent to Reject identifies at least five grounds for
rejecting the Mining Lease Application under rule 48(3) of the 2002 BM Rules. With
regard to the fourth and fifth grounds, Respondent acknowledges that they are not set out
in the Notice of Intent to Reject "as clearly as they might have been," but claims that they
nevertheless "were referred to, were evidently in the minds of the Licensing Authority at

the Government believed and understood was the best response to the unfolding crisis. Irrespective of the question

the time, and constituted objectively justified reasons" for rejecting the Application. In
Respondent's view, these two grounds should therefore be taken into consideration as
well. !!42
(i) | Ground One: TCCP Lacked Standing to Make the Mining
Lease Application!

1058.Respondent submits that the Licensing Authority's view that TCCP (alone) was not the
“holder of [an] exploration licence” within the meaning of rule 48(1) of the 2002 BM
Rules, and therefore lacked standing to make the Mining Lease Application, was
"factually accurate," given that the Exploration License (EL-5) was held by the Joint
Venture in which TCC[P] had a 75% interest and the BDA had a 25% interest. !'#4

1059. Respondent notes that Ground 6 of the Notice of Intent to Reject refers to Claimant's letter
of 3 March 2011 by which it sought to initiate negotiations for the acquisition of its
partner's interest in the Joint Venture in accordance with Article 11.4 of the CHEJVA.
Article 11.4 requires Claimant to acquire the transfer of the joint venture partner's interest
before it can undertake a sole risk joint venture, subject to compliance with all required
Government approvals to enable it to do so. According to Respondent, this demonstrates
that Claimant never sought to do so before it filed its Application, despite the fact that it
had given an express undertaking that it would comply with all of its obligations under
the CHEJVA and the Licensing Authority had made this a condition for approving the

assignment of BHP's interest in the Exploration License EL-5 to Claimant in 2006.''*

1060.In addition, Respondent submits that the Licensing Authority noted in Ground | that,
even though the Joint Venture was the holder of Exploration License EL-5, it would not
have been eligible to file the Application either because it was not a "body corporate" in
Pakistan as required by rule 47(1) of the 2002 BM Rules.!!4°

1061.Finally, Respondent argues that the rejection was reasonable under rule 48(2), which
provides that:

“the Licensing Authority shall not grant a mining lease .. . if. . . any
person other than the applicant holds any exploration licence

conferring an exclusive right to carry on exploration operations in that

vl

area.

1062.Respondent emphasizes that pursuant to rule 23(1)(a), all exploration licenses are, by
default, exclusive, which is why the right of the BDA to carry out exploration activities
was "exclusive." In Respondent's view, the Licensing Authority was therefore "duty
bound" to reject the Application under rule 48(2), but in any event, the decision was not
“outrageous, in bad faith or in neglect of duty, or unreasonable." !!48

(ii) Ground Two: The Mining Lease Application Failed to
Provide "Value Addition"?

1063.Respondent claims that the Licensing Authority rejected the Mining Lease Application
because it did not provide value addition in the form of a smelter and refinery. Respondent
refers to rules 48(3)(a)(ii), (v), (vi) and (vii) and notes in particular that rule 48(3)(b)(vii)
requires "a concrete proposal for value addition for the Ore to be produced/exploited
from the applicant's mining lease within the country is submitted, or if the facility is not
available in the province, the Ore could be taken out of the province with the prior
approval of the Provincial Government."''°° According to Respondent, Claimant's
witness Mr. Livesey acknowledged during the Hearing that the amendment to the 2002
BM Rules of 1 October 2010, by which "value addition" was included as an express
requirement, had been gazetted and that Claimant was aware of this requirement when it

filed its Application.!!>!

1064.Respondent submits that the decision of the Licensing Authority on this issue clearly
involved the exercise of discretion, which the Tribunal may only gainsay if it considers

that the invocation of this ground was "outrageous, in bad faith or in neglect of duty. . .,

1152

or at the very least unreasonable. According to Respondent, Claimant's witness Ms.

Boggs conceded that local smelting/refining was a legitimate objective and that, in its

evaluation whether the Application was satisfactory, the Licensing Authority was entitled
to take this objective into account.!!53

1065. According to Respondent, "value addition" in this case was the need for smelting/refining
capacities within the country, as it had been repeatedly stressed during the Mineral

Agreement negotiations. !'*+ Respondent contends that, despite the fact that the GOB had
pursued its "core objective of securing local smelting/refining in the interests of the
people of Balochistan and Pakistan to ensure a transfer of metals technology and skills,
and job creation" and emphasized the need for "such local benefits in order to obtain a
social licence to operate," Claimant nevertheless intended to export all of the concentrate
via a pipeline to the sea, which would not bring any local benefits to the tribal people,

and did not address this issue at all in its Application.''*°

1066. Respondent argues that "it was very far from being outrageous, in bad faith or in neglect

of duty, and equally far from being unreasonable" for the Licensing Authority to conclude
that smelting/refining was required under the rule 48(3)(a), in particular given that
smelting/refining was envisaged in the "value addition of the ore" requirement under rule
48(3)(a)(vii), as confirmed by the MMDD Summary of 11 June 2010 seeking the Chief
Minister's approval for the 1 October 2010 amendment to the 2002 BM Rules, and was

consistent with the GOB's desire for a local smelter/refinery.!!°°

1067.Respondent submits that in light of Claimant's failure, in its Mining Lease Application

and again in its Interim Response, to address local smelting/refining or to offer to supply
the Government's smelter with ore/concentrate (as Respondent claims it had been agreed)
and also taking into account "the long history of discussions on this key issue," the
Licensing Authority was duty bound, but in any event entitled, to reject the Application
as "unsatisfactory" and "not in the interests of the development of the mineral resources"
as set out in paragraph 10 of the Notice of Intent to Reject.!!°”

(iii) Ground Three: The Mining Lease Application Was
Incomplete and Failed to Ensure the Efficient, Beneficial and
Timely Use of the Mineral Resources!!*8

1068.Respondent notes that the Feasibility Study undisputedly covered only two of the 14

deposits over which the mining lease was sought and asserts that Claimant had no plan to
develop the other 12 deposits, given that there was only an undisclosed Expansion Pre-

Feasibility Study for developing some, but not all, of them.!'*?

1069. Respondent claims that Claimant knew that the Feasibility Study should have covered all

larger area of Exploration License EL-5, and refers to the minutes of the OC Meeting of
26 October 2007:

"TCC pointed out that EL-5 is to expire in February, 2008 and an
application for renewal of the licence has to be filed with the
Government of Balochistan by November 22, 2007. TCC stated that
given the wide area over which discoveries had been made and the
time that would be needed to carry out the feasibility study to tie all
the deposit together . .. TCC was recommending that the request for
renewal be over 90% of the existing EL-5 area and that the term of
the renewal be three years."''!

1070. Respondent further refers to Claimant's second renewal application, filed on 2 November
2007:

"[T]he Applicant faced a number of technical and other challenges
which have or will affect its ability to complete a full feasibility study
during the first renewal period. . . . With EL-5 to expire in February,
2008 the Applicant will be able to commence activities for drawing up
the Feasibility study in the first renewal period but will not be able to
complete the same given the time that will be needed to carry out the
Feasibility Study to tie the development of all the deposits, which are
spread over a large area of EL-5 . . . together into one mining project.
. .. the Applicant considers that it requires a renewal for the full three
year period over 90% of the existing EL-5 area to be in a position to
fully develop the discoveries." ''°!

1071.According to Respondent, the reference to a "full" Feasibility Study reflected rule
29(2)(c)(iii) of the 2002 BM Rules which provides:

“An application for the renewal of a licence shall... not be made .. .
in the case of a second renewal, unless the applicant can satisfy the
authority that such a renewal is necessary for the completion of a full
feasibility study of the discovered deposits.” ''

1072.Respondent submits that rule 29(2)(c)(iii) aims at ensuring the "efficient, beneficial and

timely use of mineral resources" and therefore conditions a second renewal upon the

submission of a feasibility study that covers all discovered deposits in the exploration

it: 1164

(i) _ breached its promise under rule 29(2)(c)(iii) and was therefore in default pursuant
to rule 48(3)(b);

(ii) failed to demonstrate that its "proposed plans .. . will ensure the efficient, beneficial

(iii) failed to submit "the relevant feasibility studies" with its Mining Lease

Application; !!©

(iv) breached its 2006 Undertaking to comply with the 2002 BM Rules;
(v) failed to submit "satisfactory" proposals;!!6’ and

(vi) failed to convince the Licensing Authority that "it is in the interest of the

development of the mineral resources of Balochistan to grant the lease."""%

1073.Respondent claims that Claimant understood the concerns of the Licensing Authority as
set out in paragraphs 2, 3, 7, 8 and 10 of the Notice of Intent to Reject, but failed to address
them in its Interim Response. Referring to Claimant's submission that the Quarterly
Report for the period ending September 2007 made clear that the focus lay on H-14 and
H-15, Respondent argues that there is no indication in this Quarterly Report, or elsewhere,
that the GOB had agreed to limit the Feasibility Study to those two deposits. Respondent
adds that in any event, such an agreement would have been contrary to rule 29(2)(c)(iii),
which was intended to prevent that the development of further deposits would be
blocked.!!® In Respondent's view, the Licensing Authority was therefore barred from
granting the Application under rule 48(3)(b) which provides that "a mining lease shall
not be granted . . . if at the time of the application the applicant in question is in
default."'!7°

1074. Respondent also contends that Claimant intended to "flout" rule 48(3)(a)(ii) of the 2002
BM Rules by "/and-banking" the mining lease area for 56 years, as it stated in its Interim
Response that ore sites other than H14 and H15 "may become viable" in the future and

expressed its desire to avoid the inconvenience of having to submit further applications
for mining leases if and when such an ore site became viable.''7! In Respondent's view,
it would not "ensure the efficient, beneficial and timely use of the mineral resources" if

Claimant were granted a mining lease over areas in which it had no present intention of

1172

mining and for which it had not submitted a feasibility study. Therefore, Respondent

claims that the Interim Response only confirmed the concerns of the Licensing Authority,

which is why it reasonably concluded that the Application was incomplete and failed to

"ensure the efficient, beneficial and timely use of the mineral resources."

(iv) Ground Four: The Feasibility Study Failed to Demonstrate
that the Mine Could Be Profitably Developed and

viability and refers to the Feasibility Review Committee Report of January 2011 and the
Summary for the Chief Minister of May 2011.!!> According to Respondent, the
Licensing Authority is referring to this concern in paragraphs 2 and 7 (ii)-(iv) of the
Notice of Intent to Reject.!!7°

1076.Respondent argues that that this concern was "genuine and legitimate," given that the

Feasibility Study failed to establish that the project was financially viable as demonstrated

in particular by the following points:!!77

(i) | The base case IRR was only 12.3%, which Claimant's then CEO, Mr. Von Borries,

described before the Supreme Court in January 2011 as being "far too low

compared to the risk rating of the country";'!78

(ii) _ the base case model incorrectly assumed an EPZ tax rate of 1% for the first 15 years

of the project, rather than the normal tax rate of 35%, even though Ms. Boggs had

accepted the regular rate during the Mineral Agreement negotiations; !'””

(iii) Claimant "naive[ly]" considered discount rates of only 0%-12%, even though

Professor Damodaran evaluated Pakistan's country risk premium alone at 14% in

January 2011, which would have led to a negative NPV of the project; !!®°

which is why Claimant decided to build a slurry pipeline and was not willing or not able
to provide local benefits, such as transport, and/or value addition, i.e., smelter/refinery,
to make this "hugely disruptive mega-project socially and politically acceptable to the
tribal people and the GOB."''*°

1078.Respondent submits that in light of the "obvious" flaws in the Feasibility Study, it was

(v) Ground Five: The Mining Lease Application Failed to
Demonstrate that TCCP Had the Financial Resources to

Carry Out the Mining Operations Effectively !!**

1079.Respondent refers to rule 48(3)(a)(iii) of the 2002 BM Rules, which requires the
Licensing Authority to reject a Mining Lease Application unless "the applicant in
question has or can obtain the . . . financial resources . . . to carry out mining operations
effectively" and also to Article 3.1 of the 2000 Addendum, which required that the
Feasibility Study include "a plan for providing financing of all development costs of the

mining project including external debt agreements."''®?

1080. Respondent states that, as TCCP undisputedly did not itself have the financial means to
carry out the project, it had to demonstrate in the Application how it would have
"obtained" the US$ 1.55 billion of third-party financing that it required in addition to
shareholder funding. However, Respondent claims that TCCP addressed this issue only
in the "vaguest and most incomplete and unsatisfactory of terms."''°° In Respondent's
view, this was due to the fact that the "skinny" economics of the project and the absence

of a Mineral Agreement made the project unfinanceable. !!°!

1081.Referring to Claimant's argument that copper prices increased following the submission
of the Feasibility Study and that Claimant's parent companies might have contributed
additional funds to the project, Respondent emphasizes that the Licensing Authority could
only judge the Application on the basis of the material provided to it; therefore, it had to
conclude that TCCP had not established how it would raise the financial resources to fund
the project and thus failed to satisfy rule 48(3)(a)(iii).!!

(vi) There Were No Assurances to Claimant Which Would Have
Rendered the Rejection of the Mining Lease Application
Arbitrary

1082.Referring to Claimant's argument that TCCA was assured prior to submitting its
Application that the project was "in the interest of the development of the mineral
resources of Balochistan," Respondent submits that these alleged assurances do not

render the rejection of the Application by the Licensing Authority improper. Respondent
notes that (a) four of the six statements that Claimant relies on were made in 2006/2007,
i.e., more than four years before the Feasibility Study and Application were submitted,
and thus in an outdated context; (b) none of these statements were made by the Licensing
Authority; and (c) all of these statements were very general and were not made on a
review of the Application.!!°?

(b) The Mining Lease Application Was Handled in Accordance with

Due Process

1083. Respondent rejects Claimant's claim that Article 3(2) of the Treaty was breached because
the Licensing Authority did not handle the Application in accordance with due process

and argues as follows: !!%4

(i) In accordance with rule 48(4) of the 2002 BM Rules, the Notice of Intent to Reject
identified "at least three clear grounds" and referred to "two other objectively
justified grounds" for rejecting the Application and Claimant was given the

opportunity to respond to the Notice and make new proposals; !!%>

(ii) Respondent submits in this regard that, despite the "succinct style" of the Licensing
Authority's rejection letters, the reasoning behind the decision was adequate and
sufficiently clear, in particular when taking into account that the reasons had been
raised in the context of the Mineral Agreement negotiations. Noting that Claimant
was made aware of this style by Mr. Lehri, Respondent claims that it reflects the
"house style" in Balochistan, which is the only standard to which the Licensing
Authority can be held.!!°°

(iii) Claimant's Interim Response filed on 19 October 2011 showed that Claimant
understood the grounds identified by the Licensing Authority; however, it did not
address any of the legitimate concerns and requirements raised in the Notice of

Intent to Reject, but rather adopted "an inflexible and adversarial stance," which is

why any "dialogue" would have been fruitless; !!°”

(iv) Respondent claims that Claimant's "aggressive" legal response demonstrates that
Claimant was not aware of the administrative environment into which it made its

investment, and was unable to communicate effectively; !!°*

(v) the Licensing Authority was not required under the 2002 BM Rules to meet, or
"engage in any informal dialogue," with Claimant and, in fact, it would have been

improper for the Licensing Authority to do so;!!°°

(vi) the 2002 BM Rules did not require the Licensing Authority to provide further
reasons at the time the Application was finally rejected — beyond those set out in
1200

the Notice of Intent to Reject and

(vii) Claimant did not make a due process complaint about the handling of the
Application by the Licensing Authority before the Supreme Court or a complaint
about the appeal decision of the Secretary of the MMDD, which it could have
challenged before the High Court under Article 199 of the Pakistan Constitution. !7°!

ii. There Was No Plan to Oust Claimant

1084.Respondent claims that in order to succeed with its "ouster theory," Claimant must
establish both that the alleged ouster plan existed at the relevant point in time and that

such plan played a causative role in the rejection of the Application. '?°

1085. According to Respondent, Claimant acknowledged at the Hearing that: (a) "[t]here was
no express repudiation [of the CHEJVA]";'° (b) the parties continued to negotiate in
2010 after the Cabinet's (provisional) 24 December 2009 decision;!? and (c) the
negotiations in 2010 contemplated that Claimant would supply ore/concentrate to the
Government's project, which demonstrates that Respondent acted on the assumption that

Claimant would be granted a mining lease. !2°5

1086. Respondent submits that the Application was rejected on the grounds set out in the Notice
of Intent to Reject and argues that, "[w]hatever might have seemed to have been the case
from scraps of evidence as to the position months or years beforehand, there was

absolutely no ouster plan as at the time when the MLA came to be considered, and was

rejected." 2

(a) MCC's Expression of Interest in Mining Reko Diq

1087.Respondent submits that Claimant has not established that the GOB intended to give
Claimant's project to MCC or that the Application was rejected on this ground and notes

that the Governments decided to reject MCC's proposal in early 2009, i.e., two years
before the Application was submitted, as Mr. Khokhar confirmed in his testimony. !2°7

1088.According to Respondent, the fact that the Governments were sincere in their
consideration of Claimant's proposal is demonstrated by the minutes of the Second
Steering Committee meeting on 23 January 2009:

"GOP/GOB to continue with TCC, as entertaining of MCC proposal at
this stage may lead to legal implications and effect [sic] credibility of
Pakistan in the international Mineral Sector."!7°

1089. Referring to Claimant's reliance on a letter of 9 June 2009 in which MCC stated it had
been advised by the MPNR to submit its proposal through the Pakistani Embassy in
Beijing, Respondent acknowledges that MCC "would not take 'no' for an answer" and
argues that the Governments’ letters were sent for diplomatic reasons and due to MCC's
involvement in various other projects in Pakistan. According to Respondent, the

Governments showed only "polite interest," but were not motivated by a plan to oust

Claimant from Reko Dig in the invitation to submit a further proposal. !7°

1090. Finally, Respondent notes that there is no evidence that MCC's proposal (rejected in 2009)

played any causative role in the rejection of the Application in late 2011.'?!°

(b) The GOB's Reko Diq Project Was a Complementary Smelter
Project

1091. According to Respondent, Claimant's second argument that the GOB wanted to mine
Reko Diq itself and this caused the Mining Lease Application to be rejected is
contradictory to its first argument, i.e., that Respondent wanted to give the project to
MCC.!"! In addition, Respondent submits that the GOB never intended to mine, but
rather to secure a local smelter/refinery in Balochistan, as demonstrated by Article 5.5 of
the GOB's August 2008 draft of the Mineral Agreement.'?!? Respondent argues that the
GOB's own smelter proposal was caused by Claimant's unwillingness to accommodate
the GOB's desire for a smelter and claims that, if Claimant had changed its mind at any

time, the GOB would not have needed its own smelter project. !7!

1092. According to Respondent, all three versions of the PC-1 proposal show that the GOB's
project was complementary to Claimant's mining project and not competitive with it.
Respondent emphasizes that the (only) reference to mining in the third PC-1 proposal
contemplates the possibility of mining 15,000 t/d to supply the smelter, based on a budget
of approximately US$ 100 million (compared to US$ 3.8 billion allocated by Claimant in

order to mine the proposed 110,000 t/d).!?!+

1093. Respondent notes that the budget in Balochistan's project was actually allocated to "costs
of ore" and argues that the Governments had not yet made a decision whether to purchase
the ore from the CHEJVA or another mining project or whether to conduct the limited
mining required to supply their smelter themselves. !7!> In addition, Respondent submits
that, contrary to Claimant's allegation, the heavy machinery listed in the "Funds

Required" document was not required for mining operations, but rather for processing. !7!°

1094. Respondent emphasizes that the Governments communicated to Claimant from the outset
that they were considering options for setting up a smelter/refinery in Pakistan and refers
to the Working Papers circulated prior to the second Steering Committee meeting on 23
January 2009 and the third Steering Committee meeting on 13 March 2009, as well as to

Claimant's notes of its meetings with Chief Secretary Lehri on 4 March 2010 and on 2
June 2010.'2!7

1095. With regard to Claimant's reliance on the 24 December 2009 Working Paper, Respondent

claims that this document is "merely a discussion paper" and does not reflect what
actually happened at or after the Cabinet meeting.'?!* Respondent also refers to the
Minutes of the Cabinet Meeting on 24 December 2009 and puts particular emphasis on
the decision "in principle" to take over Claimant's project, but also a decision that the
"future course of action would be decided by the Chief Minister," meaning that the Chief
Minister had a free hand. Respondent further argues that the Chief Minister did not decide
to "take over" the project, but rather opted to continue negotiations with Claimant in 2010
and even 2011, and actually wanted to buy concentrate from it.'?!° In Respondent's view,

this was accepted by Claimant at the Hearing. !?”°

1096.In support of its argument that the Government continued to negotiate with Claimant in
good faith and wanted the project to proceed, Respondent refers to a meeting of the Chief
Minister with Claimant in January 2010 and a further meeting between Chief Secretary
Lehri and Claimant on 4 March 2010 in which Mr. Lehri stated, according to Claimant's
notes, that "in his assessment TCC (Antofagasta/Barrick) was the best company to
implement the Reko Diq project."'??! However, Respondent notes that Mr. Lehri also
pointed out the need to develop a lobby in support of the project and that TCC should
agree to supply 25% of their output to the Government smelter, contribute to building a
road from Gwadar to Reko Dig, set up 20-25 scholarships for students from western
Balochistan at the Khuzdar University of Technology and Engineering and make public
its plans for large scale training of Baloch people being prepared by TCC to meet its
commitment to employ as many Baloch people as possible — in order to maintain a "social

licence to operate."'?>

1097. Respondent also refers to the Board of Governors' Meeting on 28 May 2010 in which the
Chief Minister stated:

"If TCC is keen on a mining lease, then they can have it. We will buy
the ore from them and do the refining and metal production ourselves.
. . .The future role of [TCC] will be decided by the Government of
Balochistan, after they apply for mining lease."'?%

1098. Respondent claims that the Chief Minister's intentions were communicated to Claimant
at a meeting on 2 June 2010:

“DG(M) informed the Tethyan team of the Ist meeting of the BOG for
the Reko Dig Refinery. The salient points that came under discussion in
the meeting were as follows:

a. GOB made its final decision to go for a refinery that would be
made with the help of GOP at site.

b. The refinery would get its concentrate / ore from Tethyan and
Saindak and processing of Copper would be carried at site. It was
decided that Tethyan would be told to apply for a mining lease
and the lease would be approved under the Balochistan Mining
Rules.

c.  Tethyan would supply concentrate / ore to the refinery set up by
the GOB and GOB would buy it on international market rate.”'?*4

1099.Respondent submits that Claimant agreed in principle to this supply-purchase
arrangement, as is apparent from its letter to the GOB dated 5 October 2010,'??> and

argues that this arrangement would not have worked if Claimant had not received a

mining lease; thus, the Chief Minister could not have intended otherwise. 1226

that "we will do the mining" to supply the GOB's smelter, as it was envisaged in the third
PC-1 proposal, but not to take over Claimant's proposed project. !727

1101.Respondent refers to Claimant's reliance on the 30 May 2011 Working Paper, in which

the Chief Minister's stated that "we will do the mining," and claims that it would not have
made sense to "carefully prepare" this document "recording the GOB's legitimate
concerns regarding the Feasibility Study" if the decision to reject the Mining Lease

Application had already been taken. !778

1102. According to Respondent, the reference to the remark of the Chief Minister ("we will do
the mining") in the Director General's internal letter of 12 September 2011 reflects that
the Director General had not been involved in the Government's project and therefore
sought clarification from his superior the Secretary of the MMDD when he learned of an
apparent decision on the Government's project.'??? In Respondent's view, the
Government's decision to conduct limited mining activities itself did not intend to oust
Claimant from its project, which is confirmed by the Chief Minister's press statement of
15 September 2011: "Jf Tethyan wants to do the mining, well and good, but I have decided

that the total refining will be done by us."'?°°

1103. Respondent further claims that the instruction of the Secretary to the Director General on
16 September to "dispose off [sic] the Mining Lease application" meant that the
application should be considered in accordance with the 2002 BM Rules and contends
that when the Director General did so, his decision was not affected by the Government's
steps in 2012 to implement its own project.'2*! Finally, Respondent notes that pursuant to
its draft mining lease application of 25 April 2012, the Government intended to mine only
15,000 t/d and proposed to start at H4, which was not covered by Claimant's Feasibility
Study. In any event, Respondent contends that the Government's Reko Diq project was
never implemented and has now been abandoned. !7°7

iii. Claimant's Assertion of a Composite Breach of the Fair and Equitable

take over the Reko Diq project as well as the Governments' conduct in the Mineral

Agreement negotiations and the Supreme Court proceedings. !?77

1105.Respondent notes that Claimant has thereby abandoned its claims that some of those acts

were wrongful per se, and instead invokes a concept of State responsibility that "usually
operates .. . in the context of genocide, apartheid, crimes against humanity or systemic
discrimination." In Respondent's view, the Tribunal should reject this alleged "composite
breach," as there is no precedent for it and "barely a scintilla of justification" in the law

of State responsibility. !?°4

1106.Respondent submits that Claimant abandoned its claim that the Government's and the

Supreme Court's conduct during the Supreme Court proceedings constituted a breach of
the FET obligation because there is no evidence that the Supreme Court was influenced
in its decision making by any improper pressure or request from the Governments.
Respondent refers to the order of May 2011 by which the Supreme Court ordered that the
Mining Lease Application should be dealt with on the merits and should not be affected
by the pending Supreme Court proceedings.'?*> In addition, Respondent notes that the
Application was rejected in November 2011 and the Supreme Court’s decision was
rendered in 2013; thus, the latter cannot have played any causative role in the rejection of

the Application. '?*°

1107.In any event, Respondent submits that Claimant does not explain how the Supreme

Court’s decision affects any purported investment and notes that Claimant has not pleaded
that there has been any denial of justice. Respondent further argues that (a) Balochistan's
change of position on the validity of the CHEJVA was due to new evidence that came to
light as a consequence of the Supreme Court ordering disclosure of documents; (b) the
Supreme Court's judgment was correct under Pakistani law and Claimant's Pakistani
lawyers never stated that there was any issue related to due process in those proceedings;
and (c) Claimant's complaints about the discussion of ICSID jurisprudence at the end of

the Supreme Court's decision is irrelevant to the evaluation of Claimant's FET claim.!?*7

1108. With regard to the Mineral Agreement negotiations, Respondent claims that Claimant

attempted to obtain fiscal and legal exemptions, including from the Licensing Authority's
discretion to grant or reject mining lease applications, and thereby sought a guaranteed
"right to mine" for multiple, not yet defined, mining projects within the area covered by

argues that this request was intended to circumvent the requirements under rules 47 and

made it clear in their revised draft that TCCP "shall be subject" to all provisions of the

revised draft and expressed its disagreement with the royalty rate of 5%, the lack of EPZ
status, the introduction of a Management Committee and the fact that the Mineral
Agreement would be subject to the 2002 BM Rules. '*“° In addition, Respondent maintains

that the Governments reiterated the smelter/refinery requirement to which Claimant was
not willing to accede, !*4! emphasizing, however, that the "central message" was whether
the Mineral Agreement should override the 2002 BM Rules or "it should be the other way

around."2

1110.Respondent claims that despite Claimant's attempt to obtain legally impossible
concessions and its failure to address the value addition requirement as well as the
Governments' financial concerns, which ultimately caused the negotiations to stall, the
Governments continued to negotiate with Claimant throughout 2010 and even in 201 1.!743

and (e) officials from both Governments in July 2011.!74?

1111.In Respondent's view, the falsity of Claimant's allegation that the Governments conducted
the negotiations in bad faith is further confirmed by the fact that the Governments did not
even consider proposals from other parties such as MCC, despite the fact that they would
have offered significantly more attractive terms. '?°

iv. Claimant's Own Conduct Precludes a Finding that the FET Standard
was Breached

1112.Finally, Respondent refers to the three duties of an investor set out by Professor
Muchlinski, i.e., "a duty to refrain from unconscionable conduct, a duty to engage in the
investment in light of an adequate knowledge of its risks, and a duty to conduct its
investment in a reasonable manner." Respondent claims that Claimant breached each of
these duties and therefore cannot rely on provisions of the Treaty to cure the defects in its

own conduct. !25!

1113. Respondent argues that Claimant did not "refrain from unconscionable conduct" because
it sought illegal exemptions from mandatory local legislative requirements under the 2002
BM Rules and filed a Mining Lease Application that it must have known was doomed to
fail, in order to "manufactur[e]" its international arbitration claims seeking specific

performance. '?>>

1114.In addition, Respondent claims that Claimant did not "engage in the investment in light
of an adequate knowledge of its risks" because it failed to conduct a proper risk
assessment when it began its activities in an underdeveloped region with limited
experience in large-scale mining; it failed to conduct a proper due diligence into BHP's
activities prior to acquiring its interest and the requirements of the BM Rules; and it also

failed to address the need to maintain a "social licence to operate" in Balochistan. !?>?

1115.Finally, Respondent contends that Claimant did not "conduct its investment in a
reasonable manner" because it tried to mislead the Governments with regard to the
economic viability of its project, in particular by making incorrect assumptions in the
Feasibility Study and stating before the Supreme Court that it was "still confident that the

international financial community will be willing and happy to finance this project." In
Respondent's view, Claimant's attempt to "force through" its Application despite the
"numerous shortcomings" in the Feasibility Study" likewise reflected the unreasonable
manner in which Claimant pursued its project. !?4

ec. The Tribunal's Analysis

1116.It is Claimant's position that there were two separate, independent breaches of the FET
obligation by (i) the denial of the Mining Lease Application; and (ii) the development and
implementation of the GOB's plan to take over Claimant's project. In addition, Claimant
claims that there was a composite breach of the FET standard by the foregoing conduct,
together with the Governments’ conduct in the Mineral Agreement negotiations and/or
the Supreme Court proceedings.

1117.In the Tribunal's view, however, a separate analysis of the purported individual breaches
appears rather artificial because the two are inextricably linked. The planned takeover of
Claimant's project, if proven as the motive for denying the Mining Lease Application
would, in the absence of any valid grounds for the denial, be the ground upon which the
denial amounted to a violation of Respondent's FET obligation.

1118. Therefore, the Tribunal will assess as a first step whether Claimant has established that
there was a plan to take over Claimant's project and whether this motive informed the
decision of the Licensing Authority to deny TCCP's Mining Lease Application. However,
even if the Tribunal were to conclude that this was indeed the case, this would not in itself
be sufficient for a finding that the denial of the Mining Lease Application amounted to a
violation of the FET obligation. In its Notice of Intent to Reject, the Licensing Authority
did not invoke the GOB's own project as a ground for denial but rather, on its face, based
its decision on ten other grounds, which could lead to the conclusion that there were in
fact legitimate reasons for denying the Mining Lease Application.

1119. Consequently, the Tribunal will analyze as a second step whether the Grounds given in
the Notice of Intent to Reject and/or the additional reasons invoked by Respondent in this
arbitration nevertheless provide a justified basis for the denial or whether they rather
served as a pretext designed to conceal the true motive of implementing the GOB's own
project. Only if the latter were the case, the Tribunal would reach the conclusion that
Respondent has breached its FET obligation under Article 3(2) of the Treaty.

i. The Takeover of Claimant's Project as a Motive for Denying the Mining
Lease Application

1120. At the outset, the Tribunal notes that it is undisputed between the Parties that the GOB
prepared a total of three proposals for a "Reko Dig Gold/Copper Project," the third of
which was approved by an organ of the Federal Planning Commission (the CDWP) on 9
December 2009 and by the ECNEC, the Executive Committee of Pakistan's National
Economic Council, on 9 December 2010. The Parties are in dispute, however, as to
whether this project was meant to be complementary to Claimant's project, as alleged by
Respondent, or whether it was a competitive project by means of which the GOB intended
to "oust" Claimant from the Reko Dig area, as alleged by Claimant.

1121.In light of the differing submissions of the Parties on the purpose of the GOB's project,
the Tribunal has reviewed the contemporaneous evidence in order to shed light on the
project's scope as it evolved over the course of the proposals and through the decisions
taken by the relevant authorities.

(a) The Evidentiary Record on the Scope of the GOB's Project

1122. The first proposal that was submitted on 16 May 2009 contemplated "the processing of
copper ore 5000-tons per day to produce copper metal and other valuables."'?> The
second proposal submitted on 19 October 2009 was still based on the plan to process
5,000 tons of ore per day, but included in its cost analysis an item "Annual profit for
processing 15000 ton/day."'?5°

1123.In its Working Paper for the Planning Commission dated 17 November 2009, the
Planning & Development Division of the GOP stated in relation to the "Status of Mining
Rights":

"It is understood that Tethyan Copper Company (TCC) is a joint
venture between Antofagasta of Chile and Barrick Gold of Canada and
has completed exploratory work in its mining concession, which is valid
up to 2010. The sponsors may clarify whether Government of
Balochistan is legally bound to convert Exploration License into long
term renewable mining lease for thirty (30) years under Balochistan

Mining Concession Rules 2002 or not. If so, then what would be their
strategy to implement the subject project?"'?>"

1124. The third proposal that was submitted and approved by the CDWP on 9 December 2009
was still based on the plan to process 5,000 tons of ore per day but nevertheless included
in its "Annual operating and maintenance cost after completion of the project" an item
"Mining of Ore 15000 ton/day." '?°8

1125.The Working Paper for a meeting of the Balochistan Cabinet on 24 December 2009 that
was prepared by the MMDD sets out a total of 13 items as "Justification for taking over
the Project by Balochistan Government": (i) transfer of TCCP's shares to Antofagasta and
Barrick Gold without the GOB's consent; (ii) TCCP's reluctance to build a refinery plant;
(iii) TCCP's refusal to exempt the GOB from its obligation to invest into the project in
accordance with its 25% equity share; (iv) TCCP's desire to obtain exemptions from
federal and provincial taxes through the Mineral Agreement; (v) TCCP's unwillingness
to invest into a mining academy; (vi) TCCP's plan to transport the ore via pipeline to the
Gwadar port and then on to Chile / Canada for refining purposes; (vii) TCCP's lack of a
mining lease to be granted by the Licensing Authority, which "can exercise his [sic]
power to reject Mining Lease for the better interest of the province"; (viii) the PC-1
proposal submitted by the GOB for processing 15,000 tons of ore per day; "[flor this
processing plant we require Ore that's why the mining activities are also required to be
undertaken by the Provincial Government for smooth and efficient supply of Ore"; (ix)
the expiry of the agreement between the GOP and MCC on the Saindak Copper & Gold
Project in October 2011, which would then be handed over to Balochistan so that the ore
produced in the Saindak mine could also be used for the GOB's project; (x) an anticipated
annual profit of the GOB's project in the amount of Rs. 15,375 million; (xi) technical
assistance ensured by the Director General, Strategic Plans Division for mining copper
and gold at Reko Diq; (xii) sufficient technical staff at the MMDD "to run mining
activities efficiently," in particular after having absorbed the mining staff of the BDA;
(xiii) anticipated submission of a PC-1 proposal by the MMDD for "carrying out mining

activities in the mine areas of Reko-Dig."'??

1126. Against this background, the MMDD requested that the Balochistan Cabinet "solicit
approval for awarding the mining rights of Reko-Diq Copper / Gold Project to [the

MMDD} for the larger interests of the province."'?

1127.Claimant further submitted a PowerPoint presentation that was apparently presented at
the 24 December 2009 meeting. The document itself, which is entitled "REKO DIQ
Gold/Copper 2009,"'?5! is undated and does not reveal the occasion at which it was
presented. However, Claimant pointed out during the Hearing and again in its Post-
Hearing Brief that Respondent disclosed the presentation during document production as
"Presentation on ‘Baluchistan Copper Gold Project' given to the Baluchistan Cabinet in
its meeting on 24 December 2009." '?° Respondent did not dispute that it had described
the presentation in this manner. The cost analysis presented therein includes an item
"Annual profit for processing 30000 ton/day."'?? Under the heading "Mining," the
document states:

"The growth path currently envisaged, will start at
5,000 T/d and expanding to
15,000 t/d (year 4),
30,000 t/d (year 6) and
60,000 t/d (year 10),"'?64

1128. The minutes of the Balochistan Cabinet meeting on 24 December 2009 record under item
no. 4 on the agenda, i.e., "Taking over of Rekodiq Copper & Gold Project from TCCP by
the Government of Balochistan," that "[t]he agenda was approved in principle. It was
further decided not to go ahead with the proposed Mineral and Shareholder agreements
with TCCP. Further course of action would be decided by the Chief Minister."!?°

1129.In a memorandum to the Chief Secretary dated 31 December 2009, the Secretary of the
MMDD reported on the progress made by Claimant's project and concluded by stating:

"Since the Government of Balochistan has decided to take over the
project from TCCP, it is utmost important to establish a camp office of

1130.In a further memorandum to the Chief Minister dated 11 February 2010, the Secretary of
the MMDD reported on the negotiations of legal services to be rendered in relation to the
Reko Dig Gold/Copper Project and stated:

"In the aftermath of the decision of the Provincial Cabinet to take over

the Reko-Dig Project from Tethyan Copper Company Pakistan (TCCP)

..., it was deemed necessary to engage Legal Advisor / Consultant for

advi[cle before issuing legal notice to TCC for cancellation of

Exploration Agreement."'?°

1131.On 18 March 2010, the CDWP recommended the GOB's project for submission to the

ECNEC. According to the project description, the "Government of Balochistan envisages
creating a facility for processing 15,000 tons per day of copper ore to produce copper
metal, and other valuables." However, the breakdown of the capital cost again included
the item "Mining of Ore 15,000 ton/day."'76

1132.According to the minutes of the Board of Governors meeting on 28 May 2010, Dr.
Mubarakmand informed the other participants of the meeting that Claimant was not
willing to refine the ore within Pakistan, but was planning to export the ore for the refining
process. He then stated that "[w]ith deposits worth billions of dollar discovered till now,
it is worth considering that the ore may be kept within the country and refined locally"
and requested guidance from the Chief Minister. In response to the Chief Minister's
inquiry whether they should adopt a course of litigation, Dr. Mubarakmand stated that he
would not recommend litigation, but rather to inquire about Claimant's willingness "for
mining the ore only while the Government of Balochistan may install and commission the

refining plant." '?

1133. When another Board member raised the concern that "only giving prospect license will

earn a bad reputation for the country," the Chief Minister stated that "national interest is
above all" and observed that "if TCC is keen on a mining licence, then they can have it.

in mining and processing of minerals"; "Inadequate infrastructure for mining"; and "Dependence on foreign
companies." The "Sector Strategy" included, inter alia, the following items: "Indigenously development of mineral
resources"; "Self-reliance in the production of Hi-tech materials"; and "Infrastructure development.” Exhibit RE-

We will buy the ore from them and do the refining and metal production ourselves."'?”°

The Board ultimately decided, inter alia, as follows:

"(iii) The future role of Tithium Copper Company (TCC) will be
decided by the Government of Balochistan, after they apply for mining
lease.

(iv) Plants for refining and production of pure copper and gold will
be designed, developed and commissioned in Balochistan and under no
circumstances will the pure metals be allowed to leave the country."!77!

1134.On 3 December 2010, Dr. Mubarakmand, who led the technical development of the
GOB's project, participated in a talkshow on the Duniya television network. Dr.
Mubarakmand emphasized that, while the exploration work at Reko Diq had been
performed by a foreign company, Pakistan itself possessed the technical capability for the
mining of copper and gold and added that "it remains to be seen whether the government
of Baluchistan will sanction the mining contract to Pakistan or to foreign companies." 7”
In response to the interviewer's comment that the GOB "should give the contract to the
local companies rather than the outsiders," Dr. Mubarakmand stated:

"This is the reason why I had developed a technical project and
presented it to the Chief Minister of Baluchistan. He appreciated my
efforts and endorsed that this project should be handled by Pakistani
scientists and engineers. If our project is approved in the ACNEC
meeting on December 9, 2010, the Baluchistan government has the
funds for us to start work on this project."

1135.On 9 December 2010, the ECNEC considered the Summary on the Reko Diq
Gold/Copper Project that the Federal Planning Commission had submitted to it on 15 July
2010. According to the minutes of the 9 December 2010 meeting, the ECNEC was
informed that the "Government of Balochistan envisaged creating a facility for
processing 15,000 tons per day of copper ore to produce copper metal and other
valuables." The minutes further record:

"It was also added that a foreign firm had done a feasibility study, but
they intend to work as a joint venture, but would take raw gold/copper
for refinery to their country at 50:50 share, thus it could not be
established as to whether final distribution would be fair or not?

ECNEC was apprised that local technology and expertise is available
to develop the mines, therefore it would be appropriate to consider this
option in the larger national interest. It was also pointed out that some

s related to the project are pending consideration in the courts of
1274

 

case:
law.

1136. At the meeting, the ECNEC approved the GOB's project and further directed:

"If an agreement has not been signed with any firm for mining and
refining etc, then Govt. of Balochistan may decide, as to whether the
project is to be executed by them. If the project is to be bifurcated
involving some other companies, the draft agreement shall be vetted by
Law & Justice Division to ensure transparency and consistency with
International Law.

L..]

Before launching the project, Government of Balochistan will check
from the courts about litigation on the issue, if any."!2

1137.On 15 December 2010, Dr. Mubarakmand gave a telephone interview on Dawn television
about the GOB's project and confirmed that "ECNEC has approved this project and the
project is to be done by Pakistan herself. ... There is no discussion regarding the
involvement of foreign companies in it."!?"° In response to the interviewer's comment that
"it is generally said that mining contracts are awarded to those companies who do the
exploration work" and the question what the "best international practices" were in this
regard, Dr. Mubarakmand stated:

"Under the international best practices it is not necessary that one who
does exploration will also get the mining license. People initially enter
into an exploration contract with the Government which owns the
minerals. This contract contains terms and conditions whether or not
the exploration license will convert into a mining license and upon
which terms. So the exploration license which they [Tethyan Copper
Company] obtained from the Balochistan Government must in my
opinion contain such terms and conditions. The Balochistan
Government and this company must be aware of such terms and
conditions in accordance with which a mining license can or cannot be
awarded. This condition must be there."1277

1138.In his submission to the Supreme Court dated 19 January 2011, Dr. Mubarakmand
compared the total profit (share) to be generated by the GOB over the 56-year life of the
mine under (i) the project presented by Claimant in its Feasibility Study (US$ 8.97
billion); and (ii) the GOB's own project (US$ 131.824 billion).'?” With regard to the
GOB's project, Dr. Mubarakmand explained that, while the plant would initially be
installed for processing 15,000 tons of ore per day, "as the mine grows wider and deeper
with time, more ore is expected per day and therefore every 5-6 years the size of the plant
is enhanced."!7”° He emphasized:

"That the local project is designed to start with mining of the Ore and
finally produce 99.9% pure Copper and Gold metal. All steps of the
process are catered for in the design of the plant and have been duly
budgeted." 78°

1139.Dr. Mubarakmand further submitted:

"That the Feasibility Study submitted by TCC is just the tip of the ice
berg in the EL-S5 area. If the indigenous project is sanctioned though a
decision of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and the Government of
Balochistan, it will be launched using the H-15 Ore deposits. That while
the project is running, a massive exploration effort will simultaneously
commence to bring out the content and location of mineral deposits
containing Copper, Gold or other metals in the Chaghi region." '?5!

1140. Three days later, the GOB also filed a submission in the Supreme Court proceedings in
which it informed the Court about the approval of its project by ECNEC and stated that
this approval was "also in conformity with the earlier decision taken by the Balochistan
Cabinet on 26 December 2009 wherein the Balochistan Government had expressed its
interest to execute the project."'*8* The GOB further stated that it considered TCC's
Feasibility Study "deficient in several aspects," although it was still in the course of being
examined, and submitted:

"That it is thus clear that no entity holding a license for exploration has
a vested right for the grant of the mineral concession and the grant of
the said right / concession, partly or fully continues to be the discretion
of the Government of Balochistan.

That accordingly, the Government of Balochistan is interested to
implement the approval / decision received from the ECNEC and also
take appropriate decision in its own right about the fate of the mining
concession based on its independent judgment." 78

1141. Balochistan concluded by requesting that the Supreme Court:

"permit the Government of Balochistan to execute the decision of the
ECNEC dated 9.12.2010 while declaring that in the circumstances of
the case, no entity has any vested right for the mining concession and
that only the Government of Balochistan can take any decision in this
regard in the best national interest." 784

1142.On 25 April 2012, Balochistan prepared, but ultimately did not file,'**° a mining lease
application for an area identical to the Mining Area that TCCP had applied for in its
Mining Lease Application of 15 February 2011.!78° On 20 May 2012, Balochistan
submitted a proposal to the Federal Planning Commission regarding a water supply
project for its Reko Diq Copper Gold Project that envisaged using water from the
"Baghicha Site," i.e., the same groundwater source that Claimant had discovered and
identified in its Feasibility Study as the groundwater source for its mining operations. !?°7
Finally, on 30 May 2012, Balochistan also applied for surface rights at Reko Dig, which
overlapped Claimant's exclusive Surface Rights Lease and proposed Mining Area. !8°

1143.In its meeting on 12 September 2012, the Board of Governors decided, inter alia, as
follows:

"Government of Balochistan will grant permission to B{alochistan]

The area previously identified by ... BGCP in their application may be
reserved for the project for their future activities and that the same may
not be allotted to any other agency or organization." '78°

(b) The Tribunal's Considerations on the Evidentiary Record

1144. In the Tribunal's view, the contemporaneous evidence shows that the GOB's project was
not only a complementary smelting project intended to process ore that it would buy from
Claimant (or any other mining company operating in Pakistan). The question raised in the
Working Paper of 17 November 2009 whether the GOB was bound to convert Claimant's
Exploration License into a mining lease and if so "what would be the strategy to
implement the project?" rather demonstrates that at least as of that time, the GOB intended

to implement a competing mining project in the same area. !2°°

1145.The third and final proposal that was ultimately approved by the Planning Commission
and the ECNEC further explicitly provided for a budget for the mining of ore at a rate of
15,000 tons per day. !?*! The Tribunal is aware that Claimant's project envisaged an initial
rate of 110,000 tons per day, later expanding to 220,000 tons per day, and thus was
planned to operate at a larger scale. The PowerPoint presentation that was apparently
presented during the Balochistan Cabinet meeting on 24 December 2009 indicates that
the GOB intended to expand its own mining operations beyond 15,000 tons per day (up
to 60,000 tons per day within ten years). !?°?

1146. A further indication for an expansion plan is contained in Dr. Mubarakmand's 19 January
2011 submission in which he stated that the size of the plant would be enhanced every
five to six years along with the growth of the mine.!2°* However, the Tribunal notes that
Dr. Mubarakmand was not a Government official and would have required the approval
of the relevant authorities for his plans. Given that none of the summaries and/or working
papers prepared by Government officials on the project mention such expansion plans,
the Tribunal is not convinced that the GOB in fact had a concrete plan at the time to
expand the capacity of its project to a scale comparable to that of Claimant's project.

1147.In the Tribunal's view, however, it is not relevant whether the GOB's project was at the
same scale as Claimant's project. What matters is whether the implementation of the
Government's project excluded the simultaneous implementation of Claimant's project
and therefore presented a motive for denying TCCP'S Mining Lease Application. The

Tribunal considers it established that the GOB intended to mine (at least) 15,000 tons of
ore per day at the area that was covered by Claimant's Exploration License (EL-5) and
would have been part of Claimant's proposed Mining Area.'?” In particular, the Tribunal
is not convinced by Respondent's argument that it included the budget for mining only in
case it did not reach an agreement with Claimant on the supply of ore.

1148.The minutes of the 24 December 2009 Cabinet meeting, the 31 December 2009
memorandum to the Chief Secretary as well as the 11 February 2010 memorandum to the
Chief Minister record that the GOB had decided to "take over" the project from
Claimant. '?°> The Tribunal does not follow Respondent's argument that this was only a
decision in principle which had to be, and never was, implemented by the Chief Minister.
Contrary to Respondent's submission, after the decision to "take over" the project and
"not to go ahead with" the negotiations of the Mineral Agreement and the Project
Agreement had been made, no actual negotiations took place but only high-level meetings
in which Claimant was assured that there was no competing project. In addition, the GOB
even considered in February 2010 that it was "necessary to engage Legal Advisor /
Consultant for advi{cle before issuing legal notice to TCC for cancellation of Exploration

Agreement." !?°6

1149.Further, the Working Paper for the 24 December 2009 meeting that sets out the
"Justification for taking over the Project by Balochistan Government" expressly states
that "mining activities are also required to be undertaken by the Provincial Government"
and that the MMDD was planning to submit a PC-1 proposal "for carrying out mining
activities in the mine areas of Reko Dig"; finally, the MMDD requested that the Cabinet
"solicit approval for awarding the mining rights of Reko-Diq Copper / Gold Project to
[the MMDD] for the larger interests of this province."'?9"

1150. Finally, Dr. Mubarakmand's contemporaneous statements both during the interviews that
he gave in December 2010 and in his submission to the Supreme Court in January 2011
demonstrate that he considered the GOB's project as an alternative, and not a supplement,
to Claimant's project.!?°° While Dr. Mubarakmand served as a member of the Pakistan

2 Tp his 19 January 2011 submission, Dr. Mubarakmand stated that the GOB's project would be launched by
using the H-15 deposits, i.e., the same deposits that Claimant intended to form part of its Initial Mine Development.
Exhibit CE-269, { 17. In his witness statement, Dr. Mubarakmand stated that when he was instructed "to go ahead
with the project" in May/June 2012, he decided that the best place for the mining was H-4 in order to "avoid any
dispute with the Claimant over the areas that it had identified in their Feasibility Study, H-14 and H-15" and also
for technical reasons (at H-4, the copper is closer to the surface than at H-14 and H-15, and it contains copper
oxide ore which is easier and less energy intensive to refine). Mubarakmand I, { 17.

Planning Commission and was appointed as Chairman of the Board of Governors of the
Reko Dig Project, his conduct as such may not be attributable to Respondent because he
may not have been a "Government official." Nevertheless, the Tribunal recalls that he was
responsible for the technical development of the project that was fully endorsed by the
GOB and approved by the CDWP and later the ECNEC. Therefore, there is at least a
strong indication that his statements reflected the view taken by the GOB and the relevant
authorities as well.

1151.In the Tribunal's view, this is sufficient evidence that mining activities formed part of the
GOB's project and that the GOB thus did not intend to implement a complementary
processing project, but rather a competing mining and processing project (albeit at a
smaller scale) that was not compatible with Claimant's project. This is confirmed by the
fact that the GOB ultimately sought a mining lease over the exact same area that TCCP.

had proposed as the Mining Area in its Mining Lease Application. !2°°

1152. This finding is not contradicted by the statement made by the Chief Minister in the 28
May 2010 meeting of the Board of Governors that "if TCC is keen on a mining licence,
then they can have it. We will buy the ore from them and do the refining and metal
production ourselves."'*°° While the GOB may have been willing to consider buying the
ore from Claimant, the Chief Minister's further statement that "national interest is above
all" and the Board's resolution that the "future role of [TCC] will be decided by the
Government of Balochistan, after they apply for mining lease"'*°! shows clearly that the

GOB did not consider itself bound by the contractual commitments and assurances it had

given to Claimant. The GOB rather considered that it could interpret the requirements in

the 2002 BM Rules, in particular rule 48(3)(a)(vi), in a manner that would allow it to
impose any obligation on Claimant that would be labelled as being in the "national
interest." This approach is confirmed by Balochistan's submission in the Supreme Court
proceedings dated 22 January 2011 in which it requested that the Supreme Court allow it
to execute its own project and declared that "no entity has any vested right for the mining
concession and that only the Government of Balochistan can take any decision in this

regard in the best national interest."

1153. The Tribunal recalls its statement above that the desire of the GOB to implement its own
project as such does not impact Claimant's investment and therefore cannot constitute an
FET breach in itself, but only if it is established that this desire became the motive for
denying TCCP's Mining Lease Application. In this regard, the Tribunal considers that the

remarks made by Chief Minister Raisani as recorded in the letter from the Director
General to the Secretary of the MMDD dated 12 September 2012 and their apparent
impact on the decision of the Licensing Authority are particularly relevant. The Chief
Minister is recorded to have said:

"It was decided by the Board of Governors that:-

i) We will do the mining

ii) We will do the refining."

1154.In light of these remarks, the Director General (i.e., the Licensing Authority) requested
from the Secretary of the MMDD (i.e., his superior and the appellate authority) that
"future line of action in the matter kindly be conveyed whether the TCC be refused Mining
Lease for Reko-Digq Gold-Gold Project or otherwise." > In response to this request, the
Secretary of the MMDD requested on 13 September 2011 "to dispose off the Mining
Lease application." °° While the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that the term "dispose
off’ could be interpreted differently and does not necessarily imply that the Application
was to be rejected, the Tribunal has to take into account the context of the Director
General's request for guidance. In this particular context, the Secretary's instruction can
only be understood to mean that the Director General should decide on the Application
in line with the Chief Minister's remarks, i.e., that he should deny the Application.

1155.At this point, the Tribunal notes that the Chief Minister, the Director General and/or the
Secretary of the MMDD could have explained in evidence that the refusal of the Mining
Lease Application was nevertheless a bona fide decision, which was taken independently
of the developments regarding the GOB's project, but Respondent decided not to present
any of them as a witness in this arbitration. Consequently, there is no evidence that would
rebut the strong indication from the above-mentioned evidence that the refusal was
motivated by the GOB's desire to take over the project from Claimant.

1156.In fact, the Tribunal considers that this indication is confirmed by the various news
articles, which record statements made by Government officials with regard to the project
at the time. For example, the online edition of the Pakistani newspaper The Dawn reported
on 25 December 2009, i.e., the day after the Cabinet meeting in which it was decided to
take over the project, that the "Reko Dik exploration contract [was] cancelled." The article
cited Chief Minister Raisani stating that the "[c]ancellation of the Reko Dik copper and

gold project agreement is a step towards getting control over provincial resources in

accordance with the wishes of the people."'3°°

1157.On 22 May 2010, Balochistan's Directorate of Public Relations issued a press release
describing an "official handout" issued the day before, which reportedly stated that "the
foremost objective of the provincial government would be to take full control of Reko-Diq
Copper and Gold Project from its present operators i.e. M/s. Tethyan Copper Company
(TCC) and thereafter the provincial government would run the project itself." Pursuant
to the press release, the newly constituted Board of Governors would discuss at its first
meeting "the role of TCC in the project, if any." The press release then reported that "[t]he
Government of Balochistan had decided to take over the Reko-Diq Copper and Gold
Project and cancel the agreement with TCCP" and quoted the thirteen grounds referred

to in the Working Paper for the 24 December 2009 Cabinet meeting. '°”

1158. According to a further news article in The Dawn dated 4 November 2010, Chief Minister
Raisani said that "[TCC's] exploration licence would expire next year and his government
had decided that afterwards it would run the project itself."'*°* On the same day, the daily
newspaper Balochistan Express also reported that Chief Minister Raisani had said that "a
company had been issued only exploration license and it will be ended in 2011 after that

government will take over the project."

1159. While the Tribunal is aware that officials from both the GOB and the GOP repeatedly
assured Claimant's representatives during this time period that these news articles and
also the press release issued by Balochistan's own public relations department did not
represent the official position of the Governments, it rather appears that the press was
given reasonably accurate accounts of the GOB's decision. In particular, the press release
quoted from an "official handout" that used the same wording that was also used in the
Working Paper for, and the meeting minutes of, the 24 December 2009 Cabinet meeting
strongly indicates that it was rather TCC that was deceived until it had finished and
submitted its Feasibility Study to the GOB. Dr. Mubarakmand further expressly stated
during his 15 December 2010 interview: "Now when we work we will have the results of
exploration in front of us which will help us and we will be able to benefit from those
results."'>'° Therefore, the Tribunal considers that the press coverage in 2010 reinforces
its conclusion that the GOB had decided to take over the project and, accordingly, to deny
TCCP's Mining Lease Application.

1160. However, as stated at the outset of its analysis, the Tribunal considers that the existence
of such motive in itself is not sufficient for a finding that Respondent is in breach of its
FET obligation because there may have been, at the same time, legitimate reasons for
denying the Mining Lease Application. The Tribunal will therefore assess in a second
step whether the Grounds given in the Notice of Intent to Reject and/or the additional
reasons invoked by Respondent in this arbitration nevertheless provide a justified basis
for denial or whether they only served as a pretext to disguise the true motive of
implementing the GOB's own project. Only if the latter were the case, the denial would
amount to a violation of Respondent's FET obligation.

ii. The Stated Grounds for Denying the Mining Lease Application

1161.As to the various grounds for the denial that Respondent invokes, the Tribunal will first
analyze the ten grounds given in the Notice of Intent to Reject. As both Parties grouped
these grounds into three main reasons in their Post-Hearing Briefs, the Tribunal will
follow this structure in its analysis as well. Thereafter, the Tribunal will determine
whether Respondent can rely on the additional grounds it invokes in this arbitration and
whether they could justify the denial of TCCP's Mining Lease Application.

(a) The Grounds Given in the Notice of Intent to Reject

1162.Before analyzing the three main reasons identified by the Parties in more detail, the
Tribunal will address the two grounds that were only summarily touched upon by the
Parties. The first ground states:

"That from the record, it appears that the Balochistan Development
Authority had signed a Chagai Hills Exploration Joint Venture
Agreement with BHP, thereafter M/S Tethyan Copper Company
Pakistan (Pvt) Ltd for exploration, evaluation of Gold, Copper and
Associated Minerals during the period of license existing for
exploration and prospecting of the area. The record reflects that neither
any company was registered and incorporated under the Companies
Act 1984 with the registrar of the Firm's nor in any other law.""3!!

1163. Pursuant to rule 47(1) of the 2002 BM Rules, "[a]n application for the grant of a mining
lease may be made only by a body corporate formed by or under a law for the time being
in force in Pakistan."'3!? The Mining Lease Application of 15 February 2011 was

submitted by TCCP and included in its enclosure no. 12 a copy of the Memorandum and

the Articles of Association of TCCP with an attested copy of its certificate of

8! Exhibit CE-7, { 1.
‘82 Exhibit RE-1, rule 47(1).

incorporation in Pakistan.'*!? Pursuant to this certificate of incorporation, TCCP is
incorporated as a company under Pakistani law as of 30 November 2000.'*'+ Therefore,
the Tribunal finds that there is no merit in the first ground given by the Licensing
Authority in its Notice of Intent to Reject.

1164. The fourth ground states:

"That on account of non-exploration and failure to explore the area
during the last 17 years, the Government of Balochistan and the local
inhabitants of the area has been deprived of the fruitful results."'3"

1165.Pursuant to rule 48(3)(a)(ii) of the 2002 BM Rules, the Licensing Authority shall not

grant the mining lease unless "the proposed plans for development and operation of the
mine and the programme of the mining operations of the applicant will ensure the
efficient, beneficial and timely use of the mineral resources."'*' In the Tribunal's view,
it is apparent from the evidentiary record that Claimant did not fail to explore the area
covered by Exploration License EL-5. Apart from the fact that the GOB was continuously
informed about the status and progress of the exploration work through both the
Operating Committee meetings, in which it was represented by the BDA and later by the
MMDD, and the quarterly reports that Claimant submitted to the GOB, the Tribunal
considers it established that Claimant has indeed performed a considerable amount of
work as recorded in the sections above on TCC's initial and expanded exploration work
during the time period from 2002 through 2009. '3!7

1166. The Tribunal recalls that the GOB itself recognized at various times that Claimant had

performed a significant amount of exploration work at Reko Diq. For example, in its
submission to the Balochistan High Court in 2007, the GOB stated:

"It was as a result of [the foreign investors' US$ 200 million] investment
that the large copper and gold deposits were discovered in 1996-1997.
[The GOB and the BDA] have been very closely monitoring the
progress of the subject project and receive [sic] Quarterly Reports
which detail the progress that is being made, local employment that has
been provided and investments made in each quarter." '*'8

1167.The MMDD also reported in its 31 December 2009 memorandum to the Chief Secretary:

313 Exhibit CE-6, p. 2.

314 Exhibit CE-14.

315 Exhibit C-7, 4.

1316 Exhibit RE-1, rule 48(3)(a(ii).

"[TCC] ha[s] done tremendous efforts in discovering the Reko-Diq
Copper & Gold prospects, and going according to schedule. ... Mining
is one of the most difficult activities to be carried out requiring huge
amount of investment, rich expertise and skills, and very careful
planning and proper management to make it a success. The way of
working and performance reflect that their attitude is serious and they
are committed to develop the project.""3!9

1168. In light of the above, the Tribunal sees no basis for the allegation that Claimant failed to
explore the area over the last 17 years and finds that there is no merit in the Licensing
Authority's fourth ground.

(i) The First Set of Grounds: TCCP Was Not the Proper
Applicant

1169. The first set of grounds invoked by Respondent is based on the argument that TCCP was
not eligible to file the Mining Lease Application without its Joint Venture partner under
the CHEJVA, given that it had not acquired the GOB's interest in the Joint Venture
beforehand. The fifth and sixth ground state:

"That the present application has been filed on behalf of M/S Tethyan
Copper Company Pakistan (Pvt) Ltd and not on behalf of co sharer,
who was alleged to be co-associate in the working project under the
Rule 48 of the Balochistan Mineral Rule 2002. Since the applicant
alone was not allottee of exploration licence and thus not legally
applicant is not competent to make application for grant of Mining
lease.

That the Mines Committee has noted the fact that the application was
received on 18-02-2011 and the licence had expired on 19-02-2011
later on request was made to the Secretary, Mines & Mineral
Department, Government of Balochistan on 03-03-2011 for
participating in the mining lease. This fact indicates that the
application was filed alone by the company and the co sharer was not
made party in it. In such circumstances, the application is incomplete
and is in violation of rule 48 of the Balochistan Minerals Rule,
2002." 1320

1170.As to the requirements to be met by TCCP, the Tribunal considers that it has to be
distinguished between (i) the regulatory requirements established by the 2002 BM Rules;
and (ii) the contractual procedure foreseen in the CHEJVA.

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1

1171.As stated above, rule 47(1) of the 2002 BM Rules requires that the applicant be "a body
corporate formed by or under a law for the time being in force in Pakistan."'*?! Rule
48(1) of the 2002 BM Rules refers to "the holder of exploration licence" making an
application for a mining lease and rule 48(2)(a) provides that a mining lease shall not be
granted "if, at the time of the application, any person other than the application holds any
exploration licence conferring an exclusive right to carry on exploration operations in
that area of land in respect of that mineral or group of minerals." Pursuant to rule
23(1)(a) of the 2002 BM Rules, "an exploration licence shall confer on the licensee — (a)
the exclusive right to carry on exploration operations in the exploration area in respect

of any mineral or group of minerals to which the licence relates." 373

1172.In sum, the 2002 BM Rules require that (i) the applicant is a company incorporated in
Pakistan; (ii) the applicant is an exploration license holder; and (iii) no person other
than the applicant has been granted an exclusive right to explore the area over which the
mining lease is being sought. While the first requirement has clearly been met as set out
above, Respondent argues that TCCP held only a 75% interest in Exploration License
EL-5, while its Joint Venture partner held the other 25%, and therefore was not the
exploration license holder; in addition, its partner also held an exclusive right to explore
the area according to rule 23(1), which prevented the grant of a mining lease to TCCP
under rule 48(2)(a).

1173. The Tribunal is not convinced by Respondent's first argument. The Joint Venture was
unincorporated and, pursuant to Clause 4.1 of the CHEJVA, nothing in the CHEJVA
was intended to create a trust, mining or commercial partnership or a new legal entity
"for any purpose whatsoever." '?*4 Clause 4.3 of the CHEJVA further provides that the
Joint Venture partners held a beneficial interest in the Joint Venture Property as tenants-
in-common according to their respective Percentage Interest.'*?> While the Tribunal is
aware that EL-5 was granted and renewed in favor of the Joint Venture, the parties to
the CHEJVA apparently considered that TCCA (and later TCCP) held an interest in the
Exploration License EL-5 — distinguishable from Claimant's interest in the Joint
Venture as such.

1174. This understanding of the parties is demonstrated by the fact that the GOB, BHP and
TCCA entered into a separate Novation Agreement for Exploration License EL-5,

1321 Exhibit RE-1, rule 47(1).

1822 Exhibit RE-1, rules 48(1) and 48(2)(a).
1823 Exhibit RE-1, rule 23(1)(a).

1824 Exhibit CE-1, Clause 4.1.

1825 Exhibit CE-1, Clause 4.3.

which states that the parties intended "to transfer by novation BHPB's undivided interest
in the Licence to TCC such that TCC shall replace BHPB as a party to the Licence."'**
Subsequently, on 5 November 2007 and 3 January 2008, the GOB gave its no-objection
to the transfer of TCCA's interest in EL-5 to TCCP through the amalgamation of
TCCA's Pakistani branch into TCCP.!*?7

1175.The Tribunal thus considers it undisputed that TCCP held a 75% interest in EL-5 (and
not only in the Joint Venture Property as a whole). Given that there is no requirement in
the 2002 BM Rules that the applicant must hold a 100% interest in the exploration license,
the Tribunal is of the view that TCCP can thus be considered an exploration license holder
under rule 48(1) of the 2002 BM Rules. In fact, the Amalgamation demonstrates that
Claimant transferred its interest in EL-5 to TCCP for the exact purpose of creating an
eligible applicant for the Mining Lease Application.'*8 The Amalgamation further
records that the GOB and the BDA “had already given their no objection to the
amalgamation as the same is necessary to meet the requirement of rule 47(1) of the
Balochistan Mineral Rules, 2002."'52°

1176.In addition, the negotiations between TCCA and the GOB for a Shareholders Agreement
illustrate the parties' initial plan that the GOB would acquire a 25% share in TCCP in
exchange for the assignment of its 25% interest in EL-5 to TCCP.'°° The Tribunal notes

1326 Exhibit RE-153, Recital E. It is not clear from this document on which date the Agreement was concluded.

However, by letter of 8 April 2006, the Licensing Authority referred to an application dated 28 March 2006 and
informed the Joint Venture that it "has been pleased to assign your Exploration License No. EL(5) .
M/S Tethyan Copper Company Limited under rule 64 of the Balochistan Minerals Rules, 2002." Exh
1327 Exhibit RE-61, pp. 116 and 117 (numbered as pp. 103 and 104). While the Tribunal is aware of the fact that
the no-objection was "subject to registering the share holding status of the component companies including the
25% share held by the Government of Balochistan (through BDA)," a condition that was not fulfilled because the
GOB never exchanged its interest in EL-5 for a 25% share in TCCP, this document confirms that both parties
considered that Claimant's interest in EL-5 could be transferred separately from its interest in the Joint Venture.
1328 The Amalgamation records: "An application for the grant of a mining lease, under Rule 47(1) of Balochistan
Mineral Rules, 2002, can only be granted to a body corporate which should be formed under the Companies
Ordinance 1984 and other provisions of laws of Pakistan. Given the foregoing the respective Boards of Directors
of the petitioners, after, inter alia, considering ways and means to improve and more economically carry on their
businesses and to meet the requirements of Rule 47(1) of the Balochistan Mineral Rules, 2002, had resolved that
it would be to the advantage of petitioner No. 1 and petitioner No. 2 and their respective shareholders if by way
of reorganization of the assets/undertakings of petitioner no. 2, which along with other assets, comprising the
Licences, are amalgamated with and transferred to petitioner No. 1." Exhibit CE-21, p. 3.

1329 Exhibit CE-21, p. 5.

1330 Tp its letter to the GOB dated 21 May 2008, Claimant wrote that "the Shareholders Agreement only works
where the Government of Balochistan becomes shareholder of TCCP and assigns its 25% interest in EL-5 to
TCCP." Exhibit CE-331. This intention is also recorded in the Preliminary Statements of the draft Shareholders
Agreement returned to Claimant by the GOB with its comments on 24 October 2008: "[Cloncurrently with the
execution of this agreement, GOB is assigning and/or transferring its 25% undivided interest in EL-5 to TCCP for
a twenty five percent (25%) of the paid up share capital as an equity interest in TCCP pursuant to the terms of the
GOB Assignment Agreement." Exhibit CE-231, p. 7.

that it was due to the GOB's decision not to go forward with the negotiations of the
Shareholder Agreement, as recorded in the minutes of the Cabinet meeting on 24
December 2009, '**! that this plan was never implemented and TCCP thus did not acquire
the remaining 25% interest in EL-S. In light of the fact that the GOB (i) was on notice at
least as of 2008 when TCCA transferred its 75% interest in EL-5 to TCCP that TCCP was
intended to become the (only) eligible applicant under rule 47(1) of the 2002 BM Rules;
and (ii) chose to abandon the plan to transfer its 25% interest to TCCP, the Tribunal
considers that, in any event, the GOB cannot invoke the missing 25% as a reason for
denying TCCP the eligibility to apply for a mining lease under the 2002 BM Rules.

1177.As to Respondent's second argument, i.e., the GOB's alleged exclusive right under rule
48(2)(a), the Tribunal is of the view that, while both Joint Venture partners held an
"exclusive right" in relation to any third party to explore the area covered by EL-S, the
GOB's 25% interest in the Joint Venture (and in EL-5) did not confer on it an "exclusive
right" vis-a-vis its Joint Venture partner TCCA. Therefore, TCCP was an, and in fact
the only, eligible applicant under the 2002 BM Rules.

1178.Apart from the regulatory requirements under the 2002 BM Rules, the CHEJVA
contained a specific contractual procedure to be observed in relation to the application for
a mining lease. Clause 5.7.1 provides that "[w]here so directed by the Manager, the BDA
shall be responsible on behalf of the Joint Venture for making all applications ... for
Mining Leases required pursuant to Clause 5.9 ... ."'*°* The referenced Clause 5.9
provides in relevant part:

"The Parties shall pursuant to Clause 2.2 seek an assurance from the
Provincial Government, namely that the Joint Venture shall have the
right to apply for a Mining Lease at any time during the conduct of
Stage Three [pre-feasibility work] or Stage Four [feasibility study
work] Activities if in the opinion of the Manager a decision to undertake
mining development is likely to be made pursuant to either of sub-
clauses 8.2.10(d) [transfer of the Joint Venture Activities to the Mining
Venture] or 11.3.2 [any of the parties gives notice of intention to
participate in mining development]. ..."'5°

1179. Clause 11.4.2 of the CHEJVA provides that in case Claimant gives notice of its intention
to participate in mining development, but the GOB is (deemed) a Non-participating Party,
"then subject both to [TCCA] obtaining all routine Government approvals required and
to compliance with Clause 11.6, [TCCA] shall be entitled to undertake sole risk

investment ... in a mining development within any of the relevant Prospecting
Licences."'*** In this case, Clause 11.5 stipulates that the parties shall negotiate in good
faith and, within 120 days from the Election Date, "agree upon the fair value to be paid
by the Participating Party to the Non-participating Party as consideration for transfer of
the Non-participating Party's Percentage Interest in all the Joint Venture Property

pertaining to the proposed Mining Area."'3*>

1180.In case the parties are unable to reach an agreement on the fair value, Clause 11.6.2
provides that the question shall be referred to an expert. Finally, Clause 11.6.3 of the
CHEJVA stipulates that once the fair value has been determined by either means, "the
Non-participating Party shall do all things reasonable and necessary to transfer all legal
and beneficial interest in the non-participating Party's Transfer Interest to the

Participating Party." |

1181.According to Respondent, TCCP was not eligible to file the Mining Lease Application
on its own, i.e., without its Joint Venture partner, because, contrary to Clause 11.4.2, it
did not acquire its partner's 25% interest in the Joint Venture pursuant to Clause 11.6
beforehand. At the outset, the Tribunal considers it questionable whether a failure to
comply with this contractual procedure could theoretically serve as a ground for the
Licensing Authority to deny the Mining Lease Application because this is not part of the
regulatory requirements on which the Licensing Authority must base its decision. In any
event, the Tribunal is not convinced by Respondent's argument.

1182.The Tribunal recalls that, under the 2002 BM Rules, the unincorporated Joint Venture
was not eligible to apply for a mining lease; therefore, the CHEJVA provided that either
(i) the Joint Venture partners would form a new, incorporated Mining Venture under a
Project Agreement; or (ii) TCCA would notify the GOB of its intent to participate in a
mining development and, in case, the GOB decided, or was deemed, not to participate,
would be entitled to proceed with the mining development on its own.

1183. While it is correct that, under the second scenario, the CHEJVA provides for a detailed
procedure as to how TCCA would then acquire the GOB's interest in the Joint Venture,
the Tribunal does not agree with Respondent that this procedure had to be completed
before TCCP could apply for a mining lease. First, Clause 11.4.2 does not state that the
application for a mining lease, specifically, is subject to "compliance with Clause 11.6,"
but rather refers more generally to Claimant's entitlement "to undertake sole risk
investment ... in a mining development." In addition and more importantly, the Tribunal

considers that, if Respondent's interpretation of the contractual provisions in the CHEJVA.
were correct, the GOB could in fact block any further mining development by refusing to
participate in the procedure set out in the CHEJVA. This is particularly relevant given
that in the present case Exploration License EL-5 was to expire three months after
Claimant had notified the GOB of its intention to participate in mining development and
there was no possibility under the 2002 BM Rules to apply for a further renewal.

1184. While Respondent correctly pointed out that Claimant did not even attempt to acquire the
GOB's interest until 3 March 2011, i.e., after the Application was filed, the record shows
that Claimant repeatedly emphasized the need for action in light of the impending expiry
of EL-5. According to TCC's minutes of a meeting with the MMDD on 8 November 2010,
i.e., before the time limit for the GOB's election to participate in the Mining Venture
expired, the Secretary of the MMDD indicated that their review of the Feasibility Study
would require at least six months. The minutes further record:

"Mr. von Borries explained that assuming the GOB elected to
participate, both parties need to form a Mining Venture in order to
submit the Mining Lease Application before the expiration of EL-5 on
19" February 2011. Therefore he asked whether the GOB would sign a

Memorandum _of Understanding in order to file for a Mining Lease
Application. Mr. Raisani said the GoB would agree with the MOU and
make its election to participate after the presentation [of the Feasibility
Study] to the cabinet has been done." '*"

1185. In his letter to the Secretary of the MMDD dated 30 November 2010, Mr. von Borries (in
his function as Manager of the Joint Venture) noted that the 90-day election period under
Clause 11.3.1 of the CHEJVA had expired on 24 November 2010 and that he had received
no notification from the GOB. Mr. von Borries informed both parties to the CHEJVA that
"the procedure laid out down in the CHEJVA ... shall now follow" and suggested that the
parties and the Manager meet at their earliest convenience "to discuss and formulate the
future course of action pursuant to the CHEJVA."'°8

1186. Following a request from the MMDD, dated 18 December 2010, to extend the 90-day
election period under the CHEJVA until the review of the Feasibility Study would be
completed,'*° Mr. von Borries again noted in his letter to the Secretary of the MMDD
dated 29 December 2010 that the election period under the CHEJVA had expired on 24
November 2010, with no response from the GOB. He further emphasized that Exploration

License EL-5 would expire on 19 February 2011 and, "[g]iven these circumstances,"
asked for "advice as to how to move forward" in considering this request.'*4° It appears
from the record that there was no response to this letter.

1187.In a further letter to the Secretary of the MMDD dated 8 February 2011, i.e., shortly
before the Mining Lease Application was filed on 15 February 2011, Mr. von Borries
again noted that EL-5 would expire on 19 February 2011 and stated:

"[I]t is imperative that the Mining Lease Application in relation to the
Mining Area (as defined in the CHEJVA) for the Mining Operations (as
defined in the CHEJVA) of the Reko Dig project may be filed with the
licensing authority ahead of the expiration of EL-5. As per
requirements of rule 47(1) of the Balochistan Mineral Rules, 2002, the
Mining Lease Application will be filed by Tethyan Copper Company
Pakistan (Private) Limited which is a company incorporated under the
laws of Pakistan."'**!

1188.Mr. von Borries further enclosed a draft letter to be signed by the Secretary of the MMDD
by which the MMDD would ask the Manager of the Joint Venture "to take all necessary
steps in order to file the Mining Lease Application by [TCCP] on behalf of the ... Joint
Venture with the licensing authority in relation to the Mining Area."'*? The letter was
never signed by the MMDD and it appears from the record that, again, there was no
response.

1189. By letter of 3 March 2011, i.e., two weeks after the Mining Lease Application was filed,
Claimant notified the GOB of its intention to purchase the interest of the GOB (as Non-
participating Party) in the Joint Venture and to engage with the GOB in agreeing the fair
value of such interest pursuant to Clause 11.5.3 of the CHEJVA. At the same time,
Claimant noted that "It is still the wish of TCC and its shareholders to have the GOB as
a 25% partner in the Reko Dig project. TCC would welcome the opportunity to discuss

how this can be achieved."'3%

1190. By letter of 28 March 2011, the GOB stated that "the matter is subjudice in the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of Pakistan and the Provincial Government at this stage is not in a
position to negotiate / discuss the provisions of CHEJVA for becoming either a
participating or non-participating party, as well as consideration of Joint Application for
mining lease till the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan is arrived." In

conclusion, the GOB therefore requested that the time limit for its election be postponed

until after the Supreme Court's decision would be rendered. !*+4

1191. Following Claimant's letter dated 29 April 2011 by which it noted that the 120-day period
for reaching a mutually agreeable decision under Clause 11.6.2 had expired and notified
the GOB of its intention to submit the matter to an independent expert,'*4> the GOB
reiterated its position in its letter dated 8 May 2011 that it would be "premature and
unhealthy to proceed further in disregard of court proceedings" and concluded that it
would be "better we may not proceed till the case is decided by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court of Pakistan."**°

1192. Against this background, the Tribunal considers it established that irrespective of the
exact date on which Claimant notified the GOB of its intent to purchase the GOB's interest
in the Joint Venture, the GOB refused to acknowledge, while the Supreme Court
proceedings were still ongoing, that it was deemed a Non-participating Party pursuant to
Clause 11.3.3 and, consequently, to negotiate with Claimant or participate in the
contractual procedure for the determination of the fair value to be paid in consideration
for the transfer of its interest. The GOB also refused to consider a joint application for a
mining lease even though Mr. von Borries had repeatedly emphasized that the
Exploration License EL-5 was about to expire and would have already expired by the
time the GOB communicated such refusal in its letter of 28 March 2011, if TCCP had not
taken unilateral action by then.

1193. Therefore, if Respondent's interpretation of the CHEJVA provisions were correct, the
GOB could, and would successfully, have blocked any action that prevented EL-5 from
expiring in February 2011 because there would not have been any eligible applicant at
the time that could have filed a mining lease application for this area. In the Tribunal's
view, this cannot have been the intent of the contracting parties when they entered into
the CHEJVA and clearly does not correspond to the co-operation and good faith
obligations of the GOB as set out in Clauses 24.6.2 and 24.6.3 of the CHEJVA. Therefore,
the non-completion of the contractual procedure can in any event not serve as a ground
for denying TCCP's Mining Lease Application.

(ii) The Second Set of Grounds: The Feasibility Study Did Not
Provide for Processing, Smelting and Refining the Ore

1194. The second set of grounds invoked by Respondent is based on the alleged silence of
Claimant's Feasibility Study as to the further treatment of the ore after its extraction. The
ninth ground states:

"That feasibility report is silent about the processing, smelting and
refining of the metals / minerals to be extracted from the mining
1347
area.
1195.As to the processing of the ore, the Tribunal notes that Chapter 6 of the Feasibility Study

is entitled "Metallurgy and Process Development" and presents at a total length of 145
pages how Claimant intended to process the ore into concentrate.'** Therefore, the
Feasibility Study is clearly not "silent about the processing" of the minerals to be
extracted from the Mining Area.

1196. With regard to the smelting and refining of the concentrate, Claimant anticipated in the
Feasibility Study that the ore would be transported via a pipeline to the port of Gwadar
and then be exported in order to be smelted and refined outside of Pakistan. The Tribunal
is also aware that the GOB had repeatedly requested that Claimant build a local smelter
and refinery, something which Claimant refused as being uneconomic. Therefore, the
Tribunal has to assess whether the GOB was entitled to make such request or, more
specifically, whether the Licensing Authority was entitled to refuse the Mining Lease
Application on such grounds.

1197. Rule 48(3)(a)(vii) of the 2002 BM Rules, as amended as of 1 October 2010, provides that
the Licensing Authority shall not grant the application for a mining lease unless the
applicant submits "a concrete proposal for value addition of the ore to be produced /
exploited from the applicant's mining lease within the country ..., or if the facility is not
available in the province, the Ore could be taken out of province with the prior approval

of the Provincial Government." 4°

1198. Claimant's witness Mr. Livesey acknowledged during the Hearing that, even though the
amendment was enacted only after Claimant had submitted the Feasibility Study to the
GOB, this amended requirement had to be observed when TCCP filed its Mining Lease

Application in February 2011.'*°° However, the Parties are in dispute as to the meaning
of the term "value addition" and, consequently, whether TCCP satisfied the requirement
in its Application. While Respondent alleges that rule 48(3)(a)(vii) established a
requirement to build a smelter and refinery within Pakistan, Claimant argues that the term
"value addition" is used in the industry for the processing of the ore into concentrate. This
was confirmed by Claimant's witness Ms. Boggs during the Hearing:

"Q. And is turning ore into concentrate value addition to the ore?

A. Absolutely. I mean, if you don't turn it into concentrate, it's
essentially just rocks.

Q. Is that how it's widely understood in the industry?

A. Absolutely. It's probably the biggest value addition to it in the
mining process."'3>!

1199. In response to the question "[w]hat is the [sic] understood under ‘value addition’ of ore in
the mining industry in general," Mr. Livesey confirmed that "you have immediately added
value to the ore by creating the concentrate" and explained that the ore is thereby turned
into "a product that is saleable on the international market."'**? Mr. Livesey further
emphasized that "[w]e consider we have created value addition. Just to be clear, we don't
consider this to be the request for a smelter, or the requirement, rather, for a smelter."'3>3

Finally, he added that "adding a smelter to the project would be value-destructive, not

value accretive." 354

1200.Respondent's witness Mr. Khokhar was also asked during the Hearing whether the
processing of ore constitutes value addition:

"Q. And turning ore into concentrate is a form of treatment of ore;
correct?

A. To an extent, yeah, maybe.

Q. Okay. And you would agree with me that treatment of the ore adds
value to the ore; correct?

A. Partially, yes."'°°

Case 1:19-cv-02424-TNM Document 1-1 Filed 08/09/19 Page 954 of 1447
Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability
ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1

1201. Taking into account the above testimony of the witnesses, the Tribunal considers that the
term "value addition" in rule 48(3)(a)(vii) of the 2002 BM Rules cannot be interpreted to
establish a requirement for a smelter and refinery within Pakistan. If it were otherwise,
the Tribunal would have to assume that Respondent introduced the requirement
specifically in order to target Claimant's project and to prevail with the GOB's request for
a local smelter and refinery; such conduct would then not correspond to bona fide
regulatory exercise of State power but rather to an abuse of sovereign power to achieve a
concession that the Governments had failed to achieve through negotiations with
Claimant. In light of the rather general wording of the requirement, which appears to have
a different meaning in the industry, the Tribunal does not wish to go that far, but rather
finds that TCCP's Mining Lease Application has satisfied this particular requirement by
providing a "concrete proposal" for processing the ore into concentrate within Pakistan.

1202. The Tribunal recalls that the Licensing Authority further stated in its tenth ground:

"That in view of aforementioned reasons, the Committee found that the
application submitted by the applicant is not satisfactory. It is also not
in the interest of the Government and people of Balochistan that the
lease cannot be granted on a documents which is in complete [sic] and
sketchy." 1356
1203. The Licensing Authority thus (also) bases its denial of the Mining Lease Application on
the discretionary elements contained in rules 48(3)(a)(v) and (vi) of the 2002 BM Rules
pursuant to which a mining lease shall not be granted unless "the proposals submitted
with the application are satisfactory" and "it is in the interest of the development of the

mineral resources of Balochistan to grant the lease." 13°"

1204. While these elements indeed granted a certain amount of discretion to the Licensing
Authority, the Tribunal also recalls its finding above that Claimant legitimately expected
that the Licensing Authority would exercise such discretion in line with the security of
tenure conferred in Clause 11.8.2 of the CHEJVA and the assurances given by
Government officials throughout the years of Claimant's exploration work at Reko Diq.
In particular, Clause 11.8.2 of the CHEJVA provides that Claimant shall be entitled to
convert its exploration license into a mining lease "subject only to compliance with

routine Government requirements." '°8

1205.In the Tribunal's view, it has to be taken into account at this point that, following the
GOB's repeated emphasis on having a local smelter and refinery, Claimant provided the

1356 Exhibit CE-7, { 10.
887 Exhibit RE-1, rules 48(3)(a)(v) and (vi).
358 Exhibit CE-1, Clause 11.8.2.

Case 1:19-cv-02424-TNM Document 1-1 Filed 08/09/19 Page 955 of 1447

GOB with a white paper that set out the reasons why a local smelter and refinery would
(i) "not [be] economically justified"; (ii) make the Reko Diq project "unprofitable and
therefore unviable"; and (iii) "not be necessary in order to ensure that TCC and the GOB
are properly paid for the metal content of the concentrate that is produced."'3°°
Respondent further admitted during the Hearing:

"At no stage was the Government of Balochistan saying that it would
be a profitable element on its own for a smelter to be constructed. But
what they were saying was, it was necessary in order to get the social
license to operate."

1206. In light of this admission, the Tribunal considers that, while the construction of a smelter
may have remained a point of negotiation for the Mineral Agreement (as evidenced by
Claimant's 5 October 2010 offer to co-finance a feasibility study for a Government-owned
smelter and to supply such smelter on mutually acceptable terms),'*°! spending an
additional US$ 1 billion on, undisputedly uneconomic, non-mining facilities could
certainly not be considered a "routine" requirement that the Licensing Authority could
have imposed on Claimant as the price for receiving the mining lease. Therefore, the
Tribunal finds that the denial of the Mining Lease Application based on such grounds was
not in line with Claimant's legitimate expectation that TCCP's Application would be

assessed in accordance with the contractual agreements and assurances given to Claimant.

(iii) Third Set of Grounds: TCCP Failed to Submit a
Proper/Complete Feasibility Study on the Discovered
Deposits in the Exploration Area

1207.Respondent further invokes that, contrary to the regulatory requirements and Claimant's
undertaking in the application for the second renewal of Exploration License EL-5, the
Feasibility Study that Claimant submitted together with its Mining Lease Application
covered only the mine development of two deposits (H-14 and H-15) rather than of all
deposits within the exploration area. The second, third, seventh and eight grounds in the

Notice of Intent to Reject state:

"2. That the company did not make proper feasibility or exploration
of the discovered deposits and achieve the targets under the rules.

3. That the second renewal application submitted by the applicant,
had given declaration that the applicant will submit the complete
feasibility of the entire lease/exploration area. The applicant has utterly

failed to submit the said feasibility reports and meaning thereby that
they have failed to conduct and complete exploration in the exploration
license / granted area.

L..]

7. The relevant portion on the feasibility study report submitted by
the expert committee was also examined by the Mines Committee and
found following observation:

(i) That the Company has failed to comment or dilate upon rest of
discover deposits except H-14 and H-15;

(ii) The proposed development, operation and scheme of the mines in
programme of the mining operation for the 11 other potential resources
is missing/omitted to be considered in the feasibility report;

(iii) That the information given by the company in all respect keeping
in to consideration the Balochistan Minerals Rules, 2002, the Company
has further failed to identify all resources and achievements of all the
targets within stipulated time.

(iv) Misrepresentation for obtaining exploration licenses EL-6, EL-8,
EL-26 and EL-27 where there is no share of partner. Despite being a
world class Exploration/ Mining Company so called partner has failed
to submit the technical, financial, economical viability report of the
entire resources of EL-5 enjoying with special relaxations in all respect
allegedly granted by the Government of Balochistan for the last 17
years.

(v) There is a default and violation committed under rule 29 (2) (c)
(iii) of Balochistan Minerals Rules, 2002 as well as failure to provide
the required information as contemplated under rule 47 of Balochistan
Minerals Rules, 2002.

8. That the submission of the application relating to H-4, H-8, H-13,
1-35 and H-79 etc is in violation of rule-48 of Balochistan Minerals
Rule, 2002."'3°
1208. Given that it is Claimant's position that the Feasibility Study covered only an initial mine
development, which was later to be expanded as set out in the Pre-Feasibility Expansion
Study, the Tribunal has to assess whether such a phased development of the mining area
is in line with the regulatory requirements under the 2002 BM Rules.

1209. Rules 48(3)(a)(i) and (ii) of the 2002 BM Rules provide that a mining lease shall not be

the nature of the products." 13°

1211.The Tribunal notes that all of the above quoted provisions refer to a "mine." The term is
defined in rule 2(za)(i) of the 2002 BM Rules as "any surface or underground excavation
where any operation for the purpose of searching for or obtaining a mineral has been or
is being carried on, and includes all works, machinery, tramway, ropeway and siding,
whether above or below ground, in or adjacent or belonging to or appurtenant to a mine

but does not include the manufacturing or processing plant."

1212.In the Tribunal's view, there is no indication in the above mentioned regulatory
requirements that the phased development of a mine is prohibited. In particular, the
Tribunal considers that a gradual development does not exclude a profitable development
and operation of the mine or an "efficient, beneficial and timely use of the mineral
resources." To the contrary, Claimant's witness Mr. Luksic, Chairman of Antofagasta,
the world's biggest copper mining company, explained that even if an initial mine
development as anticipated at H-14 and H-15 did not turn out to be very profitable, "the

marginal expansions are very profitable." Mr. Luksic then explained that this approach
is common in the industry and corresponds to what Antofagasta has very successfully
been doing at one of its mines in Chile over the past years:

"A. Even if you have a start that is tight, your expansions are going

to be extremely profitable. We have the experience, we have seen it. And

this is how the mining industry operates.

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1

Q. You mentioned about the expansion, but if you don't have a
feasible and viable project, there is nothing to expand, is there Mr.
Luksic?

A. Of course there is. This is how the mining industry works. You do
your first project, you work for five years, and then you present your
next expansion." 36%

"H14 and H15 is a 5 billion tonne resource. You're going to work here,
says 2 billion tonnes of those. In what? In 56 years.

What you do is you start with a small mine or the smallest viable
mine. So, you make the smallest investment first. And then you make
marginal expansion on the same deposit, and those marginal
expansions are extremely profitable. They're very, very, very useful.
And this is what happened for us in one of our mines. We started with
a plant the size of 85,000 tonnes per day. In the last ten years, we have
taken that mine to 175,000 tonnes per day. And that is what happens in
this mining world in mines, and that is what we believe is going to
happen with H14 and H15."1°°"

"What happens after this ... starting project, as I called it, then you start
making expansions. You go, and this happens. I mean, you go to any
mining board, and that's what we all do when you have resources like
this. You can actually expand further, and we have in our case, in one
of our mines in Chile, in the last 12 years we have expanded four times,
and that's how we managed to get where we are."
1213.In the Tribunal's view, the unrebutted statement of Mr. Luksic that a phased development
corresponds to the common practice in the industry is relevant to the interpretation of the
regulatory requirements in the 2002 BM Rules. Not only does the Foreword state that the
Rules were intended to be "internationally competitive," but rule 31(1)(a), e.g., provides
that an exploration license holder shall carry on the exploration activities "in accordance
with good exploration practices," which are defined in rule 2(q) (together with "good
reconnaissance practices" and "good mining practices") as "practices which are
generally accepted internationally by persons involved in reconnaissance operations,
exploration operations, or mining operations, as the case may be, as good, safe and

necessary in carrying out such operations."

1214. In addition, rule 45(1)(b(i) of the 2002 BM Rules expressly provides for the right of a
mining lease holder to "carry on in the mining area, in conjunction with mining
operations ..., exploration operations in relation to any such mineral or group of
minerals."'5”° Rule 56(1)(a), which sets out the obligations of the mining lease holder
with regard to keeping records on its mining operations, also repeatedly refers to

“exploration operations" that are carried out within the mining area. '>7!

1215.As a result, the Tribunal is convinced that the 2002 BM Rules do not require an immediate
development of all deposits that were discovered within the anticipated mining area
throughout the exploration activities, but rather generally allow for a phased
development, as intended by Claimant. However, Respondent further argues that
Claimant specifically undertook to submit a feasibility study on all deposits that were
discovered within the area of Exploration License EL-5 when the Joint Venture filed its
application for a second renewal of EL-5 and was therefore required to do so under rule
29(2)(c)(iii) of the 2002 BM Rules.

1216.Rule 29(2)(c)(iii) provides that an application for a second renewal shall not be made
"unless the applicant can satisfy the authority that such a renewal is necessary for the
completion of a full feasibility study of the discovered deposits and that the proposed
activities could not have been reasonably completed during the period of the first
renewal."'3?

1217.In the application for a second renewal of Exploration License EL-5 dated 2 November
2007, the section entitled "Justification for Second Renewal for 3 years over 90% of
Existing El-5 Area" includes, inter alia, the following statement:

"With EL-5 to expire in February 2008, the Applicant will be able to
commence activities for drawing up the Feasibility Study in the first
renewal period but will not be able to complete the same given the time
that will be needed to carry out the Feasibility Study to tie the
development of all the deposits, which are spread over a large are of
EL-5, (some of which are still being reviewed through further drilling
work) together into one mining project. ... [T]he Applicant considers
that it requires a renewal for the full three year period over 90% of the
existing EL-5 area to be in a position to fully develop the
discoveries.""°

1218. The regulatory requirement in rule 29(2)(c)(iii) of the 2002 BM Rules consists of a "full
feasibility study of the discovered deposits." In the Tribunal's view, it is clear from the

1310 Exhibit RE-1, rule 45(1)(b)(i).

311 Exhibit RE-1, rules 56(1)(a)(v), (vi), (vii) and (ix).
32 Exhibit RE-1, rule 29(2)(c)(iii).

application for the second renewal of EL-S that the Joint Venture intended to satisfy this
requirement, given that the application was expressly submitted "[p]ursuant to Rule 29(2)
of the Balochistan Mineral Rules, 2002" and the language in the above statement was
apparently used to reflect the language used in the provision itself. In any event, the
Tribunal notes that the alleged default referred to in the seventh ground (rule 48(3)(b))
could be based only on a direct violation of rule 29(2)(c)(iii); therefore, the Tribunal will
focus on the interpretation of the regulatory requirement itself.

1219. The Tribunal considers that the term "full feasibility study" does not mean that TCCP had
to submit a feasibility study on each and every deposit within the exploration license area,
irrespective of whether such deposit formed part of a reasonable (initial) mine
development project. If the provision were interpreted in such a manner, this requirement
would impose on the investor the uneconomic and irrational obligation to invest large
amounts of money and working hours into the full assessment of deposits that were not
meant to be part of the (initial) mine development because they were found to be too small

or to have only limited potential in previous pre-feasibility studies. '*"+

1220.In addition, this interpretation would also be contrary to the approach explained by Mr.
Luksic to start with a rather small investment into an initial project and then make
additional investments into various expansions over the years when the initial investments
had already paid off. Given that Respondent does not dispute that this is a common
approach in the industry and further given that the 2002 BM Rules contain provisions
expressly allowing for such phased development, the Tribunal is not convinced that rule
29(2)(c)(iii) BM Rules should be interpreted to require a development of each deposit to
feasibility level before a mining lease can be granted.

1221.In addition, the Tribunal recalls that the GOB was aware of Claimant's actual plans both
through the meetings of the Operating Committee and the quarterly reports by means of
which Claimant continuously informed the GOB of the progress made at Reko Digq. In
particular, the Operating Committee agreed in its 26 October 2007 meeting on the
preliminary budget for "full feasibility study on option 72 ktpd and parallel pre-feasibility
study on expansion options." '37> Given that Respondent does not contest that "option 72
kptd" referred to the Western Porphyries, i.e., the two deposits H-14 and H-15, the GOB
was thus aware as of that date that Claimant would prepare a "full feasibility study" on
these two deposits and, in parallel, a pre-feasibility study on future expansion options.

'374 Claimant's witness Mr. Luksic confirmed during his oral testimony that such deposits might be developed later,
"once you are completely established in the area, and then you will continue to explore your other targets and
hopefully develop now in the future." Transcript (Day 3), p. 722 lines 11-14.

Case 1:19-cv-02424-TNM Document 1-1 Filed 08/09/19 Page 961 of 1447
Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability
ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1

1222.Following the approval of this approach, the GOB was kept abreast of Claimant's work
through the quarterly reports; Respondent does not allege that there was any indication in
these reports that the approach approved by the Operating Committee was subsequently
changed or expanded. In addition, the application for the second renewal itself, in its
summary of the progress made during the first renewal period, reported that "the focus of
the geological team shifted from the Tanjeel area, primarily to the drill out of the resource
at the W{estern] P[orphyries]" and further that "[s]coping studies for the pre feasibility

and feasibility studies was carried out."'*7°

1223.In its 31 December 2009 memorandum to the Chief Secretary, the MMDD also reported
that Claimant was planning to "produce 110,000 tons of ore and 2000 tons of concentrate
per day at the initial stage and to increase it to the maximum of 220,000 tons of ore and
4000 tons of concentrate per day at a later stage."'3"" This demonstrates that the GOB
was aware at all times that Claimant intended to pursue a phased approach with an initial
project and future expansions; nevertheless, the GOB never indicated to Claimant prior
to completion of the Feasibility Study that it considered the Study's scope to be
insufficient and/or incompatible with rule 29(2)(c)(iii) of the 2002 BM Rules.

1224. Finally, the Tribunal is not convinced by Respondent's argument that Claimant intended
to block the deposits that it did not intend to mine in the near future from being developed
by anyone else. First, Claimant established that its approach corresponds to international
mining practice, and second, the GOB intended to apply for the exact same area when it
drafted the mining lease application for its own project in 2012 even though it intended
to mine only H-4 in the beginning and it remains unclear whether it had any concrete
expansion plans beyond this deposit.

1225. Therefore, the Tribunal considers that the Licensing Authority could not use the fact that
Feasibility Study covered only H-14 and H-15 while the proposed Mining Area covered
a total of 13 discovered deposits, as a ground for denying the Mining Lease Application.

(iv) Conclusion on the Grounds Given in the Notice of Intent to
Reject and Remarks on the Procedure

1226.In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that none of the reasons given in the Notice of Intent to
Reject could have justified the denial of the Mining Lease Application. In addition, the
Tribunal considers that, even though the Licensing Authority, on its face, complied with
the procedure set out in rules 48(4) and (5) of the 2002 BM Rules pursuant to which the
applicant must be notified of the reasons for the intended refusal and be afforded the

opportunity to make representations and/or proposals thereon, which in turn must be
given due consideration by the Licensing Authority, the Notice of Intent to Reject and the
subsequent denial letter did not fulfill the actual purpose of these requirements.

1227. In particular, the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that the reasons set out in the Notice were

“not commensurate with the size of the investment" because they remained at a very
general level and further included several allegations that were false, even on a superficial
review. In addition, the Licensing Authority refused, despite Claimant's repeated
requests, '*”8 to provide any further clarifications on the stated reasons or to meet with

Claimant prior to the expiry of the 30-day deadline, which it also refused to extend.'3”?

1228. Finally, the Licensing Authority rejected the Mining Lease Application on 15 November

2011 with a single sentence of reasoning: "You are hereby informed that your reply was
found unsatisfactory under Rules 10, 29 (2) (c) (iii) 47, 48, 52 etc of Balochistan Mining
Rules 2002."'**° This sentence does not convey the impression that the Licensing
Authority took into consideration the arguments raised by TCCP in its 22-page response
to the Notice of Intent to Reject, which already set out several of the arguments that were

raised and subject to an intense debate in this arbitration. '**!

According to Claimant's letter dated 2 March 2012, i

immediately after the hearing and without officially communicating such decision to
TCCcP.!387

1230. As stated above, the Tribunal does not consider it sufficient that the requirements set out
under rules 48(4) and (5) of the 2002 BM Rules were complied with from a formal point
of view and that the appeal procedure was conducted. In the Tribunal's view, the real
question is whether the underlying purpose of these provisions, i.e., to afford the applicant
the fundamental right to be heard, was fulfilled. In this regard, the Tribunal considers that
the conduct of the Licensing Authority and the Secretary of the MMDD as appellate
authority does not correspond to the treatment that Claimant could legitimately expect
under the circumstances, i.e., in light of the contractual and regulatory framework as well
as the direct assurances given by Government officials on the basis of which it decided
to invest more than US$ 240 million and many years of work into the project.
Consequently, the Tribunal finds that that the manner in which the application and appeal
procedure were carried out amounts to a further violation of the FET obligation.

(b) The Additional Grounds Invoked by Respondent in This
Arbitration

1231.As a last step, the Tribunal will assess whether Respondent can rely on additional reasons
that were not raised in the Notice of Intent to Reject and whether they provide a
justification for the Licensing Authority's decision to deny the Mining Lease Application.
Respondent claims that Claimant failed to demonstrate in the Feasibility Study that (i) its
project would be profitable; and that (ii) it would have or obtain the financial resources
required to carry out the mining operations in an efficient manner. In addition,
Respondent alleges that (iii) the security risks of transporting the ore via pipeline to the
port of Gwadar had not been adequately addressed; and (iv) the water source for its project
had not been fully assessed.

1232.In the Tribunal's view, Respondent should not be allowed to rely on reasons additional to
those invoked in the Notice of Intent to Reject because Respondent would thereby be
allowed to ignore the procedural requirements set out in rule 48(4) and (5) of the 2002
BM Rules and, more generally, this would violate Claimant's right to be heard both during
the procedure before the Licensing Authority and the appeal before the Secretary of the
MMDD. Even though Respondent claims that in particular the first additional reason was
in fact included in the Licensing Authority's ground no. 7 (iv), the Tribunal further
considers that Respondent should not be allowed to benefit from the fact that the language
used by the Licensing Authority was very broad and could have been interpreted in many

1387 Exhibit CE-137.

ways. The Tribunal also takes into account that, as noted above, the Licensing Authority
refused to provide clarifications on the reasons, despite Claimant's repeated requests in
this regard.

1233.In any event, the Tribunal is of the view that none of the additional reasons invoked by
Respondent would justify the denial of the Mining Lease Application in the present case.

(i) | The First Additional Reason: TCCP Failed to Prove that the
Mine Could Be Profitably Developed and Operated

1234. As to the first reason, i.e., that Claimant failed to demonstrate in the Feasibility Study
"that the mine can be profitably developed and operated" as required under rule
48(3)(a)(i) of the 2002 BM Rules, the Tribunal recalls the oral testimony of Claimant's
witness Mr. Luksic who explained that "[e]ven if you have a start that is tight, your
expansions are going to be extremely, extremely profitable." '*** Tn light of this undisputed
testimony and further taking into account the fact that two of the world's largest mining
companies were willing to invest large amounts of equity into this project, the Tribunal
considers it sufficiently established that the mining project as envisaged by Claimant, i.e.,
consisting of the initial mine development set out in the Feasibility Study and the
expansions set out in the Pre-Feasibility Expansion Study, could be "profitably developed
and operated" as required under rule 48(3)(a)(i) of the 2002 BM Rules.

1235. However, the Tribunal is aware that, contrary to the Feasibility Study, the Pre-Feasibility
Expansion Study that Claimant completed in July 2010 was not part of the documents
that supported TCCP's Mining Lease Application. While the Feasibility Study contains a
few references to an "Expansion Study" or a "second phase feasibility study" that it

0,'38? such references were not

expected to be completed in the second quarter of 201
made in the context of increasing the profitability of the mine; thus, the Licensing
Authority was not made aware, through the documents submitted together with the

Application, of the economics as described by Mr. Luksic.

1236. The Tribunal thus considers it essential whether the Licensing Authority nevertheless had
knowledge of the fact that the anticipated expansions in the future would considerably
improve the profitability of the mine over its 56-year life span. In this regard, the Tribunal
notes that on 19 January 2011, Dr. Mubarakmand submitted to the Supreme Court that
"the Feasibility Study submitted by TCC is just the tip of the ice berg in the EL-5 area"
and added that the GOB's project would yield a net profit of US$ 131.824 billion during

the life of the mine.'* Together with the above mentioned fact that Claimant's
shareholders, two highly experienced mining companies, were willing to contribute their
equity into the project, this strongly indicated that the project would indeed yield
considerable profits over its life span.

1237. In this regard, the Tribunal further notes that, if the Licensing Authority had observed the
procedure set out in rule 48(4) of the 2002 BM Rules in this respect, Claimant would have
had the opportunity to clarify its concept and explain the increasing profitability of the
project through its expansions. The Licensing Authority's failure to (clearly) mention this
ground in its Notice of Intent to Reject and to clarify its reasons must not go to the
detriment of Claimant.

1238. In any event, the Tribunal is not convinced by Respondent's argument that the initial mine
development as presented in the Feasibility Study would have been unprofitable. While
Respondent focused its argument primarily on the allegation that Claimant made wrong
assumptions with regard to the tax and royalty regime, Claimant's witness Mr. Livesey
explained during the Hearing that the profitability was much more sensitive to the prices
of fuel and metals, in particular copper, and further stated that in light of the subsequent
rise of the copper prices after the completion of the Feasibility Study, the profitability had
increased "into high teens to twenties IRR even in the normal tax regime."'*°' This is
reflected in the sensitivity analysis on metal prices conducted in Chapters 28.3.1 and
28.3.2 of the Feasibility Study, which further includes the statement that a "conservative

base copper price" was selected for this analysis. !7°?

1239. Finally, with regard to Respondent's argument that Claimant made wrong assumptions as
to the tax and royalty regime, the Tribunal notes that the applicable tax and royalty rates
were still subject to the Mineral Agreement negotiations. While such negotiations had
apparently stalled before the Mining Lease Application was filed, the parties may well
have decided to revive them after the grant of the mining lease, given that Claimant would
then have been the only one allowed to conduct mining operations in the area. There
would thus have been a mutual interest to achieve agreement on the remaining issues. In
the Tribunal's view, Claimant would have been in a far better bargaining position as
holder of the mining lease over the area than it was before, in particular once it became
clear that the Governments considered that Claimant did not have a right to convert its

1382 Exhibit RE-133, pp. 28-20 to 28-26. Specifically with regard to Table 28.20 entitled "Impact of Price on IRR,"
Mr. Livesey further explained that "if you were to take today's prices on copper and gold, you would actually be
off the chart another block to the right, down on that bottom line, and your IRR would be somewhat close to 20
percent." Transcript (Day 5), p. 1415 lines 16-19.

exploration license into a mining lease. Therefore, the Tribunal is not convinced that
Claimant made unrealistic assumptions in the absence of which the project would have
been unprofitable without any future expansions.

(ii) The Second Additional Reason: TCCP Failed to Establish
That It Had or Could Obtain the Resources to Carry Out the
Mining Operations Effectively

1240. As to the second additional reason, i.e., that TCCP failed to demonstrate that it had or
could obtain the "technical and financial resources and experience to carry out mining
operations effectively" as required under rule 48(3)(a)(iii) of the 2002 BM Rules,

Respondent claims that TCCP addressed third-party financing in the Feasibility Study
only in the "vaguest and most incomplete and unsatisfactory of terms."'39
1241.As part of its Introduction, the Feasibility Study sets out Claimant's Financing Strategy

as follows:

"TCC's Financing Plan for the project is to finance the development
and commissioning of the project with a combination of Senior Debt
advanced by a group of lenders and Shareholder Equity and
subordinated Shareholder Loans provided by the project sponsors.

The Senior Debt will be a traditional ‘Project Financing’ structure,
similar to the structure that the sponsors have successfully put in place
for other projects. Project Financing is typically sourced via
consortiums consisting primarily of large international financial
institutions (IFIs), governmental Export Credit Agencies (ECAs) and
commercial banks.

Given the large capital requirement for Reko Dig the funding approach
to be undertaken will involve discussions with a large number of ECAs,
IFIs, and commercial banks. Additional funding sources, including the
potential for an Islamic tranche or funding tied to off-take will be
evaluated. Finally, the potential to fund particular items that make up
the overall capital number is being evaluated, particularly in
connection with the power solution for Reko Dig and the port."'°*

1242. It is further noted in the Introduction that it is important for the investment decision of
each stakeholder whether the required contribution of equity and corporate guarantees is
affordable and whether conventional financial institutions will fund the project,
"particularly given the challenging aspects of the project." However, it is further noted

that "[w]hile certain preliminary work has been undertaken during the FS stage in
relation to both ‘fundability' and ‘affordability’, it is generally not deemed appropriate to
attend too much to these aspects of the project until completion of the FS and, wherein,
there is a well defined project and well defined financial requirements." Finally, the
Feasibility Study expressly refers to the 2002 BM Rules that "require that the anticipated
source of funding is addressed within the FS" and concludes that the above quoted

information about the Financing Strategy “satisfies that requirement." °°

1243.The Tribunal further recalls that during the Hearing, Claimant's witness Mr. Luksic
referred to meetings that Claimant's shareholders had with the World Bank, which
supported a program for developing mining in Balochistan, the Asian Development Bank
and "a few others, agencies that were very, very interested" in financing or being part of
the financing of the project.'**° In response to the question why no documents were on
the records that could support that statement, Mr. Luksic explained: "J don't think we ever
got to that stage. We had lots of meetings, lots of previous meetings. We prepared, and

you need to have a fully approved project before you get the financing." °°"

1244. Finally, in response to Respondent's suggestion that "without a Mineral Agreement ... it
would have been impossible or at least very difficult to obtain external funding for this
project," Mr. Luksic stated: "J'm not so sure. I mean, the World Bank seemed very
committed. ... [T]hey were very committed to Pakistan developing mining. It had a special
man in charge of a mining program, and they were very committed." °°

1245. In light of this testimony and again taking into account that Antofagasta and Barrick Gold
as two of the world's largest mining companies were willing to contribute large amounts
of equity to the project, it appears improbable that they would not have been able to obtain
third-party financing from financial institutions, such as the World Bank and/or the Asian
Development Bank. In the Tribunal's view, the absence of a Mineral Agreement might
have made such financing more challenging, but there was no indication that it would
have been impossible.

1246.In addition and apart from the above mentioned fact that the parties might have decided
to resume the negotiations on the Mineral Agreement after the grant of a mining lease,
the Tribunal considers that the requirement that Respondent tries to impose on Claimant
with regard to the financing details is not realistic. Mr. Luksic confirmed what is stated
in the Feasibility Study, i.e., that it is premature to have more than general discussions on

395 Exhibit CE-98, p. 2-9.

financing before the project is approved and its financial requirements are determined.
This applies in particular when, as in the present case, the third-party financing is meant
to be based on a project-financing structure, which naturally requires that the basic
parameters of the project are fixed before a financing institution will enter into any
commitment or even make a binding offer as to the financing conditions.

1247.Therefore, the Tribunal considers that the information given in the Feasibility Study
satisfied the requirement under rule 48(3)(a)(iii) of the 2002 BM Rules in the present
context and the Licensing Authority therefore could not deny the Mining Lease
Application on this basis.

(iii) The Third Additional Reason: TCCP Failed to Adequately
Address the Security Risks of the Pipeline

1248.As to the third additional reason that Respondent invokes, i.e., that TCCP failed to
adequately address the security risks associated with transporting the concentrate via
pipeline to the port of Gwadar, Respondent refers in particular to the following statement
made in the Bankable Feasibility Report on the pipeline prepared by the pipeline
construction company PSI:

"The safety and security only includes minor support for the offices. No
safety and security has been included in the estimate due to the
unknown issues related to Pakistan. These issues need to be understood
to provide a better cost estimate for this important task."

1249. The Tribunal notes that the security risks were subject to an extensive discussion with
Claimant's witness Mr. Livesey during the Hearing. Specifically with regard to this
statement, Mr. Livesey explained that PSI is "not a pipeline security company, so the
security risk issues are transferred across to security which, primarily for this project
was handled by Barrick's global security VP and his team in Toronto. And it was input
from them that added security into the CAPEX and OPEX in the Feasibility Study under
G&A,"1400

1250.Mr. Livesey further explained that, contrary to Respondent's allegation, Claimant did
recognize the security risks and dedicated a separate section to this matter; specifically
with regard to the pipeline, it had a mitigation strategy to avoid business disruption, which
would involve "security along the pipeline using the local communities."‘“°! The Tribunal
notes that this strategy is reflected in the section entitled "Business Strategy," which sets

out three levels of strategic partnerships intended to reduce project risk: (i) the joint
venture of Antofagasta and Barrick Gold, the partnership with the GOB and the "network

of relationships with service and infrastructure providers and the socio-economic

1402

participants. The security chapter of the Feasibility Study further includes the

following statement:

"The concentrate pipeline route, choke and valve stations, and Panjgur
drivers' rest stop will be patrolled by a light truck, a driver, and a guard
on 24 h/d, 7 d/w basis. The three stations will be monitored by CCTV
and access control and alarm systems." 4

1251. When asked about the Sui gas pipeline, which has been subject to various attacks and
therefore has an extensive security concept implemented, Mr. Livesey explained:

"[T]he Sui has pipeline and the rest of the gas infrastructure in
Balochistan does not pay any royalty or revenue to Balochistan itself,
so it's naturally a target because it's seen by the Balochis as being a
non-Balochi project. It's being seen as something that is not adding
value to them necessarily.

The Sui gas pipeline is, I think, I would guess, 800 kilometers away from
us, and it's a very easy target for exactly that reason. We would be
paying royalty and we would have, we assumed, an equity stakeholder
from the government, and we would be engaging with the local
community to provide ongoing support for the project. So we felt our
level of risk was much lower than in the gas pipelines, and that was our
position." 44

1252.Mr. Livesey further explained why they considered that the pipeline was a safer option
than using trucks or railway:

"When we did the analysis of the trade-off studies for the transport
routes, we found that the chances of serious incidents on the roads were
extremely high. It was another reason why we weren't keen on using the
roadways, and we knew that on the rail the costs would be high and we
wouldn't have access to it. And the rail itself is also subject to a lot of
interruption from attacks. I think there has been probably half as many
attacks on the rail as there has in the gas pipelines in the last ten years.

... So, the pipeline option to us offered the safest and the cheapest
option. We're talking about an 8-inch pipeline buried here in the ground

with roving patrols along that pipeline made up of people from the local
communities who benefit from that pipeline and that route staying in
existence."'4°5

"[Y]ou've got an issue there with community relations by bringing in
outsiders. And this is one of the risks that we looked at with trucking. If
you bring in a trucking fleet to provide transport, there is no existing
Balochistan company that can provide a contract trucking fleet with the
600, 700, 800 trucks required for the project.

So, that likelihood is that that trucking firm will be tendered out to

somebody from Karachi or from Sindh or Punjab. You would

immediately bring into conflict that entire trucking route with the

people of Balochistan, and this is exactly the sort of thing we're trying

to avoid. We are trying to build this as Balochi-centric project. That's

one of the reasons we moved away from Port Qasim and Port Karachi

as our preferred port of operation because by moving to Gwadar you

keep the entire project in Balochistan. It gives you a better chance to

build that relationship with your partner, Balochistan, the 25 percent

equity stakeholder in the project, potentially 25 percent stakeholder in

the project." 4°

1253. The Tribunal is of the view that Mr. Livesey's testimony is supported by the fact that the

Feasibility Study contained separate sections on both security and risks, which identified
certain issues and set out the strategies to address them.'*°” While it is true that it is also
stated in the chapter on asset evaluation that certain "residual risks," including security
risks, were identified the value of which was not included in the economic evaluation of
the project, '#° the Tribunal does not agree with Respondent that TCCP therefore failed
to adequately address security risks. The same section cited by Respondent states that
such risks "will require further mitigation attention during the subsequent stages." In the
Tribunal's view, it is plausible that not all risks can be fully assessed and quantified at
such an early stage of the project and that the risk mitigation strategy evolves over time
and the further development of the project. Therefore, the Tribunal sees no reason to
assume a failure on the part of TCCP to adequately address security risks in the Feasibility
Study.

1254. Finally, Mr. Livesey emphasized that at no point until the rejection of the Mining Lease
Application did the GOB raise any concerns and that, in fact, the pipeline was not even
mentioned in the Notice of Intent to Reject. He concluded that "J don't see why this is all

of a sudden become a significant issue." "4

1255.At this point, the Tribunal notes that the GOB had known about the option to transport
the concentrate by means of a slurry pipeline since December 2007 when Claimant
presented the transport options as part of its Mineral Agreement Proposals to the
Governments in Dubai.'4!° While the GOB did express its interest in having built a road
to Gwadar in order to improve the infrastructure of the region, there is no indication in
the record that it ever raised any security concerns with regard to the pipeline option.
Respondent's witness Mr. Yaqoob confirmed during the Hearing that "there was no
official discussion with the Government of Balochistan on security issues" and further
that, to his knowledge, there was also no internal discussion between the Licensing
Authority and the GOB. '*!!

1256.Further taking into account the fact that the pipeline as such, let alone the allegedly
ignored security risks, were not mentioned in the Notice of Intent to Reject, the Tribunal
is therefore not convinced that this additional reason invoked by Respondent in this
arbitration played any role in the decision-making process of the Licensing Authority at
the relevant time.

(iv) The Fourth Additional Reason: TCCP Failed to Fully Assess
the Water Source for its Project

1257. As to the fourth additional reason, i.e., that TCCP failed to assess the water source that it
intended to use for its project to full feasibility level, Respondent relies in particular on
the statement made in the Final Report on the Water Resource Assessment that "[a]//
Preferred Groundwater Source acquifers span international borders," i.e., Tran or
Afghanistan; however,

"Hydrogeological assessment has been restricted to specific localities
in Pakistan as permission from the Client to assess the adjacent
groundwater resources by visiting Iran and Afghanistan was not
received. Thus hydrogeological assessment of these areas to Feasibility
level has not been carried out.“

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1

1258.It thus appears that, as far as the Pakistani side of the acquifer is concerned, it is
undisputed that Claimant did make a full feasibility assessment of the groundwater source
that it intended to use for the project, i.e., the Baghicha Bore Field.'*!? The dispute
between the Parties rather relates to the question whether it was inadequate for TCCP not
to make the same assessment for the Afghan side of the acquifer because this would result
in a substantial uncertainty for the project's water supply.

1259. The Tribunal notes that, as emphasized by Claimant's witness Mr. Livesey during the

1414

Hearing, '*'* the section quoted by Respondent above continues as follows:

"Although most aquifers appear regionally extensive and the
confidence level of hydr logical extrapolation appears r ble,
there is a risk of hydrogeological misinterpretation as a large
percentage of some aquifers cannot be physically assessed and

tested."'415

1260. Mr. Livesey explained that the statement relied on by Respondent related primarily to the
other groundwater sources that were assessed in the Final Report because "the bulk of the
Tahlab and the Patangaz head waters are in Iran," and they feed the Tahlab valley, the
Tahlab River and the Saindak river; by contrast, "in the case of the fan sediments which
was our selected area, the water flow was from Pakistan into Afghanistan, so, the
feasibility of the water quantities in Afghanistan doesn't impact — it's not flowing back

into Pakistan, it's flowing the other way."'*'®

1261.In addition, Mr. Livesey laid out that in order to mitigate the risk of not receiving the
required quantities from the Baghicha source, Claimant maintained licenses to the other
areas, which gave them extraction rights with regard to the other water sources, if

needed. !4!7

1262.In addition to Mr. Livesey's convincing testimony on this issue, the Tribunal notes that,
according to its own Feasibility Study for the Supply of Water submitted on 7 September
2012, the GOB chose the same water source for its own mining project, citing the
following advantages over other potential groundwater sources: "No other groundwater
user"; "Large volume of groundwater storage"; "Easy accessibility of pipe line route";

and "Most of area of resource is in Pakistan."'4!8

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1

1263. Based on this record, the Tribunal is convinced that Claimant did in fact make an adequate
assessment of the groundwater source it intended to use for its project so that
Respondent's fourth additional reason also does not present a justifiable basis for denying
TCCP's Mining Lease Application.

iii, Conclusion

1264.In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that none of the reasons invoked in the Notice of Intent
to Reject and/or in this arbitration justified the Licensing Authority's decision to deny
TCCP's Mining Lease Application. The Tribunal is convinced that the real motive for the
denial was the fact that the GOB had decided to develop and implement its own mining
project rather than to collaborate with Claimant pursuant to the CHEJVA and that the
grounds invoked by the Licensing Authority served only as a pretext to conceal this
motive. The Tribunal recalls that Respondent had created legitimate expectations on
Claimant's part that it would be entitled to convert its exploration license into a mining
lease "subject only to compliance with routine Government requirements." Given that
Claimant in fact fulfilled all of the requirements under rule 48 of the 2002 BM Rules in
its Mining Lease Application, Respondent's denial, motivated by its desire to mine the
area on its own, violated Claimant's legitimate expectations and thereby breached the FET
obligation under Article 3(2) of the Treaty.

1265.As a result of this finding, the Tribunal does not have to express an opinion as to whether
this conduct, together with the Governments’ conduct in the Mineral Agreement
negotiations and/or the Supreme Court proceedings amounted to a composite breach of
the FET standard.

D. DID PAKISTAN BREACH ARTICLE 7(1) OF THE TREATY?

1266. There is no dispute between the Parties as regards the applicable expropriation standard,
which is contained in Article 7(1) of the Treaty:

"Neither Party shall nationalise, expropriate or subject to measures
having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation
(hereinafter referred to as 'expropriation') the investments of investors
of the other Party unless the following conditions are complied with:

(a) the expropriation is for a public purpose related to the internal
needs of that Party and under due process of law;

(b) the expropriation is non-discriminatory; and

(c) the expropriation is accompanied by the payment of prompt,
adequate and effective compensation."'4!

1. Summary of Claimant's Position

1267.Claimant alleges that Pakistan breached Article 7(1) of the Treaty by, without payment
of any compensation, (a) arbitrarily depriving TCCA of its right to mine Reko Diq; and
(b) appropriating information and data from TCC's exploration work and studies in order
to use them in Balochistan's own project.'*?° According to Claimant, Respondent
deprived Claimant of its investment "precisely in order take over the project for itself";
therefore, the Governments' conduct amounts to an expropriation pursuant to either a

"pure ‘effects’ test or a more motivation-centered test."'7!

a. Pakistan Unlawfully Expropriated TCCA's Right to Mine Reko Diq

i. The Right to Mine Reko Dig Is a Protected Investment Under the Treaty

1268.Claimant submits that "TCCA's right to mine Reko Dig subject only to compliance with
certain routine requirements" qualifies as an investment within the meaning of Article
1(1) of the Treaty and is thus protected by the expropriation provision under Article
7(1) 422

1269.Claimant refers to the tribunal in Siemens v. Argentina, which observed that the State
parties to an investment treaty have confirmed that contractual rights can be expropriated
where a contract "falls under the definition of ‘investment’ under the treaty" and the
expropriation provision of the treaty refers to "expropriation or nationalization of
investments."'4?> Claimant also cites the tribunal in Vivendi v. Argentina (III), which
confirmed that:

"the taking away or destruction of rights acquired, transmitted and
defined by contract is as much a wrong entitling the sufferer to redress
as the taking away or destruction of a tangible property." 74

1270.Claimant claims that its right to mine Reko Diq arises under Article 11.8.2 of the
CHEJVA as well as under rule 48(1)(b) of the 2002 BM Rules, both of which provide for
the grant of a mining lease subject to the satisfaction of "routine requirements" (i.e., those

specified in rule 48).'475 In Claimant's view, TCCP's Mining Lease Application "by far

exceeded" those "routine Government requirements."'?6

1271.In relation to Pakistan's argument that the scope of Article 7(1) is limited to specific
property rights, Claimant maintains that the provision protects TCCA's investment "as a
whole," i.e., the mining business that it developed in Pakistan, which included, but was
not limited to, the right to mine Reko Dig and the data and information contained in the
Feasibility Study. !4?”

ii. Balochistan's Rejection of the Mining Lease Application Constitutes an
Expropriation

1272.Claimant submits that Balochistan's rejection of the Mining Lease Application in pursuit
of its scheme to take over TCC's project deprived TCC of its right to mine Reko Dig and
therefore constitutes a measure "having effect equivalent to nationalisation or

expropriation" under Article 7(1) of the Treaty. '4?8

1273.Claimant claims that Balochistan acknowledged that its measures constitute a taking and

refers to the following documents: '*??

(i) the 24 December 2009 Cabinet decision to "tak[e] over Rekodiq Copper & Gold
Project from TCCP";'4°

(ii) the 31 December 2009 memorandum to the Chief Secretary in which the MMDD
stated that "the Government of Balochistan has decided to take over the project
from TCCP"; '!

(iii) the 11 February 2010 Working Paper in which the MMDD referred to the Cabinet’s
decision "to take over the Reko-Dig Project from Tethyan Copper Company
Pakistan (TCCP)" and considered it "necessary to engage Legal Advisor /
Consultant for advi{cle before issuing legal notice to TCC for cancellation of
Exploration Agreement";'*? and

foremost objective of the provincial government would be to take full control of
Reko-Dig Copper and Gold Project from its present operators .. . and thereafter .
.. run the project itself."'4

1274. Claimant submits that a measure has "effect equivalent to expropriation" if it results in
“substantial deprivation, or effectively neutralizes the enjoyment, of an investment."
Claimant refers to the tribunal in AJG Capital Partners v Kazakhstan, which held that
such measures include

"covert or incidental interference with the use of property which has
the effect of depriving the owner in whole or in significant part of the
use or reasonably to be expected benefit of property even if not
necessarily to the obvious benefit of the host State."\°+
1275.Claimant further cites the tribunal in Alpha Projectholding GmbH vy. Ukraine, which in
turn referred to the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal stating in the Starrett Housing

case:

"[I]t is recognized in international law that measures taken by a State
can interfere with property rights to such an extent that these rights are
rendered so useless that they must be deemed to have been
expropriated, even though the State does not purport to have
expropriated them and the legal title to the property formally remains
with the original owner."

1276.Claimant argues that, by rejecting TCCP's Mining Lease Application, Balochistan
deprived TCCA of the full value of its investment, on which TCCA had spent more than
US$ 240 million and has not yet received anything in exchange, and transferred this value
to itself. According to Claimant, Pakistan and Balochistan were fully aware of this value
when they took TCCA's contractual and statutory right to mine Reko Dig and thereby

rendered TCCA's property rights useless. '47

1277. With regard to Respondent's argument that the rejection of the Mining Lease Application
was an "exercise of regulatory power," which does not amount to expropriation, Claimant
argues that TCC did not lose its investment as a result of "non-discriminatory" and "bona
fide regulations that aimed at the general welfare" passed by the Licensing Authority or
any other organ of the GOP. Claimant emphasizes that it alleges an expropriation

resulting from the passage of the 2002 BM Rules or other Pakistani legislation, but that
it contends that Pakistan expropriated TCCA's investment by arbitrarily denying TCCP's
Mining Lease Application, taking over TCC's project and using the information and data
that TCCA had obtained as a result of its exploration and feasibility work.'4” In
Claimant's view, the Licensing Authority and the Secretary of the MMDD acted mala
fide, and in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner when they denied the Mining Lease
Application to implement the preordained decision that the Application be "dispose[d]
of" so that Balochistan could then take over the Reko Dig Project from TCCP and use the
data and information from the Feasibility Study to mine the valuable deposits that TCC
had identified “3%

1278.Claimant submits that this conduct amounts to an expropriation under Article 7(1) of the
Treaty, despite the fact the Licensing Authority pretended to apply the criteria of rule
48(3) of the 2002 BM Rules.'4*° Claimant refers to the tribunal in Vivendi v. Argentina
(II), which commented that "international tribunals, jurists and scholars have
consistently appreciated that states may accomplish expropriations in ways . . . that may

seek to cloak expropriative conduct with a veneer of legitimacy."'“°

1279. Claimant further argues that "tribunals have recognized that where a government body
acts outside the proper bounds of its authority, with the purpose and effect of destroying
the value of an investment, the line between ordinary regulatory measures and
expropriatory regulatory measures has been crossed." Therefore, Claimant claims that
Respondent cannot defeat its expropriation claim by relying on any exercise of authority
under the 2002 BM Rules. “4!

iii. Pakistan Failed to Pay Prompt, Full and Effective Compensation

1280.Claimant submits that TCCA undisputedly has not received any compensation from
Pakistan or Balochistan in connection with the rejection of the Application and argues
that this is sufficient, by itself, to render the expropriation of TCCA's investment unlawful
and in violation of Article 7(1) of the Treaty, regardless of whether the measures served

a public purpose and were non-discriminatory. '44?

1281.Claimant claims that, as a result, the Tribunal does not need to establish that the
expropriation also failed to meet the other requirements of Article 7(1), i.e., whether it (a)

served a public purpose, (b) was not discriminatory and (c) complied with basic notions
of due process. In any event, Claimant asserts that Balochistan failed to meet those
requirements as well and refers to its argument that the Government ousted TCC from
Reko Dig in order to develop its own project. '+4

b. Pakistan Unlawfully Expropriated the Data and Information from TCC's
Feasibility Study

i. The Content of the Feasibility Study Is a Protected Investment Under the
Treaty

1282.Claimant submits that TCC's rights to the content of the Feasibility Study as well as other
studies that TCC prepared as part of its exploration work qualify as an investment within
the definition of Article 1 of the Treaty; in particular, they constitute "intangible rights"

and "intellectual and industrial property rights."

1283.Claimant notes that, TCC prepared the Feasibility Study and other exploration studies
pursuant to Clause 3.2 of the CHEJVA "art its sole cost."'** According to Claimant, the
Feasibility Study consists of "nearly 18,000 pages . . . reflect{ing] nearly 200 component
studies, with 300,000 hours of analysis, review and drafting"; it "contains commercially
sensitive, highly valuable conclusions that are the culmination of a decade of exploration
work at Reko Dig"; it "provides detailed guidance for a massive undertaking tailored to
Reko Dig's unique characteristics and contains industry secrets and commercially
sensitive proprietary information"; and it "includes improved processing methods,
developed specifically for Reko Dig, which are currently the subject of a patent

application in the United States."'46

1284. Claimant refers to Clause 18 of the CHEJVA, pursuant to which "all Mining Information
flowing to a Party by reason of the operation of this Agreement shall be confidential" and
shall not be disclosed "without the consent of each party .. . to any third person," subject
only to certain narrow standard exceptions; in addition, the parties agreed to "take all
steps necessary to ensure that the contents of ... Mining Information . . . shall be known
only to such persons as must necessarily acquire such knowledge in the course of their

recognized TCC's property rights over the data and information contained in the

Feasibility Study and other studies. '448

1285.Claimant further notes that the first page of the Feasibility Study expressly reminds
Balochistan that the information contained therein is confidential and that the CHEJVA
parties had agreed to "cause their directors, officers, employees and representatives to
use the information herein contained only for purposes specified in the CHEJVA and for
no other purpose."

ii. Pakistan's Use of the Information from the Feasibility Study for Its Own
Project Constitutes an Expropriation

1286. Claimant submits that by making unauthorized use of the data and information contained
in the Feasibility Study and other studies for Balochistan's project, Pakistan and
Balochistan have appropriated TCCA's intellectual rights, commercially sensitive
proprietary information and industry secrets. In Claimant's view, TCCA was thereby
deprived of the value of its investment, which constitutes a measure "having effect

equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation" under Article 7(1) of the Treaty.'4°

1287. According to Claimant, Balochistan's intention to use TCC's exploration data for its own
project was acknowledged by Dr. Mubarakmand in a December 2010 TV interview:

"Now when we work we will have the results of exploration in front of
us which will help us and we will be able to benefit from those
results,"'45!

1288.Claimant argues that Dr. Mubarakmand's statement is confirmed by the fact that
Balochistan has:

(i) adopted for its project a mining area, which is identical in size, shape and location
to the area that TCC presented at the 25 August 2010 OC meeting when it
introduced the Feasibility Study and TCCP outlined in its Mining Lease
Application; '? and

tapes, sketches, drawings, memoranda, drill cores, logs of such drill cores, geophysical, geological drill maps,
sampling and assay reports, notes."

(ii) used for its water supply project data and information about the Baghicha water
source that TCC discovered in 2008 and identified in its Feasibility Study as the

best water source for mining operations at Reko Diq.'*°

1289. With regard to the water source, Claimant claims that the Government could not have
chosen the Baghicha water source on any basis other than TCC's Feasibility Study, given
that Balochistan's water supply proposal of 20 May 2012 does not indicate that the
Government had undertaken any independent work to select this source, which is
approximately 80 meters underground and cannot be detected from the surface. '4>+

Claimant further submits that on 7 September 2012 Balochistan submitted a "[r]evised

feasibility" study for the water project, which contained information that was in substance

identical to that in the Feasibility Study, and notes that, despite TCCA's requests,

Respondent has not produced evidence that it independently undertook any feasibility

work for its project.'4>

1290.In relation to Respondent's argument that the data and information contained in the
Feasibility Study and other studies prepared by TCC do not belong to TCCA, but rather
to the Government, Claimant submits that neither the CHEJVA nor the 2002 BM Rules
permit the Governments to appropriate this data for Balochistan's own project. !4°°

1291. According to Claimant, the fact that the CHEJVA classifies the data as "Joint Venture
Property" does not grant Balochistan the right to use it to TCC's exclusion because the
Mining Information was intended to be used only for the Joint Venture's mining plans
and was to remain "strictly confidential." Claimant argues that Balochistan would have
been entitled to use the data to undertake its own project only if it had been the sole
Participating Party and had paid a fair value for TCCA's interest in the Joint Venture,
including "the amount of exploration expense." However, Claimant claims that by failing
to elect to proceed in this manner, Balochistan forfeited any right under the CHEJVA to

the Mining Information. '457

1292.Claimant also refers to sub-clause 5.3.3 of the CHEJVA pursuant to which Balochistan
was permitted to use the Mining Information and explore any area over which "the Joint

project, it nevertheless sought to secure all the land within the area of TCC's previous exploration licenses. Reply,

Venture relinquishes any Prospecting License," but "in dealing with third parties with
respect to the relinquished area, [had to] maintain strict confidentiality in accordance
with the requirements of Article 18." Claimant argues that this provision would have been
superfluous if Balochistan had been free to use Mining Information in any event.'4°8

1293. Finally, Claimant refers to Respondent's argument that the Governments’ use of TCCA's
information for Balochistan's own project was permitted under rule 71(1) of the 2002 BM
Rules, which provides the Provincial Government with the right to "data .. . and other
information in respect of exploration or mining operations" and submits that any
regulatory action must still comply with the "fundamental requirements" of Pakistani law.
Claimant refers to Pakistani courts stating that "if power confer[ed] on an Authority is
exercised in bad faith or for any purpose against the concept of law, it is an abuse of

power and fraud on the Statute."'4°°

1294. Claimant notes that the Director General of the MMDD stated in the foreword of the 2002
BM Rules that their purpose was to "attract the interest of investors on such matters as
transparency, . . . security of tenure, . . . independent resolution mechanism etc., and to
equitably meet the objectives of investors as well as aspirations of the Government." In
Claimant's view, the Governments’ conduct cannot be reconciled with this purpose, as
this would allow a government to become a competitor of the investor without prior

disclosure of its intentions or subsequent compensation. 4°

iii. Pakistan Failed to Pay Prompt, Full and Effective Compensation

1295.Claimant submits that TCCA has undisputedly not received any compensation for
Balochistan's unauthorized use of the data and information contained in the Feasibility
Study and other studies for purposes of Balochistan's own project and claims that, as a
result, Pakistan's expropriation of this data is unlawful and constitutes a violation of
Article 7(1) of the Treaty. In relation to the other criteria in Article 7(1), Claimant refers
to its argument that the denial of the Mining Lease Application was arbitrary and contends
that the expropriation was therefore also carried out without a valid public purpose,

without due process and in a discriminatory manner. 4°!

2. Summary of Respondent's Position

a. Claimant Never Had the "Right to Mine Reko Diq"

1296.Respondent refers to the definition of expropriation used by the tribunal in Tradex v.

Albania, i.e., a"compulsory transfer of property rights," 4°

and submits that the question
whether Claimant has acquired such property rights is determined by Pakistani law.
Respondent claims that, contrary to Claimant's allegation, neither the CHEJVA nor the

2002 BM Rules conferred a guaranteed "right to mine" Reko Dig upon Claimant. '4°?

1297.Respondent argues that, besides the fact that the CHEJVA was illegal, void and non-est,
Claimant never complied with the contractual provisions regulating when a joint venture
party could apply for a mining lease in relation to an Exploration Area that belonged to
the Joint Venture. 4

1298. Respondent refers to sub-clause 11.4.2 of the CHEJVA, which provides that "where the
BDA is a Non-participating Party, then subject both to BHPM obtaining all routine
Government approvals required and to compliance with Clause 11.6, BHPM shall be
entitled to undertake sole risk investment (or form a consortium to undertake such
investment in a mining area)" and claims that Claimant never sought, nor was granted

any such Government approval. !#°5

1299. In addition, Respondent submits that Claimant did not satisfy the condition precedent of
acquiring its joint venture partner's "percentage interest pertaining to the proposed
Mining Area" for a price to be agreed by means of negotiations or expert-determination,
as set out in Clause 11.6 of the CHEJVA.'4° Respondent claims that Claimant
acknowledges its failure to comply with this provision by stating in its letter to the
Secretary of Mines dated 29 April 2011 that the parties had been unable to reach a
mutually acceptable decision pursuant to Clause 11.5 within 120 days of the Election
Date, referring to its invitation to the GOB to negotiate of 3 March 2011, and, further,

giving notice of its intent to submit the matter to an independent expert and accordingly

proposing the name of an expert to determine the fair value of the interest. '4°7

1300.Respondent emphasizes that Claimant did not refer the matter to expert determination,
and claims that Claimant's alleged right to apply for a mining lease under Article 11.8.2
thus never arose, before TCCP filed its Mining Lease Application on 15 February
2011.'#°8 Respondent further notes that the potential for such right to arise was

coterminous with the expiry of Exploration License EL-5 on 19 February 2011.'4

1301.In addition, Respondent asserts that, even if the pre-condition was satisfied, Claimant's
Mining Lease Application was for 99.473 square kilometers of the area covered by
Exploration License EL-5, whereas Claimant's election as a Participating Party was the
less than six square kilometers covered by the Feasibility Study. Thus, the question of
any entitlement to the remaining 93 or more square kilometers of the area covered by
Exploration License EL-5 does not even arise under Article 11.8.2. That sub-clause
applies to a Participating Party's right to "develop a mine" in the Mining Area whose
parameters are determined by the Feasibility Study. Respondent refers to the fact that the

Feasibility Study notes that Claimant has the "right to apply for a mining lease." '*”

1302. Respondent further argues that any right under sub-clause 11.8.2 to convert an exploration
license into a mining lease was subject to compliance with the routine Government
requirements set out in rules 47 and 48 of the 2002 BM Rules and alleges that many of
the requirements in rule 48(3) were not satisfied by the Mining Lease Application. '47!

Respondent refers in particular to TCCP's alleged lack of standing to file the Mining

Lease Application on its own, given that it had not acquired its joint venture partner's

interest pursuant to Clause 11.4 before filing the Application, but only approached its

partner to commence negotiations nearly one month later, despite the fact that it had

undertaken to comply with the CHEJVA in its 2006 Undertaking. '7*

1303.Respondent submits that in the absence of a guarantee that Claimant would obtain a right

to mine Reko Dig, the right to apply for a mining lease under the CHEJVA does not meet

the threshold of an “investment.” 473

b. Claimant's Case on Expropriation Remains Unclear

1304. With regard to the alleged expropriation of a "right to mine," Respondent argues that
Claimant does not fulfil the requirements for establishing a breach of Article 7(1) of the
Treaty, as it does not specify (i) the precise scope of its alleged guaranteed "right to mine";
(ii) when precisely such right was taken; and (iii) whether it was taken other than for a
public purpose, discriminatorily and without due process. According to Respondent, the
same applies to Claimant's "claim to performance of the CHEJVA."'*74

1305.In relation to Claimant's claim that "the mining Business [it purportedly] developed in
Pakistan" was expropriated, Respondent contends that Claimant has not defined what is
meant by this phrase and has failed to link this alleged investment to an expropriatory act.
Similarly, Respondent argues that Claimant refers to undefined "property rights" without

specifying their nature, scope or source and the wrongful conduct alleged to have

amounted to an expropriation. '47°

ce. The Licensing Authority's Exercise of Regulatory Powers Over Mineral
Resources Does Not Amount to an Expropriation

1306.Respondent submits that, in refusing TCCP's Mining Lease Application, the Licensing
Authority duly exercised its regulatory powers with regard to the grant or refusal of
mineral titles in Balochistan in accordance with the 2002 BM Rules.'4”° Respondent
claims that the exercise of a state's “police powers” will not give rise to a right of
compensation under international law, as bona fide regulatory measures fall outside the

on the Government, and the Government had made no undertaking in this regard. Mr Nagel could do no more
than hope that his cooperation with the State-owned Czech company SRA would increase his chances to become
involved in the operation of GSM in the Czech Republic, but he could not be certain of getting a licence. Although
he may have been encouraged by various remarks from Ministers or Government officials or by the general interest
they demonstrated in his plans, this was not sufficient, in the Arbitral Tribunal's view, to raise his prospects based
on the Cooperation Agreement to the level of a ‘legitimate expectation’ with a financial value.” Nagel v. The Czech
Republic [RLA-104], [ 326. Respondent also refers to the case of Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine, in which the
tribunal considered it "important first to identify the object of the alleged expropriation" and found that "the
Claimant had a very limited bundle of rights arising under the Order on Land Allocation, Lease Agreements,
Foundation Agreement and Construction Permit. Thus, if the Kyiv City State Administration's omission on 31
October 1997 did constitute an expropriation, it could only have deprived the Claimant of these legal interests
and them alone." Counter-Memorial, {{[ 604-605. Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine [RLA-105], 20.7. Respondent
claims that in the present case, Claimant did not even have a limited bundle of rights in relation to the Mining
Lease Application, as its purported rights did not exist. Counter-Memorial, {| 606.

scope of the expropriation provisions found in investment treaties. '4”” Respondent refers
to the tribunal in Saluka v. Czech Republic, which held:

“Tt is now established in international law that States are not liable to
pay compensation to a foreign investor when, in the normal exercise of
their regulatory powers, they adopt in a non-discriminatory manner
bona fide regulations that are aimed at the general welfare.

[T]he principle that a State does not commit an expropriation and is
thus not liable to pay compensation to a dispossessed alien investor
when it adopts general regulations that are ‘commonly accepted as
within the police power of States’ forms part of customary international
law today.” '478

1307.Respondent also cites the tribunal in Methanex v. USA, which stated:

“[A]s a matter of general international law, a non-discriminatory
regulation for a public purpose, which is enacted in accordance with
due process and which affects, inter alios (sic), a foreign investor or
investment is not deemed expropriatory and compensable unless
specific commitments had been given by the regulating government to
the then putative foreign investor contemplating investment that the
government would refrain from such regulation."\*”

1308.Finally, Respondent refers to Article 3 of the 1967 OECD Draft Convention on the
Protection of Foreign Property, which states that “no Party shall take any measures
depriving, directly or indirectly, of his property a national of another Party"; however,
Respondent emphasizes that pursuant to subsequent notes, “the concept of 'taking' is not
intended to apply to normal and lawful regulatory measures short of direct taking of

property rights.” “°°

1309. Respondent argues that the Licensing Authority did not cancel a mineral title, but rather
refused TCCP’s Mining Lease Application because it did not satisfy the requirements
under rule 48(3), including the requirement that it be in the best interests for the

prevailing in the country at the time, the State had been acting, through the Central Bank, as a prudent and
concerned supervisor in the banking sector. Counter-Memorial, { 611. Genin v. Estonia [RLA-93].

development of minerals in Balochistan. According to Respondent, there is no evidence

that the refusal was not bona fide and not a legitimate exercise of the state's police

powers. !48!

d. The Claim that the Government of Pakistan Expropriated Information and
Data in Relation to the Exploration of Reko Diq Fails as a Matter of Law and
Fact

1310.Respondent rejects Claimant's allegation that it expropriated "intellectual and industrial
property rights in the Feasibility Study and other works (scoping study, pre-feasibility

study, expansion study)." 482

1311.Respondent claims that pursuant to the CHEJVA, the information and data arising from
the exploration of the area covered by Exploration License EL-5 is Joint Venture
Property; thus, Claimant cannot assume ownership of this information and data without
having sought a transfer of its joint venture partner's rights in the Joint Venture
Property. '**? Referring to Claimant's reliance on the confidentiality provision in Clause
18 of the CHEJVA in support of its argument that Balochistan may not use the
information to TCC's exclusion, Respondent emphasizes that the CHEJVA does not
contain an exclusivity requirement and argues that Claimant therefore cannot be the sole

owner of the information. 484

1312.Respondent also refers to Claimant's allegation that, by failing to elect to undertake its
own project upon payment of a fair value for TCCA's interest in the Joint Venture
pursuant to Clause 11.6.1 of the CHEJVA, Balochistan "forfeited any right under the
CHEJVA." Respondent argues that, to the contrary, only upon payment by Claimant of
fair market value for Balochistan's interest would Balochistan have transferred its rights
to Joint Venture Property; however, given that this never happened, Balochistan retained

its right in the Joint Venture's data and information. '**°

1313.Respondent further claims that, pursuant to the rule 71 of the 2002 BM Rules, which
Claimant undertook to abide by, the Government has exclusive ownership and rights over
the data produced during the exploration. '48° Rule 71 provides:

“71. Rights over data - (1) Subject to sub-rule (2), the Government
shall have the exclusive right to all data including geological,

(2) Subject to sub-rule (3) the holder of a mineral tile or mineral
concession shall have the right to make use of the data referred to in
sub-rule (1), free of costs, for the purpose of exploration or mining
operations and to retain copies or samples of material or information
constituting the data.” '#°”

1314. Respondent also cites the 1995 NMP, which provides in relevant part:
“Proprietary Rights over Data

All geodata obtained by a licensee/lessee shall be a property of the
Licensing Authority and shall be deposited at such offices and at such
intervals as are specified in the Rules.” “*8

1315.In Respondent's view, Claimant was aware that it did not have any right to the data under
tule 71, given that the minutes of the OC Meeting held on 24 February 2007 record that:

“Mr Hargreaves noted that GOB had expressed concern at the lack of
submission of reports for the previous Tanjeel Feasibility Study. He
stated that the full suite of engineering reports, all of which were in
draft form at the point of suspension, had been delivered to BDA in
early 2006. He added that it could be misleading to submit the draft
reports to GOB since these would effectively become public
documents containing outdated information, there was risk of extracts
of information causing further confusion.”

1316.Respondent also notes that Claimant's witness Mr. Williams confirmed during the
Hearing that Respondent had a right to, and thus owned, the data generated during the

exploration of Reko Diq.'*”°

1317.In relation to Claimant's argument that rule 71 may not be read "in a vacuum," Respondent
argues that (i) rule 71 does not contain a qualifier, but simply grants the Government with
"the exclusive right to all data .. . in respect of exploration or mining operations"; and

(ii) the Licensing Authority has not breached any applicable law, but rather its actions

have been entirely consistent with its mandate under the 2002 BM Rules. 49!

1318. Finally, Respondent rejects Claimant’s allegation that Balochistan "used" the exploration
data and information for its own project. Respondent emphasizes that Balochistan's
project has not progressed and therefore, by definition, any data from the Feasibility Study

cannot have been used for that purpose. '49?

3. The Tribunal's Analysis
1319. Article 7(1) of the Treaty provides:

"Neither Party shall nationalise, expropriate or subject to measures
having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation
(hereinafter referred to as 'expropriation') the investments of investors
of the other Party unless the following conditions are complied with:

(a) the expropriation is for a public purpose related to the internal
needs of that Party and under due process of law;

(b) _ the expropriation is non-discriminatory; and

(c) the expropriation is accompanied by the payment of prompt,
adequate and effective compensation." 4?
1320.The Tribunal is aware that Claimant separates its expropriation claim as follows: (i)

Respondent arbitrarily deprived Claimant of its right to mine Reko Diq; and (ii)
Respondent appropriated information and data from Claimant's exploration work and
studies and used them for Balochistan's own project. In the Tribunal's view, however, the
second claim is in fact contained within the first claim because the data and information
that Claimant collected over the course of its exploration work and processed in its
studies, in particular the Feasibility Study, as well as the costs that it incurred in this
regard, form part of Claimant's investment at Reko Diq.

a. Claimant's Investment Within the Meaning of Article 7(1) of the Treaty

1321.The Tribunal recalls that it determined above that Claimant's investment is primarily
based on two pillars: (i) TCCA's interest in the CHEJVA and the Joint Venture, including
in particular the right under Clause 11.8.2; and (ii) its interest in TCCP, which was

Venture. Claimant's interest in the CHEJVA includes a 75% interest in the Joint Venture
Property, which is a protected investment under Article 1(1)(a) Treaty because it includes
"tangible and intangible property" (Article 1(1)(a)(i) of the Treaty); "intellectual and
industrial property rights" (Article 1(1)(a)(iv) of the Treaty); and "business concessions
and other rights required to conduct economic activity and having economic value"
(Article 1(1)(a)(v) of the Treaty). The information and data that Claimant collected and
processed throughout its exploration work forms part of this protected Joint Venture
Property.

1322. At this point, the Tribunal notes that it does not follow Claimant's argument that the GOB
forfeited its right to the Joint Venture Property by failing to elect to participate in the
mining development pursuant to Clause 11.3 of the CHEJVA. Rather, the Tribunal agrees
with Respondent that the GOB would have lost its right only upon transferring its interest
to TCCA against payment of the fair value of its interest. However, the absence of such
transfer does not exclude that Claimant's 75% interest in the Joint Venture Property, and
in particular the information and data from Claimant's exploration work and studies,
nevertheless formed an important part of its investment, without which the project could
not have been implemented.

1323. The Tribunal is further aware of Respondent's argument that the right under Clause 11.8.2
to convert the exploration license into a mining lease "subject only to compliance with
routine Government requirements" in fact never arose because the procedure under
Clauses 11.4 through 11.6 was not completed. However, the Tribunal refers to its finding
above that it cannot have been the common intention of the contracting parties that the
GOB would be in a position to block TCCP from making a Mining Lease Application on
its own by refusing to participate in this procedure. The same must apply to the most
essential right of the Joint Venture (or TCCA as the Sole Participating Party) under Clause
11.8.2 to make use of the information and data collected during the exploration period by
applying for, and being granted, a mining lease that would allow it to actually mine the
area. Consequently, the Tribunal is of the view that Claimant's investment did include the
right to convert Exploration License EL-5 into a mining lease upon submission of an
application that met all routine regulatory requirements.

b. Respondent's Measure Having an Effect Equivalent to an Expropriation

1324. As a next step, the Tribunal will analyze whether Claimant's investment as determined
above was expropriated or made subject to a measure having an equivalent effect and, if
so, whether any of the conditions set out in Article 7(1) of the Treaty was not complied
with. If that was indeed the case, there is no need for the Tribunal to conduct a separate
analysis on Claimant's second expropriation claim.

339

Case 1:19-cv-02424-TNM Document 1-1 Filed 08/09/19 Page 990 of 1447
Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability
ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1

1325.In its analysis of whether Respondent breached Article 7(1) of the Treaty, the Tribunal
will first assess whether Claimant's investment was expropriated or made subject to a
measure having an effect equivalent to expropriation. Given that Claimant still has its
75% interest in the CHEJVA and the Joint Venture and still owns 100% of the shares in
TCCP, there has been no direct taking of Claimant's investment and it is thus undisputed
between the Parties that Respondent has not (directly) expropriated such investment.
However, the Parties are in dispute as to whether Respondent's conduct, in particular the
denial of the Mining Lease Application but also the GOB's alleged use of the information
and data, constituted measures having an effect equivalent to expropriation.

1326.Respondent does not contest Claimant's submission that a measure has an "effect
equivalent to expropriation" if it results in "substantial deprivation, or effectively
neutralizes the enjoyment of an investment." 4 The same is true for Claimant's reference
to a statement made by Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in the Starrett Housing case
that property rights "must be deemed to have been expropriated," even though the legal
title formally remained with its owner, if the "State interfere[d] with [the] property rights

to such an extent that these rights are rendered ... useless."'4°°

1327. Therefore, the Tribunal must determine whether Claimant's investment was substantially
deprived of its value and/or rendered useless by Respondent's conduct, in particular by
the Licensing Authority's decision to deny TCCP's Mining Lease Application.

1328.In this regard, the Tribunal notes that the sole purpose of the Joint Venture under the
CHEJVA and, likewise, of TCCP was to carry out the exploration and eventual mining
operations at Reko Dig. After Claimant had spent more than US$ 240 million on its
exploration work and had completed its Feasibility Study on the Initial Mine
Development of the area, TCCP filed an application for a mining lease, which would have
allowed Claimant to amortize the expenditures it had incurred during the exploration
period. By denying TCCP's Mining Lease Application, however, the Licensing Authority
rendered it impossible for Claimant to make use of the information and data it had
collected and thereby also rendered Claimant's interest in both the CHEJVA and in TCCP.
useless. Without a mining lease, neither of them could any longer fulfill their exclusive
purpose, after the exploration had been completed; thus, following the denial of TCCP's
Application, the value of both the CHEJVA and TCCP was effectively neutralized.

1329. Consequently, the Tribunal finds that the denial of TCCP's Mining Lease Application was
a measure having an effect equivalent to expropriation. While the Tribunal is aware of,
and agrees with, Respondent's argument that a bona fide regulatory measure of the State

cannot amount to an expropriation, the Tribunal recalls its finding above that the decision
of the Licensing Authority was not justified by any of the grounds invoked in the Notice
of Intent to Reject and/or in this arbitration. Rather, it was motivated by the GOB's
decision to implement its own project, instead of continuing its collaboration with
Claimant, and therefore amounted to a violation of Respondent's FET obligation. At the
same time, the Tribunal considers that such a motivation excludes the classification of the
denial as a bona fide regulatory measure; despite its "disguise" as an exercise of
regulatory power under rule 48(3) of the 2002 BM Rules, the denial amounts to abuse of
sovereign power that can also constitute a measure with expropriatory effect.

1330. Finally, the Tribunal's finding on the motive for denying the Mining Lease Application
makes it superfluous to decide whether the expropriatory measure must further satisfy a
motivation-centered test (in addition to a pure "effects" test) because the denial not only
had an expropriatory effect, but it was also based on the GOB's motive to take the value
of Claimant's investment for itself and therefore satisfied both tests.

1331.As a result, the Tribunal considers that it does not have to make a separate finding as to
whether the GOB's use of the information and data from Claimant's exploration work and
studies for its own project amounted to a further expropriatory measure. While it indeed
appears from the evidentiary record that the GOB intended to, and did, use information
from Claimant's Feasibility Study, in particular with regard to the proposed Mining

1496

Area'4°6 and the groundwater source, '*°’ during the planning phase of its own project, '4°

the Tribunal notes that the GOB did have a right to this information and data both as a
Joint Venture partner under the CHEJVA and as the Government under rule 71(1) of the
2002 BM Rules. While the provisions of the CHEJVA may not have granted the GOB a
right to use the information and data to Claimant's exclusion but only for the purpose of
the project of the Joint Venture (except for information relating to "relinquished areas"
under Clause 5.3.3, which does not apply in the present case), rule 71(1) of the 2002 BM
Rules expressly grants the GOB the "exclusive right to all data ... as weil as all
interpretative and derivative data including reports, studies ... and other information in

respect of exploration or mining operations." 4°

'496 The coordinates of the mining area over which Balochistan intended to seek a mining lease is identical to the
ones of the proposed Mining Area that TCCP applied for in its Mining Lease Application. Cf. Exhibits CE-283,
p. 15 and CE-272, p. 17.

"Now when we work we will have the results of the exploration in front of us which will help us and we will be
able to benefit from those results." Exhibit CE-108, p. 6.

1332.The Tribunal further notes that Claimant's witness Mr. Williams confirmed during the
Hearing that it corresponds to "the nature of mining around the world, that ... the
information as it's gathered is regularly reported to the relevant Government authority
and that information belongs to the Government as the mineral rights."'>°° However, in
response to the suggestion that the Government may thus use the information "any way
they like," Mr. Williams stated that this was not customary practice but that the
information provided to the Government would rather remain confidential between the

parties and not be used by the Government. !*°!

1333.In light of the above, the Tribunal does not need to make a separate finding as to whether
the use of the data and information from Claimant's exploration work amounts to a further
expropriatory measure under Article 7(1) of the Treaty.

ec. Non-Compliance with the Legality Requirements for an Expropriatory
Measure under Article 7(1) of the Treaty

1334.Having determined that the Licensing Authority's denial of TCCP's Mining Lease
Application constituted a measure having an effect equivalent to an expropriation, the
Tribunal must now analyze whether this measure complied with the requirements for a
lawful expropriation as set out in Article 7(1) of the Treaty. Pursuant to this provision,
the expropriatory measure must (i) serve a "public purpose related to the internal needs
of (Pakistan]"; (ii) be carried out under due process of law; (iii) be non-discriminatory;
and (iv) be accompanied by the payment of "prompt, adequate and effective"
compensation.

1335.While both Parties focused their submissions on the existence (or non-existence) of
Claimant's investment and of an expropriatory measure, they are also in dispute as to
whether the denial, if considered as an expropriatory measure, complied with the further
requirements of Article 7(1) of the Treaty. However, given that Respondent does not
allege that Claimant has received any amount of compensation from either Pakistan or
Balochistan, it can be considered common ground that the expropriation was not
accompanied by the payment of "prompt, adequate and effective" compensation.

1336.In addition, the Tribunal has found above that the denial was not based on justified
grounds but rather motivated by the GOB's desire to implement its own project instead of
collaborating with Claimant under the CHEJVA. Apart from the fact that this finding
renders it questionable whether the expropriatory measure served a public purpose, the
Tribunal in any event considers that the denial was discriminatory because it favored the

GOB's local project over the project of a foreign company. While the Tribunal has further
found that the procedure by means of which TCCP's Application and its subsequent
appeal were denied amounts to a violation of Claimant's legitimate expectations, it does
not need to make a finding as to whether this also amounts to a breach of the due process
requirement. In any event, Respondent has not complied with (at least) two out of four
Treaty requirements and therefore breached Article 7(1) of the Treaty.

E. DID PAKISTAN BREACH ARTICLE 3(3) OF THE TREATY?
1337. Article 3(3) of the Treaty provides as follows:

"Each Party shall, subject to its laws, accord within its territory
protection and security to investments and shall not impair the
management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of
investments."1°

1. Summary of Claimant's Position

a. The Legal Standard of Non-Impairment Under Article 3(3) of the Treaty

1338.Claimant refers to the tribunal in Saluka v. Czech Republic for a definition of the legal
standard of impairment. The Saluka tribunal stated that the term "impairment" includes
“any negative impact or effect caused by measures taken by" the host State. In addition,
the Saluka tribunal held that the term "enjoyment" means "the exercise of a right which
includes the beneficial use, interest and purpose to which property may be put, and

implies [the] right to profits and income therefrom." °°

1339. Claimant emphasizes that Article 3(3) does not require that the impairment be caused by
“arbitrary, unreasonable or discriminatory measures" in order to constitute a Treaty
breach and argues that it is therefore irrelevant in this context whether or not Pakistan's
conduct is also unfair and inequitable, within the meaning of Article 3(2) of the Treaty,

or arbitrary and discriminatory, within the meaning of Article 7(1)(b) of the Treaty. !5

1340. With regard to Pakistan's argument that Article 3(3) has been violated only if Claimant
can “prove[] that the measures allegedly constituting such impairment were in breach
of Pakistani law,” Claimant claims that the qualifier "subject to its laws," on which
Respondent relies, does not apply to the non-impairment obligation. Claimant argues

that the repetition of the word "shail" indicates that Article 3(3) imposes two distinct

obligations on the Contracting States: (i) the full protection and security obligation,
which is qualified by the condition that the host State's conduct be "subject to its laws";

and (ii) the non-impairment obligation, which is not subject to that condition. !°°

1341.In any event, even if the qualifier "subject to its laws" applied to the non-impairment
obligation, Claimant refers to the tribunal in White Industries v. India, which held that
such a reference does "not mean that national laws ‘trump’ international laws, or that the
content of national law affects the interpretation to be given to obligations freely given
by the State" in an investment treaty. !°°° Claimant submits that the standard by which this
Tribunal will determine whether Article 3(3) has been breached is not to be found in the
2002 BM Rules or any other aspect of Pakistani law, but rather in the terms of the Treaty

and general international law.!°°”

b. Respondent Breached Its Obligation Not to Impair Claimant's Investment

1342.Claimant submits that Pakistan has breached Article 3(3) of the Treaty because Pakistan

and Balochistan have not only impaired but altogether prevented TCCA from managing,
maintaining, using, enjoying and disposing of its investment in Reko Dig. '*°*

1343.Claimant argues that Article 3(3) protects TCCA's ability to use the rights and plans it
possessed in relation to its investment in Reko Dig (including, inter alia, rights under the
CHEJVA, the 2002 BM Rules, its Exploration Licenses, its Surface Rights Lease and the

"comprehensive plan to mine Reko Dig") as an investor would use them in the normal
course, i.e., if not impaired by the host State's conduct. 1509

1344. Claimant claims that Balochistan has impaired TCCA's use of those rights and plans by,
for example, (i) taking various measures that prevented TCC from carrying out the plans
for a mine at Reko Diq laid out in the Feasibility Study; (ii) trying to undermine the
CHEJVA in the Supreme Court proceedings by attacking its validity; (iii) breaking the
promises it made in the CHEJVA to support TCC's Mining Lease Application; (iv)
unlawfully denying TCC a mining lease; (v) denying TCC's expatriate staff full and

effective access to the Reko Dig site by delaying and denying administrative clearances,
which had previously been granted "as a matter of course"; (vi) starting to use TCC's
plans as the foundation for its own mining project; and (vii) "purposely hindering and

eventually halting" the Mineral Agreement and Project Agreement negotiations. !*!°

1345.Claimant submits that these acts qualify as an "impairment" within the meaning of Article
3(3) of the Treaty. According to Claimant, there can be little question that Balochistan's
various measures negatively impacted TCCA and its beneficial use of its investment.
Claimant further claims that, even if the impairment were required to be "arbitrary,
unreasonable, or discriminatory," Respondent's conduct would satisfy this standard in

the present case.!>!!

1346. Claimant concludes that, if ever there was a case of the State impairing the "management,

 

use, enjoy or dis} l of ii "as set out in Article 3(3) of the

Treaty, it would be the wrongful conduct of Pakistan's organs and officials, which
prevented TCCA from mining Reko Dig or making any other beneficial use of the work
that TCC performed over a decade or enjoying any return on its investment of more than
US$ 240 million. '5!

2. Summary of Respondent's Position

a. The Legal Standard of Non-Impairment Under Article 3(3) of the Treaty

1347.Respondent submits that pursuant to Article 3(3) of the Treaty, any obligation "not to
impair" is subject to Pakistani law.'*'? According to Respondent, the ordinary meaning
of Article 3(3) makes clear that the qualifier "subject to [the host State's] Jaws" applies to

the non-impairment obligation set out therein; therefore, the application of those laws

cannot result in a violation of the Treaty, even if they result in an impairment.'>!+

1348. In relation to Claimant's reliance on the case of White Industries v. India, Respondent
claims that this case concerned a most-favored nation clause, which was not qualified by

a comparable phrase; therefore, it cannot provide any guidance as to the statutory

interpretation of the non-impairment obligation in the present case. !!>

1349. Respondent also refers to Claimant's reliance on the case of Saluka v Czech Republic, and
the tribunal's definition of the term “impairment” in that case as “any negative impact or
effect caused by measures taken by” the host State. Respondent notes that the non-
impairment standard in that case was qualified by a requirement of "reasonableness," as
explained by the tribunal:

“The standard of ‘reasonableness’ has no different meaning in this
context than in the context of the ‘fair and equitable treatment’ standard
with which it is associated; and the same is true with regard to the
standard of ‘non-discrimination’. The standard of ‘reasonableness’
therefore requires, in this context as well, a showing that the State’s
conduct bears a reasonable relationship to some rational policy,
whereas the standard of ‘non-discrimination' requires a_ rational
justification of any differential treatment of a foreign investor.

Insofar as the standard of conduct is concerned, a violation of the non-
impairment requirement does not therefore differ substantially from a
violation of the ‘fair and equitable treatment’ standard. The non-
impairment requirement merely identifies more specific effects of any
such violation, namely with regard to the operation, management,

re, use, enjoy or dis} l of the i by the
191516

 

investor.

1350.In Respondent's view, this statement contradicts Claimant's assertion that, in the present
case, Respondent's measures do not have to be "arbitrary, unreasonable or
discriminatory" in order to give rise to a breach of Article 3(3).!>!”

b. Respondent Did Not Breach Its Obligation Not to Impair Claimant's
Investment

1352. As regards Claimant's plans to mine Reko Diq, Respondent argues that, besides failing to
explain how those plans constitute an investment, Claimant cannot show how the alleged
unspecified "various measures" have impaired its plans in breach of Pakistani law.
According to Respondent, the Licensing Authority refused to grant the Mining Lease
Application in accordance with its powers under rule 48 of the 2002 BM Rules and TCC's
joint venture partner refused to participate in the mining venture in compliance with
Article 11.3 of the CHEJVA.'5'°

1353.In relation to Balochistan's conduct in the Supreme Court proceedings, Respondent
claims that Balochistan had a duty to the Court to provide the entire record relating to the
CHEJVA and took the position that the Court should decide the matter on the merits.
According to Respondent, "Pakistani law permits a party to change or modify its position

in court upon the receipt of additional information or documentation." °°

1354.Referring to Claimant's allegation that Balochistan broke the "promises it made in the
CHEJVA to support TCC's Mining Lease Application," Respondent claims that there is
no provision in the CHEJVA that requires the joint venture partner to do so. Respondent
emphasizes that pursuant to the CHEJVA, the BDA was expressly allowed not to
participate in the mining venture, in which event Claimant could make an application at
its sole risk, subject to the satisfaction of the required Government regulations and the
conditions precedent concerning the acquisition of the BDA's interest pursuant to Article
11.6, 152!

1355.As for the Licensing Authority's rejection of Claimant's Mining Lease Application,
Respondent contends that the decision was made pursuant to the 2002 Mining Rules and
does not constitute an impairment. Respondent contends that Claimant did not have a
right to receive, but at best a right to apply for, a mining lease, and claims that this right
was not interfered with, as TCCP’s Application was duly considered under the 2002 BM
Rules.'>?? In Respondent's view, the rejection of the Mining Lease Application on
"proper, or at least not unreasonable, grounds" cannot be considered an impairment of

the right to apply for a mining lease. !°?3

1356. Finally, as to the denial of security clearances by the Governments for certain members

conduct constitutes an impairment of its investment. !°*4

3. The Tribunal's Analysis

1357. The Parties are in disagreement as to (a) the applicable standard of non-impairment under
Article 3(3) of the Treaty, in particular whether the standard is qualified by the words
"subject to its laws"; and (b) whether Respondent's conduct, i.e., the denial of the Mining
Lease Application but also further individual actions, amounts to a violation of the non-
impairment obligation. The Tribunal will therefore first determine the standard applicable
to Respondent's obligation to refrain from impairing Claimant's investment in its territory
pursuant to Article 3(3) of the Treaty before assessing in a second step whether
Respondent's conduct amounts to a violation of this obligation.

a. The Applicable Standard of Non-Impairment

1358.With regard to the applicable standard, the Parties agree that Respondent's non-
impairment obligation is provided for in Article 3(3) of the Treaty, which may be quoted
again at this point:
"Each Party shall, subject to its laws, accord within its territory
protection and security to investments and shall not impair the

management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of
investments." !575

1359. The Parties are in dispute as to (i) whether the qualifier "subject to its laws" applies only
to the Contracting Parties’ obligation to accord protection and security to investments
(first part) or also to the obligation to refrain from impairing investments (second part);
and (ii) whether an impairment amounts to a violation of the Treaty only if it is caused by

“arbitrary, unreasonable or discriminatory measures."

1360.The Tribunal will interpret Article 3(3) of the Treaty pursuant to Article 31(1) of the
Vienna Convention, i.e., "in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be
given to the terms of the treaty in their context in the light of its object and purpose."'>**
The Tribunal agrees with Claimant that the decision to place the qualifier "subject to its
laws" after the word "shall" before the first part of the provision and to repeat the word

"shall" before the second part of the provision indicates that the Contracting States

intended to make a distinction between the two obligations contained in this provision —

to the effect that only the first obligation is qualified by the term "subject to its laws.

1361.In the Tribunal's view, this interpretation is supported by the differing quality of the two
obligations: While the obligation to accord protection and security to an investment
requires the State to take proactive measures in order to protect the investment, the non-
impairment obligation requires the State to refrain from taking measures against the
investment. In the context of the obligation to accord protection and security, the
Contracting Parties intended to clarify that the State can be expected to take proactive
measures only within the framework of its own laws. However, if the qualifier were to be
applied literally to the non-impairment obligation, the State would be obliged to refrain
from taking measures "subject to its laws," to the effect that it would not be prohibited to
take measures outside the framework of its laws. It is apparent that this was not the
intention of the Contracting Parties.

1362.Respondent's interpretation, on the other hand, would allow the State to impair the
investment as long as it would be entitled to do so under its own laws. This interpretation
would be contrary to the fundamental principle that a State cannot rely on its domestic
law to determine the scope of, and thus to escape its liability under, international law.
Therefore, the Tribunal considers that it corresponds to both the ordinary meaning of the
provision and the object and purpose of the Treaty that the non-impairment obligation is
not qualified by the term "subject to its laws."

1363. With regard to the second question whether the impairment must be caused by "arbitrary,
unreasonable or discriminatory measures," the Tribunal notes that, unlike other treaties
(e.g., Article 2(2) of the Australia-Hong Kong BIT!’ or Article 3(2) of the Australia-
Chile BIT!>8), Article 3(3) of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty does not qualify the non-
impairment obligation by reference to arbitrary, discriminatory or unreasonable
measures, thus raising the question of whether it prohibits any measure that impairs the
investment. However, the Tribunal does not have to make a finding on this question if it
finds that the impairment of Claimant's investment was in any event arbitrary,

1527 Article 2(2) of the Australia-Hong Kong BIT provides in relevant part: "[...] Neither Contracting Party shall,
without prejudice to its laws, in any way impair by or discriminatory measures the
maintenance, use, enjoyment, or disposal of investments in its area of investors of the other Contracting Party.
L...]" (emphasis added)

1528 Article 3(2) of the Australia-Chile BIT provides: "Each Contracting Party shall, subject to its laws, regulations
and investment policies, protect within its territory investments by investors of the other Contracting Party and
shall not impair, by or y measures, the e, use, enjoyment,
sale and liquidation of such investments." (emphasis added)

unreasonable and discriminatory and thus fulfills even the stricter standard advanced by
Respondent.

b. Did Respondent's Conduct Amount to a Violation of Article 3(3) of the Treaty?

1364. As stated above, the same conduct that amounts to a violation of the FET obligation, in
this case, the denial of TCCP's Mining Lease Application, can at the same time amount
to a violation of the non-impairment obligation if such conduct has one or more of the
effects set out in Article 3(3) of the Treaty, i.e., if it "impair[s] the management,
maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of [Claimant's] investment."!>”? In addition to
the denial of the Application, Claimant invokes the following actions of Respondent as
conduct that impaired the use of its investment: (i) Balochistan's attacks on the validity
of the CHEJVA in the Supreme Court proceedings; (ii) Balochistan's violation of its
promises under the CHEJVA to support TCCP's Mining Lease Application; (iii)
Balochistan's denial of the administrative clearances, and thus access to Reko Digq, for
TCC's expatriate staff; (iv) Balochistan's use of TCC's plans for its own project; and (v)
the Governments' conduct in the negotiations on the Mineral Agreement and the Project
Agreement by which they "purposely" hindered and halted the negotiations.

1365.In the Tribunal's view, it is not necessary to assess whether each of these actions by itself
would amount to a violation of Respondent's non-impairment obligation because, if
considered together with the denial of the Mining Lease Application, Respondent's
conduct clearly impaired, if not prevented altogether, the use of Claimant's investment.
By denying TCCP's Mining Lease Application, Respondent prevented Claimant from
making any use of its exploration work and of any possibility to amortize its expenditures
— much less to realize the benefit of its investment. Given that both the Joint Venture in
which Claimant had a 75% interest and Claimant's subsidiary TCCP were established for
the sole purpose of carrying out the exploration and, ultimately, the mining operations at
Reko Dig, Claimant's investment was rendered useless when the Mining Lease
Application was denied.

1366. The Tribunal further refers to its findings above that (i) the denial was motivated by the
GOB's desire to implement its own project rather than to continue its collaboration with
TCCA; and that (ii) the Licensing Authority did not have any justified grounds for
denying the Application. In light of these findings, the Tribunal considered it questionable
whether the denial served a public purpose, but in any event found that it was

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1

"discriminatory" because Respondent thereby favored the GOB's local project over that
of Claimant or the Joint Venture.

1367.Respondent's further actions that Claimant invokes confirm this finding — except for the
alleged violation of specific provisions under the CHEJVA, which is a question to be
decided by the ICC Tribunal and on which this Tribunal will therefore not express an
opinion. In the Tribunal's view, all of these actions contributed to the impairment effect
on Claimant's investment and/or demonstrate that the GOB's true motive behind the
denial was its desire to implement its own project.

1368. First, Balochistan's change of position in the Supreme Court proceedings in early 2011
was aimed at obtaining a declaration from the Supreme Court that the CHEJVA and thus
Claimant's right to convert its exploration license into a mining lease was null and void.
While this conduct did not have an immediate effect on Claimant's investment, it
contributed to the fact that the security of tenure conferred to Claimant by means of
Clause 11.8.2 was called into question.

1369.Second, the Tribunal considers it (at least) curious that the GOB started to deny
administrative clearances for TCC's expatriate staff on 12 December 2009, i.e., three days
after its own project had been approved by the ECNEC and on the very same day that the
MMDD took over as the GOB's representative on the Operating Committee.'°*? The
denial of access for experienced staff impaired the use of Claimant's investment and the
timing indicates that this conduct was motivated by the GOB's intention to "take over"
Claimant's project as decided by the Balochistan Cabinet in its meeting a few days

later. 53!

1370. Third, Balochistan's use of TCC's exploration data for its own project confirms that the
purported insufficiencies of Claimant's Feasibility Study did not have any justified basis.
While the use of the data in itself does not impair Claimant's investment, it demonstrates
that Balochistan intended to develop its own project in the exact same area and thus in a
manner that would not be compatible with the simultaneous implementation of Claimant's
project.

1371.Finally, as regards the negotiations on the Mineral and Project Agreements, the Tribunal
considers that the decision of the Balochistan Cabinet on 24 December 2009 "not to go
ahead with the proposed Mineral and Shareholder agreements with TCCP," >? together
with the Tribunal's impression from the record that no actual negotiations took place after

this decision,'*** further support the Tribunal's finding that the decision against
Claimant's project was related to Balochistan's plans to develop its own project.

1372.As a result, the Tribunal finds that, as confirmed by the above mentioned actions, the

F.

denial of the Mining Lease Application impaired the use of Claimant's investment. The
Tribunal is further convinced that Respondent's measures were motivated by the desire to
implement its own project — without having a justified ground for denying the Mining
Lease Application. Therefore, the measures were also "arbitrary, unreasonable and
discriminatory" and thus fulfill even the stricter standard of protection that has been
advanced by Respondent. Consequently, the Tribunal does not have to make a finding as
to the exact scope of the non-impairment obligation, since the denial of the Mining Lease
Application in any event amounts to a violation of Article 3(3) of the Treaty.

CONCLUSION ON CLAIMANT'S CLAIMS

1373.In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that, by denying TCCP's Mining Lease Application in

order to allow the GOB to implement its own project instead, Respondent breached its
obligation to accord Claimant fair and equitable treatment under Article 3(2) of the
Treaty, carried out a measure having effect equivalent to expropriation that did not
comply with the requirements for a lawful expropriation under Article 7(1) of the Treaty,
and impaired the use of Claimant's investment in violation of Article 3(3) of the Treaty.

1374. While the Tribunal is aware that Respondent has further raised the argument that

Claimant's claim must fail in limine because it has failed to address causation, the
Tribunal considers it sufficient to state at this point that Respondent's conduct deprived
Claimant of the value of its investment and thereby directly caused a loss that is to be
quantified at a later stage of the proceedings. In the Tribunal's view, any specific questions
on whether Respondent's conduct was causal for individual parts of Claimant's — yet
unquantified — claim cannot be dealt with in the abstract but will be addressed as part of
the quantum phase of the proceedings.

VII. RESPONDENT'S COUNTERCLAIMS

1375.Respondent claims that (i) Claimant's alleged "investment" was not made "in accordance

with [Pakistan's] laws and investment policies" as set out in Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty;
(ii) Claimant breached Clauses 11, 15 and 24.6 of the CHEJVA because it did not even

with Balochistan's Chief Secretary in March and June 2010, with Pakistan's Prime Minister in July 2010, with the
MPNW in September 2010 and officials from both Governments in July 201 1, it appears from the record that these
were high-level meetings, which did not include any actual negotiations on the terms of the Mineral and/or Project
Agreement. Cf. Exhibits CE-84, CE-85, CE-90, RE-79 and RE-80.

attempt to comply with the contractual pre-conditions set out in the CHEJVA before filing
its Mining Lease Application, and because it prepared a "secret" Expansion Pre-

because it failed to complete "a full feasibility study of the discovered deposits" in the
area covered by Exploration License EL-5, despite the fact that it had undertaken to do

JURISDICTION

Summary of Respondent's Position

1377.Respondent submits that pursuant to the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules,

counterclaims are admissible. Respondent refers to Article 46 of the ICSID Convention,
which states:

“Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall, if requested
by a party, determine any .. . counter-claims arising directly out of the
subject-matter of the dispute provided that they are within the scope of
the consent of the parties and are otherwise within the jurisdiction of
the Centre.” >>

1378.Respondent further quotes Rule 40(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules:

“Except as the parties otherwise agree, a party may present an
incidental or additional claim or counter-claim arising directly out of
the subject-matter of the dispute, provided that such ancillary claim is
within the scope of the consent of the parties and is otherwise within the
jurisdiction of the Centre.”

1379.Respondent notes that it timely filed its counterclaims under Rule 40(2) of the ICSID

Arbitration Rules, which provides that a counterclaim is timely if presented "no later than
in the Counter-Memorial." °°

Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability
ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1

1380.Respondent submits that its counterclaims further meet all other jurisdictional
requirements under Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 40(1) of the ICSID
Arbitration Rules, as they (a) arise directly out of the subject matter of the dispute; (b) are
within the scope of the consent of the parties; and (c) are otherwise within the jurisdiction
of the Centre. '°

a. Respondent's Counterclaims Arise Directly out of the Subject-Matter of the
Dispute

1381.In the context of the first requirement, Respondent refers to Note B (a) to Rule 40 of the
ICSID Arbitration Rules:

“The test to satisfy [whether a counter-claim arises directly out of the
subject-matter of the dispute] is whether the factual connection between
the original and ancillary claim is so close as to require the
adjudication of the latter in order to achieve the final settlement of the
dispute, the object being to dispose of all grounds of dispute arising out
of the same subject-matter.” '>*°
1382.Respondent claims that there is a close factual connection between Claimant's claims and
Respondent's counterclaims, which requires that they are adjudicated in the same
proceedings, because the counterclaims are "the flip side" of Pakistan's defenses against
Claimant’s claims, and arise primarily from the same provisions of the CHEJVA and the
2002 BM Rules; therefore, a final settlement of the dispute between Claimant and

Respondent requires that Respondent's counterclaims be considered as well.'**!

1383. In relation to Claimant's argument that the admission requirement in Article 1(1)(a) of the
Treaty can only result in a rejection of its claim for lack of jurisdiction, but not give rise
to a counterclaim for a violation of the Treaty, Respondent argues that Article 1(1)(a)
imposes an obligation on the investor, which Claimant has failed to fulfil, and therefore
it can give rise to a counterclaim by Respondent. '**?

1384. With regard to Claimant's argument that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to decide
Respondent's counterclaims to the extent they are based on alleged breaches of the
CHEJVA because of the exclusive arbitration clause contained therein, Respondent
argues that the only question to be considered by this Tribunal is whether the

counterclaims have a sufficient nexus with Claimant's claim under the Treaty and thus

satisfy the requirements of Article 46 of the ICSID Convention. !>47

1385.Finally, Respondent refers to Claimant's argument that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction
over Respondent's counterclaims that are based on to the 2002 BM Rules and notes that
the tribunal in the case of Paushok v. Mongolia, which Claimant relies on, had to consider
Article 19 of the UNCITRAL Rules, which specifically limit counterclaims to issues
“arising out of the same contract."'* In addition, Respondent claims that the present
case can be distinguished from Paushok v. Mongolia because, unlike the relevant treaty
in that case, Article 13 of the Treaty makes provision for counterclaims as well as for
claims under both domestic law and the Treaty. As a result, Respondent claims that the
Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear Respondent's counterclaims based on the 2002 BM Rules

and the laws or investment policies of Pakistan. +

b. Respondent's Counterclaims Are Within the Scope of Consent of the Parties

1386. Respondent refers to the tribunal in Roussalis v. Romania, which held that the question
whether a claimant's consent to arbitrate extended to counterclaims "must be determined
in the first place by reference to the dispute resolution clause in the BIT."'>*6

1387.Respondent submits that, contrary to other treaties such as the Greece-Romania BIT,
which limit the class of claimants to investors only,'**’ Article 13(2) of the Treaty
provides that “either party” may submit “the dispute” to ICSID arbitration. In addition,
Respondent notes that Article 13(5) refers to “counter-claim[s]” being asserted by a

Contracting Party to the Treaty against an investor and argues that the Treaty thus clearly
anticipates that a State may advance claims or counterclaims against an investor.!>48

Respondent rejects Claimant's argument that this reference to counterclaims in Article

13(5) is limited to domestic proceedings as being contrary to the ordinary meaning of the

phrase "any proceeding."

1388. As a result, Respondent claims that, by initiating these proceedings pursuant to Article 13
of the Treaty, Claimant also consented to counterclaims being raised by Respondent. !°°°

1389. Respondent further claims that, by resorting to ICSID arbitration, Claimant consented to
be bound by Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 40 of the ICSID Arbitration
Rules.!°>! According to Respondent, Article 46, if interpreted in accordance with Article
31(1) of the Vienna Convention, clearly envisages that, subject to certain conditions, a
State respondent may bring counterclaims. According to Respondent, this is confirmed
by Article 36(1) of the ICSID Convention, which refers to institution of arbitration
proceedings either by a national of a Contracting State or by a Contracting State itself. !°°?

Respondent refers to Kendra in relation to the travaux preparatoires of the ICSID

Convention:

"It was therefore the expressed intention of the authors of the
Convention that ICSID arbitration should not be a one-way street and
that claims and therefore counterclaims could be brought by host
states"!

1390. Respondent also quotes Professor Reisman in Roussalis v Romania:

“[When the State Parties to a BIT contingently consent, inter alia, to
ICSID jurisdiction, the consent component of Article 46 of the
Washington Convention is ipso facto imported into any ICSID
arbitration which an investor then elects to pursue. It is important to
bear in mind that such counterclaim jurisdiction is not only a
concession to the State Party: Article 46 works to the benefit of both
respondent state and investor.” '°>4

1391.In addition, Respondent refers to the tribunal in Goetz v. Burundi, which held that, by
accepting Burundi's offer in the treaty to go to ICSID arbitration, the claimants had
provided a "twofold consent," which included their consent that counterclaims would be
considered by the tribunal, provided that the conditions laid down by Article 46 of the
ICSID Convention and Rule 40 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules were met.'°°>

c. Respondent's Counterclaims Are Otherwise Within the Jurisdiction of the
Centre

1392. Respondent submits that its counterclaims also meet the five jurisdictional requirements
of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention: (1) there is a “legal dispute” between the
Parties; (2) the dispute relates to an “investment”; (3) it “arises directly” out of that
investment; (4) it is between a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention and a national
of another Contracting State; and (5) the Parties consented in writing to submit the dispute
to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.'°*°

1393.Respondent submits that there is a "legal dispute" between the Parties because
Respondent's counterclaims arise out of Claimant’s breach of the Treaty, in particular its
failure to comply with the requirement that the investment be “admitted by [Respondent]
subject to its laws,” its breach of the CHEJVA as the underlying investment agreement
in this case, and its breach of the 2002 BM Rules. !°>7

1394.Respondent claims that, in case the Tribunal dismisses Respondent’s objections to
jurisdiction and admissibility, the dispute also “arises directly" out of Claimant’s
“investment,” as the counterclaims relate to and arise out of the same contractual
instruments (the CHEJVA and related agreements), and the same regulatory instrument
(the 2002 BM Rules), which Claimant relies on as constituting its investment. '°>*

1395.Respondent further notes that it is a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention and that
Claimant is a national of another Contracting State to the ICSID Convention (namely,

Australia). °°

1396. Finally, Respondent claims that both Parties have consented in writing to submit this
dispute to the jurisdiction of this ICSID Tribunal: Respondent provided its written consent
in Article 13 of the Treaty; and Claimant provided its written consent in paragraph 16 of

its Request for Arbitration. °°

2. Summary of Claimant's Position

1397.Claimant refers to the requirements under Article 46 of the Convention and submits that
the tribunal in Saluka v. Czech Republic held that a counterclaim is not admissible unless
its subject matter is “intimately connected with the subject-matter of the primary

claim.”'*©! Claimant claims that the claims and counterclaims must be “indivisible” and
991562

“interdependent.
a. There Is No Basis on Which the Tribunal Could Hear the Sole Counterclaim
Alleging a Treaty Breach

1398. In relation to Respondent's first counterclaim alleging that TCCA violated Article 1(1)(a)
of the Treaty, Claimant submits that none of the provisions of the Treaty impose an
obligation on the investor. According to Claimant, Article 1(1)(a) is only a definition,
which establishes a jurisdictional requirement that an investor must satisfy in order to be
protected by the Treaty; it does not impose a substantive obligation on the investor and

therefore cannot give rise to a claim by the State for a violation of the Treaty. !°°

1399. Claimant relies on the tribunal in Spyridon Roussalis v. Romania, which found that where
a treaty “imposes no obligations on investors, only on contracting States .
counterclaims fall outside the tribunal’s jurisdiction,” unless the treaty specifies
otherwise. !° Claimant argues that, contrary to Respondent's allegations, Article 13(5) of
the Treaty does not provide authority for the host State to bring counterclaims against the
investor for breach of the Treaty. Article 13(5) states:

"In any proceeding involving a dispute relating to an investment, a
Party shall not assert, as a defence, counterclaim, right of set-off or
otherwise, that the investor concerned has received or will receive
pursuant to an insurance or guarantee contract, indemnification or
other compensation for all or part of any alleged loss."!°°

1400. Claimant argues that the term “any proceeding” refers not only to ICSID proceedings
(initiated pursuant to Article 13(2)(b)), but also to domestic judicial or administrative
proceedings (initiated under Article 13(2)(a)).!°© In addition, Claimant emphasizes that
Article 13(5) does not authorize the filing of counterclaims based on the Treaty, but rather
denies the right to assert defenses or counterclaims based on the investor's recovery from
third parties.'°°’ In Claimant's view, Article 13(5) therefore only refers to counterclaims

that may be filed in domestic proceedings, but it does not constitute the Contracting
States’ consent to arbitration of counterclaims against an investor in ICSID

proceedings. >

b. The Tribunal Lacks Jurisdiction over Pakistan's Non-Treaty Counterclaims

1401.With regard to Respondent's second counterclaim alleging that TCCA breached the
CHEJVA, Claimant notes that it is undisputed that the Government of Pakistan is not a
party to the CHEJVA; therefore, Respondent has no standing to bring a claim under the
CHEJVA.!5® Claimant emphasizes that, while Balochistan's acts are attributable to
Respondent under international law, Balochistan remains a separate entity under
Pakistani law, which is juridically distinct from Respondent and has the authority to enter

into and enforce its own contracts. 57°

1402. Claimant further submits that even if Respondent did have standing to assert contractual
claims against TCCA, this Tribunal would not have jurisdiction to hear them, given that
Treaty does not contain an umbrella clause (the only possible source of jurisdiction over
contractual disputes) and there is no satisfactory nexus with TCCA’s Treaty-based

claims. !57!

1403.Claimant also refers to the exclusive arbitration provision contained in the CHEJVA,
pursuant to which all disputes concerning the CHEJVA must be submitted to ICC
arbitration, and emphasizes that Balochistan has brought identical counterclaims (as

Proceedings, which is the proper forum for these claims.!°’? Claimant refers to the
tribunal in Saluka v. Czech Republic, which held that “[t]he Tribunal thus cannot in this
arbitration entertain a counterclaim based on a dispute arising out of or in connection
with, or the alleged breach of, an agreement which . . . contains its own mandatory

arbitration provision” and which is already the subject of separate proceedings. !>7

1404. As to Respondent’s third counterclaim alleging that TCCA breached the 2002 BM Rules,
Claimant similarly argues that the Treaty does not provide any basis for jurisdiction over
claims which are based on an alleged breach of Pakistani law, and that there is no
satisfactory nexus to TCCA’s Treaty claims.!°* Claimant refers to the UNCITRAL

tribunal in Paushok v. Mongolia, which held that “an arbitral tribunal exclusively vested
with jurisdiction under the BIT’ does not have jurisdiction over counterclaims that

“exclusively raise issues of non-compliance with [Respondent’s] public law,” because
such claims “cannot be considered as constituting an indivisible part of the Claimants’
claims based on the BIT and international law or as creating a reasonable nexus between

the Claimants’ claims and the Counterclaims.”'>7

1405. According to Claimant, Pakistan acknowledges that its primary counterclaims do not arise

under the Treaty, but only as a matter of contract (the CHEJVA) or under Pakistani law
(the 2002 BM Rules), and merely asserts that the Tribunal's jurisdiction over them follows
from its jurisdiction over Claimant's claims (in the alternative, that its objections to
jurisdiction and admissibility should fail). Claimant submits that Respondent's argument
is based on the "fallacy" that TCCA asserts non-Treaty claims over which this Tribunal
has jurisdiction. Claimant emphasizes that, to the contrary, TCCA's claims arise under
the Treaty, which is why Pakistan's argument that it should likewise be entitled to assert

non-Treaty claims must fail.!°7°

1406. With regard to Respondent's reliance on Article 46 of the ICSID Convention, Claimant

claims that this provision is irrelevant in the present case because it is only of a procedural
nature and cannot provide the source of the Tribunal's jurisdiction, as the dispute must be
"within the scope of the consent of the Parties and . . otherwise within the jurisdiction of
the Centre."!>7" Claimant argues that neither of those two requirements is met with regard
to Respondent's contract claims; in particular, the scope of consent as defined by the
Treaty does not extend to non-Treaty claims, which are, as Respondent itself argues,
within the exclusive jurisdiction of the ICC Tribunal. 578

The Tribunal's Analysis

1407. Respondent raises its counterclaims in the alternative, i.e., in the event that the Tribunal

finds that Claimant made an "investment" within the meaning of Article 1(1)(a) of the
Treaty and dismisses Respondent's further objections to jurisdiction and admissibility. As
set out above, the Tribunal affirmed its jurisdiction to hear Claimant's claims and found
them to be admissible. Therefore, the Tribunal is called to make a decision on
Respondent's counterclaims and must first determine whether it has jurisdiction to hear
them.

1408. In its analysis, the Tribunal will have to take into account that Respondent invokes three
bases of a different legal quality for its counterclaims: (i) Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty;
(ii) Clauses 11, 15 and 24 of the CHEJVA, i.e., provisions of the investment agreement
concluded between Claimant and the GOB, representing the Province of Balochistan; and
(iii) rule 29(2)(c)(iii) of the 2002 BM Rules, i.e., a provision of the provincial regulatory
framework enacted by Balochistan. The Tribunal will therefore assess whether it has
jurisdiction to hear any or all of Respondent's counterclaims on these legal bases.

1409. Even though Claimant emphasizes that Article 46 of the ICSID Convention cannot in
itself be the source of the Tribunal's jurisdiction, the Parties agree that the relevant
jurisdictional requirements for raising counterclaims in ICSID proceedings can be derived
from this provision as well as from Rule 40(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.

1410. Article 46 of the ICSID Convention reads:

"Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall, if requested
by a party, determine any incidental or additional claims or
counterclaims arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute
provided that they are within the scope of consent of the parties and are
otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre."

1411.Rule 40(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules reads:

"Except as the parties otherwise agree, a party may present an
incidental or additional claim or counter-claim arising directly out of
the subject-matter of the dispute, provided that such ancillary claim is
within the scope of the consent of the parties and is otherwise within the
jurisdiction of the Centre."

1412. Both provisions provide for the same three requirements: (a) the counterclaims must arise
directly out of the subject matter of the dispute; (b) they must be within the scope of
consent of the Parties; and (c) they must otherwise be within the jurisdiction of ICSID.
The Tribunal will address these requirements in turn.

a. Do the Counterclaims Arise Directly Out of the Subject Matter of the Dispute?

1413.As to the first requirement that the counterclaims must arise directly out of the subject
matter of the dispute, Respondent refers to Note B (a) to Rule 40 of the ICSID Arbitration
Rules pursuant to which it has to be determined "whether the factual connection between
the original and ancillary claim is so close as to require the adjudication of the latter in
order to achieve the final settlement of the dispute."'*” Claimant relies on the

‘519 Counter-Memorial, 631.

interpretation given by the tribunal in Saluka v. Czech Republic, which held that the
subject matter of the counterclaim must be "intimately connected with the subject-matter
of the primary claim."'**° Tn the Tribunal's view, these interpretations are not very far
apart from one another but the dispute between the Parties rather focuses on whether there
is a sufficient nexus between Claimant's Treaty claims and Respondent's counterclaims,
insofar as the latter are based on breaches of the CHEJVA and the 2002 BM Rules, as to
constitute the required "close" or "intimate" connection.

1414. The Tribunal is of the view that, irrespective of the question whether Article 13 of the
Treaty extends to non-Treaty claims in the present case (to be answered as part of the
analysis of the second requirement of consent), there is no general rule pursuant to which
there cannot be a sufficient nexus within the meaning of Article 46(1) of the ICSID
Convention and Rule 40(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules between an investor's treaty
claims and a host State's non-treaty counterclaims. To the contrary, the Tribunal considers
that there indeed can be such a close or intimate connection if the analysis of the investor's
Treaty claims necessarily includes the examination of the contractual and regulatory
instruments on which the counterclaims are based.

1415.In the present case, the Tribunal had to take into account in its analysis of Claimant's
Treaty claims not only the CHEJVA and the 2002 BM Rules in general, but very
specifically several of the provisions on which Respondent relies as a basis for its
counterclaims, in particular Clauses 11.3 and 11.4 of the CHEJVA and rule 29(2)(c)(iii)
of the 2002 BM Rules. In addition, Respondent submits and Claimant in fact
acknowledges that Respondent's counterclaims are the "flipside" of its defenses against
Claimant's claims; therefore, the Tribunal considers that all three of Respondent's
counterclaims arise directly out of the subject matter of the dispute and therefore satisfy
the first jurisdictional requirement.

b. Are the Counterclaims Within the Scope of Consent of the Parties?

1416. As to the second requirement of whether Respondent's counterclaims are within the scope
of consent of the Parties to arbitrate, the Parties agree that the question of whether their
consent extends to counterclaims in general and to non-Treaty claims in particular is
determined by reference to the Treaty's dispute resolution clause in Article 13. The
Tribunal will interpret Article 13 of the Treaty pursuant to Article 31(1) of the Vienna
Convention "in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the

terms of the treaty in their context and the light of its object and purpose." '**!

1417. Article 13(1) of the Treaty refers to "dispute[s] between a Party and an investor of the
other Party relating to an investment." Article 13(2)(b) states that "either party to the
dispute may ... refer the dispute to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes." Finally, Article 13(5) provides that "[i]n any proceeding involving a dispute
relating to an investment, a Party shall not assert, as a defence, counter-claim, right of
set-off or otherwise, that the investor concerned has received or will receive" any form

of compensation for its alleged loss from third parties. '°**

1418. The language used in Article 13(1) and (2) of the Treaty makes clear that both sides, i.e.,
the investor and the host State, may initiate ICSID proceedings with regard to disputes
relating to an investment. In the Tribunal’s view, there is no indication for Claimant's
allegation that the host State may do so only in order to obtain a decision on claims of the
investor. To the contrary, while the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that Article 13(5) does
not explicitly authorize a State to raise counterclaims, the provision is nevertheless
premised on the assumption that the State may in fact do so and the Tribunal is not
convinced by Claimant's argument that counterclaims are mentioned only because the
term "any proceeding" also refers to domestic proceedings initiated pursuant to Article
13(2)(a) of the Treaty.

1419.In the Tribunal's view, not only the language used in Article 13 itself, but also the
expressed intention of the authors of the ICSID Convention not to provide for a "one-way
street" for investors, '*** together with the absence of any indication that the Contracting
Parties intended to provide otherwise in their dispute resolution clause, support and
confirm an interpretation of Article 13 that allows the host State to raise counterclaims
against the claims of the investor.

1420. As to the further question whether the scope of consent extends to counterclaims that are
not based on violations of the Treaty, the Tribunal considers that the language used in
Article 13(1) of the Treaty, i.e., "dispute ... relating to an investment," indicates that the
scope of consent is not limited to disputes based on Treaty violations but rather extends
to disputes based on the investment agreement (in this case, the CHEJVA and related
agreements) and/or the regulatory framework for the investment (in this case, in particular
the 2002 BM Rules). Therefore, the fact that Respondent's counterclaims, insofar as they
are based on a breach of the CHEJVA and the 2002 BM Rules, are not Treaty claims,
does not exclude them from the scope of Article 13.

1421. However, the Tribunal notes that in the present case, Respondent did not become party to
the CHEJVA and its related agreements and Respondent further did not enact the 2002

1582 Exhibit CE-4, Article 13.

BM Rules, but in both cases, its autonomous province Balochistan did so. While
Balochistan's actions can be attributed to Respondent pursuant to the ILC Articles for the
purposes of Treaty claims, i.e., claims under international law, such attribution does not
apply for non-Treaty claims under domestic law. In the context of Respondent's claims
based on the CHEJVA and the 2002 BM Rules, the Tribunal must therefore give effect
to the juridical distinction between the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the Province of
Balochistan under Pakistani law.

1422.As a result, the Tribunal considers that Respondent lacks standing to raise non-Treaty
claims based on the alleged breach of a contract that Claimant entered into with, and that
can be enforced by, Balochistan. The same applies to Respondent's claim based on
domestic law that was enacted, and can again be enforced, by Balochistan. In this regard,
the Tribunal also notes that Balochistan has in fact raised very similar counterclaims,
based on an alleged breach of Clauses 11, 15 and 24 of the CHEJVA as well as rule
29(2)(c)(iii) of the 2002 BM Rules, in the parallel ICC Proceedings that Claimant has
initiated against Balochistan on the basis of the dispute resolution clause in Clause 15.4
of the CHEJVA.'** It is thus apparent that Balochistan not only has the means to enforce
such claims against Claimant, but it is in fact doing so before the ICC Tribunal.

1423. Therefore, the Tribunal considers that Respondent lacks standing to raise counterclaims
on the basis of alleged breaches of the CHEJVA and/or the 2002 BM Rules because these
claims are for Balochistan to raise, as it has in fact done in the parallel ICC Proceedings.
As a result, the Tribunal finds that it does not have jurisdiction to hear Respondent's
counterclaims insofar as they are based on the CHEJVA and the 2002 BM Rules.

1424. As to Respondent's counterclaim based on Claimant's alleged violation of Article 1(1)(a)
of the Treaty, the Tribunal finds that this claim is within the scope of consent as provided
for in Article 13 of the Treaty. While Article 13 (directly) defines only the scope of
Respondent's consent, which is contained in this very provision, the Tribunal is of the
view that it is also (indirectly) relevant to the scope of Claimant's consent as provided in
its Request for Arbitration. In this submission, Claimant stated:

"TCCA hereby consents to submit to the Centre the dispute that is the
subject of this Request for Arbitration." °®

1425. While this statement in isolation could be read as limiting Claimant's consent to its own
claims because Respondent's counterclaims were not "subject of [its] Request for
Arbitration," Claimant also referred in its Request for Arbitration to Article 13 of the

Treaty as constituting Respondent's consent and did not indicate that the scope of its own
consent differed from that under Article 13 of the Treaty. In addition, the Tribunal is of
the view that, if the dispute resolution clause in a treaty allows for counterclaims, it is not
for the investor to decide that such counterclaims shall not be part of its arbitration with
the host State. This would contradict the intention of both the authors of the ICSID
Convention and the Contracting Parties to the Treaty that the arbitration initiated by the
investor should not be a "one-way street."

1426. In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the second jurisdictional requirement is satisfied for
Respondent's counterclaim based on Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty, but the Tribunal does
not have jurisdiction to hear the counterclaims based on the CHEJVA and the 2002 BM
Rules. Therefore, the Tribunal will limit its analysis of the third jurisdictional requirement
to Respondent's counterclaim based on the Treaty.

ce. Are the Counterclaims Otherwise Within the Jurisdiction of the Centre?

1427.As to the third jurisdiction requirement that the counterclaims are otherwise within the
jurisdiction of the Centre, the Tribunal considers that this is a reference to the general
jurisdiction requirements under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, which partially
overlap with those explicitly mentioned in Article 46.

1428. Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention reads:

"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising
directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State ... and a
national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute
consent in writing to submit to the Centre."
1429. First, Respondent's counterclaim arises out of Claimant's alleged breach of Article 1(1)(a)
of the Treaty and therefore constitutes a legal dispute between the Parties.

1430. Second, the Tribunal has found above that Claimant had a qualifying investment within
the meaning of Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty and that Respondent's counterclaim arises
directly out of the subject matter of the dispute on Claimant's claim. Therefore, the
counterclaim can also be considered as arising directly out of Claimant's investment.

1431.Third, Pakistan is a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention because Pakistan has
ratified the ICSID Convention on 15 September 1966 and the Convention entered into
force for Pakistan on 15 October 1966. Claimant is a national of another Contracting State
to the ICSID Convention because it is a company incorporated under Australian law and
Australia has ratified the ICSID Convention on 2 May 1991, and the Convention came
into force for Australia on 1 June 1991.

Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability
ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1

1432.Finally, as found above, Respondent's consent to submit the dispute on its counterclaim
to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal is contained in Article 13 of the Treaty and Claimant's
written consent that it provided in paragraph 16 of its Request for Arbitration likewise
extends to an arbitration on Respondent's counterclaim.

1433.As a result, the general jurisdictional requirements under Article 25(1) and thus all three
of the specific requirements under Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 40(1) of
the ICSID Arbitration Rules are fulfilled for Respondent's counterclaim based on
Claimant's alleged breach of Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty. The Tribunal therefore has
jurisdiction to hear this counterclaim, but it does not have jurisdiction to hear
Respondent's counterclaims based on the CHEJVA and the 2002 BM Rules.

1434. The Tribunal is aware that Claimant also argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to
hear Respondent's counterclaim based on the Treaty because, in Claimant's view, Article
1(1)(a) of the Treaty does not impose an obligation on the investor and therefore cannot
give rise to any claim of the host State. However, the Tribunal considers that this is a
question for the merits and will thus be addressed as part of its analysis of the merits.

B. LIABILITY

1. Summary of Respondent's Position'**°

1435.On the merits, Respondent submits that Claimant's alleged investment was admitted in
violation of Pakistani law and investment policies and thus unlawful under Article 1(1)(a)

of the Treaty. !°87

1436. Respondent refers to the definition of the term "investment" in Article 1(a) of the Treaty,
which requires that the asset must be "admitted by the other Party subject to its law and
investment policies applicable from time to time” and also to the Preamble to the Treaty,
which "[a]cknowledg[es] that investments of investors of one Party in the territory of the
other Party would be made within the framework of the laws of that other Party.”'>88

Respondent claims that Claimant’s alleged investment is unlawful and therefore does not

meet the admission requirement in Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty. !>°°

1437. Respondent states that the illegality of Claimant's alleged investment has been determined
conclusively by the Supreme Court and claims that it was also known to BHP by 2000,

1586 In light of the Tribunal's finding that it has jurisdiction to hear only one of Respondent's counterclaims, the
following summaries of the Parties’ positions do not include their arguments on the other two counterclaims.

when it received advice from its Pakistani lawyers on the contemplated 2000 Addendum
that was only to BHP's benefit.'°°? According to Respondent, Claimant built on the
illegality of BHP's initial investment when it executed the 2006 Novation Agreement,
which relied on the existence of the CHEJVA and the 2000 Addendum for its operation

and was therefore predicated on the same unlawfulness.!°*!

1438.Respondent contends that, for the purpose of this arbitration, the unlawfulness of
Claimant’s investment as determined by the Supreme Court is a matter of fact under

Pakistani law, which cannot be adjudicated afresh by this Tribunal.'°°?

2. Summary of Claimant's Position

1439. Claimant submits that, even if the Tribunal were to find that it has jurisdiction to hear
Respondent's counterclaims, those claims would fail on the merits. Claimant quotes
Respondent's submission that its counterclaims “represent the flipside of [its] defences to
[TCCA’s] claims in this arbitration” and therefore merely refers to its arguments on

Respondent's liability in relation to Claimant's Treaty claims. >

1440. Claimant emphasizes that it contests all of Respondent's counterclaims, but submits that
all of them are addressed in the context of Claimant's claims, as each of the counterclaims
"mirrors one of Pakistan's affirmative defenses." Claimant argues that if it succeeds in

defeating those defenses, it will also succeed in defeating Pakistan's counterclaims. !>*4

3. The Tribunal's Analysis

1441.Respondent's counterclaim is based on an alleged violation of Pakistani laws and
investment policies and thus a lack of fulfilling the admission requirement in Article
1(1)(a) of the Treaty. In the Tribunal's view, this raises two separate questions: (a)
whether Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty can, in principle, give rise to a claim of the host
State against the investor if the admission requirement was not satisfied; and if so, (ii)
whether Claimant's investment was in fact admitted in violation of Pakistani laws and
investment policies.

1442.As to the second question, the Tribunal refers to its finding above that the admission
requirement in Article 1(1)(a) does not impose a strict legality requirement on the
investment but is rather met if the investment was accepted by the host State at the time
the investment was made. The Tribunal further found that, at the time Claimant entered

into the 2006 Novation Agreement with the GOB and thereby became party to the
CHEJVA, its investment was not only accepted but highly welcomed and encouraged on
every level of the Provincial and Federal Governments and therefore satisfied the
admission requirement in Article 1(1)(a).

1443. In particular with regard to the Supreme Court judgment that was rendered seven years
after the conclusion of the 2006 Novation Agreement, the Tribunal held that the reasons
for which the Supreme Court declared the CHEJVA and its related agreements invalid
did not concern any illegal conduct on the part of Claimant. Therefore, the Tribunal
considers that this judgment does not support Respondent's allegation that any violation
of Pakistani laws and investment policies was predicated on Claimant's conduct.

1444. In addition, the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty cannot
give rise to an obligation and a corresponding liability of the investor vis-a-vis the host
State. Article | is entitled "Definitions" and states in relevant part:

"1. For the purposes of this Agreement:

(a) ‘investment’ means every kind of asset, owned or controlled by

investors of one Party and admitted by the other Party subject to its

laws and investment policies applicable from time to time."!°°

1445. As per its lead-in, Article 1(1)(a) defines the term "investment" for the purposes of the

Treaty, but such definition in itself does not give rise to an obligation of either the
Contracting Parties or the investor. An investment that violates the host State's laws and
investment policies and thus does not fulfill the admission requirement is not an
"investment" for the purposes of the Treaty and is thus not subject to the standards of
protection under the Treaty. Therefore, the non-fulfillment can be invoked by the host
State as a defense against claims of the investor based on a violation of any standard of
protection; however, it cannot give rise to a liability of the investor for a loss of
opportunity as Respondent claims. In any event, an agreement between the Contracting
Parties on a liability of the investor would constitute an impermissible agreement at the
expense of a third party to the Treaty, i.e., the investor in the present case.

1446.As a result, Respondent's counterclaim based on Claimant's alleged breach of Article
1(1)(a) of the Treaty is dismissed because this provision cannot give rise to a liability of
the investor and, in any event, Claimant's investment was admitted in accordance with
Pakistani laws and investment policies at the time the investment was made in 2006.

VII. THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION ON COSTS

1447. The Tribunal is aware that, further to the Tribunal's invitation of 4 February 2015, both
Parties submitted their statements of costs on 2 March 2015, reflecting the costs, fees and
expenses they incurred up to that date. However, the Tribunal also recalls that it clarified
in its e-mail of 16 February 2015 that its request for the Parties' statements of costs was
without prejudice to whether the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability would
include a decision on the costs of this phase of the proceedings or whether such decision
would be reserved for the Final Award.

1448. Pursuant to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, the decision on the costs of the
arbitration, i.e., the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings
as well as the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, shall form part of the
Award. In light of the Tribunal's finding that Respondent has breached Articles 3(2), 7(1)
and 3(3) of the Treaty and is therefore liable for the losses that Claimant incurred as a
result of these breaches, there will be a further phase of the proceedings in which
Claimant's losses are to be quantified. The present decision is therefore not an award
within the meaning of Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and the Tribunal has thus
decided to reserve its decision on the costs of this phase of the arbitration for its Award.
