Main Facts

The following summary is meant to give a general overview of the present dispute. It
does not include all facts which may be of relevance, particularly as they emerged from
the extensive evidence gathered at the hearings. To the extent relevant or useful,
additional facts will be discussed in the Tribunal’s analysis of the disputed issues.

1. The Uzbek Molybdenum Industry

As a result of a significant increase in the demand for molybdenum in the 1960s and
1970s, the Uzbek molybdenum industry flourished in the 1980s. With the collapse of

the Soviet Union, it then experienced a downturn.* Following its declaration of
independence, Uzbekistan sought to attract foreign investment to revive the industry.

7. Beginning in December 1998 and continuing through 1999, Metal-Tech and the Uzbek
government conducted negotiations concerning a joint venture to build and operate a
modern plant for the production of molybdenum products. The joint venture was to be
formed between Metal-Tech, on the one hand, and Uzbek Refractory and Resistant
Metals Integrated Plant (“UzKTJM”) and Almalik Mining Metallurgy Combinate
(‘AGMK’”), two companies owned by the Government and involved in the molybdenum
industry, on the other. AGMK produces molybdenum concentrate from raw deposits of
copper and other minerals and sells it to others who use it to produce various
molybdenum products.‘ It is the only company that mines molybdenum in Uzbekistan.°
UzKTJM is the primary producer and exporter of molybdenum products in Uzbekistan.®

8. Due to the outdated technology used by AGMK, the molybdenum concentrate it
produced was of low quality and did not meet world market standards. As a result, it
could not be exported. While the industry standard required molybdenum concentrate
to have a concentration of 51%, AGMK’s concentrate contained no more than 30% of
molybdenum.” In addition, AGMK lost significant quantities of molybdenum, copper,
and rhenium in the extraction process. It was also incapable of extracting the available
osmium, and its extraction process produced gases that polluted the environment.®

9. | UzKTJM, AGMK’s only local customer, could not use AGMK’s low-quality molybdenum
concentrate to produce molybdenum trioxide (a high-end derivative product of
molybdenum concentrate) that met international standards. Neither could it produce
higher-grade products, such as molybdenum tiles and wire, to sell on the world market.
In addition, UZKTJM’s technology and equipment was outdated; it frequently broke
down while processing AGMK’s low-quality molybdenum concentrate. As a result,
UzKTJM operated at 15-20% capacity. By 1998, it was losing money and falling into
debt.®

It was against this background that a joint venture was to be formed with the Claimant.
The Claimant was to contribute its technology, know-how and access to international
markets as well as part of the financing needed for a new plant. UZKTJM and AGMK
were to make their contributions in the form of buildings, constructions, machines, and
equipment.'° According to the Claimant, the most important contribution of AGMK was
the raw molybdenum, which would be processed by the joint venture. AGMK being the
only company in Uzbekistan to mine molybdenum, the joint venture would have no raw
material, and thus no purpose, if it did not receive AGMK’s raw molybdenum."

2. Feasibility Study

During the course of the negotiations, Metal-Tech prepared a draft feasibility study that
set out what the Claimant expected to achieve by entering into the joint venture. The
Ministry of Economy and Ministry of Finance reviewed this draft feasibility study and
advised Metal-Tech how Metal-Tech would have to revise the feasibility study before

the Government could approve the proposed project.'?

In a revised feasibility study dated 29 August 1999 (the “Feasibility Study”), Metal-Tech
detailed its proposed USD 17.5 million investment project. '® According to the Claimant,
the Feasibility Study was prepared on the basis of the “shared understanding” with the
Uzbek government that the joint venture was specifically created to process AGMK’s
low quality concentrate into pure molybdenum oxide that could be sold on the
international market.'* The Feasibility Study, according to the Claimant, was a mere
analytical tool to show how the proposed project would be planned and executed.

3. Resolutions Nos. 15 and 29F

The Feasibility Study was presented to the Uzbek authorities on 29 August 1999. On
29 September 1999, the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan provided its
comments. On 18 January 2000, on the basis of the Feasibility Study, the Cabinet of
Ministers issued Resolution No. 15'° and Resolution No. 29-F,"° which authorized the
creation of the joint venture Uzmetal Technology (“Uzmetal” or the “JV”).

Resolution No. 15 was issued to “effectively use copper and molybdenum deposits
Kalmokar and SaryCheku (Tashkent Region), to process molybdenum products and
increase the export potential of the Republic’.'? Resolution No. 29-F was issued to
approve “the technical and economical justification” for the creation of Uzmetal.'® As
set out in the Resolution, the value of the project, including construction works,
amounted to USD 19,398,000. Uzmetal was to create 109 workplaces and produce
600 tons of molybdenum products per year. The construction of the new plant was to
be completed within 12 months. Uzmetal was given five years to repay its loans taken
from Metal-Tech and from the National Bank of Uzbekistan (“NBU”) as described below
(17).

Pursuant to Article 2 of Resolution No. 15, Uzmetal’s share capital amounted to USD 1
million’? distributed among Metal-Tech (50%), UzKTJM (30%) and AGMK (20%).
Metal-Tech was to make a capital contribution of USD 500,000 or Soum 60,500,000.
UzKTJM and AGMK were to make their contributions in kind as set out above (10).
Article 2 further provided that Uzmetal’s main purpose was “to develop the processing
of molybdenum products at AGMK and to manufacture molybdenum products at
UzKTJM using state-of-the-art technology”. The volumes and terms of export of
Uzmetal’s products were to be defined in separate agreements with Metal-Tech.

Article 3 of Resolution No. 15 provided that “all molybdenum-containing products
manufactured by AGMK shall be processed by JV Uzmetal Technology, while by-
products shall remain in the possession of AGMk”. Article 3 further provided that
Uzmetal was to return the metal-containing cake left over from the processing of
molybdenum to AGMK.

Articles 4 to 6 of Resolution No. 15 dealt with the financing of the project. Under Article
4, Uzmetal was authorized to take a loan from Metal-Tech in the amount of USD 2.624
million (15% of the contract value) for a period of three years. An Israeli bank was to
grant another loan to NBU for the remaining USD 14.866 million (85% of the contract
value) for a period of five years. Uzmetal was to repay both loans out of its revenues in
foreign currency. Pursuant to Article 6, the Uzbek Minister of Finance was authorized to
guarantee these loans on behalf of the Government.

Resolution No. 15 also granted several benefits to Metal-Tech. For example, according
to Article 10, Uzmetal was exempted from paying customs duties for a period of five
years (except for customs clearance charges). Uzbekistan also agreed to issue
working permits and visas for Uzmetal’s foreign employees and to exempt them from
paying consular fees or state duty. Moreover, Metal-Tech’s bank was exempted from

paying taxes on the income of non-resident personnel.”

4. Charter and Constituent Contract of Uzmetal

On 28 January 2000, Metal-Tech, UZKTJM and AGMK adopted the Charter of the Joint

yy 24

Venture Uzmetal Technology (the "Charter”)“’ and signed the Constituent Contract

About Creation and Activity of Uzbek-Israeli Joint Venture Uzmetal Technology (the
22

“Constituent Contract”), incorporating Uzmetal as a limited liability corporation in

Uzbekistan.

According to Article 2.1 of the Charter and Article 2.1 of the Constituent Contract, the
purpose of Uzmetal was the “manufacture of pure molybdenum and products from it
and realization, reception of the profit, including currency”. Article 2.1 of the Charter
further provided that Uzmetal’s “basic tasks” would be the following:

“. organization of manufacture for processing of molybdenum
industrial product on OAO "Almalik GMK" and introduction of
modern technology for manufacturing of molybdenum
production on UZKTJM;

- maintenance of UZKTJM with clean molybdenum raw material
from OAO «ALMALIK GMK» and loading of a part of its
capacities;

- expansion of commercial and public connections between the
State of Israel and Republic of Uzbekistan.”

In addition, Article 2.2 of the Constituent Contract provided that Uzmetal would have as
a “main task”:

“- to create on UZKTJM and on OAO “Almalik GMK” a modern
manufacture of pure molybdenum and products from it with a
high export potential.”

According to Article 4.1 of the Charter, Uzmetal’s “bodies of management” were the
General Meeting of the Participants, the General Director and the Auditing
Commission. The highest power in the JV was with the General Meeting of the
Participants.”*

On 23 March 2000, the JV was registered with the Ministry of Justice.
5. Contract No. 0150500/U

On 15 May 2000, Metal-Tech and Uzmetal entered into Contract No. 0150500/U (the
“EPC Contract’) for the sale of goods and services by Metal-Tech to Uzmetal. Under
the Construction Contract, Metal-Tech agreed to build a new roasting plant in Almalik
and to upgrade the facilities in Chirchik.* Uzmetal in turn agreed to purchase from
Metal-Tech equipment, know-how, and installations needed to modernize the
molybdenum production at the AGMK and UzKTJM facilities.”®

On 19 July 2000, Supplementary Agreement No. 1°° was concluded, modifying several
provisions of the Construction Contract.””

In 2002, the construction and upgrading of the facilities in Almalik and Chirchik was
completed. Operations commenced on 1 October 2002.”°

6. Export Contract No. 180800EX

On 12 November 2000, Metal-Tech and Uzmetal concluded Export Contract
No. 180800EX (the “Export Contract”), pursuant to which Uzmetal agreed to sell all of
its molybdenum production to Metal-Tech.*° Metal-Tech was then to sell the products
on the world market and to pay Uzmetal with the proceeds from these sales. Uzmetal
would ship the products directly to the purchasers, pursuant to shipping instructions
received from Metal-Tech, and the purchasers would pay Metal-Tech under their
separate sale contracts with Metal-Tech.*°

7. Consulting Contracts

On 15 December 2000 and 3 March 2003, Metal-Tech entered into consulting
agreements with MPC International Investments and Consultants GmbH (“MPC”), a
Swiss limited liability company founded on 20 July 1998. As of 14 May 2012, MPC’s
shareholders were BV Chemie Pharmacie Holland (45%) (“CPH”), Bordeaux Intertrade
Inc. (45%) (“Bordeaux”), and Mr. Wouter Hans Miller (10%).°" Mr. Miller is also the
Director of MPC. On 25 October 2004, Metal-Tech entered into another consulting
agreement with MPC-Tashkent, the “daughter enterprise” of MPC (“MPC” and “MPC-
Tashkent” are collectively referred to as the “MPC Companies’).

In addition, on 1 October 2004, Metal-Tech entered into three individual consulting
agreements with Messrs Victor Mikhailov, Uygur Sultanov and Igor Chijenok
(collectively referred to as the “Consultants”). On 28 February 2005, Metal-Tech
entered into a further contract with the Consultants. Payments under this contract were
made to Lacey International Corp. (“Lacey International”).

The Parties disagree about the purpose of these consulting agreements. While the
Claimant submits that these were legitimate consulting contracts, the Respondent
argues that they were a sham meant to cover the Claimant's illegal payments to
Government officials or to persons closely connected to the Government.

8. Origin of the Present Dispute

On 22 May 2002, at the General Meeting of Participants of Uzmetal, the then General
Director, Mr. Shwa, informed the Participants that the new facilities would soon start to
operate and that by the end of 2002, 100-150 tons of finished molybdenum products

would be manufactured and sold by Uzmetal.**

On the basis of Resolution No. 15, on 14 June 2002, AGMK and Uzmetal concluded
Contract No. 07-1335 under which Uzmetal undertook to deliver to AGMK “off-gas,

generated in the course of firing of molybdenum middling product [...]”.°°

On 26 July, 2002, AGMK and Uzmetal concluded a framework agreement, entitled
Contract No. 12-1614, by which AGMK agreed to sell to Uzmetal its molybdenum
concentrate. Uzmetal agreed to return “all by-products — cake with the metals it
contains — obtained after reprocessing of the molybdenum middling product” to
AGMK.™ Over the years, this agreement was amended.

Uzmetal’s facilities started operating on 1 October 2002. The Parties are in
disagreement over the date when Uzmetal should have commenced operations. They
also diverge on whether the delays in setting up the facilities were minor or major and
whether or not they were attributable to Metal-Tech.

On 17 October 2002, Uzmetal and Metal-Tech concluded Export Contract No. 1. Under
this contract, Uzmetal undertook to sell Metal-Tech 150 tons of molybdenum oxide for
the total amount of USD 1,218,000.°°

The Parties dispute whether Uzmetal and Metal-Tech fulfilled their contractual
obligations during operation from October 2002 until mid-2006. In particular, the Parties
disagree on the scope of Metal-Tech’s obligations and whether Metal-Tech complied
with these obligations. It is undisputed, however, that Uzmetal made a profit in 2005
and that on 26 May 2006, the Uzmetal General Meeting of Participants decided to
distribute dividends.°°

On 12 June 2006, the Public Prosecutor's Office for the Tashkent Region initiated
criminal proceedings on the ground that officials of Uzmetal had abused their authority
and caused harm to Uzbekistan. These proceedings focused on Mr. Krespel, the
General Director of Uzmetal, who had negotiated and signed the Export Contract and
its amendments on behalf of Uzmetal.°”

On 18 July 2006, Uzbekistan’s Cabinet of Ministers adopted Resolution No. 141.°° This
Resolution abrogated Article 3 of Resolution No. 15, namely Uzmetal’s rights to

purchase raw materials.°° According to the Claimant, the resolution cancelled its
exclusive right to export Uzmetal’s refined molybdenum oxide.*°

On 21 July 2006, AGMK notified Uzmetal of its intention to terminate the supply
contract in force at the time between AGMK and Uzmetal, i.e. Contract No. 12-17 of 5
January 2006. The Parties dispute whether Resolution No. 141 prevented AGMK from
continuing to supply molybdenum concentrate to Uzmetal and whether Uzmetal could
have purchased molybdenum concentrate from alternative sources.

On 25 July 2006, AGMK sent Uzmetal a draft agreement for terminating Contract No.
12-17, which Uzmetal did not sign.*' A few months later, on 25 December 2006, AGMK
initiated proceedings against Uzmetal before the Economic Court of Tashkent Region
requesting that the Court cancel Contract No. 12-17.4?

By letter dated 27 December 2006, UZKTJM requested that Uzmetal pay UZKTJM’s

The Commercial Court of the Tashkent Region awarded the relief sought by UZKTJM
on 18 June 2007 and ordered Uzmetal to distribute the unpaid dividends to its
shareholders. “®

On the same day, Uzmetal initiated court proceedings before the Tashkent District
Economic Court to invalidate the decision taken at Uzmetal’s General Meeting of
participants on 26 May 2006 to distribute dividends.®° On 19 July 2007, the Court
dismissed Uzmetal’s claims and upheld the validity of the decision."

On 31 July 2007, UZKTUM initiated bankruptcy proceedings against Uzmetal before the
Economic Court of Tashkent Region on the basis of Uzmetal’s failure to pay the
dividends.® It is disputed between the Parties whether these bankruptcy proceedings
were fair and whether they were conducted in accordance with Uzbekistan’s
Bankruptcy Law.

On 2 August 2007, UzKTJM’s bankruptcy claim was accepted by the Court and a
temporary manager, Mr. Bakhriev, was appointed.®* A few days later, on 7 August
2007, the Commercial Court of the Tashkent Region appointed an external auditor, the
audit company Bukhgalter.®*

On 31 August 2007, Metal-Tech submitted its claims in the bankruptcy proceedings to
the temporary manager, who rejected the claims on 12 September 2007. The Parties
dispute whether this rejection of Metal-Tech’s claims was proper.

On 4 and 5 September 2007, AGMK and UzKTJM submitted their respective claims in
Uzmetal's bankruptcy, which the temporary manager accepted.

On 17 September 2007, the first meeting of Uzmetal’s creditors took place with
UzKTJM and AGMK as the only recognized creditors (Metal-Tech's claims having been

Uzmetal.°® On 14 January 2008, the Uzbek Court of Cassation upheld the Economic
Court’s ruling by declaring Uzmetal bankrupt and initiating liquidation proceedings. °°

A number of creditors’ meetings were held during the course of the liquidation
proceedings, specifically on 9 November 2007, 3 January 2008, 22 February 2008, and
15 October 2008. Metal-Tech did not attend these meetings.® At the creditors’ meeting
of 15 October 2008, a liquidation plan was finalized and the creditors approved, inter
alia, the transfer of Uzmetal’s property to UZKTJM and AGMK.°*!

On 20 October 2008, the report on the completion of the liquidation proceedings was
submitted to the Commercial Court of the Tashkent Region. On 18 November 2009,
the Economic Court of the Tashkent Region closed the liquidation proceedings.

As a result, on 30 December 2009, Uzmetal was delisted from the state registry of legal
entities.

According to the Claimant, all of Uzmetal’s assets are presently jointly or individually
owned by AGMK and UzKTJM, both of which are, in turn, controlled by Uzbekistan.®

(xiv) Such other or additional relief as may be appropriate under the

On 4 February 2010, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Claimant's
Request for Arbitration.

By letter dated 9 February 2010, the Claimant proposed that an arbitral tribunal be
constituted and consist of three arbitrators, one appointed by each party, and the
President of the Tribunal appointed by agreement of the parties.

On 4 March 2010, the Respondent agreed to the Claimant's proposal, in accordance
with Arbitration Rule 2(1)(b) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.

On 26 March 2010, the Claimant informed ICSID that it appointed Mr. John M.
Townsend, a national of the United States, as arbitrator in this case.

On 30 April 2010, the Respondent informed ICSID that it appointed Mr. Claus von
Wobeser, a national of Mexico, as arbitrator in this case. Messrs Townsend and von
Wobeser subsequently accepted their appointments.

By letters of 17 June and 18 June 2010, the Parties informed ICSID of their agreement
to appoint Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a national of Switzerland, as presiding
arbitrator. On 22 June 2010, Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler accepted her appointment.

By letter dated 28 June 2010, ICSID informed the Parties and the Tribunal that the
Tribunal was constituted and that the proceedings were deemed to have commenced
as of that date. ICSID also informed the Parties and the Tribunal that Ms. Janet
Whittaker would serve as the Secretary of the Tribunal. Subsequently, on 21 November
2012, Ms. Geraldine Fischer replaced Ms. Whittaker.

On 3 August 2010, the Tribunal held its first session by teleconference. At the session,
the Parties expressed their agreement that the Tribunal had been properly constituted
(ICSID Arbitration Rule 6) and stated that they had no objections to the appointment of
any of the members of the Tribunal. In addition, the calendar for the proceedings and
procedural matters were addressed.

The first session was audio-recorded and copies of the recording were deposited in the
ICSID archives and subsequently sent to the Parties. Minutes were drafted, signed by
the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal, and transmitted to the Parties on 3
September 2010.

WRITTEN PHASE ON JURISDICTION AND MERITS

On 11 November 2010, the Respondent submitted its Memorial on Jurisdiction,
Admissibility, and Bifurcation (“Mem. J.”), in accordance with the procedural calendar
set out in Annex 2 to the Minutes. The Respondent’s Memorial was accompanied by
Exhibits R-1 to R-110, eight witness statements and one expert report, and legal
authorities (Exhibits RLA-1 to RLA-100).

On 11 February 2011, the Claimant submitted its Statement of Claim and Counter-
Memorial on Jurisdiction and Bifurcation (“Mem. M.”) in accordance with the procedural
calendar. The Statement of Claim was accompanied by Exhibits C-1 to C-93, legal
authorities (Exhibits CLA-1 to CLA-44), and two witness statements and two expert
reports.

On 24 February 2011, a procedural hearing on the issue of bifurcation took place in
Washington, D.C. The procedural hearing was audio-recorded and a real time
transcription was made. Copies of the transcript and the audio-recording were sent to
the Parties and the Tribunal on 25 February and 28 February 2011 respectively.

On 8 March 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 (“PO 1”), according to
which the Parties were advised that issues of jurisdiction and admissibility would be
considered together with the merits and that the proceedings would be bifurcated
between jurisdiction and liability, on the one hand, and quantum, on the other.

By letter dated 20 May 2011, the Respondent requested an extension of the deadline
for filing its Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Reply on Jurisdiction from 26 May
2011 to 2 June 2011, and a corresponding one-week extension of some of the
remaining deadlines set forth in the procedural calendar.

The Tribunal granted the Respondent's request on 23 May 2011. It also issued a

revised procedural calendar for the proceedings, replacing the procedural calendar set
out in Annex 2 to the Minutes of the First Session.

On 2 June 2011, the Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial on the Merits and
Reply on Jurisdiction (“C-Mem. M.”) in accordance with the revised procedural
calendar. The Respondent's Counter-Memorial was accompanied by Exhibits R-19 to
R-21, R-29, R-85, and R-110 to R-506, legal authorities (Exhibits RLA-101 to RLA-169)
and by 17 witness statements and two expert reports. Subsequently, the Respondent
submitted corrected versions of some of its exhibits and legal authorities.

On 16 June 2011, each Party filed simultaneous document production requests. On 23
June 2011, each filed its objections to the other Party’s requests and, on 30 June 2011,
its replies to the other Party's objections. On 14 July 2011, the Tribunal issued
Procedural Order No. 2 (“PO 2”) ruling on the Parties’ requests for document
production. On 28 July 2011, the Parties produced the required documents. In its
production, the Claimant redacted some information as it was allegedly related to third
parties.

On 9 September 2011, the Claimant submitted its Reply on Merits and Rejoinder on
Jurisdiction (“Reply M.”). The reply was accompanied by Exhibits C-92 to C-202, legal
authorities (Exhibits CLA-45 to CLA-95), and three witness statements and one expert
report.

On 15 November 2011, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal amend the dates set
forth in the revised procedural calendar for the designation of witnesses and experts
and the submission of documents for cross and redirect examination.

On 23 November 2011, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder on the Merits (“Rej.
M.”) in accordance with the revised procedural calendar. The Respondent's Rejoinder
was accompanied by Exhibits R-507 to R-658, as well as Exhibits R-85, R-150, R-305,
R-311, R-339, R-344, R-350, R-382, R-383, R-468, R-473, and R-486. It was also
accompanied by legal authorities RLA-170 to RLA-189 and nine witness statements
and two expert reports.

On the same day, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it had recently become
aware of details concerning a criminal investigation by the Prosecutor General's Office
of Uzbekistan into the activities of several joint venture companies operating or having
operated in Uzbekistan, including Uzmetal. The alleged criminal enterprise involved
kickback payments to individuals, including Uzbek government officials and individuals
affiliated with the Claimant and Uzmetal. The Respondent requested that, in light of this

investigation, the Tribunal postpone the forthcoming hearing and order the Claimant to
produce unredacted copies of all documents responsive to Respondent’s document
production requests Nos. 14, 15, 17, 30, 35, 50, and 51.

On 1 December 2011, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the pre-hearing
conference call scheduled for 6 December 2011 was postponed to 7 December 2011.
It also advised them that it had ruled on the Claimant's request of 14 November 2011
that they should: (i) designate the witnesses for cross-examination by no later than
6 December 2011; (ii) submit the documents for cross-examination by no later than
20 December 2011; and (iii) submit the documents for redirect examination by no later
than 3 January 2012. The Tribunal added that it would hear presentations by the
Parties on the postponement of the hearing and the production of unredacted
documents during the 7 December telephone conference.

The pre-hearing conference call took place on 7 December 2011, during which matters
relating to the organization of the forthcoming hearing were addressed and the Parties
made oral submissions on the Respondent's request to postpone the forthcoming
hearing and its request for the production of unredacted documents.

By letter dated 8 December 2011, the Tribunal confirmed that it had decided not to
postpone the hearing. It noted that it was providing its decision by way of a letter for the
Parties to be advised as promptly as possible and indicated that it would issue an order
providing the reasons for such decision and addressing the Respondent's application
for further document production and the organization of the forthcoming hearing.

Accordingly, it followed up on 13 December 2011, with Procedural Order No. 3 (“PO
3”), which also dealt with the Respondent’s request for production of unredacted
documents. To protect potentially sensitive information relating to third parties, the
Tribunal proposed to appoint an independent confidentiality advisor to review
unredacted copies of certain documents. The Tribunal proposed Mr. Brooks Daly of the
Permanent Court of Arbitration (“PCA”) for that role and gave the parties until 15
December 2011 to object to Mr. Daly’s appointment. Both Parties subsequently agreed
to Mr. Daly's appointment.

On 16 December 2011, the Respondent submitted a corrected version of its Counter-
Memorial, together with corrected versions of witness statements and expert reports.

On 22 December 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 (“PO 4”) ona
request filed by the Respondent in connection with the review of Exhibits R-636 and C-
194, and on matters of witness examinations.

On 13 January 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 (“PO 5”) on matters
relating to Mr. Daly’s review of documents, document production issues, and
confidentiality.

On 15 January 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 (“PO 6”) on the
organization of the evidentiary hearing.

JANUARY HEARING AND FURTHER SUBMISSIONS

A hearing on jurisdiction and liability was held at the World Bank’s Washington D.C.
office between 23-28 January 2012 (“January Hearing”) in accordance with the
procedural calendar.

At the January Hearing, three facts came to light of which the Tribunal had been
unaware: (a) the February 2005 consulting agreement (“February 2005 Consulting
Agreement’) between Metal-Tech, Ltd. and Messrs Uygur Sultanov, Igor Chijenok, and
Victor Mikhailov was an amendment to or a replacement of earlier agreements that had
been in place since 1998; (b) the Consultants primarily or exclusively engaged in what
was described as “lobbyist activity,” rather than in the activities set out at page 107 of
Exhibit R-101, namely, assistance with the operation, production, and delivery of the
joint venture’s products; and (c) the Consultants had been compensated by payments
totalling approximately USD 4 million. In light of these new elements, at the close of the
January Hearing, the Tribunal indicated that it had decided to order the Parties to
produce additional information and documents, pursuant to its powers under Article 43
of the ICSID Convention, which would be reflected in a procedural order issued after
the hearing.

Accordingly, on 10 February 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 (“PO 7”)
restating the directions on the production of documents and post-hearing submissions
given at the close of the January Hearing. It ordered the Parties to produce certain
documents by 27 February 2012 and to submit their first post-hearing submissions by
19 April 2012, and their reply post-hearing submissions, not exceeding 20 pages, by 25
May 2012.

92.

In a letter to the Tribunal of 28 February 2012, the Claimant proposed to limit its
production as contemplated by PO 7. Consequently, on 13 March 2012, the Tribunal
issued Procedural Order No. 8 (“PO 8’) clarifying the information required to be
produced by the Claimant pursuant to PO 7.

On 16 March, 2012, the Claimant produced the relevant documents including the
payment schedule contemplated by PO 7 and modified by PO 8 (the “Payment
Schedule”). In addition, the Claimant submitted a “Statement of Ariel (Aik) Rosenberg
in Response to Procedural Order No. 7 dated 16 March, 2012” (“the Rosenberg
Statement”). On the same day, the Respondent produced documents responding to
PO 7, including the Second Statement of Mr. Esemurat Kanyazov dated 28 February
2012 (“Kanyazov WS II”).

By letter dated 16 March 2012, the Respondent proposed a confidentiality order to
cover the service record of Mr. Uygur Sultanov (the brother of the former Prime
Minister and one of the Consultants). As the Claimant had consented to the proposed
confidentiality order, the Tribunal endorsed the order in Procedural Order No. 9 dated 2
April 2012 (“PO 9”).

On 22 March 2012, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to strike the Rosenberg
Statement from the record and, on 28 March 2012, it asked for an order that the
Claimant produce certain documents.

On 17 April 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 10 (“PO 10”), in which it
struck the Rosenberg Statement from the record because it had been filed contrary to
the applicable rules. It also noted that it would be assisted by receiving further
information about the services provided by the Consultants. Specifically, it directed the
Claimant to submit information about the payments made to each individual
Consultant, specifying (a) the specific services rendered, (b) which Consultant
rendered the service, and (c) when the services were rendered. The Tribunal also
asked for responses to the following questions:

a) Where payments were made to companies (i.e., MPC Companies or Lacey
International):
e For which individual Consultant were these payments meant?
e What was the amount paid to each individual Consultant?
e What service was the payment intended to remunerate?

25

93.

94.

95.

e When was this service rendered?

b) | Where payments were made to individual Consultants:
e What service was the payment intended to remunerate (beyond mere
reference to the contracts under which the service was rendered)?
e When was this service rendered?

The Tribunal further stated that this information would best be supplied in a revised
written statement of Mr. Rosenberg, which should be accompanied by a brief written
submission, if useful, and by "relevant contemporaneous documents concerning the
Claimant's submission that services were effectively rendered by the Consultants"
({75, PO 10). Together with this submission, the Claimant was invited to supplement
the Payment Schedule to reflect the additional information sought by the Tribunal.

The Respondent was given an opportunity to file a rebuttal witness statement together
with a brief submission limited to issues contained in the revised statement by Mr.
Rosenberg and the Claimant's submission and relevant contemporaneous documents
by 14 May 2012. Further, the Parties were given until 17 May 2012 to request an
additional hearing for the purpose of examining Mr. Rosenberg and/or the
Respondent’s additional witness (if any). They were informed that the additional
hearing, if any, would take place on 28 or 29 May, 2012 in Washington, D.C. or New
York, NY and that a pre-hearing conference call would be conducted on 21 May 2012
at 11:00 a.m. (Washington, D.C.-time) (“Procedural Conference Call”). Finally, the time
limits for the first round of post-hearing submissions was extended to 18 June 2012
and for the reply post-hearing submissions to 23 July 2012.

On 1 May 2012, the Claimant submitted the Third Witness Statement of Mr. Ariel
Rosenberg of the same date (“Rosenberg WS Ill”). The Claimant informed the Tribunal
that it would only be available for an additional hearing on 29 May 2012. On 15 May
2012, the Respondent submitted the Third Witness Statement of Victor Mikhailov dated
14 May 2012 (“Mikhailov WS III”) in rebuttal of the Rosenberg WS Ill. The Respondent
also submitted a witness statement of Mr. Nodirjon Juraev dated 14 May 2012, and an
Expert Report by Mr. Juval Aviv of the same date. The Respondent informed the
Tribunal that Mr. Mikhailov would be available for examination by videoconference on
29 May 2012.

99.

100.

In its letter to the Tribunal dated 16 May 2012, the Claimant notified the Tribunal that it
intended to cross-examine Mr. Mikhailov. On the next day, the Respondent notified the
Tribunal that it intended to cross-examine Mr. Rosenberg.

On 17 May 2012, the Secretary of the Tribunal, acting on the instructions of the
Tribunal, confirmed to the Parties that, in accordance with PO 10 and further to the
Claimant's letter dated 16 May 2012, an additional hearing would take place on 29 May
2012 at the offices of the World Bank in Washington, D.C. (“May Hearing”).

In its letter of 14 May 2012, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that Mr. Mikhailov
would be available for examination by video link. On 16 May 2012, the Claimant
objected to a videoconference and requested that Mr. Mikhailov testify in person. The
Claimant also requested the production of all the documents on which Mr. Mikhailov
had relied when preparing his latest witness statement. Finally, the Claimant requested
that the Aviv Report be struck from the record. In subsequent correspondence, the
Respondent objected to all these requests. During the pre-hearing conference call
conducted on 21 May 2012, the Tribunal heard the Parties' oral submissions on these
issues.

On 22 May 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 11 (“PO 11”) on the
Claimant’s requests. It held that because Mr. Mikhailov was detained in Uzbekistan, he
would testify by video link from a neutral location in Tashkent, preferably from the
World Bank's local offices. It rejected the Claimant's request to strike the Aviv Report
from the record and directed the Respondent to produce, by 24 May 2012, the
documents relied on by Mr. Mikhailov in preparing his latest witness statement or a
statement by Mr. Mikhailov confirming that he had not relied on any documents (other
than those already produced) in preparing his statement. The Tribunal also issued
several directions concerning the organization of the May Hearing.

May HEARING

On 29 May 2012, the hearing took place as scheduled. Mr. Rosenberg was examined
at the offices of the World Bank in Washington, D.C., while Mr. Mikhailov was
examined by video conference, with the Tribunal in Washington and Mr. Mikhailov at
the Ministry of Justice in Tashkent. Ms. Menaker, Messrs Currier and Savransky of
White & Case and Messrs Kanyazov, Juraev, Meliev and Shadibaev from the Ministry
of Justice attended the examination of Mr. Rosenberg by video link from Tashkent.

During Mr. Mikhailov’s examination, only Ms. Menaker and Mr. Currier of White & Case
and Ms. Aurélia Antonietti (Team Leader/Legal Counsel, ICSID), were present in the
Tashkent conference room. The representatives of the Ministry of Justice did not
attend. The hearing arrangements in Tashkent were supervised by Ms. Aurélia
Antonietti, who was in the hearing room at all times.

On 18 June 2012, in accordance with PO 10, the Parties submitted their first round of
post-hearing submissions (“C-PHB 1” and “R-PHB 1”).

In a letter to the Tribunal of 6 July 2012, the Respondent submitted three
commentaries on provisions of the Uzbek Criminal Code dealing with bribery, marked
as Exhibits R-681 through R-683. The Respondent stated that it was submitting these
documents in advance of the time limit for the reply post-hearing briefs “so that both
parties will have an equal opportunity to comment thereon.” On 9 July 2012, the
Claimant objected to the introduction of these materials into the record “in the interests
of the equality of the parties and procedural good order.”

On 12 July 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 12 (“PO 12”) on such new
documents and granted the Respondent’s request. To ensure that the Claimant had
sufficient opportunity to express itself on the content of these documents, the Tribunal
extended the page limit for the Claimant’s reply post-hearing submission. It also invited
the Parties to submit their reply post-hearing submissions by 2 August 2012.

On 2 August 2012, the Parties submitted their reply post-hearing submissions (“C-PHB
2” and “R-PHB 2”).

The Claimant submitted its cost statement on 1 August 2012 (“C-CB 1”) and the
Respondent included its cost statement in its First Post-Hearing Submission (“R-CB
1”). Replies on costs were submitted simultaneously on 22 August 2012 (“C-CB 2” and

“R-CB 2”).

The Tribunal closed the proceedings on the date of dispatch of this Award.

Ill. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES AND RELIEF REQUESTED

A. THE CLAIMANT’S POSITION AND REQUEST FOR RELIEF

107. In its written and oral submissions, Metal-Tech made the following main submissions:

The justifications advanced by Uzbekistan for Resolution No. 141, namely that
Uzmetal had failed to perform a number of the tasks set forth in Resolution No.
15 and in the founding documents (i.e. Uzmetal’s Charter and the Constituent
Contract), are without merit. Uzmetal had the right to decide for itself what
products to manufacture and in what volumes. Based on this right and on
market realities during the relevant period, Uzmetal took the business decision
to focus on production and sale of pure molybdenum oxide, to which neither
UzKTJM nor AGMK objected. Thus, Uzbekistan’s actions were illegitimate and
designed to seize Uzmetal’s assets. The government, together with AGMK and
UzKTJM, worked in league with the shared objective of depriving the Claimant

of its investment;®”

In any event, even if Resolution No. 15 required Uzmetal to produce fabricated
products, Uzmetal’s non-compliance would not have justified revocation of the
guarantees forming the basis of the Claimant’s investment. Further, the
Respondent's new allegations in respect of Resolution No. 15 and the founding
documents did not form the basis of Resolution No. 141 at the time, and should
not be entertained by the Tribunal now. In any case, the Respondent's
allegations are baseless as neither the Claimant nor Uzmetal violated the
founding documents or Resolution No. 15. For instance, pursuant to Appendix 2
of Resolution No. 15, the Claimant could contribute either USD 500,000 or
60,500,000 Soum. Therefore, Uzbekistan’s assertion that the Claimant could
only contribute USD 500,000 is wrong;®*

In reliance on Resolution No. 141, AGMK stopped supplying molybdenum to
Uzmetal. As a result, Uzmetal was forced to cease operations, as there was no
feasible alternative source of supply. On the other hand, UZKTJM immediately

benefited from Resolution No. 141 as all of AGMK’s raw material went to
UzKTJM;

Uzbekistan breached its obligations under the Agreement between the
Government of the State of Israel and the Government of the Republic of
Uzbekistan for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments of 4
July 1994 (the "Treaty" or the "BIT") and Uzbek Law. First, by enacting
Resolution No. 141, which deprived Metal-Tech of the expected economic
benefits of its investment, Uzbekistan expropriated Metal-Tech’s investment
without compensation in violation of Article 5 of the BIT.” The deprivation
inflicted by Resolution No. 141 was compounded by the decision of the
Economic Court of the Tashkent Region to void Uzmetal’s supply contract with
AGMK.”' It was then completed by the illegitimate bankruptcy proceedings
against Uzmetal, which were designed to transfer all of Uzmetal’s assets to
AGMK and UzKTJM. Additionally, the expropriation was unlawful because
Uzbekistan discriminated against Metal-Tech on the grounds of its nationality;

Second, by issuing Resolution No. 141, Uzbekistan violated its obligation to
accord Israeli investments fair and equitable treatment pursuant to Article 2(2)
of the BIT, namely its obligation not to frustrate the legitimate expectations
engendered by the representations and commitments which it made and on
which the Claimant relied in making its investment;”°

Third, by adopting Resolution No. 141 and thereby revoking its commitments
made to and relied on by Metal-Tech, Uzbekistan subjected Metal-Tech’s
investment to unreasonable and discriminatory measures in violation of Article 3
of the BIT. Uzbekistan’s measures against Uzmetal were taken in wilful
disregard of due process and proper procedure. Further, Metal-Tech was
singled out for arbitrary treatment as part of the Government's reaction to
criticism from Western democracies;

Fourth, Uzbekistan violated its obligation to provide full protection and security
to Metal-Tech’s investment in violation of Article 2(2) of the BIT. In particular, by
revoking the legal guarantees set forth in Resolution No. 15, the Respondent
violated its obligation to provide Metal-Tech with a secure commercial and legal
environment. Moreover, by not intervening when UzKTJM denied Uzmetal
access to its facilities in Chirchik, Uzbekistan violated its obligation to provide
Claimant's investment with physical security;”°

Finally, even if Uzbekistan did not violate the standards of treatment set forth in
the BIT, it is still liable for violating several of its own foreign investments laws,
which standards of treatment are incorporated into the BIT through Article 11 of
the BIT. Uzbekistan has also consented to ICSID arbitration of claims arising
under its foreign investments laws in the foreign investment laws themselves.”
For instance, the Respondent has violated the stabilization clause contained in
Article 3 of the Law on Guarantees by adopting and immediately applying
Resolution No. 141 to Metal-Tech’s investment only six-and-a-half years after
the date of the initial investment;””

Uzbekistan’s wrongful measures resulted in the total deprivation of Metal-
Tech’s 50% interest in Uzmetal and its exclusive right to export molybdenum
oxide without compensation.” Metal-Tech is thus entitled to reparation in
accordance with the standards prescribed by international law for wrongful

acts;”°

Contrary to the Respondent's allegations, the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the
present dispute. The legality requirement in the BIT must be interpreted as a
bar to jurisdiction only where the establishment of the investment was tainted by
illegality. It does not apply where the unlawful act is committed in the course of
the operation of the investment.®° Further, in application of the most favoured
nation provision in Article 3(2) of the BIT, the Tribunal must assert jurisdiction
on the basis of the more favorable definition of investment under Article 1(1) of

the Greece-Uzbekistan BIT, which includes no legality requirement.®" In the
event that the Tribunal were to deny the MFN claim, Metal-Tech still has not
violated Uzbek law: Uzmetal was constituted and operated in accordance with
Uzbek law; and,

xi. Again contrary to the Respondent's allegations, the counterclaims are not
directly concerned with the subject matter of this dispute, which involves
Uzbekistan’s violations of international law with respect to the Claimant's
investment. Hence, Article 8 (1) of the BIT is not sufficiently broad to include
counterclaims. Finally, even assuming that the Tribunal has jurisdiction,
Uzbekistan’s counterclaims should be dismissed because they are insufficiently
pled.®*

108. For these reasons, in its Reply on Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, Metal-Tech
requested the following relief:

“323. For the reasons set forth above, Claimant respectfully requests
that the Tribunal:

o exercise jurisdiction under Article 8 of the Israel-Uzbekistan
BIT over Metal-Tech’s claims described in its Request for
Arbitration, Part IV of its Statement of Claim, and Part | of its
Reply on Merits;

o deny Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction described in
Uzbekistan’s Memorial and Reply on Jurisdiction;

324. Claimant further requests that the Tribunal:

o find that Respondent has violated its obligations under the BIT
by:

a) unlawfully expropriating Metal-Tech’s investment in
Uzbekistan without paying prompt, adequate and effective
compensation;

b) failed to accord fair and equitable treatment to Metal-
Tech’s investment;

c) subjected Metal-Tech’s investment to unreasonable and
discriminatory measures; and

d) failed to accord full protection and security to Metal-
Tech's investment.

a) violating the stabilization clause contained in Article 3 of
the Law on Guarantees; and

b) violating Article 18 of the Law on Foreign Investments by
failing to reorganize or liquidate Metal-Tech’s investment in

right to recover its share of the investment in the event that
it is liquidated;

o deny Respondent's defenses on the merits described in
Sections III.G to IIl.L. of Respondent’s Counter-Memorial on
Merits.

325. Claimant further requests that the Tribunal decline to exercise
jurisdiction over Respondent's counterclaims, to which it fleetingly
refers in Section IIl.N of its Counter-Memorial on Merits. In the
alternative, Claimant requests that the Tribunal dismiss Respondent’s
counterclaims for the reasons set forth in Section II of Metal-Tech’s
Reply on Merits.

326. Claimant further requests that the Tribunal order further
proceedings on the issue of quantum and eventually order
Respondent to pay compensation to the Claimant in the amount of
$173,962,625.

327. Finally, Claimant requests that the Tribunal order Respondent to
pay interest on the above amount at a reasonable commercial rate,
compounded from 18 July 2006 until full payment has been made;
and to order Respondent to pay Claimant's costs in this arbitration,
including all attorney’s and expert-witness fees, and to bear sole
responsibility for compensating the Tribunal and the International
Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes.”**

109. In its first post-hearing submission, Metal-Tech referred to the relief requested earlier
and summarized it as follows:

“For the reasons set forth above, Metal-Tech renews its request for
relief as presented in its written memorials and its oral arguments at
the hearing. The Tribunal should find for Metal-Tech on all claims,
reject Respondent's jurisdictional objections, defenses, and
counterclaims, and order Respondent to pay the costs of this
proceeding.”®°

submissions:

The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over this dispute because the Claimant’s
investment was “implemented”, i.e. made and operated, in violation of Uzbek
law.® In particular, the Claimant engaged in corruption and made fraudulent
and material misrepresentations to gain approval for its investment.® It also
implemented its investment unlawfully by unjustly enriching itself and
defrauding the JV, the Uzbek partners and the State. Contrary to the
Claimant’s allegations, in the absence of clear and unambiguous language to
that effect, Article 1(1) of the BIT cannot be expanded to cover investments that
are unlawfully implemented via the most favoured nation clause in the BIT. In
any case, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal cannot be based on the Greece-
Uzbekistan BIT via the MFN clause because the Claimant's investment was not
only operated, but also made in violation of Uzbekistan’s laws. The requirement
that investments must be made in accordance with the host State’s law is
implied in BITs, including the Greece-Uzbekistan BIT, irrespective whether they
contain a legality clause or not;®

The Tribunal also lacks jurisdiction over claims for violation of Uzbek and
customary international law because Uzbekistan has not agreed to arbitrate
these claims. In particular, Articles 8 and 11 of the BIT do not provide any
foundation for claims based on national and customary international law;°°

Alternatively, the claims should be dismissed because they are inadmissible on
account of the Claimant's unlawful conduct. Under the “clean hands” doctrine,
the Claimant should not be allowed to pursue its claims because it has engaged
in significant misconduct directly related to its investment;

Uzbekistan has not breached any of its obligations under the Israeli-Uzbekistan
BIT. First, Resolution No. 141 did not expropriate the Claimant’s investment
because it did not have the effect of a “taking”. It did not deprive Metal-Tech of
all or substantially all of its investment, but merely voided Article 3 of Resolution
No. 15 which granted Uzmetal the privilege to purchase all of AGMK’s

molybdenum middlings.°' The Resolution did not prohibit AGMK from
continuing to supply molybdenum middlings to Uzmetal and did not prevent
Uzmetal from purchasing molybdenum raw material from other sources.” In
any event, the Resolution is not expropriatory because it was legitimately
enacted in response to the Claimant’s wrongdoing.® Further, none of the
actions taken in the bankruptcy proceedings by the judicial receiver who served
as interim and later liquidation manager of Uzmetal are attributable to the
Respondent and the acts of the Uzbek courts in Uzmetal’s bankruptcy
proceedings did not expropriate the Claimant's investment as the courts acted
in conformity with Uzbek law.™ Finally, the transfer of Uzmetal’s assets to
AGMK and UzKTJM was lawful and even if it was not, AGMK’s and UZKTJM’s
acts are not attributable to the State;

Second, the Claimant could not have legitimately expected that its investment
would remain entitled to the benefits granted under Resolution No. 15 despite
its failure to comply with its obligations under that Resolution and its efforts to
unjustly enrich itself to the detriment of the joint venture, the Uzbek parties and
Uzbekistan. Resolution No. 141 was legitimately enacted in direct response to
the Claimant’s unlawful conduct and failure to fulfill its obligations under
Resolution No. 15;

Third, Resolution No. 141 was legitimately enacted and therefore does not
constitute unreasonable treatment in violation of the BIT. The investment would
not have been approved, and the exclusive supply arrangement would not have
been granted, but for Metal-Tech’s representations that Uzmetal would comply
with the obligations specified in Resolution No. 15.°” Since Uzmetal did not
comply with its obligations, it was reasonable to expect that the Respondent
would revoke the benefits granted in return for these obligations. Further, in
light of the multiple notifications that Uzmetal was not performing and the
warnings by the Government that there would be “serious consequences” if
Uzmetal did not fulfill its obligations set forth in the approved Feasibility Study

and Resolution No. 15, the Claimant cannot assert that it was surprised by the
enactment of Resolution No. 141 or that it had not been given any prior
notice.*® Moreover, the bankruptcy proceedings were reasonable and
conducted in conformity with Uzbek law. In any event, UZKTJM’s actions in the
bankruptcy proceedings cannot be attributed to Uzbekistan. Finally, Resolution
No. 141 was based on the Claimant's failure to deliver on its promises and did
not discriminate against the Claimant on the basis of its nationality;

Fourth, Uzbekistan did not cause any physical damage to Metal-Tech’s
investment in Uzbekistan. Therefore, Uzbekistan did not violate the full
protection and security clause in Article 2 of the BIT. The Claimant is wrong in
contending that the obligation to afford full protection and security extends
beyond physical protection to legal security. The BITs full protection and
security clause does not operate as a legal stabilization agreement that
guarantees the absolute stability of Resolution No. 15 irrespective of Claimant's
actions;'°

Finally, even if the Tribunal were to find that it has jurisdiction over claims for
violation of Uzbek law, the Respondent has not breached any of its laws. In
particular, the so-called stability clause in Article 3 of the Law of Guarantees is
inapplicable as Resolution No. 141 does not fall within the types of “legislation”
to which the protections of Article 3 apply. Further, even if Resolution No. 141
was covered by Article 3, the Claimant has not given notice that the change in
legislation worsened its investment conditions, which notice was required to
trigger the application of Article 3;'°' and,

The Respondent is entitled to bring counterclaims to recover for damages
sustained as a direct result of the Claimant's unlawful conduct. These
counterclaims fall within the ICSID’s jurisdiction and the Parties’ consent to
arbitration provided in Article 8(1) of the BIT. They also arise directly out of the
subject matter of the dispute pursuant to Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and
Article 40 (1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.'”

111. For these reasons, in its Rejoinder on the Merits, the Respondent requested that the
Tribunal “dismiss Metal-Tech’s claims in their entirety and issue a decision in favor of
Respondent in respect of its Counterclaims. Respondent furthermore respectfully

requests that it be awarded all the expenses and costs associated with defending

against Claimant's claims.”'°

112. In its first post-hearing submission, the Respondent sought the following relief:

“For all of the reasons set forth in Respondents submission to the
Tribunal, at the Hearing and above, Respondent respectfully requests
that the Tribunal:

(1) Dismiss Metal-Tech’s claims in their entirety for lack of jurisdiction,
inadmissibility, or on the merits;

(2) enter a decision in favor of Respondent in respect of all of its
counterclaims;

(3) if the Tribunal reaches the merits the Tribunal should decide:

(A) Respondent has not breached the fair and equitable treatment
standard under the treaty;

(B) Respondent has not impaired by unreasonable and discriminatory
measures Metal-Tech’s management, maintenance, use enjoyment
or disposal of its investment;

(C) Respondent has not failed to provide full protection and security
to Metal- Tech’s investment;

(D) Respondent has not expropriated Metal-Tech’s investment
without just compensation; and,

(E) Respondent has not violated the foreign investment laws of
Uzbekistan.

(4) award all costs and expenses associated with defending against
Claimants claims.”'*

IV. ANALYSIS

113. The Respondent submits that the claims must be dismissed before reaching the merits
on the following grounds: first, because the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction under the
express terms of the BIT and, second, because Uzbek law does not provide an
independent basis for jurisdiction. The Respondent also invokes the inadmissibility of
the claims. Following some preliminary matters discussed in Section IV.A, the Tribunal
will consider the Parties’ arguments on jurisdiction and specifically on legality under the
BIT in Section IV.B, and then address their submissions on Uzbek law in Section IV.C.
It will then conclude on the claims in Section IV.D, before dealing with the
counterclaims in Section IV.E.

PRELIMINARY MATTERS

Prior to entering the merits of the Parties' positions, the Tribunal will address the
relevance of previous decisions or awards in Section IV.A.1, the scope of this Award in
Section IV.A.2, and the applicable legal framework in Section IV.A.3.

1. Relevance of Previous Decisions and Awards

In support of their positions, both Parties have relied on previous decisions or awards,
either to conclude that the same solutions should be adopted in the present case or in
an effort to explain why this Tribunal should depart from a solution reached by another
tribunal.

The Tribunal's view is that it is not bound by previous decisions of ICSID or other
arbitral tribunals. At the same time, it is of the opinion that it should pay due regard to
earlier decisions of international tribunals. The Tribunal is further of the view that,
unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary, it has a duty to follow solutions
established in a series of consistent cases comparable to the case at hand, but subject,
of course, to the specifics of a given treaty and of the circumstances of the actual case.
By doing so, it will meet its duty to contribute to the harmonious development of
investment law and thereby to meet the legitimate expectations of the community of

States and investors towards certainty of the rule of law.‘

2. Scope of this Award

In PO 1, the Tribunal decided to join the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction and
admissibility to the merits on the ground that they were closely related to the merits. At
the same time, it bifurcated the proceedings between jurisdiction and liability, on the
one hand, and quantum on the other, because damage quantification (if applicable)
could be easily heard in isolation from the rest of the case. As will be seen in the
course of its analysis, the Tribunal has come to the conclusion that it has no jurisdiction
over the Claimant's claims. Thus, the Award does not address liability issues.

Further, in its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent raised certain counterclaims, as
according to it, the Tribunal’s lack of jurisdiction over the claims does not affect the

counterclaims. In Section IV.E below, the Tribunal will thus analyze the Respondent's
counterclaims.

3. Legal Framework

119. This arbitration is brought under the Treaty, which is thus the primary source of law for
this Tribunal. As this arbitration is an ICSID arbitration, the ICSID Convention is also a
relevant source of law in respect of jurisdictional and procedural matters. The
interpretation of these two instruments is governed by customary international law as
codified by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (“Vienna Convention” or
"VCLT"). 16

120. In this context, the Tribunal notes that Uzbek law recognizes and prioritizes treaties
and generally accepted norms of international law. This is, in particular, evident from
the Preamble of the Constitution of the Republic of Uzbekistan,” from the Law on
Foreign Investments of 30 April 1998' and from the Law on Guarantees and
Measures of Protection of Foreign investors’ Rights of 30 April 1998 (the “Law on

Guarantees’). '°°

B. JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTIONS TO TREATY CLAIMS

=

. Applicable Law

121. The Tribunal's jurisdiction is governed by the ICSID Convention and by the BIT. Where
these treaties are silent on an issue that is relevant to determine jurisdiction, e.g. the
manner in which consent is given, such issue is subject to customary international law,

18 While Israel is not a party to the VCLT, it has not been contested that the rules on interpretation
that it contains reflect customary international law.

'°? The Preamble of the Constitution reads as follows: ‘The people of Uzbekistan, solemnly declaring
their adherence to human rights and principles of state sovereignty, aware of their ultimate
responsibility to the present and the future generations, relying on historical experience in the
development of Uzbek statehood, affirming their commitment to the ideals of democracy and social
justice, recognizing priority of the generally accepted norms of the international law, aspiring to a
worthy life for the citizens of the Republic, setting forth the task of creating a humane and democratic
rule of law, aiming to ensure civil peace and national accord [...]" (emphasis added).

108 Article 2 of the Law of the Republic of Uzbekistan No. 609-I “On Foreign Investments” of 30 April
1998 reads as follows: “If an international agreement concluded by the Republic of Uzbekistan
established other rules than those provided by the legislation on foreign investments, then the rules of
international agreement are applied” (Exh. R-14).

109 Article 2 of the Law of the Republic of Uzbekistan No. 611-1 “On Guarantees and Measures of
Protection of Foreign Investors’ Rights” of 30 April 1998 reads as follows: “If an international
agreement concluded by the Republic of Uzbekistan established other rules than those provided by
the legislation on guarantees and measures of protection of foreign investors' rights then rules of
international agreement are applied” (Exh. R—-15).

39

unless the treaties refer to municipal law. This is in particular so when an investment
treaty requires that an investment be made in accordance with host State law.

a. ICSID Convention

122. Jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention is governed by Article 25(1), which reads as
follows:

"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising
directly out of an investment between a Contracting State (or any
constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated
to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting
State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to
the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may
withdraw its consent unilaterally."

123. For a tribunal to have jurisdiction under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, four
conditions must be satisfied: (i) the arbitration must be between a Contracting State
and a national of another Contracting State, (ii) there must be a legal dispute arising
directly out of (iii) an investment, and (iv) the Contracting State and the investor must
have consented in writing to ICSID arbitration. In addition, of course, the ICSID
Convention must have been applicable at the relevant time. '"° Finally, it is the duty of a
tribunal established on the basis of a treaty to verify its jurisdiction under that treaty,
even if the parties have not objected to it.

124. There is no dispute between the Parties — and rightly so — on the fulfilment of the first
condition of nationality. The Republic of Uzbekistan and Israel are each parties to the
ICSID Convention. The Claimant is a company organized under the laws of the State of
Israel. As such, it is a national of Israel, i.e. it is a “national of another Contracting
State” as defined by Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. There is no issue either
about the applicability of the ICSID Convention ratione temporis. Uzbekistan signed the
ICSID Convention on 17 March 1994, and ratified it on 26 July 1995, with an effective
date of 25 August 1995. Israel, for its part, signed the Convention on 16 June 1980,
and ratified it on 22 June 1983, with an effective date of 22 July 1983.

125. In connection with the second and third conditions, the Parties agree about the
existence of a legal dispute. They also agree that the Claimant has made an
investment in the sense that it has committed resources to a project in Uzbekistan.
However, they diverge on whether such investment must be in conformity with law and,

"° Phoenix Action Ltd. v. Czech Republic (hereafter “Phoenix’), Decision on Jurisdiction, 15 April
2009, 954.

40

126.

127.

128.

129.

if so, whether it actually was. The Parties' disagreement thus hinges on the necessity
that the allocation of resources be in conformity with the law. In other words, they
diverge on whether the definition of the term “investment” contained in Article 25(1)
includes a requirement of legality.

The Claimant submits that “... Article 25 [does not contain] any requirement that
investments be entered into in good faith or made in accordance with host state law,
and the Tribunal should not incorporate additional jurisdictional requirements ... at
Uzbekistan’s request.”'"' The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant's position.

The Tribunal does not share the view expressed for instance in Phoenix pursuant to
which compliance with the laws of the host State and respect of good faith are
elements of the objective definition of investment under Article 25(1) of the ICSID
Convention.'"? In the Tribunal’s view, the Contracting Parties to an investment treaty
may limit the protections of the treaty to investments made in accordance with the laws
and regulations of the host State. Depending on the wording of the investment treaty,
this limitation may be a bar to jurisdiction, i.e. to the procedural protections under the
BIT, or a defense on the merits, i.e. to the application of the substantive treaty
guarantees. Similarly, a breach of the general prohibition of abuse of right, which is a
manifestation of the principle of good faith, may give rise to an objection to jurisdiction
or to a defense on the merits. This does not mean that these elements are part of the
objective definition of the term “investment” contained in Article 25(1) of the ICSID
Convention.

Bearing these clarifications in mind, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant's investment,
which consists in a 50% participation in Uzmetal, a joint venture established under the
laws of the Republic of Uzbekistan, meets the objective definition of investment as
understood to be contained in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and thus fulfills the
second condition set in such provision.

Turning now to the third condition which requires consent to ICSID arbitration, the
Tribunal notes that the Claimant consented to ICSID jurisdiction in a letter of 13 July
2009 and subsequently by filing its Request for Arbitration. The Respondent has
expressed its consent to ICSID jurisdiction in Article 8(1) of the BIT. However, the
Respondent submits that it “consented to arbitrate only those disputes concerning

™ Reply M. 9288.
"2 See e.g., Phoenix (101, 114.

4

lawfully implemented investments. Where, as here, the investment at issue was made
and implemented contrary to the laws and regulations of the Republic of Uzbekistan,
Respondent has not granted its consent to arbitrate before ICSID a dispute concerning
that investment.”'? Whether the Respondent’s consent covers the present dispute
depends on the content of the BIT and in particular on Article 8(1) thereof. If the
requirements set in Article 8(1) are not met, then the Respondent has not consented to
submit the present dispute to ICSID arbitration and the ratione voluntatis condition
required by Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention is not satisfied. The analysis of
Article 8(1) of the BIT follows.

b. BIT

130. The following provisions of the BIT are relevant:

«Article 12, which deals with the BITs temporal scope of application:

“The provisions of this Agreement shall apply to investments made on
or before the entry into force of this Agreement.”''*

« Article 8, which provides for dispute settlement as follows:

“1. Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit to the
International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes
(hereinafter: the "Centre") for settlement by conciliation or arbitration
under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes
between States and Nationals of Other States opened for signature at
Washington on 18 March 1965 any legal dispute arising between that
Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contracting
Party concerning an investment of the latter in the territory of the
former.

3. If any such dispute should arise and cannot be resolved, amicably
or otherwise, within three (3) months from written notification of the
existence of the dispute, then the investor affected may institute
conciliation or arbitration proceedings by addressing a request to that
effect to the Secretary-General of the Centre, as provided in Article
28 or 36 respectively of the Convention. The Contracting Party which
is a party to the dispute shall not raise as an objection at any stage of
the proceedings or enforcement of an award the fact that the investor
which is the other party to the dispute has received, in pursuance of
an insurance contract, an indemnity in respect of some or all of his or
its losses.

4. Neither Contracting Party shall pursue, through the diplomatic
channel, any dispute referred to the Centre, unless:

"3 Mem. J. $200.
"4 The Treaty entered into force on 19 February 1997.

42

(a) the Secretary-General of the Centre or a conciliation commission
or an arbitral tribunal constituted by it decides that the dispute is not
within the jurisdiction of the Centre; or

(b) the other: Contracting Party should fail to abide by or to comply
with any award rendered by an arbitral tribunal’.

e Article 1(1), which defines "investments" as follows:

“The term ‘investments’ shall comprise any kind of assets,
implemented in accordance with the laws and regulations of the
Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made,
including, but not limited to:

a) movable and immovable property, as well as any other rights in rem,
in respect of every kind of asset;

b) rights derived from shares, bonds and other kinds of interests in
companies;

c) claims to money, goodwill and other assets and to any performance
having an economic value;

d) rights in the field of intellectual property, technical processes and
know-how;

e) business concessions conferred by law or under contract, including
concessions to search for, cultivate, extract or exploit natural
resources.”

 

e And Article 1(3), which defines "investors" as follows:
“The term “investor” shall comprise:

L.-J
With respect to investments made in the Republic of Uzbekistan:

a) Natural persons who are nationals of the State of Israel who are not
also nationals of the Republic of Uzbekistan; or

b) Companies including corporations, firms or associations incorporated
or constituted in accordance with the law of the State of Israel, which
are not directly or indirectly controlled by nationals or permanent
residents of the Republic of Uzbekistan."

131. It is undisputed that the ratione personae conditions provided in Articles 8 and 1(3)
and the ratione temporis requirement set in Article 1 are met. It is equally common
ground that the pre-requisite for the submission of a claim to ICSID arbitration provided
in Article 8(3) is satisfied. Indeed, despite an attempt by the Claimant, the Parties were
unable to resolve the dispute amicably.''® By contrast, while the Parties agree that
Article 1(1) contains a legality requirement, they diverge on the scope of such
requirement, an issue to which the Tribunal will turn below in Section IV.B.3. Before
doing so, however, the Tribunal must address the Claimant's most favored nation or
MEN argument in Section IV.B.2. Indeed, the Claimant argues that on the basis of
Article 3 of the BIT, it is entitled to import a definition of investment from a third party

"8 RA 435.

43

132

133.

treaty that comprises no legality requirement and, therefore, jurisdiction is not
conditional on a lawful investment.

2. Legality Requirement and MFN

a. Claimant’s Position

. The Claimant submits that the most favored nation provision in Article 3(2) of the
Treaty requires that the Tribunal incorporate the more favorable definition of
“investment” of Article 1(1) of the Greece-Uzbekistan BIT into the Israel-Uzbekistan
BIT.

The Claimant argues that while normally the definition of “investment” is not considered
as “treatment” under an MFN provision, the parties to the Treaty expressly agreed that
the definition of “investment” in Article 1(1) of the Treaty could lead to more or less
favorable treatment for investors. In support of this proposition, the Claimant relies on
Article 7(c) of the Treaty.

134. According to the Claimant, the language of Article 7(c) of the Treaty makes clear that

135.

the parties intended the term “treatment” in Article 3(2) to include more favorable
treatment accorded to investors resulting from the definition of “investment” in Article
1(1) of the Treaty. Were it otherwise, there would have been no need for the exception
in Article 7(c) of the Treaty. For the Claimant, “[t]he contemplated exception
demonstrates that the parties considered whether more favorable treatment accorded
to investors under the MFN clause would encompass broader definitions of investment
contained in BITs with third parties, and Israel and Uzbekistan concluded that it would.
They then concluded that there would be a narrow exception to this principle for
definitions of investment that appeared in pre-1992 Israeli BITs.”''® Further, the
Claimant submits that other Uzbek BITs do not contain such an exception.

Accordingly, the Claimant concludes that Metal-Tech may avail itself of a more
favorable definition of “investment” found in a BIT that Uzbekistan has entered into with
a third party. The Greece-Uzbekistan BIT, does not exclude substantive protections to
investors whose investments are initiated or operated in violation of host State law or
operated in violation of host State law.'”” If the Tribunal adopts Uzbekistan’s

"6 Mem. M. 9229.

"7 article 1(1) of the Greece-Uzbekistan BIT provides: “1. The term “investment” means every kind of
asset and in particular, though not exclusively, includes: a) movable and immovable property and any

44

interpretation of the definition of investment in the Israel-Uzbekistan BIT, Israeli
investors “would be treated less favorably than Greek investors with respect to their

management, maintenance, and use of their investments in Uzbekistan.”''®

136. In response to the Respondent's reliance on prior decisions holding that a MFN clause
does not apply to the definition of investment, the Claimant submits that all of the
decisions cited interpreted MFN provisions in treaties that do not contain exceptions
like the one in Article 7(c) of the Treaty.'’® The language of Article 7(c) shows that the
parties intended to include the definition of investment within the scope of Article 3(2) of
the Treaty. Any other interpretation would reduce part of Article 7 to “inutility,” a result
that is contrary to well-established principles of treaty interpretation. '”°

137. To the Respondent’s comparison with other treaties, the Claimant replies that such an
approach is not in accordance with the principles of treaty interpretation set forth in the
Vienna Convention. There is no rationale for the Respondent's proposition that,
because in other treaties Israel negotiated an exception that focused on the repatriation
provisions of Article 6 of the Treaty, Article 7(c) in the Treaty should be read the same
way. Article 7 of the Treaty refers not only to the repatriation provisions of other
investment treaties entered into by Israel before 1992, but also to the definition of
“investment” in those pre-1992 investment treaties. If Israel’s only concern in respect of
the MEN provision was its extension to the repatriation provisions in Article 6, it would
not have been necessary to include the definition of “investment” in Article 7(c) of the
Treaty. The reference to Article 6 itself would have been sufficient for this purpose. '*"

138. Finally, according to the Claimant, the Respondent’s submission that a legality
requirement is to be read into the BITs definition of investment, must be rejected as “it
would require the Tribunal to incorporate its own language into [the BIT], in
contravention of the Vienna Convention’s mandate to interpret a treaty in good faith

 

rights in rem, such as servitudes, ususfructus [sic], mortgages, liens or pledges; b) shares in and stock
and debentures of a company and any other form of participation in a company; c) claims to money or
to any performance under contract having an economic value, as well as loans connected to an
investment; d) intellectual and industrial property rights, patents, trade marks, technical processes,
know-how, goodwill and any other similar rights; e) any right conferred by law or contract or by virtue
of any licences and permits granted pursuant to law to undertake an economic activity. A possible
change in the form in which the investments have been made does not affect their character as
investments” (Exh. CL-1).

according to the ordinary meaning of its terms in context.”'”* Principles of good faith
should not be incorporated into a treaty to alter the jurisdictional requirements of the
ICSID Convention and the applicable BIT. Further, the decisions cited by Uzbekistan in
support of its argument are easily distinguishable. In both Phoenix Action v. Czech
Republic and Gustav Hamester v. Ghana, the BITs contained legality clauses requiring
that investments be made in accordance with host state law. The discussions of the
application of the international legal principles of good faith were therefore obiter dicta.
In any event, according to the Claimant, even assuming that a legality requirement can
be implied if the treaty is silent, such a requirement would exclude jurisdiction “only for
serious illegalities committed during the establishment of an investment.”'*° All of the
cases cited by the Respondent confirm that a legality clause may be implied in a BIT
only in respect of conduct during the initiation of the investment.

b. Respondent’s Position

139. According to the Respondent, applying the MFN clause in the manner proposed by

Claimant “would improperly circumvent the basic prerequisite that an investment first

be covered under one treaty before receiving the benefits of a second treaty.”

Tribunals have consistently rejected attempts to use the MFN clause to circumvent the
scope of treaty coverage, including the definition of a qualifying investment." In

Société Générale v. Dominican Republic for instance, the tribunal denied an attempt to

use an MEN provision to access a broader definition of investment in another treaty. 7°

The tribunal in Yaung Chi Oo Trading v. Myanmar also followed a similar approach. '?”
Moreover, the tribunal in Tecmed v. Mexico concluded that an MFN clause “cannot be

used to circumvent the core matters which determine whether an investor may access

a treaty’s substantive protections.”'°

140. The Respondent submits that it is a “fundamental principle” that an MFN provision
cannot be used to circumvent basic treaty coverage requirements to defeat the treaty’s

established boundaries. To the Respondent, “[to] do otherwise would undermine the
intentions of the Contracting Parties when agreeing to such parameters, and would
allow a claimant not otherwise entitled to any protections under a treaty to enjoy both
the benefits of that treaty and a more favorable third-party treaty.”"*° The Respondent
points out that the Claimant had not identified any case where an investor was
permitted to expand the definition of investment through an MFN clause.'*? The
Respondent insists that consistent with the decision of the tribunal in Plama and in later
cases, an MFN clause should not be read to expand the definition of investment unless
the Contracting Parties’ “clearly and unambiguously expressed” their intent to authorize
such an approach. '**

141. According to the Respondent, the Claimant rests its MFN argument on an erroneous
interpretation of the exceptions under Article 7 of the Treaty. Article 7(c) of the Treaty
was included to address Israel’s concerns regarding repatriation provisions appearing
in several of its pre-1992 BITs.'** When Article 7(c) of the Treaty is viewed along with
other investment treaties containing similar MFN exceptions specifically identifying the
repatriation provisions of the Poland, Hungary, and Romania BITs, it becomes clear
that by including Article 7(c) in the Treaty, Israel sought to avoid extending the MFN
clause in the Treaty to the repatriation provisions in these pre-1992 BITs. This position
is also confirmed by commentary which states that the intent was to preclude the
application of the pre-1992 currency transfer restrictions through the operation of the
MEN clause. ‘* The reference in Article 7(c) of the Treaty to the definition of the term

“investment” must be read in this context.

142. In any event, according to the Respondent, the international legal principle of good faith
precludes the application of an MFN clause to circumvent the definition of investment in
an investment agreement. A requirement that investments are to be made in
accordance with law is implied in investment treaties whether or not they contain an
express legality clause.'** Thus, the Phoenix tribunal observed that “this condition — the

conformity of the establishment of the investment with the national laws — is implicit
even when not expressly stated in the relevant BIT.” Tribunals in Hamester and
Plama have found the same.'%® Consequently, according to the Respondent, the
Claimant cannot rely on the Greece-Uzbekistan BIT to bypass the requirement that
Claimant’s investment be made in accordance with host State law.

c. Analysis

Article 3 of the Treaty provides for MFN treatment of investments and investors in the
following terms:

“1. Neither Contracting Party shall, in its territory, subject
investments or returns or investors of the other Contracting
Party to treatment less favorable than that which it accords to
investments or returns of investors of any third state.

2. Neither Contracting Party shall, in its territory, subject
investors of the other Contracting Party, as regards their
management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their
investments, to treatment less favorable than that which it
accords to . . . investors of any third state.”

The question that must be resolved here is whether this MFN obligation extends to the
definition of investment in Article 1(1) of the BIT, which requires that investments be
"implemented in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in
whose territory the investment is made". For the reasons given below, the Tribunal
finds that this is not the case.

As a general matter, the Tribunal notes that, ordinarily, an MFN clause cannot be used
to import a more favorable definition of investment contained in another BIT. The
reason is that the defined terms “investments” and “investors” are used in the MFN
clause itself, so that the treatment assured to investments and investors by Article 3
necessarily refers to investments and investors as defined in Article 1 of the BIT. In
other words, one must fall within the scope of the treaty, which is in particular
circumscribed by the definition of investment and investors, to be entitled to invoke the

treaty protections, of which MFN treatment forms part. Or, in fewer words, one must be
under the treaty to claim through the treaty.

The tribunal in Société Générale v. Dominican Republic applied the same reasoning.
There, the claimant contended that, although it did not meet the definition of investment
as contained in the Dominican Republic-France BIT, it met the one contained in the
DR-CAFTA. The Société Générale tribunal found that the investor had made an
investment under the basic treaty, but rejected the proposed alternative: “[eJach treaty
defines what it considers a protected investment and who is entitled to that protection,
and definitions can change from treaty to treaty. In this situation, resort to the specific
text of the MFN clause is unnecessary because it applies only to the treatment
accorded to such defined investment, but not to the definition of ‘investment’ itself”
(emphasis added).'°’ Indeed, the Claimant itself concedes that an MFN clause will
ordinarily not extend to the definition of an investment.'® In the same vein, the tribunal
in Berschader v. Russia, interpreting a MFN clause applying to "all matters covered by
the present Treaty", considered that definitions "deal with matters which have no
relations to the treatment of investors", with the result that it was "very difficult to see

how a MFN clause could possibly apply to these provisions". '%°

Here, the Claimant argues that Article 7(c) of the BIT changes this position. To the
Claimant, Article 7(c) shows the Parties’ intention to extend the MFN clause to the
definition of investment (including the legality requirement), or else they would not have
made an exception for pre-1992 treaties. The Respondent denies this position and
submits that the reference to "the definition of investment" in Article 7(c) cannot be
isolated from the rest of Article 7(c) and must be understood in the context of the
repatriation provisions referred to in that sub-article.

To resolve the issue, the Tribunal must interpret Article 7(c) of the BIT, for which it
turns to the Vienna Convention. Under the Vienna Convention, a treaty must be
interpreted "in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the
terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose" (Article
31(1)). To confirm the meaning established pursuant to this rule (among other

49

purposes), one may have recourse to supplementary means of interpretation, which
include the circumstances of the treaty’s conclusion (Article 32 of the VCLT).

149. Article 7 of the BIT, which was already quoted in part above, reads in full as follows:

The provisions of this Agreement relative to the grant of
treatment not less favourable than that accorded to the
investors of either Contracting Party or of any third state shall
not be construed so as to oblige one Contracting Party to
extend to the investors of the other the benefit of any treatment,
preference or privilege resulting from:

(a) any international agreement or arrangement relating wholly
or mainly to taxation or any domestic legislation relating wholly
or mainly to taxation;

(b) any existing or future customs union, free trade area
agreement or similar international agreement to which either
Contracting Party is or may become a party;

(c) the definitions of "investment" (Article 1, paragraph 1) and
"reinvestment" (Article 1, paragraph 2) and the provisions of
Article 6 contained in Agreements entered into by the State of
Israel prior to January 1, 1992.

150. To the Tribunal, the Claimant's interpretation carves out the reference to "the definition
of investment" from the text of Article 7(c). This is contrary to Article 31(1) of the VCLT
that requires the interpreter to take account of the context of the terms, a concept that
is defined in broad terms in paragraph 2 of that same provision.

151. Article 7(c) does not end at “the definition of investment.” Rather, it goes on to refer to
“the definition of reinvestment” and also to “the provisions of Article 6...”, i.e. the
repatriation provisions. If, as the Claimant contends, the reference to “the definition of
investment” is to be given a separate and independent meaning, it is unclear why it
would appear in the context of “reinvestment” and repatriation, both of which are
concepts intricately linked to and dependent on the definition of investment. Indeed, the
concept of reinvestment and repatriation both first require an investment. On a textual
and contextual basis, therefore, investment, reinvestment and repatriation used in the
same provision appear linked to each other.

152. The Tribunal’s conclusion is further strengthened if one looks at the overall structure of
Article 7. Article 7(a) and (b) both list the avenues through which investors are

50

153.

154.

155.

156.

foreclosed from claiming beneficial treatment: an international agreement relating to
taxation (7(a)) and a customs union or free trade agreement (7(b)). These are thus
distinct concepts arranged in separate subparagraphs. There is no reason why the
definition of investment could not have been addressed in a separate subparagraph as
well, if, as the Claimant suggests, the reference to “investment” is to be considered
independently of the rest of the text of Article 7(c) of the Treaty.

Still within the context of the terms of the treaty, the Tribunal’s view is also supported
by looking at Article 7(c) in relation to Article 3. Article 3 of the BIT states two negative
propositions: that neither Contracting Party shall subject investors of the other
Contracting Party, or their investments, to less favorable treatment than it accords to
investors of other states, or their investments. A definition is not a form of treatment; it
simply establishes the baseline of what is entitled to MFN treatment. The fact that one
form of investment may be entitled to MFN treatment under one treaty, while a different
form of investment is entitled to MFN treatment under another treaty, does not mean
that there is a breach of the MFN standard.

The Claimant contests this view by relying on Article 7(c). It contends that as Article
7(c) expressly excludes the definition of investment from treaties entered into by Israel
prior to 1 January 1992, a contrario it impliedly includes the definition of investment
from treaties entered into by Israel after 1 January 1992. However, there is no reason
why this should be the case. The fact that the Contracting Parties contemplated that
the MFN clause of the Treaty could be argued to apply to the definition of investment in
other treaties entered into by Israel before 1992, at least in the context of the
repatriation clauses of those treaties, does not necessarily mean that they intended to
endorse such an application for all other treaties.

This is all the more so as the repatriation provisions of the pre-1992 Israel BITs that are
removed from the scope of the MFN clause by Article 7(c) are peculiar provisions that
reflect particular exchange controls in effect when those BITs were entered into. The
State of Israel may have wished to foreclose complications that could have been
introduced into later treaties by those provisions and their accompanying definitions of
investment. This does not necessarily mean that it intended for the definitions in other
treaties to become interchangeable by means of the MFN clauses in later treaties.

This understanding also appears correct considering that the requirement of legality of
the investment is spelled out in the clearest terms in Article 1 of the BIT and that it is

51

common ground that, as a general matter at least, the existence of an investment
falling within the scope of that provision is a condition sine qua non of treaty protection.
Any exception to these clear rules would have to be stated in no uncertain terms, which
is obviously not so here.

157. In sum, the ordinary meaning of the terms interpreted in their context lead the Tribunal
to conclude that Article 7(c) does not provide for the application of MFN treatment to
the definition of investment under Article 1(1) of the BIT.

158. The object and purpose of the Treaty is neutral for present purposes. The Preamble
emphasizes, on the one hand, “economic cooperation to the mutual benefit of both
countries” as well as an “increase [of] prosperity in both states”, and, on the other, an
intention to create “favorable conditions for greater investments by investors” as well as
“the promotion and reciprocal protection of investments” and “the stimulation of
individual business initiative”. In other words, the Preamble refers to both the private
interests of the investor as well as the public interests of the state. It is thus of little
assistance in the present context.

159. Another consideration, however, is more helpful. While the Tribunal does not benefit
from any travaux préparatoires of the BIT, it notes that other investment treaties
entered into by Israel confirm the meaning of Article 7(c) as it results from the foregoing
analysis. In the Tribunal's view, these other treaties on the same subject matter can be
taken into account as supplementary means of interpretation pursuant to Article 32 of
the VCLT.'4°

160. A number of Israeli BITs contain a provision similar to Article 7(c) of the Treaty.
Interestingly, these BITs clearly indicate that the reference to “investment” and
“reinvestment” is meant in the limited context of the repatriation provisions of the pre-
1992 treaties. This is so for instance of the 1997 Israel-Moldova BIT the pertinent
annex of which reads as follows:

“Taking into consideration the provisions of Article 6 [the repatriation
provision] of the Agreements for the Promotion and Reciprocal

"© This is confirmed by scholars, e.g. A. Aust, Modern Treaty Law and Practice (Cambridge Univ.
Press, 2" Ed., 2007), p.248, and cases, e.g. Asian Agricultural Products Ltd v. Republic of Sri Lanka,
ICSID Case No. ARB 87/3, Final Award, 27 June 1990, 940 .

Protection of Investments entered into by the Government of the
State of Israel with the Governments of Poland, Hungary and
Romania in 1991;

The provisions of Article 3 [the MFN provision] shall not be construed
so as to oblige the State of Israel to extend to investors of the
Republic of Moldova the benefits of any treatment, preference or
privilege resulting from the definitions of ‘investment’ or ‘reinvestment’
and the provisions of Article 6 contained in the [BITs] entered into by
the Government of the State of Israel with the Governments of
Poland, Hungary and Romania in 1991.”"*"

161. The link between investment and repatriation in the pre-1992 treaties is even more
striking in the Israel-Thailand BIT. That treaty contains an Article 7(d) essentially
identical to Article 7(c) of the (Uzbek) BIT.'*? More importantly, the treaty contains an
annex, which explains the rationale behind including Article 7(d):

“In the latter part of 1991 the State of Israel entered into Agreement
for the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments with
Poland, Hungary and Romania.

Since 1991, a process of liberalisation has modified the regulations to
the point where the language of those three agreements no longer

 

reflect the current right of repatriation provided in the regulations.

 

That being the case and in order to avoid the need to constantly
revisit and modify these agreements, the State of Israel has
undertaken negotiations to modify those three agreements by
replacing the language of Article 6 therein with the current Article 6.

' Annex, Exh. RL-109, p.11 (emphasis added). See also 1998 Israel-Croatia BIT, Protocol, Exh. RL-
104, p. 7.
‘4 «The provisions of this Agreement relating to the grant of treatment not less favorable than that

any treatment, preference or privilege by virtue of d) the definition of "investment" (Article 1,
h 1) and the r to "reinvestment" (Article 1, f h 2) and the provisions of Article

The Government of the State of Israel shall notify the Government of
the Kingdom of Thailand when the said agreements will be (modified)
amended so as to render Article 7(d) unnecessary. Upon such
Notification, Article 7(d) shall become null and void.” '“*

. This rationale confirms the Tribunal's understanding of the Israel-Uzbekistan BIT. It is
clear that Article 7(c) of the Treaty is to be limited to the repatriation provisions in the
pre-1992 Israeli BITs. Thus, contrary to what the Claimant suggests, the reference to
“definition of 'investment” in Article 7(c) does not have a life of its own. It is not
independent of the repatriation provisions in the pre-1992 treaties. Quite the opposite:
the intention behind the reference to “definition of ‘investment’ was to limit the
application of the MFN obligation with respect to the repatriation provision in the pre-
1992 treaties.

For these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant cannot rely on Article 3(2)
of the Treaty to avoid the express requirement of compliance with host state law
provided in Article 1(1) of the Treaty. Having reached this conclusion, the Tribunal can
dispense with reviewing whether there exists an implied requirement of compliance
with host State law or with the good faith principle.

3. Scope of the Legality Requirement

164. Article 1(1) of the BIT defines investments as "any kind of assets, implemented in

165.

accordance with the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the
investment is made" (emphasis added). In other words, it contains a legality
requirement, the scope of which is circumscribed in terms of subject-matter (laws and
regulations) and time (the time of implementation). While the former raises no specific
issues in the present context (sub-section (a)), the latter is heavily disputed (sub-
section (b)).

a. Subject Matter of the Legality Requirement

. There is no relevant divergence between the Parties concerning the subject-matter of
the legality requirement. It is not contested that the provisions of Uzbek law prohibiting
corruption fall within the subject-matter scope of the legality requirement contained in

Article 1(1) of the Treaty.'“* The Tribunal agrees with this view. In general, on the basis
of existing case law, it considers that the subject-matter scope of the legality
requirement covers: (i) non-trivial violations of the host State's legal order (Tokios
Tokelés'*®, LESI"*® and Desert Line'*’), (ii) violations of the host State's foreign

investment regime (Saba Fakes'**)

investment (Inceysa'“®, Plama'®, Hamester'®') or to secure profits.'°* There is no

doubt that corruption falls within one or more of these categories.

166. The Tribunal is certainly aware that the Respondent alleges instances of illegal conduct
other than corruption, which other instances may or may not fall within these
categories. In light of the weight that the corruption issue gained in the later part of the
proceedings, the Tribunal will focus its analysis on that type of unlawful behavior. And
in light of the conclusion that it will reach on the corruption defense, it will dispense with
reviewing the other allegations of illegality.

b. Time of the Legality Requirement
i. Respondent’s Position

167. According to the Respondent, Article 1(1) of the BIT uses the word “implemented” to
define the type of investments to which the Treaty’s protections apply. Interpreting this
provision leads to the conclusion that an investor forfeits any right under the BIT in

™ At the January Hearing, the Claimant observed: “if there was proof of corruption here, if there was

specific and credible evidence before this Tribunal, that would be relevant to the question of
jurisdiction in this case” (Tr. 27:1-3).

respect of investments that are “made, carried out, or operated in an unlawful

manner’”.'8°

168. In support of this proposition, the Respondent submits that Article 1(1) uses and

juxtaposes both the words “implemented” and “made” in the same _ sentence,
suggesting that the drafters understood and wished to emphasize the difference in
meaning between these two terms. To the Respondent, “[w]here two words with
overlapping but different meanings appear in the same sentence, they should not be
interpreted synonymously.”"* The proper interpretation of Article 1(1) of the BIT,
therefore, is that the law of the place where the investment is made or established
governs the question of whether the investment has been implemented, i.e., made,
carried out, or operated, legally.

169. Further, the Preamble to the BIT explains that the Contracting Parties desired to

“intensify economic cooperation to the mutual benefit of both countries,” “create
favorable conditions for greater investments,” and “increase prosperity in both states.”
Seen in this wider context, there is no legitimate purpose in protecting investments that
are implemented unlawfully, because such investments do not benefit or otherwise

increase the prosperity of the host State.

170. Moreover, according to the Respondent, Uzbekistan’s concern that foreign investors

171.

153
154

for
155

comply with Uzbekistan’s laws is underscored in its Foreign Investment Law which
emphasizes the foreign investor's duty to comply with Uzbek laws in the following
terms:

“When execut[ing] investment activity on the territory of the Republic of
Uzbekistan, the foreign investor [is obligated] to observe the current legislation of
the Republic of Uzbekistan [and] to pay taxes and effect other payments in
accordance with the legislation of the Republic of Uzbekistan.”'°°

The Respondent also submits that the BIT was made in English, Uzbek, and Hebrew,
all three texts being “equally authentic”, but the English prevailing “[i]n case of
differences in interpretation”. The Uzbek and Hebrew texts of the BIT confirm that the
legality requirement obliges the investor to make and operate its investment lawfully.

The verb in the Uzbek text is “KynnaHunagu,” which translates as “used”. The Hebrew
text contains the word “nn'wn'n” which translates as “applied” or “put to use.” Like
“implemented”, the words “used” and “applied” connote ongoing action: if an
investment must be used or applied in accordance with law, it must be operated in
compliance with law and remain compliant with law.

Finally, the Respondent insists that the Claimant has conceded that the ordinary
meaning of the term “implement” includes both the idea of establishing or making, on
the one hand, and of performing, effecting, executing, or fulfilling, on the other. '*°

In response to the Claimant's reference to the term “implemented” in Article 6(1) of the
Treaty, the Respondent submits that the presence of the word implement in Article 6(1)
does not alter the ordinary meaning of the term in Article 1(1) of the Treaty. Article 6(1)
refers to something in place on a certain day. In that particular context, “implemented”
takes a meaning akin to “made” or “put into effect”. In Article 1(1) of the BIT, the term
“implemented” is used in an entirely different context. There is no “on the day” clause in
Article 1(1) of the BIT, which would suggest that the same interpretation must be given
to the word “implement” in Articles 1(1) and 6 of the BIT. Further, unlike the English
version of the BIT, which uses the term “implemented” in both provisions, the Uzbek
text employs two different words. The Uzbek words used in Article 6(1), “amanra
owupunran,” are the ones that appear in Article 1(1) for the English word “made,” not
for the word “implemented".

In reply to the Claimant's submission that the Respondent's interpretation renders
treaty protection illusory, the latter argues that denial of jurisdiction does not prevent a
tribunal from hearing both jurisdictional and merits arguments together in appropriate
circumstances. In cases in which the legality of the investment is intertwined with the
merits, tribunals may join jurisdiction to the merits. Further, there is no serious risk that
de minimis violations of law could be exploited by a host State as a jurisdictional bar.
Tribunals have rejected the possibility that trivial violations of host State law may bar
jurisdiction.'*” Finally, where (as here) ‘a treaty explicitly limits its protection to
investments established and carried out in accordance with the law, the investor cannot
be heard to complain about having to establish or defend the legality of its
operations.”"®* According to the Respondent, such a requirement is all the more

fundamental here in light of Uzbekistan’s Foreign Investment Law, which requires
foreign investors to observe its laws and comply with contractual undertakings.

For all these reasons, the Respondent concludes that since the Claimant has made
and operated its investment in violation of Uzbek laws, it may not invoke the Treaty’s
protections in respect of its investment. Consequently, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction
over the Claimant's claims.

ii. Claimant’s Position

The Claimant argues that Article 1(1) of the BIT refers only to the establishment of an
investment (not its operation) and that there is no evidence that the establishment of
Uzmetal was illegal.

A careful review to the relevant language shows that the legality requirement in the BIT
focuses on the establishment of the investment. The phrase “implemented in
accordance with the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the
investment is made” in Article 1(1) does not modify the term “investment” but applies to
the word “assets.” The word “implement” is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as
“to complete, perform, carry into effect (a contract, agreement, etc.)”. Consequently,
“[t]he most reasonable interpretation of the language in Article 1(1) [of the BIT] is that
an asset that is “completed,” “performed,” or “carried into effect” in accordance with
local law is an asset that, at a single point in time, has been established according to

local law.”*°

Further, the Claimant submits that the ordinary meaning of the word “implemented” in
Article 1(1) of the BIT, when viewed in context and in light of the object and purpose of
the Treaty, covers all assets established in accordance with local law. Articles 6(1) and
8(1) of the BIT provide important context in this regard.

Referring first to the context, the Claimant points to Article 6(1) of the BIT which
provides that “[eJach Contracting Party, shall, in respect of investments, guarantee to
investors of the other Contracting Parties all the rights and benefits . . . which were in
force on the day the current investment was implemented.” In Article 6, the parties
used the word “implement” to refer to the initiation of an investment at a single point in
time. It would be wrong to assume that the parties intended the word “implemented” to
mean something entirely different in Article 1(1), particularly when “implemented” is
used in both articles to describe an action taken with respect to investments. The

18° Mem. M. 9216.

58

180.

181.

182.

Hebrew text of the Treaty leads to the same conclusion, as there the same word for
“implemented” is used in both Articles 1(1) and 6(1). The Uzbek text does use two
different words in Articles 1(1) and Article 6(1) respectively, “but given the use of
identical terms in the English and Hebrew versions of Articles 1(1) and 6, the most
reasonable interpretation of the Uzbek text is that these words express the same
concept in both Article 1(1) and Article 6.”

In further relation with the context, under Article 8(1) of the BIT, the parties agreed to
submit to arbitration “any legal dispute” arising between a Contracting Party and an
investor of the other Contracting Party “concerning an investment of the latter in the
territory of the former”. Article 8(1) thus applies to “any legal dispute”. It is not limited to
disputes concerning the application of the treaty. If the Respondent's jurisdictional
argument was accepted, it would mean that a tribunal would lack jurisdiction to
consider “any legal dispute” between the parties if the tribunal accepted that the
claimant at any point in time had violated any provision of Uzbek law. This logic, to the
Claimant, is flawed as by following it, “any breach of contract claim between a foreign
investor and any party in Uzbekistan could be used to effectively deny the foreign
investor protection under the BIT, even where that party is not a state actor and the
alleged breach has nothing to do with the state action.”"*' The Claimant submits that
such an interpretation would render the substantive protections under the BIT
meaningless. The Claimant insists that the definition of “investment” in Article 1(1) of
the Treaty should not be interpreted in a manner “that limits consent to jurisdiction and
requires all local law claims to be heard only at the jurisdictional stage of the
proceedings.” ©

Turning then to the object and purpose of the Treaty, the Claimant insists that, contrary
to the Respondent's contention that its interpretation of Article 1(1) of the BIT is in line
with the Preamble of the BIT, Uzbekistan’s interpretation would allow the State to avoid
a hearing on the merits merely by raising violations of its laws perpetrated in the course
of the investment. This is inconsistent with promoting foreign investment, as it renders
a foreign investor’s right to pursue arbitration against the host state illusory.

The Claimant adds that the circumstances surrounding the conclusion of the Treaty
confirm its interpretation of Article 1(1) as a traditional legality clause. The fact that the
definition of investment in the BIT is the same as that in the Israel Model BIT, and that

185.

186.

Israel's policy at the time was to protect as many Israeli investments abroad as
possible, supports an interpretation of “investment” in Article 1(1) in the BIT as all
referring to investments established in accordance with law.

Finally, the Claimant underlines that Uzbekistan has not cited a single case in which a
tribunal denied jurisdiction based on a finding that the investor had violated some local
law in the operation of an investment. Replying to the Respondent’s argument that
“implemented” and “made” being used in the same sentence must have distinct
meanings, the Claimant submits that the only case relied on by the Respondent in this
respect is inapposite, and, in fact, supports the fundamental principle that treaty
language must be interpreted in its context.'®

In connection with the Respondent's reliance on the Uzbek and Israeli versions of the
BIT, the Claimant submits that the words used in Hebrew and Uzbek have a wide
range of potential meanings, “some of which connote an ongoing action and some of
which designate an action at a single moment in time.”'* When the word “implement”
is interpreted in the relevant context, the only logical conclusion is that Article 1(1)
refers to those investments established in accordance with local law.

iii. Analysis

Essentially, the question is whether “implemented” means “established” or “established
and operated”. The Tribunal reaches the conclusion that it means the former for the
following reasons.

First and foremost, one must recall the precise language of Article 1(1) in its relevant
part. Article 1(1) provides that “[t]he term ‘investments’ shall comprise any kind of
assets, implemented in accordance with the laws and regulations” (emphasis added).
The controversial word “implemented” applies to “assets” and not to “investments”.
That wording is consonant with definitions found in many treaties that refer to
investments as “any kind of assets invested”. Without the benefit of travaux
préparatoires showing the contrary, the reader is naturally inclined to assimilate the two
formulas. It indeed comes to mind that the drafters of this BIT may have sought to
avoid the tautology inherent in the usual definition by using a word different from the

Methodology for Calculating Dumping Margins, WT/DS294/R, 31 October 2005).

190.

one they were defining. They may have replaced “invested” by “implemented” for the
sake of good drafting without changing the substance of the definition.

Looking at the ordinary meaning of “implemented”, it is true that the word can mean
“made, carried out, operated, completed, performed, carried out into effect” and the
Parties do not disagree in this respect. But the question is not simply what implement
means but rather what it means in its context in relation to “assets”. When is an asset
“made, carried out into effect, operated, completed”?

Looking to the Hebrew and Uzbek versions to elucidate the ordinary meaning is not
more helpful. The Hebrew word is translated as “applied” and the Uzbek term as
“used”. When affixed to the term “assets”, the first one tends to indicate a one time
action such as established, while the second would rather signify a continuous action
analogous to operate.

By contrast, a review of the context of the term being interpreted provides more
indications. First, as the Claimant points out, Article 6(1) of the Treaty which deals with
repatriation of investment, guarantees to investors “the rights and benefits regarding
the unrestricted transfer of their investments and returns which were in force on the day
the current investment was implemented” (emphasis added). In this phrase, the word
implemented clearly identifies the one-time initial action of establishment. The
Respondent objects that the context is different and, therefore, unhelpful to interpret
the term in Article 1(1). The Tribunal does not find this objection convincing. Indeed,
the language in Article 6(1) undoubtedly demonstrates that the word “implement” can
be used to designate initial establishment at a particular point in time. Similarly, Article
1(2) speaks of “assets invested”, which tends to support the idea that, in the context of
the Treaty, the word “implemented” is used as a synonym for “invested.”

The Respondent has also drawn the Tribunal’s attention to the fact that, in addition to
“implement,” Article 1(1) uses the word “made” (“The term "investments" shall comprise
any kind of assets, implemented in accordance with the laws and regulations of the
Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made” (emphasis added)). It
infers from the use of distinct words that they must necessarily have a different
meaning. The Tribunal cannot follow this argument. Further to the reasons expressed
above, it notes that the word “made” is always juxtaposed to “investment” in the treaty
(e.g. Art. 1(1), 1(2), 1(3), 2(2), 12, 14). It is not employed to characterize assets, which
are said to be “implemented” ((Art. 1(1)) or “invested” (Art. 1(2) and Art. 6 which refers
to “capital invested”). Significantly, as was emphasized above, investments are also

61

191.

192.

193.

194.

195.

deemed “implemented", which tends to confirm that there is no difference of substance
between “implemented” and “made”.

Having followed the textual and contextual approach prescribed by the VCLT to
interpret the meaning of the word “implement” in Article 1(1) of the Treaty, the Tribunal
does not see the need to address the Respondent's argument that the word
“implement” should be interpreted in a manner consistent with Uzbekistan’s foreign
investment laws.

Last, the Tribunal notes that the object of purpose of the Treaty, which also comes into
play in the interpretation under the VCLT, is of no assistance for present purposes. As
it underlined above, the object and purpose is a balanced one that takes into account
both the private interests of the investor and the public interest of the State. It is true
that the Claimant relies on Israel's policy to secure broad protection for its investors.
Even though it reaches a conclusion that is in line with this policy, the Tribunal does so
on other grounds, as it is not persuaded that this policy reflects the common intention
of the Contracting States.

In summary, on the basis of its reading of Article 1(1) taken in its context, the Tribunal
concludes that the term “assets implemented” refers to the time when the investment
was made. In other words, the Treaty requires that the investment must be legal when
it is initially established. Article 1 simply does not address whether or not the
investment must be operated lawfully after it is in place.

4. Key Facts

The Tribunal will now turn to reviewing whether the Claimant's investment in
Uzbekistan was made in compliance with the law at the time when it was established.
Before doing so, however, the Tribunal will set forth the main facts related to corruption
in the present section, and will also address a number of threshold matters relevant to
the assessment of the evidence in the record in sub-section (5). Thereafter, it will
examine whether the investment complied with host state law in sub-section (6) and
then with international law principles and international public policy in sub-section (7),
prior to providing its conclusion in sub-section (8).

According to the Respondent, by promising to pay several individuals to obtain or
influence the Government's approval of its investment project, the Claimant violated

62

Uzbek laws on bribery as well as transnational principles and international public policy
165

prohibiting corruption.
196. In this section, the Tribunal provides an overview of the main facts in the record that it

considers determinative of the outcome of these proceedings. It will revert to them in

more detail where appropriate in connection with the application of the relevant rules.

a. Payment

197. The Tribunal recalls that at the January Hearing, Mr. Rosenberg, the Claimant's
Chairman and CEO, was shown a prospectus issued by the Claimant on 9 May 2005 in
connection with a public financing at that time." The prospectus disclosed that the
Claimant had paid consultants for assistance with the operation of the joint venture in
Uzbekistan, including production and delivery of products. In the course of
examination, Mr. Rosenberg admitted that the Consultants were paid for services other
than those set out in that prospectus. Mr. Rosenberg also conceded that the
Consultants were paid a total of approximately USD 4 million during the period from
2001 to 2007:

“Q. How much money have you paid these gentlemen, and over what
period of time?

A. We paid about $4 million in the span from 2001 until 2007.”"°”

L.-J

“PRESIDENT KAUFMANN-KOHLER: You mentioned, if | took my
notes correctly, that you paid them 4 million from 2001 to 2007. Is that
correct? Can you confirm that?

THE WITNESS: Yes, | can confirm that.”"®*

198. Later, from the Payment Schedule submitted by the Claimant, it emerged that Claimant
had actually paid USD 3.5 million to the Consultants and had paid further sums totalling
USD 900,000 to Mr. Ibragimov.

b. Amounts of Payments
199. The size of the payments made to the Consultants is another striking fact, especially
when seen in connection with the amount of the Claimant's capital investment and in

185 R-PHB 1 440.

185 Exh. R-101.

the local context.'®® The Claimant paid USD 3.5 million to the Consultants'”’ and USD
900,000 to Mr. Ibragimov. By comparison, Resolution No. 15 provided for an initial
capital contribution from Metal-Tech of USD 500,000 or 60,500,000 Uzbek Soum."”!
Subsequently, the Claimant claims to have made an additional capital contribution of
USD 2 million." Moreover, pursuant to Resolution No. 29-F, the value of the Project
was USD 19,398,000.'% Thus, the total payments made by the Claimant to the
Consultants exceeded its initial cash contribution to the venture and amounted to
nearly 20% of the entire project cost. The proportion — or rather the disproportion — is
striking. It is also worth noting that Uzmetal never paid any dividends. '”*

200. When assessing these amounts, one should further bear in mind that the Consultants
were three Uzbek citizens allegedly hired to provide services “on the ground” in
Uzbekistan,'”® where the cost of living is lower than in other countries. For instance,
Mr. Rosenberg testified that Mr. Mikhailov’s salary at Uzmetal was less than USD 100
per month.'” Mr. Mikhailov’s employment contract with Sanavita GmbH, his full-time
employer, similarly provided for a monthly salary of 4,500 Uzbek Soum.'” Yet, for
services rendered to Metal-Tech, Mr. Mikhailov received a “bonus” of USD 5,000 per
month, fifty times his salary from Uzmetal.'”® Similar “bonus” payments were made to
Messrs Sultanov and Chijenok.'”?

201. The appearance created by the high level of the payments is not dispelled by the
reasons which the Claimant puts forward to explain these amounts. The Claimant's
explanation that the Consultants were lobbyists and lobbyists do not work for Uzbek
minimum wage is unhelpful. It was not disputed that Uzbek law does not recognize the

18° In fact, the Claimant's counsel himself admitted that while not “suspiciously high”, “a lot of money”
was indeed paid by Metal-Tech to the Consultants (Tr. 1299:14-18).

° The Tribunal notes that while the Claimant's payment schedule indicates only payments totalling
USD 3,532,689.40 to the Consultants, Mr. Rosenberg later admitted that an additional payment of
USD 30,000 had been made to MPC Tashkent (Tr.1583:1-15). Thus, the total payments made to the
Consultants would be USD 3,562,689.40. Further, an additional payment of USD 240,803.97 to Lacey
International has been contested between the Parties, but is not relevant for the present purposes.
Indeed, whether or not these additional payments were made does nothing to alter the Tribunal’s
findings in respect of the payments of USD 3,562,689.40 which are admitted.

concept of a lobbyist. More important, none of the Consultants was qualified to render
lobbying services. Mr. Rosenberg himself described Mr. Chijenok as “an office man
who advised on administrative issues such as tax and insurance” and who “provided

analytical marketing reports and information on local regulations”'®°

and not principally
as a lobbyist. Similarly, the Claimant did not advance any evidence that Mr. Sultanov or

Mr. Mikhailov was competent to provide lobbying services.

Further, if the Consultants had engaged in lawful lobbying, they would have rendered
their services in a transparent manner — not under consulting contracts shrouded in
secrecy.'*' Payments too could have been made and received directly rather than
through interconnected offshore companies.

. Similarly, for the reasons discussed below (see e.g., J 205, 262), the Tribunal is

unable to follow the Claimant’s next explanation for the large payments made to the
Consultants according to which the work that the Consultants performed extended
back to 1998 and that the Consultants provided “immense assistance”. '®* Witnesses
from the molybdenum industry testified that they had never even heard of Mr. Sultanov
being involved in the industry, and Mr. Mikhailov’s qualifications pertain largely to the
pharmaceutical industry (see e.g., 49212, 343). Indeed, despite repeated requests
(see section IV.B.5(b)), the Claimant was unable to produce any meaningful
contemporaneous documentation establishing that the Consultants did provide
assistance.

c. No Services or Proof of Services

A third fact that caught the Tribunal's particular attention is that the consulting
agreements required payments to be made to the Consultants irrespective of services
provided. For instance, under the 15 December 2000 contract (pursuant to which the
Claimant paid about USD 2.4 million to MPC'®’), Mr. Rosenberg testified that “none of
the consultants had to prove any documents or supply any documents to the
services.”'** Similarly, under the three contracts executed between the Claimant and
each of the three Consultants in 2004 (pursuant to which the Claimant paid USD

18° Rosenberg WS Ill 18.

‘8! Most of the consulting contracts prohibited disclosure of their contents. See for e.g., the contract
dated 15 December 2000 (Exh. C-221) which provided that MPC was to “treat any information related
to this agreement but also to further contracts which may result, as fully secret and confidential.”

95,000 each to Messrs Chijenok and Sultanov, and USD 105,000 to Mr. Mikhailov’),
Mr. Rosenberg admitted that “we didn’t ask for any proof of services”’®*. He further
conceded that “[the Consultants] didn’t have any documents supporting any services...
because it wasn’t required.”'®” Further, for the payments made under the contracts with
MPC Tashkent (pursuant to which the Claimant paid USD 90,000 to MPC Tashkent'®),
the Claimant was unable to establish any link between the payments and any services.

205. The documents which the Claimant produced in an effort to establish “the types of

services provided by [the Consultants]”"®* do not support the submission that legitimate
services were rendered by the Consultants since 1998. First, most of the services
evidenced by these documents were services which could only be performed after
2000, when Uzmetal was established. For instance, services such as assistance with
standard certifications, '® hiring of guards, '*' getting VAT exemptions’, could only be
performed once Uzmetal was operational. Indeed, Mr. Rosenberg himself admitted that
some of these documents concerned services rendered after Uzmetal was
established. ‘°° Second, some of the documents are either undated,’ or are dated
much after 1998.'%> The only exception to this is the letter of 30 July 1998 written by
Mr. Rosenberg to Messrs Ibragimov and Mikhailov, ‘°° which Mr. Rosenberg conceded

does not concern Uzmetal.'*”

206. Among other requests for evidence, the Tribunal specifically invited the Claimant in PO

10 to specify the services rendered in return for each payment to the Consultants. For
each payment, the Tribunal asked Metal-Tech to explain “[w]hat service was the
payment intended to remunerate.” The Claimant failed to provide this information,
accepting that “[t]he nature of the contracts were such that Metal-Tech cannot provide
the Tribunal with a detailed chart of the information requested.”'®

In this context, the Tribunal notes with concern the Claimant's repeated failure to
provide evidence justifying the services rendered by the Consultants in return for their
substantial compensation. Although the Claimant had several opportunities to do so,
and was on notice that the evidence requested would be of importance to the
Tribunal’s determination, it was nonetheless unable to establish that the Consultants
actually performed any legitimate services for the Claimant at the time of establishment
of the Claimant's investment.

d. Lack of Qualification of the Consultants

As a fourth factor, it struck the Tribunal that none of the Consultants possessed any
professional qualification to perform the services for which they were allegedly
retained. According to the Claimant, the Consultants were hired to provide “the same
services that Washington lobbyists provide every day.”'®? Further, Mr. Rosenberg
testified that the “main thing” of interest to Metal-Tech was that the Consultants had
been dealing in the molybdenum industry prior to being involved with Uzmetal.2°° He
also alleged that the Consultants provided assistance on technical and financial
matters. The contracts entered into with the Consultants provided that the Consultants

were to “perform marketing investigations in ... Uzbekistan”,”°' “perform negotiations

with the Uzbek experts and different organizations”,*” “give the consulting services
concerned with application of the legislation and statutory acts”.°° A review of the
qualifications of the Consultants demonstrates, however, that they lacked the
necessary background to perform such services. None of them had any prior

experience with the molybdenum industry, much less technical credentials in that field.

At the time of the establishment of the Claimant's investment, Mr. Chijenok was
responsible for human resources functions at the Office of the President of
Uzbekistan,” with responsibilities such as examining the qualifications of applicants
for vacancies.” This hardly qualifies Mr. Chijenok to assist with technical and financial
matters. He lacked any prior experience in the molybdenum industry, or indeed in any

field other than government administration, as Mr. Rosenberg later admitted.?° It is
therefore more than surprising that the Claimant employed him to “explain the basic

tendencies and directions of economic policy of Uzbekistan’”>”

and “to perform
negotiations with Uzbek experts”.*° It is also surprising that, in the absence of relevant
qualifications, the Claimant paid USD 95,000 to Mr. Chijenok personally, plus his
shares in the USD 2,492,908 paid to the MPC Companies and the USD 774,781 paid
to Lacey International (designated as payee by the Consultants under the consultancy

agreement of 28 February 2005).

210. Similar observations apply to Mr. Sultanov. Mr. Sultanov was a police investigator who

retired after achieving the rank of Police Colonel; he had not worked in any capacity
since April 1992.?"° Despite the Claimant's allegations that Mr. Sultanov was retained
to provide lobbying services,”"' the Claimant failed to produce any evidence that he
was qualified to do so. Moreover, Deputy Minister Kanyazov testified that Mr. Sultanov
was not and had never been listed in any of the State registries for providing advocacy
or tax consulting services.*"? His testimony was not rebutted.

211. Further, despite initially testifying that only Mr. Sultanov worked in the molybdenum

206

industry, Mr. Rosenberg himself later admitted that he had only heard of Mr. Sultanov's
experience and did not know and never asked whether Mr. Sultanov was an engineer,
a metallurgist, or had any other expertise relevant to the Claimant’s investment.?"*
There is no evidence on record that Mr. Sultanov had any experience in the
molybdenum industry. It is therefore again difficult to understand that the Claimant
employed him to “advise by preparation of the necessary documentation, elaboration of
the feasibility studies”;?"* “to perform negotiations with the Uzbek experts”.’" It is
equally surprising that, despite his lack of qualifications, Mr. Sultanov received
substantial amounts: USD 95,000 was paid to him personally plus his shares in the
USD 2,492,908 paid to the MPC Companies and the USD 774,781 paid to Lacey

International (designated as payee by the Consultants under the consultancy

agreement of 28 February 2005*"*). The only possible basis for such payments to Mr.
Sultanov, it seems to the Tribunal, would have been his relationship to the Prime
Minister of Uzbekistan, which is discussed below.

212. Finally, as to Mr. Mikhailov, he himself denied having performed many of the services
the Claimant alleges he rendered.?"” He also admitted that he was not qualified to
perform some these services.?"® Mr. Mikhailov’s qualifications pertain largely to the
pharmaceutical industry. For instance, Mr. Mikhailov had held a position as
pharmaceutical science advisor at Hoechst AG, Germany. When he started as the
Claimant’s consultant, he was the Head of the Representative Office of Sanavita
GmbH of Germany.?"° In fact, before it referred to Mr. Mikhailov as “consultant to
Metal-Tech Ltd. and a senior member of the Uzmetal management team”,””° Metal-
Tech itself had downplayed Mr. Mikhailov’s importance, relying on his testimony where
he had described himself as “a manager of a newspaper business in Uzbekistan.”*”" In

sum, the Tribunal finds that Mr. Mikhailov was largely unqualified to provide the

consulting services that the Claimant alleges he provided. Here again, although
unqualified for the task, Mr. Mikhailov was paid USD 105,000 personally plus his
shares in the USD 2,492,908 paid to the MPC Companies and the USD 774,781 paid
to Lacey International (designated as payee by the Consultants under the consultancy
agreement of 28 February 2005”).

e. Sham Consulting Contracts

213. Since the analysis is limited to events surrounding the establishment of the Claimant’s
investment ({193 above), the Tribunal does not deem it necessary to review each of
the consulting contracts. Rather, the Tribunal will focus on the December 2000
Contract between the Claimant and MPC, which, by its own terms, refers to past
activities including the preparation of the Feasibility Studies.””*

214. The December 2000 Contract was the first written contract between the Claimant and
MPC. Under this contract, MPC undertook a wide range of obligations, which are
described as follows:

"2.1 MPC has taken and will take the following obligations:

2.1.1 MPC and its management will negotiate and coordinate all matters
related to Uzbekistan Government and/or official bodies.

2.1.2 To perform marketing investigations in the Republic of Uzbekistan in the
interest of Metek and to provide Metek with all information concerning prices
as received by the Uzbek Partner from competitors, supporting assistance
during all negotiations which have resulted in the optimal conditions for ‘the
contract' as well as local action to secure timely and full financial settlement of
‘the Contract and other contracts related thereto.

2.1.3 MPC has fully participated in the preparation of the Feasibility Studies
which form an integral basis for ‘the contract’ and other agreements related
thereto.

2.1.4 To keep providing Metek with all relevant information on the legal and
economical implication of 'the contract’ and agreements related thereto, in
accordance with Uzbek legislation.

2.1.5 To inform Metek full details of any payment made by the Uzbek Partner
under ‘the contract’ within 2 days after any transfer made by the Uzbek
Partner.

2.1.6 To advise of any change of regulations and/or activities, which may
jeopardize Uzmetal's and/or Metek's interest in Uzbekistan.”

215. Metal-Tech’s obligation was to pay “consultancy fees” or “commissions” to MPC
whenever debt was repaid by the “Uzbek Partner” in amounts specified in Annex |
totalling USD 3,226,000 (later updated in Annex I(a) to USD 3,032,883).”° The
December 2000 Contract would be cancelled if the performance of the EPC Contract
stopped.” Finally both parties to the December 2000 Contract agreed to keep any
information related to the contract “fully secret and confidential”.”””

216. Several elements in the December 2000 Contract attract the Tribunal's attention:

(i

) First, neither Mr. Sultanov nor Mr. Mikhailov (who allegedly required the
Claimant to enter into the contract with MPC) was qualified to fulfill most of the
“obligations” listed in the contract. For instance, while the Contract provides that
“MPC has fully participated in the Feasibility Studies”, the Tribunal has found

24 Exh. C-221, Art. 2.1.

5 Exh. C-221, Art. 2.2.
8 Exh. C-221, Art. 3.3.

7 Exh. C-221, Art. 2.3.

228

ti)

that neither Mr. Mikhailov nor Mr. Sultanov had the qualifications to do so (see
e.g., 4209-212). In fact, Mr. Mikhailov specifically denied that he prepared or
assisted with preparing the Claimant's feasibility studies, and added that he,
“like Mr. Sultanov and Mr. Chijenok, did not have this expertise.”””® Thus, the
obligations provided in the December 2000 Contract appear to be nothing more
than a smokescreen — neither MPC, nor Messrs Sultanov or Mikhailov were
qualified to fulfill the obligations assumed through in the contract. Nor, for that
matter, was Mr. Chijenok (the Tribunal has established that Mr. Chijenok was
involved in the Project since 1998; see 4312-319).

Second, under the December 2000 Contract, Metal-Tech was to make periodic
payments to MPC. These payments were not contingent on the fulfilment of the
obligations listed in the contract. In effect, the payments were “automatic” and
their amount was predetermined: once Uzmetal received monies from Bank
Leumi, on receipt of invoices from MPC, payments were due within ten days.
MPC was not required to provide proof of services to receive payment. Mr.
Rosenberg confirmed this understanding at the hearing:

“Q. But the three consultants did not have to submit any evidence of their
performance to obtain the payment under Annex 1 of the December 2000. It
was, as you testified, the success of the venture.

A. The Agreement, as you saw it, doesn't require any supporting document to
their service.“

Led

“A. As | said in the Agreement of December 2000, none of the consultants had
to prove any documents or supply any documents to the services.””*°

(iii) Third, the Claimant was unable to show that any services were actually

rendered in return for the payments. For instance, in support of its submission
that Mr. Mikhailov assisted in the preparation of the Feasibility Study, Mr.
Rosenberg initially relied on a letter of 13 January 1998. However, as he later
admitted, the feasibility study contemplated in the letter was not for the Uzmetal
project.*" Additionally, although the Draft Feasibility Study and the Revised
Feasibility Study list the various individuals involved in their preparation, none of

71

the Consultants is mentioned.”” The Claimant's inability to produce convincing
evidence is reviewed later in this award and the Tribunal refers to that review
(section IV.B.5(b)).

217. This said, it is true that the Claimant has produced some documents that, according to
it, “[are] illustrative of the types of services provided by [the Consultants].”*°? Some of
these documents, according to the Claimant, establish that the Consultants actually
carried out activities under the December 2000 Contract. The Tribunal finds it difficult to
agree with this position. Indeed, for the reasons mentioned (4205, 262), the Tribunal
has found that none of the documents on which the Claimant relies (whether under the
December 2000 Contract or otherwise) convincingly show that the Consultants
rendered any legitimate services at the time of establishment of the Claimant's
investment.

218. For all these reasons, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the December 2000
Contract cannot be regarded as a genuine agreement and must be deemed a sham
designed to conceal the true nature of the relationship among the parties to it.

f. Lack of Transparency of Payee

219. Another troubling circumstance lies in the lack of transparency of the Consultants’
payment arrangements. The Payment Schedule produced by the Claimant evidences
that less than 8% of the payments were made to the Consultants directly. The balance,
more than 92%, was paid to companies established in Switzerland (MPC), Tashkent
(MPC Tashkent) and the British Virgin Islands (Lacey International).”*

220. The Consultant's company, MPC, was established in Switzerland on 20 July 1998.%%°
Its major shareholders were B.V. Chemie Pharmacie Holland in Amsterdam (“CPH”)
and Bordeaux Intertrade Inc. (“Bordeaux”) of Tortola, which each owned 45% of MPC’s
shares.*°° Bordeaux was a BVI company incorporated on 9 June 1998.”°’ The founders

of Bordeaux were Messrs Chijenok, Mikhailov and Sultanov, each of whom held one
third of the shares.?%°

The Claimants paid more than USD 2.4 million to MPC. No cogent reason was given
why payments to the Consultants were made through a Swiss company in which the
Consultants’ ownership interest was concealed by the use of a BVI holding company.
Mr. Rosenberg testified that payments by the Claimant to Switzerland did not arouse
suspicion because “[w]e were working with many Swiss companies, and Switzerland is
a safe place to work.”*° This explanation hardly dispels the troubling impression
created by these payment arrangements. There is no reason why three Uzbek
nationals (Messrs Chijenok, Mikhailov and Sultanov) rendering services to an Israeli
company (Metal-Tech) in respect of a joint venture in Uzbekistan (Uzmetal) should be
paid through a company established in a wholly unrelated country. Further, it is not
disputed that, although MPC is registered in Switzerland, it does not have a physical
presence there. Rather, the registered address for MPC is that of a service company,
Henley & Partners Trust Company (Switzerland) AG.2"°

The case is the same with respect to Bordeaux. Bordeaux was incorporated on 9 June
1998 in the BVI.“" It appears to have only a mailing address, but no physical presence
in the BVI. The Claimant's only objection — that the document relied on by the
Respondent to establish that Messrs Chijenok, Mikhailov and Sultanov were the
founders of Bordeaux was dated April 2009, which is much later than the establishment
of Bordeaux in 1998 — seems immaterial. The fact remains that the Consultants (or, at
least, Messrs Sultanov and Chijenok) used off-shore companies to route payments in
respect of services allegedly rendered in Uzbekistan.

As for Lacey International, it was established in 2003 in Tortola, BVI. Lacey and
Bordeaux had the same registered address, i.e. c/o Overseas Management Company
Trust (BVI) Ltd. at P.O. Box 3152, Road Town, Tortola, BVI.° Lacey was
administratively dissolved in 2010.24

224. The Claimant paid USD 774,781 to Lacey. As in the case of MPC, Mr. Rosenberg
testified that he knew nothing about Lacey’s shareholding structure or what was done
with payments made to Lacey.*“° He also said that he did not suspect corruption.”“*

g. Connections with Public Officials in Charge of Claimant’s Investment

225. While the Consultants lacked obvious qualifications to advise the Claimant about the
molybdenum industry, two of them had significant connections with Uzbek Government
officials responsible for the approval, establishment and operation of the Claimant's
investment. One of the Consultants, Mr. Chijenok, worked in the Office of the President
of Uzbekistan. His responsibilities included examining candidates to head various
ministries and Government departments. Thus, besides being himself a government
official, Mr. Chijenok obviously had contacts with other officials in the Uzbek
Government. He was in a position to influence appointments of candidates to official
positions. At the January Hearing, when asked whether he knew that Mr. Chijenok was
working in the Office of the President, Mr. Rosenberg replied: “I know that he was
working in a high position in an official position [...]”.”7 These facts were later
corroborated by Mr. Mikhailov.”* Indeed, in 1997, it was Mr. Chijenok’s office that
requested Prime Minister Sultanov’s opinion on the Claimant’s proposed investment in
Uzbekistan.

226. Another Consultant, Mr. Sultanov, was the brother of the Prime Minister of Uzbekistan,

who had the delegated authority to monitor and oversee the Claimant's investment.”

The Prime Minister was also the official in charge of the establishment and operation of
Uzmetal.®' Here too, the Claimant admitted that, because Mr. Sultanov was the
brother of the Prime Minister, one of the “main figures”, Mr. Sultanov had a “very good
network”? and a “very good connection with different Government bodies”.*® In fact,
Mr. Rosenberg explained frankly that Mr. Sultanov’s brother “was the Prime Minister at

the time, so it really was one of the persons that could facilitate closing red tapes when
the [Uzmetal] was initiated.”*5*

The Tribunal finds it significant that Metal-Tech made its last payments to both of the
entities controlled by the Consultants, MPC and Lacey, in April 2006, the very month
when President Karimov dismissed Mr. Sultanov’s brother from his then position as
Deputy Prime Minister.”°

5. Factors Relevant to the Assessment of Evidence
a. Burden and Standard of Proof

The Parties disagree on the applicable burden and standard of proof. While the
Respondent submits that the burden is on the Claimant to establish the absence of
corruption and that corruption may be proved through prima facie or circumstantial
evidence, the Claimant submits that the Respondent must prove corruption through
“clear and convincing evidence”.

i. Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that the evidence in this case gives rise to a strong
presumption that the Claimant engaged in corruption. It further submits that the
Claimant has the burden of proving the facts necessary to support a finding of
jurisdiction. In light of the inherent difficulty in proving claims of corruption due to the
tendency of the parties involved to conceal evidence, as numerous tribunals have
recognized, the Claimant should have the burden to rebut the presumption and to
produce evidence to explain its payments of more than USD 4.4 million in alleged
consulting fees.*° In fact, according to the Respondent, this was the rationale behind
the Tribunal’s POs Nos. 3, 7, and 10 which directed the Claimant to produce evidence
to demonstrate that the Consultants rendered legitimate services in return for the
payments made by the Claimant. The Respondent submits that, by failing without any
credible explanation to produce evidence that the Tribunal deemed relevant and
material to the resolution of the Respondent's corruption defense, the Claimant has

failed to discharge its burden of proof and, therefore, the Tribunal should draw the
conclusion that the Claimant agreed to pay and did pay kickbacks to Government
Officials.’ Tribunals in Feldman and Europe Cement drew strong inferences from
similar non-production of documents that those tribunals directed to be produced.7°

230. In the alternative, the Respondent submits that certain facts are inherently difficult to
prove. Therefore, the Party alleging such facts may sustain its burden of proof through

prima facie evidence,

ie. evidence which if “unexplained or uncontradicted, is
sufficient to maintain the proposition affirmed.” A party alleging a fact may satisfy its
burden of proof through prima facie evidence where, as here, the other party has
control of the relevant evidence but has failed to produce it to respond to the

allegations against it.

231. Further in the alternative, the Respondent relies on AAPL v. Sri Lanka, to conclude that
international tribunals are “not bound to adhere to strict judicial rules of evidence”, but
rather have “free evaluation of evidence.” It also refers to Oostergetel v. The Slovak
Republic, where it was held that, regardless of the standard of proof, corruption may be
proved by circumstantial evidence.”°'

232. The Respondent challenges the Claimant’s submission that the appropriate standard of
proof for allegations of corruption is “clear and convincing evidence or more.”
According to the Respondent, several ICSID tribunals have noted the uncertainty of the
standard of proof for allegations of serious illegality. Some have required proof that the
allegation is “more likely than not to be true.”*©? Finally, the Respondent submits that in
this case “there is no need to apply burden shifting principles’, because Mr.

Rosenberg’s testimony and statements against interest “are decisive evidence” that the
Claimant engaged in corrupt practices.”

ii. Claimant’s Position

. According to the Claimant, the burden of proving all of the Respondent's objections and

defenses rests on the latter. The Respondent must prove its corruption allegations by
clear and convincing evidence or more.

The Claimant submits that a party alleging corruption or fraud bears a particularly
heavy burden: “[T]here is general consensus among international tribunals and
commentators regarding the need for a high standard of proof of corruption.”*°* Most
municipal legal systems apply a high burden of evidence in respect of allegations of
corruption and fraud. According to the Claimant, “[a]n over-readiness by international
arbitrators to accept illegality defenses may harm an international mechanism which
benefits numerous countries that rely on access to international funding, technology

and trade.”?°°

The Claimant submits that there is no precedent in investor-state arbitration supporting
the Respondent's argument that a prima facie showing of potential misconduct shifts
the burden to the Claimant “to demonstrate that its payments were legitimate and not
for corrupt purposes”.*° For the Claimant, the cases cited by the Respondent are
inapposite as none of them considered whether the burden of proof could be shifted for
allegations of corruption or fraud.?°”

iii. Analysis

The Parties diverge considerably on burden and standard of proof to sustain an
allegation of corruption. Put simply, according to the Claimant, as the allegation of
corruption was made by the Respondent, the Respondent bears the burden of proof.
Further, given the seriousness of the allegations raised, the appropriate standard of

proof is “clear and convincing evidence or more.” On the contrary, the Respondent
submits that the Claimant has the burden of proving the facts necessary to support a
finding of jurisdiction and that the standard of proof of serious illegality is that the
allegation is “more likely than not to be true.”

As a general matter, since the claims brought in this arbitration seek to establish the
responsibility of a State for breach of the latter's international obligations, it is
appropriate to apply international law to the burden of proof. The principle that each
party has the burden of proving the facts on which it relies is widely recognised and
applied by international courts and tribunals. The International Court of Justice as well
as arbitral tribunals constituted under the ICSID Convention and under the NAFTA
have characterized this rule as a general principle of law.”°* Consequently, as reflected
in the maxim actori incumbat probatio, each party has the burden of proving the facts
on which it relies.

Here, the question is whether for allegations of corruption, the burden should be shifted
to the Claimant to establish that there was no corruption. Rules establishing
presumptions or shifting the burden of proof under certain circumstances, or drawing
inferences from a lack of proof are generally deemed to be part of the /ex causae. In
the present case, the /ex causae is essentially the BIT, which provides no rules for
shifting the burden of proof or establishing presumptions. Therefore, the Tribunal has
relative freedom in determining the standard necessary to sustain a determination of
corruption. Both Parties subscribe to this view: both have relied on case law to
convince the Tribunal that their respective positions — a high standard advocated by the
Claimant and a low standard advocated by the Respondent — should be adopted.

While the debate about standards of proof and presumptions is an interesting one, the
Tribunal finds that it does not require the application of the rules on burden of proof or
presumptions to resolve the present dispute. In this case, facts emerged in the course
of the arbitration. Because those facts raised suspicions of corruption, the Tribunal
required explanations.

At the January Hearing, Mr. Rosenberg admitted that sums of about USD 4 million had
been paid to the Consultants.”°° He also admitted that the 2005 consulting agreement
was an amendment or replacement of earlier agreements that had been in place since

art

1998.°”° Further, it was contended that the Consultants were primarily engaged in
“lobbying” activities.?”' These facts were not alleged by the Respondent; they emerged
during the Hearing in the course of the examination of the Claimant's principal witness.

The payment of such substantial sums having been admitted, the Tribunal considered
it its duty to inquire about the reasons for such payment. First, at the January Hearing
itself, the Tribunal observed that, given the disclosure of facts unknown until then, it
needed more information from the Parties. In the exercise of its ex officio powers under
Article 43 of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal therefore invited the Parties in PO 7 to
provide that information. In PO 10, the Tribunal once again exercised its ex officio
powers to call for additional testimony and evidence.

A similar situation arose in World Duty Free v. Kenya. There, an ICSID arbitral tribunal
was called on to decide a claim brought against Kenya for not fulfilling an agreement
for the construction, maintenance and operation of duty free complexes at Nairobi and
Mombasa airports. Kenya argued that the agreement had been procured by paying a
bribe to the then President of Kenya, and, therefore, that the agreement was illegal and
could not be enforced. The CEO of the Claimant himself admitted that he had handed
over the equivalent of USD 2 million in cash to the President and others. The World
Duty Free tribunal (as the Tribunal did here) invited the parties to present additional

submissions and evidence on the issue of corruption.”

Faced with these
circumstances, the World Duty Free tribunal noted that “this is not a case which turns
on legal presumptions, statutory deeming provisions or different standards of proof [...].

Indeed the decisive evidential materials came from the Claimant itself.”

As in World Duty Free, the present factual matrix does not require the Tribunal to resort
to presumptions or rules of burden of proof where the evidence of the payments came
from the Claimant and the Tribunal itself sought further evidence of the nature and
purpose of such payments. Instead, the Tribunal will determine on the basis of the
evidence before it whether corruption has been established with reasonable certainty.
In this context, it notes that corruption is by essence difficult to establish and that it is
thus generally admitted that it can be shown through circumstantial evidence.?”

b. Claimant’s Failure to Substantiate Services Rendered by the Consultants

Parties to an arbitration have a good faith obligation to cooperate in procedural matters.
In relation to the production of evidence, this duty is expressed in Rule 34(3) of the
ICSID Arbitration Rules in the following terms:

“(3) The Parties shall cooperate with the Tribunal in the

production of evidence [...]. The Tribunal shall take formal note

of the failure of a party to comply with its obligations under this

paragraph and of any reasons given for such failure” (emphasis

added).
Further, Article 9(5) of the 2010 IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International
Arbitration, to which the Tribunal may look for guidance pursuant to the Minutes of the
First Session, provides that “[i]f a Party fails without satisfactory explanation to produce
any Document ... ordered to be produced by the Arbitral Tribunal, the Arbitral Tribunal
may infer that such document would be adverse to the interests of that Party.” It follows
that the Tribunal may draw appropriate inferences from a party's non-production of
evidence ordered to be provided. In a number of cases, tribunals have indeed stated
that they would draw inferences from non-production.?”°

Faced with the admission at the hearing that substantial payments had been made, the
Tribunal sought to understand what services these payments were intended to
compensate. By doing so, it meant in particular to give the Claimant an opportunity to
substantiate the reality and legitimacy of the services for which payments were made.
The Claimant, however, was unable to provide that substantiation. This section outlines
the Tribunal's requests for evidence and the Claimant's failure to comply with those
requests.

At the January Hearing, three facts came to light of which the Tribunal had previously
been unaware: (i) the February 2005 Consulting Agreement between Metal-Tech and
the Consultants was an amendment to or a replacement of earlier agreements that had
been in place since 1998; (ii) the Consultants were primarily or exclusively engaged in
what was described as “lobbyist activity” rather than in the activities set out at page 107
of Exhibit R-101, namely, assistance with the operation, production, and delivery of the
joint venture’s products; and (iii) the Consultants had been paid approximately USD 4
million. Consequently, the Tribunal indicated, at the close of the January Hearing, that

2”8 See Waste Management v. Mexico II (Additional Facility), Award, 30 April 2004, 30;also Europe
Cement 4152.

80

it would order the Parties to produce additional information and documents, which
would be reflected in a procedural order to be issued after the hearing.

248. Accordingly, the Tribunal issued PO 7 on 10 February 2012, inviting the Claimant to
produce four categories of information and documents, as follows:

“(a) The February 2005 Consulting Agreement, as well as any earlier
agreements whether formal or informal among (i) Metal-Tech, Ltd.
and/or any affiliate of Metal-Tech, Ltd. and (ii) the Consultants, any
MPC company, and/or any other person who may have been the
recipient of payments forming part of the U.S.$4,000,000 [paid to the
Consultants];

(b) A schedule listing all of the payments made to the Consultants,
any MPC company, and/or any person who may have been the
recipient of payments forming part of the U.S.$4,000,000 [paid to the
Consultants];

(c) Any invoices that exist with respect to [the payments of
U.S.$4,000,000 to the Consultants]; and

(d) Any other documents supporting the information in the schedule
referred to [...] above.”

249. In response to a request made by the Claimant at the January Hearing, PO 7 also
allowed the Claimant to indicate the positions held by each of the Consultants during
the respective time periods as well as the persons in office as Prime Minister from 1998
onwards. The Claimant did not submit this information.

250. The Claimant subsequently proposed to limit its production of the four categories of
information contemplated by PO 7. In particular, the Claimant proposed to produce:
“|, Unredacted copies of any consulting contracts with MPC;

ii. Copies of any consulting contracts with specific individuals, with the
names of individuals redacted. Mr. Daly would confirm that the
redactions cover only the names of Consultants (as defined in
Procedural Order No. 7); and

iii. A schedule of payments, with the names of individuals and their
banking information redacted, and all other information being
produced.”

251. In PO 8, dated 13 March 2012, the Tribunal clarified the information required to be
produced by the Claimant under the terms of PO 7 as follows:

“34. In the Tribunal’s view, insofar as it is not meant to be exclusive,
Claimant's proposed production of unredacted copies of consulting
contracts with MPC, accords with the terms of Procedural Order No.
7. Accordingly, the Tribunal is not required to make any determination
in that respect.

35. Claimant’s proposal regarding the copies of consulting contracts
with specific individuals with the names of the individuals redacted,

81

however, merits further consideration. It is clear from the Parties’
submissions that different people were involved in the Claimant's
investment at different times. So far, it appears that all of Mr.
Ibragimov, Mr. Sultanov, Mr. Chijenok, and Mr. Mikhailov may have
played a role. In the Tribunal’s view, in order for the Respondent to
sustain its corruption defence, it would be necessary for the
Respondent to match the individuals that were “consulted” with the
services that they provided. Each of these individuals may have
provided different services at different points in time. Therefore, each
case may require a specific, tailor-made defence, for which the
Respondent would need all of the necessary details of the relevant
payments. Merely providing the contracts (while redacting the names
of the individuals) would not enable the Respondent to develop its
corruption defence. Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects Claimant's
proposal with respect to this item.

L.-J
37. In the view of the Tribunal, for the purposes of the present
production, the Claimant may be allowed to redact from the schedule
of payments, information regarding “the bank account sending and
the bank account receiving the money.” For the purposes of this
arbitration, the Tribunal believes that it would be sufficient to know (a)
the date on which the payments were made; (b) the amount paid; and
(c) who paid whom. Per se, the bank account numbers would not
further the resolution of the relevant issues in this case. The Tribunal
is sensitive to the Respondent's submission that the Claimant’s
consultants may have worked as conduits to transmit payments to
others. However, even if this were to be true, the Tribunal does not
see how the disclosure of bank account numbers would aid the
Respondent's case. The Respondent may have an interest in
ascertaining the bank account numbers (such as for their possible
use in criminal proceedings), but this cannot be grounds for
disclosure in the present proceeding. The Tribunal is also aware that
in Procedural Orders Nos. 3 and 5, it directed disclosure of banking
details, including bank account information. However, disclosure
there was in respect of Mr. Ibragimov, who, inter alia, was the
Claimant's representative and Uzmetal’s General Director for a period
of two years from January 2000 to January 2002. None of Messrs
Sultanov, Chijenok, or Mikhailov, whose banking details are now
requested to be disclosed, have any similarly close connection with
the Claimant (Mr. Sultanov was the brother of the former Prime
Minister of Uzbekistan, Mr. Chijenok was a former official in the
Uzbek administration, and Mr. Mikhailov was the Deputy General
Director for Government Relations of Uzmetal).

38. In light of the Tribunal’s determination above, and for the sake of
clarity, the Tribunal directs the Claimant by Friday, 16 March, 2012, to
provide the schedule contemplated in Procedural Order No. 7
containing the following information: (i) the payments made to each of
the Consultants; (ii) the dates on which payments were made; and (c)
who paid whom."

252. As the information provided following PO 7 and PO 8 was still inconclusive, the
Tribunal made another attempt to obtain the relevant evidence. In PO 10, dated 17

82

April 2012, the Tribunal once again exercised its ex officio powers and made the
following observations:

“71. As regards...documents reflecting the amount paid to each
Consultant through the MPC companies and Lacey International, the
Tribunal believes that it would benefit from knowing the amounts paid
to (as well as the services rendered by (see below)) each Consultant.
As regards the MPC Companies, the contracts signed by them with
the Claimant have been disclosed. The Respondent is thus aware of
the services which were to be provided by these companies and the
total cost of these services. However, the amounts paid to each
individual Consultant have not been disclosed. A similar position
exists in respect of payments made to Lacey International. The
Tribunal believes that knowledge of the amounts received by each
individual Consultant may aid the Tribunal in coming to a conclusion
about the Respondent's corruption defence (for example, if
substantial payments have been made to one Consultant, then the
services rendered by that Consultant, the period at which those
services were rendered, etc., would deserve greater scrutiny). The
Tribunal notes the Claimant's submission that it does not have
possession, custody, or control of MPC’s documents or Lacey
International's documents. While the Tribunal has, for this reason, not
confined its request for further information to documents, the Tribunal
finds it difficult to understand how this would affect the Claimant's
ability to make the additional disclosure contemplated by this Order.
Payments may have been made to the MPC Companies or Lacey
International, but the Claimant should have some record or
knowledge of the services rendered by each individual Consultant
and the payment made (to these entities on behalf of that Consultant)
in consideration for that service.

73. Nonetheless, the Tribunal believes that it would benefit from
knowing (a) the nature of the service provided, (b) which Consultant
provided the service, and (c) when the service was provided. As the
Tribunal recognised in Procedural Order No. 8 above (albeit in a
different context), different individuals may have been involved at
different times in providing different services. The Claimant, which
received these services and paid for them, should be aware of the
individuals who provided them. The Claimant's submission that it
does not have possession, custody, or control of MPC’s documents
or Lacey International's documents is beside the point, for the
reasons explained in 71 above. Details of the nature of the services
rendered, by whom, and when should be within the knowledge of the
Claimant. The Tribunal does not request production of documents
from these companies; rather it directs the Claimant to specify the
nature of the services rendered, by whom, and when.

74. Additionally, the Tribunal believes that it would be prudent to
invite the Claimant to substantiate its submission that services were
rendered by the Consultants. The Claimant has disclosed that
payments of US$ 3,532,689.40 were made for services, but the
Claimant has neither substantiated the nature of the services nor that
these services were actually rendered. The Tribunal notes that
several contracts produced by the Claimant themselves require the
concerned entity “immediately to inform ‘M-T’ about the work and

83

253.

254.

255.

services executed in its interests” and also require the Claimant “to
instruct regularly [the entity concerned] about the required works and
services” (see, e.g., Ex. CE-223, 9 2.5, 3.1; Ex. CE-224, 9§ 2.5, 3.1;
Ex. CE-225, QQ 2.5, 3.1; Ex. CE-226, 9 2.1.6, 2.2.1). Relevant
contemporaneous documents (including those contemplated by the
contracts as described above) substantiating the Claimant's
submission that services were rendered by the Consultants would
assist the Tribunal in reaching a conclusion regarding the
Respondent's corruption defence” (emphasis added).

The Claimant was thus put on notice that: (i) if substantial payments were made to one
Consultant, then the services rendered by that Consultant would deserve greater
scrutiny; (ii) it was expected that the Claimant should have some record or knowledge
of the services rendered by the Consultants and the payments made in consideration
for those services; (iii) where different individuals may have been involved at different
times in providing different services, it was expected that the Claimant, which received
these services, would be aware of the individuals who provided them and of the nature
of the services; (iv) so far the Claimant had substantiated neither the nature nor the
reality of the services; and (v) contemporaneous documents supporting these facts
would assist the Tribunal in reaching a conclusion regarding the Respondent's
corruption defense.

To facilitate submission of the information requested in PO 10, the Tribunal directed the
Claimant to submit a new witness statement by Mr. Rosenberg particularly addressing
the questions set forth in paragraph 92 above.

PO 10 required Mr. Rosenberg’s new witness statement to be accompanied by (i) a
brief submission limited to the issues contained in the statement; and (ii) relevant
contemporaneous documents concerning the Claimant’s submission that services were
rendered by the Consultants. Together with its submission, the Claimant was invited to
supplement the Payment Schedule to reflect the additional information sought by the
Tribunal concerning payments made to the Consultants and the services provided by
them. The Respondent was given an opportunity to submit a rebuttal witness
statement, which could also be accompanied by (i) a brief submission limited to issues
contained in the revised statement by Mr. Rosenberg and the Claimant's submission;
and (ii) contemporaneous documents concerning the Claimant's submission that
services were rendered by the Consultants. Further, the Parties were given the liberty
to request an additional hearing for the purpose of examining Mr. Rosenberg and/or a
possible additional witness produced by the Respondent.

84

256. Thus, the Tribunal made a considerable effort to ensure that it had all the relevant
evidence that it needed to decide on the corruption allegations. In fact, even before the
January Hearing, the Tribunal had already addressed allegations of payments made by
the Claimant to Uzbek Government officials. In PO 3 of 13 December 2011, in the
context of the Respondent’s allegations against Mr. Ibragimov, the Tribunal directed
the Claimant to conduct a “further comprehensive search” for documents evidencing
payment to any official or employee of the Government since 1994 and to “report on
the actions taken in conducting the search". In spite of the Tribunal’s efforts after the
January Hearing to establish the facts related to the payments about which Mr.
Rosenberg had testified, the Claimant was unable to substantiate its contention that
actual services had been carried out for legitimate purposes in return for those
payments. The Claimant's explanations for its non-compliance with the Tribunal’s
directions to provide additional evidence (described below) remain unconvincing.

257. First, the Claimant submitted that because “the invoices received from the Consultants
did not enumerate specific services”, the Claimant was unable to supplement the
Payment Schedule to reflect the additional information sought by the Tribunal in PO
10.8 That explanation is hardly satisfactory. While it may be true that the invoices
themselves do not reflect specific services, the Claimant could rely on other elements
to describe the services provided by the Consultants. For instance, under some of its
consulting contracts, the Consultants were to visit Israel*”” and were also to participate
in management meetings,” among other tasks. The records of such visits or meetings
(expense reports, minutes of those meetings, reports submitted by the Consultants,
etc.) or statements or notes from participants would enable the Claimant to supplement
the Payment Schedule. Further, as noted by the Tribunal, several contracts produced
by the Claimant themselves require the concerned entity “immediately to inform ‘M-T’

9279

about the work and services executed in its interests””~ and also require the Claimant

“to instruct regularly [the entity concerned] about the required works and services.””°°
The information, reports, correspondence provided by the Consultants in compliance
with these provisions would also enable the Claimant to supplement the Payment

Schedule.

85

258. The Claimant also submitted that its “records related to the Uzmetal JV [were]
incomplete both due to the passage of time and the fact that many documents were left
behind in Uzbekistan”.”*' Here too, the Tribunal is unable to accept the Claimant's
explanation. There is no reason why any relevant documents should have been left “in
the JV’s premises in Uzbekistan”. Uzmetal did not contract with the Consultants or the
MPC Companies; only the Claimant did. Mr. Rosenberg admitted that the Consultants
submitted their invoices for payment to Metal-Tech — not to Uzmetal.” The consulting
contracts themselves provided that the Consultants were to report directly to the
Claimant. The Claimant’s address in the consulting contracts is its address in Israel.
Thus, if the Consultants had performed any services, they would have had an
obligation to report to the Claimant in Israel, not to Uzmetal in Uzbekistan. The
December 2000 contract, for instance, contains three separate provisions requiring
MPC to submit information to “Metek”, which is defined as “Mssrs. Metek Metal
Technology Ltd., Ramat Hovav, P.O. Box 2412, Emek Sarah, Beer-Sheva 84874,
Israel”.8 The direct link between the Consultants and Israel was also confirmed by Mr.
Mikhailov, who submitted that all contracts and invoices “were exchanged between

Switzerland and Israel, not Uzbekistan.”***

259. Further, it was not contested that none of the minutes of the 16 General Meetings of
Participants of Uzmetal from 2000 to 2007 refers to MPC or to any consulting activity
being carried out on behalf of the Claimant.” In fact, most of the contracts themselves
imposed a strict confidentiality obligation. For instance, under the December 2000
contract, the Parties were “[t]o treat any information related to this agreement but also
to further contracts, which may result, as fully secret and confidential.” It is,
therefore, unlikely that a record of services performed under a confidential contract was
maintained (or left behind) at Uzmetal’s premises in Uzbekistan, especially when the
services were rendered for the exclusive benefit of the Claimant. As noted above, the
Consultants were to visit Israel, and participate in management meetings. Mr.
Rosenberg testified that meetings took place several times a year in Uzbekistan, once

per year in Europe, and “from time to time” in Israel.”°” There is no reason why the
records of (at the least) the meetings held outside Uzbekistan should have been kept in
Uzbekistan.

Finally, Mr. Rosenberg testified that “[e]lectronic mail was not very common for our
Company in the early days of this project,” and the Claimant thus “communicated with
the consultants by facsimile transmissions or by telephone conversations,” but did not
maintain “much record of all of those transmissions and telephone calls.”*° Again, this
position is difficult to follow. At least some of the Claimant's correspondence from 1999
onwards contains its email address at that time — mtkmetal@netvision.net.il.°° But
even assuming that e-mail was "not very common” and that communications with the
Consultants were primarily by fax, the Claimant has not explained why it did not keep
records of these faxes. For instance, in support of its submissions on the collection of
rhenium gases in Almalik, the Claimant introduced a series of faxes.” It is surprising
that the Claimant was able to produce faxes relating to rhenium — which, according to
the Claimant, the Claimant had no obligation to capture — but was unable to produce
any facsimile transmissions to or from the Consultants to whom the Claimant
admittedly paid USD 3.5 million.

Nevertheless, the Claimant did submit some documents”

which, it argues, are
“illustrative of the types of services provided by [the Consultants].”** The Tribunal’s
review of these documents is incorporated into its analysis of the section titled "Key
facts” above (section IV.B.4). For present purposes, the Tribunal only notes that these
documents do not sufficiently illustrate what services were rendered by the
Consultants, especially at the commencement of the Claimant's investment. To the

contrary, they suggest that no legitimate services were performed at the time.

In respect of some of these documents, Mr. Rosenberg himself admitted that they do
not relate to the Uzmetal project. For instance, while the Claimant initially relied on a
letter of 30 July 1998*° to justify services provided under the consulting contract of 15
December 2000, Mr. Rosenberg later accepted that the letter dealt with another

project: “[t]his letter is talking about a feasibility study which is a precursor to the
Uzmetal project.”*** Second, it is not correct to suggest that a letter of 22 July 2003
provides proof of marketing services.” In fact, this letter does not refer to marketing at
all; rather it deals with the possible sale of UZKTJM to an Afghan company. Third,
some of the documents do not evidence or require the performance of any services.
For instance, an 18 April 2004 letter (Exh. C-235) merely refers to a restructuring of
Uzmetal’s loans — it does not call for any services to be rendered in respect of “opening
the letter of credit to Uzmetal or signing the interbank agreement”. Similarly, another
document (Exh. C-230) is not addressed to the Consultants or to MPC, does not refer
any of the Consultants or MPC, and moreover does not contain a transmission date.
Further, it appears to only list various problems faced by Uzmetal, without requiring any
action. Yet another document (Exh. C-244) appears to be copied from publicly
available sources, and does not seem to consider matters then of relevance to the
Claimant or to Uzmetal.

263. The Tribunal must also mention here that the Claimant did not proffer any witness

(other than Mr. Rosenberg) in support of its submission that legitimate services were
rendered by the Consultants. The consulting contracts were signed by Mr. Maimon, the
Claimant's CEO at the time. Mr. Rosenberg testified that Mr. Maimon “travelled to

"287 and that Mr. Maimon

Uzbekistan several times a year to meet...the consultants’
submitted “timely reports” on the work of the Consultants. The Tribunal could have
benefited from learning more about the discussions which Mr. Maimon had with the
Consultants. Further, the Tribunal could also have benefited from the testimony of Mr.
Klein of CPH, who allegedly introduced the Claimant to the Consultants in 1998, and of
Mr. Miller, who served as a director of MPC from 2001 and as a director of Lacey
International (designated as a payee by the consultants under the February 2005
contract) from 2003 to 2010. Mr. Rosenberg himself testified that “Mr. Muller, the
Director of MPC and Lacey International, also informed me as recently as February
2012..." (emphasis added).*°* Thus, the record shows that Mr. Rosenberg was in
contact with Mr. Miller as late as February 2012.

264. The Claimant explained that it could not offer testimony from these witnesses because

“people are very concerned about their well-being and going and suing the
Government of Uzbekistan”.*°° This is not convincing. None of Messrs Maimon, Klein
and Muller live in Uzbekistan. To the extent they feared for their safety, the Tribunal
could have made necessary arrangements.

265. The Tribunal is thus unable to accept the Claimant's justifications for not providing

evidence, be it documentary or testimonial. This is more striking as Mr. Rosenberg
conceded that the Consultants provided “immense assistance” and that “Metal-Tech
... [was] aware of the activities of the consultants on an ongoing basis.”*°' While the
Tribunal does not believe that the Claimant sought to conceal evidence, the inference
that inexorably emerges from this dearth of evidence is that the Claimant can provide
no evidence of services, because no services, or at least no legitimate services at the
time of the establishment of the Claimant’s investment, were in fact performed. The
Tribunal will bear this inference in mind when further assessing the facts.

266. In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal is aware of the Claimant's submission that it

has been prejudiced because, despite having prior knowledge of the relevant facts, the
Respondent waited until the January Hearing to raise its corruption allegations.” The
Tribunal is unable to share this view. Rather than the Respondent raising corruption
allegations at the January Hearing, facts came to light in the course of the Claimant’s
witness evidence, which prompted the Tribunal to make further inquiries, to which it
gave the Claimant ample opportunity to respond.

c. Timing of Payments to the Consultants

267. As the Tribunal interprets Article 1(1) of the BIT, the legality requirement covers only

299

the establishment of the investment, not its operation once established. The facts
analysed by the Tribunal are thus limited to events leading to the establishment of the
investment. Yet, all the payments to the Consultants were made between 2001 and
2006, i.e. the payments post-dated the establishment of the Claimant’s investment.
Because of this timing, the Claimant has submitted that none of its payments to MPC
can be viewed as compensation for obtaining the approval of its investment.°° The

Tribunal nevertheless considers it appropriate to consider such payments for the
following reasons.

268. First, at the January Hearing, Mr. Rosenberg testified that the Consultants — not the
Claimant — originally came up with the idea of establishing a joint venture to produce
molybdenum products.° This dates the involvement of the Consultants to, at least,
September 1998.°° In any event, the bulk of the services alleged to have been
provided by the Consultants appears to have been provided at the time of
establishment of the investment. In his third witness statement, Mr. Rosenberg testified
that Metal-Tech decided to contract with MPC Switzerland “at the beginning of its
investment in Uzbekistan.”** In addition, he stated that Messrs Sultanov and Mikhailov
assisted “with the preparation of the feasibility study’, ensured that the investment
would be included in the approved investment program, and represented the Claimant
in negotiations with the Government that resulted in “opening the letter of credit to
Uzmetal and signing the interbank agreement between the Israeli Bank and the
NBU.”*” By their nature, all of these services must have been rendered prior to or at
the time of the establishment of the Claimant's investment.°%

269. When asked whether the Consultants “were a crucial part of putting together the deal
right from the very beginning”, Mr. Rosenberg answered that “[t]hey were a substantial
part in putting the deal together, yes.”°° He also said that the Consultants had been

“assisting - they would have been part of the project from, as I said, ’98 until — or ’99,

»310

until the end... and that they had been “helping the implementation of the project

from the very early stages. [...] initiation through the feasibility studies [...] checking the
feasibility studies, advising us about the feasibility studies, directing us through all the
red tape...”.°"' When asked whether the compensation paid to the Consultants between

$8 The Claimant should have begun drafting its Feasibility Study in December 1998 (Exh. R-20,
p.136). In the same month, the Cabinet of Ministers resolved to include the Claimant's proposed
investment project in molybdenum in the approved investment program (Exh. R-17). The Claimant
prepared and revised its Feasibility Study for eight months, until August 1999 (Exh. R-20, p.3). From
September 1999 to December 2000, the Claimant negotiated with the Ministry of Finance and the
National Bank, the bodies responsible for deciding whether to finance the project (Exh. R-20, pp.180-
189, Exh. R-133, Exh. R-474).

2001 to 2007 would cover earlier years as well, Mr. Rosenberg replied: “Of their work,

yes.”3"2

270. Second, the various agreements entered into between the Claimant and the

Consultants pursuant to which payments were made to the Consultants either
substituted previous agreements or refer to prior services that the Consultants are
alleged to have rendered. Mr. Rosenberg described the 2005 Consulting Agreement as
a “substitute [to] some previous agreements which were made and clarified the duties
of the Parties, both parties, and they are type of payments to the duties of those
Parties.”*"* The December 2000 contract®* for instance expressly records that the
Consultants “fully participated in the preparation of the Feasibility Studies which form
an integral basis for [the EPC Contract] and other agreements related thereto.”*"°
These services too predated the establishment of the investment.*’® It is
counterintuitive to suggest that the Consultants worked on all these matters without a
prior agreement that Claimant would pay them for doing so, particularly when Mr.
Rosenberg testified that “in the beginning, we had sort of all our Agreements in case
this project will mature and be implemented, they'll get compensation...”*"’ and that all

of the money paid to the Consultants “was agreed to up front.”*"®

271. Third, these facts are corroborated by Mr. Mikhailov. At the May Hearing, Mr. Mikhailov

312

confirmed that the Consultants were inter alia paid for obtaining Resolution No.15, i.e.
the Resolution establishing the Claimant's investment.*'? Mr. Mikhailov specifically
testified that, in 1998, the Claimant agreed to pay USD 3 million to the Consultants to
guarantee the protection of Claimant's investment in Uzbekistan:

“Our agreement back in mid-98 was that if we were able to come up with a
mechanism that would guarantee protection of Metal-Tech’s investments in
Uzbekistan, MPC would be entitled to something like 3 million through its

Tr. 478:20-22-479:1. The Claimant also conceded during its closing argument at the January

Hearing that “the work for which these gentlemen were being compensated extended back to 1998”
and that they “were helping put this deal together” (Tr. 1299:19-1300:3).

272. Finally, under Uzbek law, a promise to pay a public official, in exchange for the
performance or non-performance of certain action is unlawful, even if the payment itself
is not made until a later date. **'

273. On this basis, the Tribunal concludes that Metal-Tech had promised as early as 1998
to pay the Consultants if and when the Claimant's investment was established. In
consequence, the actual date of the payments does not prevent the Tribunal’s
consideration of those payments as relating to the implementation of the Claimant’s
investment when assessing the evidence in respect of the corruption allegations.

d. Evidence of Mr. Mikhailov

274. One of the Consultants hired by the Claimant, Mr. Mikhailov, submitted three witness
statements in the present proceeding.*” Mr. Mikhailov’s third witness statement was
submitted in response to the Tribunal’s invitation in PO 10 to the Respondent to submit
witness testimony rebutting the testimony of Mr. Rosenberg. The Respondent relies on
Mr. Mikhailov’s written testimony as contained in his third witness statement and his
oral testimony at the May Hearing to substantiate its corruption allegations. However,
the Claimant submits that Mr. Mikhailov’s testimony is not credible, and should not be
relied on.

275. The Tribunal concludes that the Claimant's position is reasonable. Mr. Mikhailov has
been held in prison by the Uzbek authorities since 13 July 2011. He was incarcerated
when he submitted his second and third witness statements (16 November 2011 and
14 May 2012 respectively). Four days after the Tribunal issued PO 10 inviting the
Respondent to produce a witness statement rebutting Mr. Rosenberg’s testimony, Mr.
Mikhailov was tried and sentenced on separate charges. Although those charges were
said to be unrelated to Metal-Tech,**° Mr. Mikhailov confirmed that he was providing
testimony to this Tribunal in the hope that his cooperation with Uzbekistan in this

324

arbitration would secure a reduction in his sentence.“ Moreover, prior to the January

Hearing, Mr. Mikhailov had already submitted two witness statements — including one

279.

submitted after his arrest, when he was already cooperating with Uzbekistan. In those
first two statements, he said nothing about the Claimant’s relationship with the
Consultants and made no suggestion of corruption.

Consequently, the Tribunal does not rely on Mr. Mikhailov’s written or oral testimony to
establish any contested issue of fact. It nevertheless notes various points at which Mr.
Mikhailov’s evidence tends to corroborate other evidence in the record. In doing so, the
Tribunal is mindful of the fact that, at least on some occasions, the Claimant appears to
have itself relied on portions of Mr. Mikhailov’s testimony.

Having set out the factors relevant to its assessment of the evidence, the Tribunal will
now proceed to analyse the Claimant’s conduct in the context of the Uzbek law
prohibiting bribery.

6. Violation of Uzbek Laws on Bribery

a. Respondent’s Position

At the outset, the Respondent submits that Uzbekistan’s anti-bribery provisions are
consistent with international treaties and the laws of many other States, including Israel
(the Claimant's home State), the United Kingdom (where the Claimant trades its public
securities on the London Stock Exchange), and Switzerland (the jurisdiction to which
the Claimant made many of its payments).°°°

The Respondent alleges that, in making its investment in Uzbekistan, the Claimant
violated Articles 210-212 of the Uzbek Criminal Code. Those articles prohibit the giving
or taking of bribes, directly or through an intermediary, in exchange for the performance
or non-performance of an action. The Respondent submits that, under Uzbek law, (i) it
is unlawful "to give or to promise anything of value to a public official or an intermediary
of that public official, in exchange for the performance or non-performance of certain
action that the official must have performed or could have performed"; (ii) it is
unlawful "to enrich a third party, in particular a family member of the public official, for
the purpose of inducing the official’s performance or non-performance of certain
action";*”” and (iii) the time of the payment is irrelevant as it is unlawful to "promise to
provide anything of value to a public official, directly or through an intermediary, in
exchange for performance or non-performance of certain action, even if the payment or

7 R-PHB 1 410.

93

281.

282.

other thing of value is not given until a later date".°*® Applying these rules to the facts of
the present dispute, the Respondent submits that the Claimant “violated ... the
Republic’s Criminal Code by promising to pay — and later paying — more than USD 4.4
million in alleged consulting fees to a senior Government official at the apparatus of the
President, the brother of the Prime Minister, their business partner, and a fourth
individual in return for the Government's approval of its investment and the Prime
Minister's repeated intervention on Claimant's behalf.”°°

. The Respondent relies on commentaries to the Uzbek Criminal Code to support its

submission that, as a matter of Uzbek law, it was unlawful to pay Mr. Chijenok, a
Government official, to take steps toward the performance of an action, even if he did
not have the delegated authority to perform that action. The Respondent also submits
that the commentaries stand for the proposition that, if the Tribunal concludes that the
Claimant made its payments to Mr. Sultanov for the purpose of inducing Prime Minister
Sultanov to act or to refrain from acting in favor of the Claimant, then the Respondent
has proven its corruption defense, regardless of whether Mr. Sultanov ever transmitted
part or all of the money to his brother, the Prime Minister.

b. Claimant’s Position

The Claimant counters that the Respondent has failed to show any breach of Uzbek
law and that the commentaries which the Respondent invokes do not establish that the
conduct alleged by the Respondent constituted bribery under Uzbek law. Moreover, the
Claimant argues that the Respondent has mischaracterized the commentaries as
emanating from the Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Internal Affairs, when they are in
fact academic works, not authoritative interpretations of Uzbek law.

c. Analysis

The relevant provisions of the Uzbek Criminal Code read as follows:

“Article 210. Bribe-taking

“Bribe-taking, e.g. obviously illegal obtaining by an official, personally or
through an intermediary, of valuables or the extraction of wealth or property
benefit for the performance or non-performance in the interest of giving a bribe
a specific action that the official must have committed or could have
committed using his official position, -

$29 R-PHB 1 416.

94

shall be punished by a fine of fifty to one hundred minimum monthly wages or
imprisonment up to five years with deprivation of certain right.

Ll
“Article 211. Bribe-giving

Bribe-giving, that is, knowingly illegal provision of tangible valuables to an
Official, personally or through an intermediate person, or of pecuniary benefit
for performance or non-performance of certain action, which the official must
or could have officially performed, in the interests of the person giving a bribe

shall be punished with fine up to fifty minimum monthly wages, or correctional
labor up to three years, or arrest up to six months, or imprisonment up to three
years.

Lal’
Article 212. Intermediation in Bribery

“Intermediation in bribery, that is, activity carried out to arrive at an agreement
about acceptance of or giving a bribe as well as immediate delivery of a bribe
upon instructions of the persons concerned —

shall be punished with fine up to fifty minimum monthly wages, or correctional
labor up to three years, or arrest up to six months, or imprisonment up to three
years.

[..]

283. In addition, Resolution No. 19 issued by the Plenum of the Supreme Court of
Uzbekistan in September 1999 and entitled "Judicial Practice in Cases of Bribery"
gives the following clarifications:

“[Rlesponsibility for bribery occurs regardless of when a bribe was given —
either before or after the performance of an act or the omission of an act, and
without regard to whether a bribe was stipulated in advance or whether any
actions were actually performed in the interests of the briber.”**"

284. The "Applied Research Commentary of the Uzbek Criminal Code" published by the
Ministry of Internal Affairs gives the following explanations on these provisions:

“When an official did not possess the powers to perform an action in the
interests of the briber but owing to the official position was able to take steps
towards the performance of such an action by other officials, the act should
also be qualified as bribetaking.” *

$82 R682, p. 15-16. See also Resolution No. 19 of the Plenum of the Supreme Court of Uzbekistan,
Art. 1, Kanyazov WS II Attachment 30, p. 6 (“As the subject of this crime [of bribery] those officials

285. The Applied Research Commentary goes on to say:

“The way of bribetaking and the form thereof do not matter regarding criminal
liability. [A bribe] can be ] overt corruption or disguised by such apparently
lawful actions as a gift, sale for nothing, the conclusion of sham employment
contracts and payment as per these to the bribetaker, his/her relatives or other
authorized representatives for jobs ostensibly made by him/her, ostensibly
rendered technical support, etc. The object of bribery can be handed
(transferred) either directly to an official who is the bribetaker or with his/her
permission to the members of his/her family and other people related to
him/her....”.°°3
286. The Commentary further confirms that, even if no transfer is ever made from the
relatives to the Government official, the party making the payment has committed a
criminal offense under Uzbek law.°* Other commentaries confirm — this

understanding.

287. When referring to these commentaries, the Tribunal is mindful that they were
introduced into the record after the Respondent's first post-hearing submission and that
the Claimant opposed such introduction. The Tribunal accepted the commentaries in
PO 12, inter alia because the Claimant had not contested their relevance or materiality.
To ensure that the Claimant had sufficient opportunity to comment on these texts, it
extended the page limitation of Claimant’s reply post-hearing submission. While the
Claimant expressed its views on the commentaries, it did not provide scholarly writings
setting forth divergent opinions. In any event, the Tribunal considers that, when it
comes to applying the law, including municipal law, as opposed to establishing facts,

 

should be also recognised who, though they did not have the authority to perform certain acts for the
benefit of the briber but by virtue of their official position were able to take action to commit these acts
by other officials for a bribe”) and Exh. R-681, p. 16.

583 R682, p. 15-16. See also Exh. R-681, p.15 (“The scopes of bribe may be transferred both directly
to the official — taker of bribe and with his knowledge to the members of the family and other persons
close to him and may be transferred to the bank to the account of the bribe-taker. The way of
bribetaking and the form of its externalization are of no importance for the qualification.”

34 Exh. R-682, p. 20 (“[O]ffering the [government] official material values or property benefits, posting
these in a letter or a parcel and even transferring to his / his relatives or a mediator, if not followed by
the acceptance of the bribe by the person, should be qualified not as a completed offence but as
attempted bribery.”). See also Resolution 19 of the Plenum of the Supreme Court of Uzbekistan, Art.
3, 5, Kanyazov WS II Attachment 30, p. 6 (‘If the alleged bribe has not been received or rejected by
the official, the action of a person who tried to give a bribe, should be qualified as attempted bribery.”),
Kanyazov WS II n.2 (“Under the laws of the Republic of Uzbekistan, it is unlawful to give or to accept a
bribe (or to attempt to do so), personally or through an intermediary” inter alia relying on Article 25 of
the Uzbek Criminal Code (“Preparation for Crime and Criminal Attempt”) (Attachment 29)).

585 See Exh. R-681, p.16 (“the offer of material values or property benefit to a official, sending them by
post in an envelope or in a parcel, and also giving them to relatives or to a mediator, if the bribe is not
taken, should be treated as an attempt to give a bribe”); see also Exh. R-683, p. 11 (a bribe “can be
overt corruption or disguised by such apparently lawful actions as a gift, sale for nothing, the
conclusion of sham employment contracts and payment as per these to the bribe taker, his / her
relatives or other authorized representatives for jobs ostensibly made by him / her, ostensibly rendered
technical support, etc.”).

96

the principle iura novit curia — or better iura novit arbiter**® — allows it to form its own
opinion on the meaning of the law. Doing so, it may of course seek guidance from
academic writings.

288. The Tribunal understands that the commentaries filed by the Respondent are not

authoritative or otherwise binding interpretations of Uzbek law.**” The Tribunal also
understands, however, that the propositions for which the Respondent relies on those
commentaries — that a payment to a relative of an official is equivalent to a payment to
the official himself that a bribe may be paid before or after the act induced by the bribe,
and that an official may be bribed to take an action that he has no actual power to take
— are by now largely non-controversial propositions under all modern legal systems.

289. On the basis of the applicable rules just referred to, the Tribunal accepts the following

propositions as established under Uzbek law: (i) it is unlawful to give or to promise
anything of value to a public official or an intermediary of that public official in exchange
for the performance or non-performance of certain action that the official must or could
have performed; (ii) it is unlawful to enrich a third party, such as a member of an
official’s family, for the purpose of inducing an official’s performance or non-
performance of certain action; and (iii) the timing of payment is irrelevant; it can occur
before or after the act or omission sought.

290. It is against this legal background that the Tribunal will now review the facts. Before

doing so, it notes that the condemnation of corruption under Uzbek law is in conformity
with international law and the laws of the vast majority of States. In addition to early
bilateral treaties providing for extradition in cases of corruption, manifestations of the
fight against corruption are found at the multilateral level in the Vienna Convention of
the Law of Treaties and in the ICSID Convention. In effect, Article 50 of the VCLT
allows a State whose consent has been obtained through corruption to invalidate a
treaty and Article 52(1)(c) of the ICSID Convention provides for the annulment of an
award if there was corruption on the part of a member of an ICSID tribunal. The
international community of States has thereafter sought to address the issue of
corruption with a targeted effort to eliminate corrupt practices in the public service
sector and criminalize corruption in domestic legal orders. For instance, on 17
December 1979 the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted a "Code of

$88 Costergetel 4141.

For example, Exh. R-682/C-255, p.3 states: “By issuing this commentary, the publisher would like

to stress that certain controversial issues still require practical interpretation and thus legal
practitioners, scientists and scholars are invited to express their opinion and wishes with regard to this
publication.”

Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials". In the same year, the UN prepared a Draft
International Agreement on Illicit Payments. Also, in 1997, the General Assembly
adopted a Declaration against Corruption and Bribery in International Commercial
Transactions.

Further, a number of international agreements were adopted mainly seeking to
criminalize corruption, but also dealing with administrative and civil law aspects relating
to the fight against corruption. These include the 1996 Inter-American Convention
against Corruption; the 1997 OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign
Public Officials in International Business Transactions; the 1999 Council of Europe Civil
Law Convention on Corruption; the 1999 Criminal Law Convention on Corruption and
the 1999 Civil Law Convention on Corruption, both adopted under the aegis of the
Council of Europe; the 2003 African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating
Corruption; and the 2004 UN Convention against Corruption.

In this context, a mention must also be made of the award in World Duty Free v. Kenya
which held that corruption is “contrary to international public policy of most, if not all,

9338

States or, to use another formula, to transnational public policy’“” and consequently

declared the claims inadmissible.

For the application of the prohibition of corruption, the international community has
established lists of indicators, sometimes called "red flags". Several red flag lists exist,
which, although worded differently, have essentially the same content. For instance,
Lord Woolf, former Chief Justice of England and Wales, included on his list of “Key Red
Flags” among other things” (1) “an Adviser has a lack of experience in the sector;” (2)
“non-residence of an Adviser in the country where the customer or the project is
located;” (3) “no significant business presence of the Adviser within the country; (4) “an
Adviser requests ‘urgent’ payments or unusually high commissions;” (5) “an Adviser
requests payments be paid in cash, use of a corporate vehicle such as equity, or be
paid in a third country, to a numbered bank account, or to some other person or entity;”
(6) “an Adviser has a close personal/professional relationship to the government or
customers that could improperly influence the customer's decision”.*°° As has been

588 World Duty Free 157. This approach was confirmed in the recent Niko decision (Niko Resources
Ltd v. Bangladesh, Bapex and Petrobangla, |CSID Case No. ARB/10/11 and ARB/10/18, Decision on
Jurisdiction, 19 August 2013, 9431-433).

seen above in the section entitled "Key facts" and as will become further evident in the
course of the analysis under Uzbek law, many of these red flags are present here.*“°

294. Returning now to the facts of this case under Uzbek law, the allegations of corruption
are directed primarily against Messrs Chijenok, Sultanov and Ibragimov. Other lesser
allegations are also made in respect of Messrs Mikhailov, Shwa, Krespel and Gurtovoi.
The factual matrix is different for each of these individuals. The Tribunal will thus
review the involvement of each person separately to determine whether the evidence
establishes that any relevant provision of Uzbek law has been violated.

i. Mr. Chijenok

(i) | Respondent’s Position

295. The Respondent essentially submits that Mr. Chijenok has worked for the Claimant
since 1998 and was promised future payments while he was a Government official in
order to induce him to influence Government officials, including Prime Minister
Sultanov, to approve the Claimant's investment through Resolution No. 15.

296. The Respondent alleges that Mr. Chijenok began to work for the Claimant when he
was still an official at the Apparatus of the President. In support of its submission that
Mr. Chijenok was hired by the Claimant in 1998, the Respondent, inter alia, relies on
the following testimony of Mr. Rosenberg:*“"

i. In his direct examination at the January Hearing, in relation to the 28 February
2005 Agreement among Messrs. Sultanov, Chijenok, and Mikhailov,
Mr. Rosenberg testified that he “was introduced to them by a business
associate, a business customer, a Dutch company” in 1998;

ii. | Further, when asked what he had believed those three individuals could do for
the Claimant when he met them in 1998,°“° Mr. Rosenberg testified that:

“© The Tribunal has noted the Claimant's objections that the red flags used by the Respondent post-
date the impugned conduct of the Consultants, i.e. the red flag lists upon which the Respondent relies
were published after the conduct under scrutiny. However, the red flag lists merely assemble a
number of factors which any adjudicator with good common sense would consider when assessing
facts in relation with a corruption issue whether now or in 1998. This was for instance the approach
used in ICC cases No. 6497 and 8891.

“...This Mr. Sultanov and his associates were very active in sales
and business activities in molybdenum in Uzbekistan during this
time. They had connection both to Almalik and to UZKTJM, and they
have been exporting — buying, exporting, and doing different — of
molybdenum, and they actually proposed that rather than Metal-
Tech would be doing the recovering of different metals from the
tailings, that we'll concentrate first on the production of molybdenum
from the low-grade raw material of Almalik and implementing a
project which is to build high-purity molybdenum oxide from the low-
grade raw material. So, it means to help — they knew all the
challenges and the problem in doing the business, and they help us
in or identify to us the new possibilities in order to solve it.”*“*

According to the Respondent, Mr. Rosenberg’s references to “they” refer back
to Mr. Rosenberg’s statement regarding “Mr. Sultanov and his associates’—
Messrs Chijenok and Mikhailov. The Respondent asserts that Mr.
Rosenberg’s testimony confirms that Mr. Chijenok was “involved from the
beginning, when the consultants allegedly came up with the idea for the
Claimant to focus on molybdenum, rather than the copper tailings”;*°

iii. | Similarly, when asked whether the Claimant had agreements with the
Consultants since the beginning, Mr. Rosenberg testified that:

“Q. And you had these agreements in place with these three
individuals from the very beginning of the project; is that right? |
think that’s what your testimony was.

A. Yeah, | think — yes.”*“°

According to the Respondent, Mr. Rosenberg’s response specifically applies
to “three individuals,” i.e., to Messrs Sultanov, Chijenok, and Mikhailov, and
confirms that from the very beginning, the Claimant had entered into
agreements with the Consultants, including Mr. Chijenok. Again, when asked
where the Consultants were working before the Claimant hired them, Mr.
Rosenberg testified that he met all three consultants at the same time:

“Q. Where were these individuals working before they began
working under this Consultancy Agreement with you?

A. There were three individuals that we grouped together as one
unit operating in Kazakhstan [recte Uzbekistan]; and, as | said, that
they had been introduced to me by a Dutch company, and they
have been dealing in pharmaceuticals and later on | learned that
they had been dealing with — in other things. But the main thing
that was my interest was the fact that they have been dealing in the
molybdenum prior to the operation of Uzmetal. They had been
buying and selling from Almalik the low grade concentrate, and they
had been buying from Uzmetal — UzKTJM, sorry, the finished
product, whatever it was, and they exported it, so they had vast
experience in this field.”*“”

To the Respondent, Mr. Rosenberg’s testimony is clear in that “he met ‘three
individuals‘ - Messrs. Sultanov, Chijenok, and Mikhailov - through a Dutch
company (CPH), and that the Claimant grouped these three individuals
together from the beginning as one operating unit.”*“® The Respondent
submits that Mr. Rosenberg himself confirmed this position first when he
stated that he could not recall if the Consultants bought and sold molybdenum
under “their name, under different names, but it was their — they were the
people that did it“? and again when he stated that although he did not
mention any of the consultants in either of his witness statements, “[t]hey were
a substantial part in putting the deal together.”**°

The Respondent also points out that, in his subsequent testimony at the
January Hearing, Mr. Rosenberg did not downplay Mr. Chijenok’s role or
suggest that he became involved later than Messrs Sultanov and Mikhailov;**'

When asked by the President of the Tribunal to confirm that Messrs Chijenok,
Sultanov and Mikhailov “were a team,” and that “each one had special
capabilities and on which [he] could rely,”*°* Mr. Rosenberg agreed.*°* When

asked further exactly what Messrs Chijenok, Sultanov and Mikhailov, did for
the Claimant to be paid USD 4 million,°®* Mr. Rosenberg replied as follows:

“The way that | have been operating in those countries since I’m not
a citizen of those countries — | don’t know the country. | don’t know
who is who, and who is my enemy, who is my friend, who is doing
what and how to do? | had to have somebody that will assist me at
the site. We assumed that since they were actually the
businessmen that were dealing in molybdenum, they knew
everything. They had been in this business. They actually once we
said Uzmetal we actually replaced them, so they could either be our
enemies or they could assist us and join us and be our associate.
And so this was one thing and by having all their experience in
doing the Feasibility Study and arranging — helping us going
through. . . .”%°

He further testified that: “[the Consultants] had been assisting — they would

have been part of the project from, as | said, ’98 until - or '99, until the end.
9356

The Respondent argues that, throughout his examination, Mr. Rosenberg

repeatedly tied all three consultants back to the initiation of the Claimant's

investment in 1998 either by referring to “three individuals” or “three people,”

or by using collective terms such as “they,” “them, “this group of people.”*°”

297. Besides relying on Mr. Rosenberg’s testimony, the Respondent also relies on the
testimony of Mr. Mikhailov, which, Respondent says, confirms that Mr. Chijenok was
involved in the Claimant's investment from 1998.°% The Respondent points out that, at
the May Hearing, Mr. Mikhailov emphasized that even Mr. Chijenok himself had
admitted that he met Mr. Rosenberg in 1998:

“Q. So, you have testified both in your statement, particularly in
Paragraph 3, but also just now, that you, Mr. Sultanov, and Mr.

Chijenok were introduced to Mr. Rosenberg through friends at CPH;
is that correct?

A. Absolutely correct.

Q. And Mr. Rosenberg has testified that he did not meet Mr.
Chijenok until the year 2003. Are you certain that you meant, you,
along with Mr. Chijenok and Mr. Sultanov, that the three of you met
Mr. Rosenberg all together in 1998?

A. I’m absolutely sure of that; and, as far as | know, Mr. Chijenok
does not object to that either. That is really what happened.”*°?

298. The Respondent finds Mr. Rosenberg’s attempt at the May Hearing to “clarify the
discrepancy” in his earlier testimony about the involvement of all three Consultants
since 1998, unconvincing. First, despite being asked whether he had heard or seen
anything to refresh his recollection regarding the changes made to his testimony, Mr.
Rosenberg stated that he had no documents and could not explain what refreshed his
recollection: “I didn’t say that my memory is refreshed by documents. | said my
memory, what | can recall with my memory, and my memory can recall that | met him
[Mr. Chijenok] at about 2003...” Mr. Rosenberg thus based the change in his
testimony solely on his memory, which he himself admitted was deficient.**' Second,
nothing in the record supports Mr. Rosenberg’s changed testimony. Third, unlike Mr.
Rosenberg, who could not furnish an explanation as to why another consultant was
needed in 2003, Mr. Mikhailov provided an explanation: Mr. Chijenok helped Mr.
Rosenberg to prepare letters to the Government in order to obtain the Government's
approval of the Claimant's investment.°

299. As to the role played by this Consultant, the Respondent asserts that “Mr. Chijenok ...
interviewed the candidates to head various ministries and Government departments
and influenced appointments of candidates to these positions.” Relying on Mr.
Mikhailov’s testimony, the Respondent further submits that Mr. Chijenok had good
relationships with most senior Government officials. The core purpose of agreeing to

pay Mr. Chijenok was thus to influence Government officials, including Mr. Chijenok, to
obtain the approval of the Claimant’s investment through Resolution No. 15.°* As the
commentaries on the Uzbek Criminal Code and Resolution No. 19 reflect, it was illegal
for the Claimant to promise to pay Mr. Chijenok to take steps to obtain Resolution No.
15, even if he personally lacked any authority with respect to that Resolution.* The
Respondent also submits that, since the Claimant admitted paying more than USD 4.4
million to the Consultants, including Mr. Chijenok, and there is no evidence of any
legitimate services having been performed in return for those payments, the Tribunal
should conclude that the purpose of these payments was to bribe Government officials
in order to obtain and maintain the Claimant's investment.°®

(ii) | Claimant’s Position

300. The Claimant objects that there is no evidence in the record that Mr. Chijenok worked
for the Government during the relevant time period with respect to the Claimant's
investment. Nor is it established that Mr. Chijenok did anything for Metal-Tech while he
was a government official. In any event, even if Mr. Chijenok did begin to work for
Metal-Tech in 1998, the Respondent had not explained how such an arrangement
would violate Uzbek law.°”” The Respondent had not alleged that Mr. Chijenok took
official action within the scope of his responsibilities for Metal-Tech’s benefit in
exchange for money or a promise of future payment.*°

301. As to the start of Mr. Chijenok's involvement, the Claimant contends that it is not
established that Mr. Chijenok was introduced to and began his work for Metal-Tech in
the spring of 1998.°°° Mr. Rosenberg testified in his third witness statement that “Mr.
Chijenok joined the MPC team that Metal-Tech worked with after Uzmetal had been
operating for some years and long after the December 2000 contract with MPC was
signed.”°”° Mr. Rosenberg also stated that he did “not recall the precise date when [he]

etc., as well as other officials achieving an action or inaction desirable for the briber by means of the

first became aware of Mr. Chijenok, but [he] believe[d] it was some time in 2003 or
2004.”°”' At the May Hearing, he recalled that he met Mr. Chijenok in 2003. He also
claimed that he first learned at that time in 2003 that Mr. Chijenok had been an official

in the Uzbek Government “[s]ometime in the past.”°”

302. The Claimant argues that no reliance should be placed on Mr. Rosenberg’s testimony

at the January Hearing, as it was ambiguous. Mr. Rosenberg did not testify in his native
language and spoke of events that had taken place 14 years earlier. It was thus hardly
surprising that Mr. Rosenberg referred to the three MPC consultants as a group. The
source of Mr. Rosenberg’s confusion was his failure to distinguish between MPC and
the three individuals when answering questions about the parties to the February 2005
consulting agreement.*% It adds that if “[the] Respondent's counsel had
straightforwardly asked Mr. Rosenberg when he first met Mr. Chijenok, there would
have been no ambiguity on that score requiring clarification."** The Respondent's
characterization of Mr. Rosenberg’s testimony as an admission of Mr. Chijenok’s
involvement since 1998, was nothing more than a confirmation that Mr. Rosenberg’s
relationship with the MPC consultancy started that year.°”>

303. In connection with Mr. Chijenok's role, the Claimant challenges the Respondent's

theory that Mr. Chijenok was promised payment while he was a Government official to
obtain the Government's approval of its investment. The theory is factually incorrect
and, even if the facts asserted against Mr. Chijenok were true, they do not establish

any wrongdoing by Metal-Tech.°”°

304. As to the facts, the Claimant points out that Mr. Chijenok held the position of Principal

Consultant on Organizational and Personnel Policy of the Apparatus of the President of
the Republic of Uzbekistan.*’? The information note submitted by Mr. Chijenok
described his responsibilities as follows:

“Examination at leadership’s request of business and other qualities
of the applicants for vacancies being on the list of the Organisation
and Personnel Policy Service; making of personal data files for

newly appointed personnel; checking of subordinate employees’

(personal assistants) performance, including checking of Inventory

Division statisticians employment duties.”*”

305. For the Claimant, this description does not support the submission that Mr. Chijenok
“was in a position, through the exercise or non-exercise of powers within the scope of
his duties, to secure a government decision guaranteeing Metal-Tech’s investment".°”°
Mr. Chijenok was responsible for human resources functions at the President’s Office;
his responsibilities were confined to "low-level personnel matters".*®° He merely used
his "general familiarity with the way business was conducted in the Uzbek government
to advise Metal-Tech on letter-writing".°*"

306. As to the legal aspects, the Claimant submits that the Respondent does not show any
violation of Articles 210 to 212 of the Uzbek Criminal Code. On the basis of Articles 210
and 211, it contends that to establish corruption with respect to Mr. Chijenok, the
Respondent would need to demonstrate that (i) the Claimant knowingly paid him for
work undertaken on its behalf when he was a government official and (ii) he was paid
for the performance or non-performance of a specific action within his duties. The
Respondent has failed to establish Metal-Tech's knowledge of Mr. Chijenok’s role.°%

307. The Claimant further notes that there is no allegation that it paid Mr. Chijenok for the
performance or non-performance of actions within the scope of his duties, which were
unrelated to the Claimant's investment.*® In particular, whatever advice Mr. Chijenok
may have given about letters, the information note referred to above confirms that such
advice was outside of the scope of his duties. There was no suggestion either that Mr.
Chijenok sought to otherwise exercise authority in this connection.***

308. The Claimant also insists that it is not alleged that Mr. Chijenok "intervened directly with
other governmental officials responsible for approving Metal-Tech’s investment or used
his official position to cause them to reach decisions favorable to Metal-Tech".®° The
only document proffered by the Respondent that allegedly links Mr. Chijenok to the

Claimant’s investment is dated June 1997, prior to the date on which the Respondent
alleges that Mr. Chijenok began to work for Metal-Tech. The document is a letter from
the Office of the President (where Mr. Chijenok worked at the time), but nothing
suggests that Mr. Chijenok knew about the letter or participated in writing it. Finally,
there is no evidence that Mr. Chijenok is being investigated or has been arrested for
any crime. %°

309. Finally, the Claimant argues that Resolution 19 is inapplicable.*®” Moreover, the

resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of 6 March 1992 entitled “On the List of Officials
Forbidden to Engage in Entrepreneurial Activity” submitted by the Respondent is wholly
inapposite and its unexplained submission is "just one more example of Respondent's
attempt to escape liability for its treaty obligation by creating a smokescreen of investor

impropriety."°°°

310. While Mr. Mikhailov testified for the first time at the May Hearing that Metal-Tech paid

the MPC consultants, including Mr. Chijenok, “for the firm guarantees for the decisions

9389

to be made in Uzbekistan”** in respect of the Claimant's investment and that “such a

guarantee would be the statement made by the Cabinet of Ministers of Uzbekistan,
signed by the President of Uzbekistan”,°% no evidence in the record supports this
statement and, in any event, procuring such a decision was not within the ambit of Mr.

Chijenok’s responsibilities.

(iii) Analysis

311. For the sake of convenience, the Tribunal will adopt the order followed by the Parties

and will first review the timing of Mr. Chijenok’s association with the Claimant’s
investment before examining the role played by him.

312. The timing of Mr. Chijenok’s association with the Claimant has been a source of

386

387

388

389

390

391

considerable debate. According to the Respondent, at the January Hearing, Mr.
Rosenberg clearly testified that he was introduced to Mr. Chijenok in 1998. The

Claimant counters that Mr. Rosenberg’s “statements about when he started working

with the consultants were vague with respect to any particular individual.”*%"

313. The Tribunal has difficulty accepting the Claimant’s argument on this point. Rather, it
credits Mr. Rosenberg's testimony at the January Hearing that Mr. Chijenok was
associated with the Claimant since 1998, which is corroborated by other evidence
before it.

314. Turning first to Mr. Rosenberg's testimony, he was asked when he became acquainted
with the parties to the 28 February 2005 Agreement, i.e. with Messrs Chijenok,
Sultanov and Mikhailov. Mr. Rosenberg replied that he was introduced to them in
1998.°* Further, when asked by the Tribunal how many years the Consultants had
worked for the Claimant, Mr. Rosenberg stated: “They had been assisting — they would
have been part of the project from, as | said, ’98 until - or 99, until the end...."°%

Further, specific questions were asked to Mr. Rosenberg about three Consultants

assisting him in the establishment of the investment. He confirmed that the Claimant

entered into agreements with all three Consultants, at the very beginning of the project:

“Q. And you had these agreements in place with these three individuals from
the very beginning of the project; is that right?

A. Yeah, | think — yes.”°4

315. When asked to confirm that the February 2005 agreement between “Mr. Viktor

9395

Mikhailov, Mr. Igor, Chijenok, and Mr. Sultanov,”**’ mentioned in the prospectus was

actually a successor agreement to other agreements with “these same individuals”,*°°

Mr. Rosenberg answered: “That's correct.”°°”

316. For the Tribunal, these statements leave no room for ambiguity. It is true that
Mr. Rosenberg later testified, in relation to the February 2005 Consulting Agreement,
that he “didn’t pay attention to the group, who is exactly part of the Group.”** It is also
true that there may have been an ambiguity in his testimony, “because for most of the
time MPC was made of three persons.”*°° Yet, Mr. Rosenberg was unequivocal in
answering specific questions, often referenced with names and dates. Any perceived

ambiguity — in the Tribunal's view, there was none — could have been clarified at the
time, in particular in redirect examination, which was not done.*”

317. Neither can the Tribunal agree with the Claimant's suggestion that Mr. Rosenberg’s
testimony at the January Hearing should be discounted because he “testif[ied] in a non-
native language about events that took place some 14 years earlier.“ In the
Tribunal's perception, Mr. Rosenberg appeared to have no difficulty in understanding
and answering the questions put to him in English. In fact, he himself expressed a
preference for speaking in English and he was also specifically told that, if he had any
difficulty understanding or expressing something, he should inform the Tribunal.‘
Moreover, prior to the January Hearing, Mr. Rosenberg had already submitted two
witness statements in English.

318. The Tribunal notes that the Claimant has produced no compelling evidence in support
of Mr. Rosenberg’s subsequent position that he became aware of Mr. Chijenok only
during the operation of the project. The letter of 7 June 2004 on which the Claimant
relies says nothing in this respect; it merely indicates that Messrs Mikhailov and
Chijenok will be in Israel on 24 June 2004.“ In any event, Mr. Rosenberg himself
admitted that his revised testimony (that he met Mr. Chijenok in 2003) was not based
on any documents.“ He relied only on his memory, which he had earlier recognized
could fail after so many years.“ In weighing the evidence, the Tribunal also takes
account of the fact that Mr. Rosenberg holds a majority of the shares of Metal-Tech. He
has thus a personal stake in this dispute. Similarly, the Tribunal cannot disregard the
fact that the Third Witness Statement was submitted more than two months after the
January Hearing, with the benefit of the entire record and the knowledge of POs 7 and
8, in which the Tribunal had shown concern in respect of the corruption allegations.

319. Second, even if one were to entirely disregard Mr. Rosenberg's statements, the record
confirms Mr. Chijenok's early involvement. According to the record, Mr. Chijenok

founded Bordeaux in 1998 along with Messrs Sultanov and Mikhailov. Through his
shareholding in Bordeaux, Mr. Chijenok owned a 15% shareholding in MPC which was
also established in that same year. In fact, at the January Hearing, Mr. Rosenberg
identified MPC as the Consultants’ company to which payments were made.“°” This
evidence of the timing of Mr. Chijenok’s participation is corroborated by Mr. Mikhailov’s
testimony that Mr. Rosenberg was aware of the shareholders of MPC (and therefore
also aware of Mr. Chijenok’s shareholding in MPC through Bordeaux). When asked
whether Mr. Rosenberg knew who owned MPC’s shares, Mr. Mikhailov testified that
“he undoubtedly did”.*°®

320. The next issue that arises is the one of the role played by Mr. Chijenok in the context of

the Claimant's investment. The Claimant gave confusing explanations about Mr.
Chijenok’s role. As with Mr. Sultanov, Mr. Rosenberg initially stated that Mr. Chijenok
was involved in the molybdenum industry and was being compensated for the fact that
the Claimant took his business away. At the May Hearing, Mr. Rosenberg testified that
only Mr. Sultanov was previously involved in the molybdenum industry. Thus, by the
Claimant's own admission, Mr. Chijenok was not remunerated for losing his
molybdenum business.

321. The Claimant then submitted that Mr. Chijenok was employed as a lobbyist. At the

January Hearing, the Claimant submitted that the Consultants were being paid mainly
to influence government officials and thus were providing “precisely the same services
that Washington lobbyists provide every day”.“°° In the Tribunal's opinion, this
proposition remains unsubstantiated. If Mr. Chijenok was indeed a lobbyist, the
Claimant would be expected to have relevant letters, reports and other evidence
documenting his activity. However, in spite of several calls for evidence, the otherwise
voluminous record remains empty in this respect.

322. The Claimant's next submission, that Mr. Chijenok was “an office man who advised on

406

407

408

409

410

administrative issues such as tax and insurance” and who “provided analytical

410

marketing reports and information on local regulations”"”” is equally difficult to follow.

The record does not show that Mr. Chijenok had any expertise in insurance, tax, and

marketing matters. Indeed, the repeated changes in the Claimant's explanations of Mr.
Chijenok’s role tend to undermine the credibility of all of them.

323. In the circumstances, the Claimant has been unable to justify its substantial payments

to Mr. Chijenok (USD 95,000 to him personally; plus his shares of the USD 2,492,908
paid to the MPC Companies and the USD 774,781.40 paid to Lacey International). This
is all the more surprising as Mr. Rosenberg himself explained that the Consultants

provided “immense assistance”.*"'

324. The Tribunal notes that it is not disputed that Mr. Chijenok was the Principal Consultant

on Organizational and Personnel Policy of the Apparatus of the President of the
Republic of Uzbekistan.*’? In this capacity, he was responsible for the human
resources functions in the President’s Office.*** While in office, his responsibilities
included inter alia, examination of the qualifications of applicants for vacancies.*'* He
thus was in a position to influence appointments of candidates to official positions and
would be expected to have had contacts with many officials in the Government. At the
January Hearing, when asked whether he knew that Mr. Chijenok was working in the
Office of the President, Mr. Rosenberg replied: “I know that he was working in a high
position in an official position...”*'® These facts are corroborated by Mr. Mikhailov, who
testified that: “Mr. Chijenok accordingly had good contacts and relationships with most
senior officials in various ministries and departments of the Government of
Uzbekistan.”*"° Still other facts are indicative of Mr. Chijenok’s role. In 1997, it was Mr.
Chijenok’s office that requested Prime Minister Sultanov's opinion on the Claimant’s
proposed investment in Uzbekistan.“” Moreover, on 3 July 2000, merely three days
after leaving his position at the Government, Mr. Chijenok took over as Advisor of the
Representative Office of MPC in Tashkent.*'® Mr. Chijenok thus started working at
MPC five months before Claimant and MPC concluded the first consulting contract in
December 2000.

325. On the basis of its assessment of the entire evidentiary record, the Tribunal concludes

that: (i) Mr. Chijenok was involved in the Claimant's investment since 1998; (ii) he was

a government official at that time, and for some time thereafter; (iii) Mr. Rosenberg
admitted that he knew that Mr. Chijenok was employed in an “official position”; (iv) the
Claimant has not provided any plausible reason for making substantial payments to Mr.
Chijenok; and (v) Mr. Chijenok was hired as a consultant to use his official position to
assist the Claimant's investment. In the Tribunal's view, the only conclusion that can be
drawn from these facts is that Mr. Chijenok was paid to use his position in the Uzbek
government to facilitate the establishment of the Claimant’s investment.

These conclusions support the further conclusion that the Claimant acted in breach of
Articles 210-212 of the Uzbek Criminal Code. Indeed, contrary to the Claimant's
suggestion, there is no requirement that Mr. Chijenok’s official duties have included the
power to secure a government decision approving the investment. As commentaries
bear out, it is sufficient that the Claimant paid Mr. Chijenok to use his official position to
advance the Claimant's investment.

In summary, by paying Mr. Chijenok, a government official, to exercise his influence in
support of the Claimant's investment, the Claimant breached Articles 210-212 of the
Uzbek Criminal Code and, thereby the legality requirement contained in Article 1(1) of
the BIT.

ii. Mr. Sultanov

(i) Respondent's Position

In respect of Mr. Sultanov, the Respondent submits that there is no evidence that he
"did or was qualified to do anything for Claimant other than to provide the telephone
number of his brother, the Prime Minister".“‘° Mr. Sultanov "was not a consultant; he
was a conduit to his brother, the Prime Minister", who “took an unusual interest” in the
Claimant's investment.*”° For the Respondent, the following evidence is relevant in
relation to Mr. Sultanov:

i. When asked whether Mr. Sultanov had specific expertise to render the
services Mr. Rosenberg mentioned in his witness statement, Mr. Rosenberg
testified that he did not recall Mr. Sultanov’s “education” or “university
qualification,” but that “Mr. Sultanov was a very high appreciated person” and
“a businessman.”“*' In fact, the Respondent submits, Mr. Sultanov had not

worked in any capacity since April 1992. Prior to that he was a police
investigator, who had retired with the rank of Police Colonel;*”

While he asserted that Mr. Sultanov had business experience in molybdenum,
Mr. Rosenberg testified that he knew about this through hearsay and never
himself saw evidence of this experience. Further, witnesses in the
molybdenum industry had never heard of Mr. Sultanov being involved in the
industry;

Mr. Rosenberg asserted that the Claimant hired its consultants to assist “on
the ground”. However, from at least 2003 to 2009, i.e. during the time that
he allegedly acted as consultant, Mr. Sultanov lived in Germany, which Mr.
Mikhailov confirmed. Mr. Rosenberg himself testified that he would travel to
Germany ‘to meet with Mr. Sultanov, who resided there”;47>

When asked in this context how Mr. Sultanov could have rendered services
during the period when he resided abroad, Mr. Rosenberg testified that “[h]e
had the connections which were required,” and also “was traveling quite
often.” Thus, the Respondent submits “even though Mr. Sultanov could not
and did not perform independent services for Claimant, Claimant paid Mr.
Sultanov for his required connections to his brother, the Prime Minister, who
was the designated official in charge of monitoring the implementation of

Metal-Tech’s investment.”4”°

pondent submits that it is not relevant whether Mr. Sultanov kept his share of

the payments for himself*”” or whether he transmitted some or all of them to his

brother,

the Prime Minister, because Mr. Rosenberg admitted that the purpose of

paying Mr. Sultanov was to influence the Prime Minister to act in the Claimant's

interests. Metal-Tech’s compensation to Mr. Sultanov amounted to bribery, the

Respondent argues, because the ultimate purpose of the compensation was to secure

approval

of Metal-Tech’s investment.“

(ii) Claimant’s Position

330. According to the Claimant, the Respondent's submissions are mere inferences. The
Respondent implies that Metal-Tech’s employment of the Prime Minister’s brother as a

°° and insinuates that the Prime Minister’s decisions

consultant was somehow unlawful
in respect of Uzmetal might have been improperly influenced by Mr. Sultanov.“°
However, this is not the actual position. Mr. Mikhailov testified at the May Hearing that
there was no evidence that compensation to Mr. Sultanov was paid for any wrongful
purpose or that it was shared with his brother, the Prime Minister.**' He also stated that
he knew of no payment made to an Uzbek government official on behalf of Metal-Tech,
or for that matter, of any payment to any Government official using Metal-Tech’s
funds.** According to the Claimant, when asked whether payments were made to any
of the government officials who submitted written testimony in this case, Mr. Mikhailov
confirmed that he was unaware of any such payments.** In sum, the Claimant submits
that there is no evidence of any payment by Mr. Sultanov to any government official.

331. The Claimant also denies the Respondent's submission that Mr. Sultanov was paid
large sums for not rendering any services. According to Mr. Rosenberg, Mr. Sultanov
assisted with the preparation of the Feasibility Study, represented the Claimant in
negotiations that resulted in opening the letter of credit to Uzmetal, and performed
other services.“

332. In the Claimant's submission, the Respondent has not come close to proving bribery.
To constitute an offense of bribery under Article 211 of the Uzbek Criminal Code,
payment must be made or promised to a Government official. As it was not alleged that
Mr. Sultanov was a Government official, the payments made to him were obviously not
payments to an official for the purposes of the Uzbek Criminal Code. Further, pursuant
to the commentaries on which the Respondent relies, the Respondent must show not
only a payment to Mr. Sultanov, but also that: “(i) Metal-Tech’s direct intention in
compensating Mr. Sultanov was to induce favorable action or inaction in its favor by the
Prime Minister; [and] (ii) The Prime Minister knew that was the purpose of the payment

 

official may constitute a bribe even if it is not transferred to the official. Respondent's letter of 20 July

to his brother and gave his approval.”*° The Claimant submits that the Respondent
has not established these necessary elements.

333. First, the Respondent has not shown that the Claimant promised Mr. Sultanov, before
Resolution No. 15 was enacted, that he would be paid if the investment was approved.
This was confirmed by Mr. Mikhailov, when he testified that that the Claimant's first
payments to the Consultants (including Mr. Sultanov) started in 2001.“ Under the
December 2000 agreement, payment was contingent on future events — specifically
repayment of Uzmetal’s loans. According to the Claimant, "[the Consultants’]
agreement to such conditional terms is flatly inconsistent with any earlier unqualified
promise of payment in return for securing approval of the investment and explodes the
theory that Prime Minister Sultanov acted favorably towards Metal-Tech in the hopes
that his brother might receive a conditional forward-looking compensation contract
three years in the future.”**”

334. Second, there is similarly no evidence that "Metal-Tech’s intention in paying Mr.
Sultanov was to bribe the Prime Minister, or that the Prime Minister approved the
Claimant’s investment because his brother had been promised payments".* The
Respondent has adduced no evidence of any inappropriate act of the Prime Minister in
connection with Uzmetal. The investment approval was a deliberative process involving

0439

"a multitude of officials and institutions, and none of the officials who appeared as

witnesses confirmed the allegations of corruption.

335. The Claimant also notes that the Respondent offered no testimony by Mr. Sultanov
himself, "who would have been well-placed to know the purpose of the payments made
to him".““° In this connection, the Claimant relies on an ICC award in Case No. 6497,
where the tribunal held that a party who had not called a witness was to bear the
consequences. **'

336. Last, the Claimant submits that the Respondent has failed to prove that Prime Minister
Sultanov knew or could have known that, by compensating his brother, Metal-Tech
intended "to induce favorable action on his part, and that he approved this

arrangement".“” In addition, the Claimant also points out that no official was charged
with unlawful conduct in connection with its project.‘**

(iii) Analysis
337. The Consultant Sultanov, whose first name is Uygur, is the brother of Utkir Sultanov,
who was the Prime Minister of Uzbekistan from 21 December 1995 until 10 December
2003, and Deputy Prime Minister from then until 2006.“ Prime Minister Sultanov was
the Government official entrusted with the responsibility of monitoring the execution of
Resolution No. 15,“ which established the Claimant's investment in Uzbekistan. The
Respondent alleges that the Claimant paid Mr. Sultanov to use his family and other
relationships with Government officials to obtain approval for and protect Metal-Tech’s
investment. The Claimant objects stating that Mr. Sultanov was paid for legitimate
consulting activities.

338. The Claimant made substantial payments to Mr. Sultanov (USD 95,000 to him
personally; plus his shares of the USD 2,492,908 paid to the MPC Companies and the
USD 774,781.40 paid to Lacey International). A review of the record does not show any
legitimate services for which such compensation may have been paid.

339. First, the Tribunal notes that the reasons advanced for paying Mr. Sultanov such large
sums are unsupported by the facts on record. At the January Hearing, Mr. Rosenberg
testified that Mr. Sultanov was actively involved in the molybdenum business:

“A. This Mr. Sultanov and his associates were very active in
sales and business activities in molybdenum in Uzbekistan
during this time. They had connection both to Almalik and to
UzKTJM, and they have been exporting--buying, exporting, and
doing different--of molybdenum...”“°

“Q. Did they have relationships with officials of the Uzbek
Government that you thought would be useful?

implementation of this Decree.”); see Cabinet of Ministers Resolution No. 29-F dated 18 January 2000

“The fact that [the Consultants] have been dealing in the
molybdenum prior to the operation of Uzmetal. They had been
buying and selling from Almalik the low grade concentrate, and
they had been buying from Uzmetal — UzKTJM, sorry, the
finished product, whatever it was, and they exported it, so they
had vast experience in this field.”*

“Q. What about Mr. Sultanov? What benefits did he provide to
the company, to Metal-Tech, as opposed to Uzmetal?

A. First it was a group of these three individuals, Mr. Sultanov
was, as | said before, was very knowledgeable in the
molybdenum trading prior to the establishment of Uzmetal,
which actually Uzmetal took--replaced his--their trading with
molybdenum....”44°

340. At the May Hearing as well, Mr. Rosenberg repeatedly testified that Mr. Sultanov had
prior experience in molybdenum:

“| said three individuals, but as a matter of fact, and the same
one | was asked about the molybdenum project, | said three
individuals, but then | actually indicated there was one. /t was
Mr. Sultanov that was dealing it.*°°

341. He also testified that monies were paid to Mr. Sultanov in consideration for taking away
his molybdenum business:

“compensation for [the Consultants] losing the--their past
operation in the molybdenum. We will replace them. In that
way, Uzmetal replaced them.”**'

“[Y]ou would compensate them for the fact that you were taking
the molybdenum business away from them? Is that what you're
saying?

453

However, on later questioning, Mr. Rosenberg was less affirmative. He stated that he
“was informed” “®* of Mr. Sultanov’s participation in the molybdenum industry and never
himself saw evidence of this experience.“ In fact, Mr. Sultanov’s résumé and service
record reflect that he was an internal police investigator who retired after achieving the
rank of Police Colonel and that he has not worked in any capacity since April 1992.“%°
The record contains no evidence that he had any experience in the molybdenum
industry prior to his involvement with the Claimant.

Throughout the course of these proceedings, the Claimant has argued that only two
entities were involved in the molybdenum industry in Uzbekistan: AGMK and UzKTJM.
Given the small size of the industry, one would expect that all the actors in the
molybdenum industry would know one another. Mr. Rosenberg testified that Mr.
Sultanov was “very active in sales and business activities in molybdenum”*** that he
had “connection both to Almalik and to UzKTJM”*” and that the Consultants had
business dealings with both AGMK and UzKTJM.“%® Yet Mr. Tashmetov, the General
Director of UZKTJM in 2002 and 2003, testified that he was unaware of Mr. Sultanov
having worked in the molybdenum industry: “If the others had been involved in
molybdenum business, then they would have been involved with someone else. | have
not worked with these individuals.” Similarly, Mr. Sanakulov, the General Director of
AGMK from 2004 to 2007, stated in examination that “[t]hese last names are familiar to
me, but | had no idea that they were involved in molybdenum. No idea.”*°

In another effort to justify the substantial payments to Mr. Sultanov, Mr. Rosenberg
stated in his Third Witness Statement and at the May Hearing that the Consultants had
assisted in preparing the Feasibility Study.“°' However, here too, this assertion appears
unsupported by the record. Indeed, the letter on which Mr. Rosenberg’s statement
relies does not mention Mr. Sultanov.*® Similarly, the Draft Feasibility Study and the

Revised Feasibility Study list the various individuals involved in their preparation, but
Mr. Sultanov is not among them.“

345. Moreover, when he was asked whether Mr. Sultanov had any professional qualification
to perform the tasks that Mr. Rosenberg described in his witness statement, either as
an engineer, a construction manager, a metallurgist, a financial specialist, a tax
specialist, or a marketing specialist,“ Mr. Rosenberg replied that he did not recall Mr.
Sultanov’s “education” or “university qualification,” but that “Mr. Sultanov was a very
high appreciated person” and “a businessman.”“®° From his Service Record, it is
apparent that Mr. Sultanov lacked any professional qualification to perform the services
he is alleged to have provided.** Further, as mentioned above (210), Deputy Minister
Kanyazov’s statement that Mr. Sultanov was not and had never been listed in any of
the State registries for providing advocacy or tax consulting services was not
challenged.

346. As in the case of Mr. Chijenok, the Claimant has alleged that Mr. Sultanov was hired to
provide lobbying services.*®’ The observations made in this respect concerning Mr.
Chijenok apply equally to Mr. Sultanov (4321).

347. In addition, the chronology of events is telling when it comes to assessing the
corruption allegations and especially Mr. Sultanov's role. On 5 June 1997, the
Apparatus of the President (Mr. Chijenok’s office) requested Prime Minister Sultanov’s
opinion on the Claimant’s proposal for a joint venture project.*® Therefore, as early as
1997, the Claimant knew that Prime Minister Sultanov would likely be involved with its
prospective investment. Mr. Rosenberg understood this well. He explained that Prime
Minister Sultanov “was important to us since he was at the time elected to be
responsible on the foreign investment, and he was directly responsible... to look after
our project.”“® With this knowledge, the Claimant hired Mr. Sultanov in 1998 to help it
in establishing the joint venture. Mr. Rosenberg himself acknowledged the importance
of the family relationship: “[o]ne of the main figure... [was] Mr. Sultanov, who at the time

has been conducted by” Mr. Jonathan, Mr. Gdalyahu, Mr. Sela, and also Mr. Maimon).

was the brother of the Prime Minister”.*” And further: “it was helpful to Metal-Tech that
Mr. Sultanov, as the brother of the Prime Minister and a former Ministry of the Interior
official, had a direct relationship to many government officials and could open many
doors for us.”*”"

Later, in June 1999, when faced with difficulties concerning AGMK’s participation in the
proposed joint venture, the Claimant approached Prime Minister Sultanov to
“personally... meet” with the interested parties and asked him to resolve the issue.‘”* In
November 1999 (if not earlier, in August that year), the Claimant specifically requested
that the JV be supervised by Prime Minister Sultanov. Although this request was later
rejected, it is telling that the Claimant actively solicited the involvement of Prime
Minister Sultanov.

In January 2000, Resolution No. 15 was enacted, assigning to Prime Minister Sultanov
the role of supervising Uzmetal.‘”* It is also telling that the last payment to MPC (of
USD 182,054.50) and to Lacey (of USD 33,460.40) was made in April 2006, which was
the same month that Prime Minister Sultanov left his (then) position as Deputy Prime
Minister. Finally, it appears significant that Resolution No. 141 was enacted shortly
after Deputy Prime Minister Sultanov was released from that position.‘

Failing other justification for the substantial payments to Mr. Sultanov, and taking into
account the Prime Minister's personal involvement with the JV, the conclusion is
inescapable that the true motive for the high compensation was Mr. Sultanov's
relationship with the Prime Minister. In fact, Mr. Rosenberg did not conceal the
importance of this relationship:

“One of the main figure in this group of people were Mr.
Sultanov, who at the time was the brother of the Prime
Minister"*”°

“Q. What about Mr. Sultanov? What benefits did he provide to
the company, to Metal-Tech, as opposed to Uzmetal?

bodies. His brother was the Prime Minister at the time, so it

really was one of the persons that could facilitate closing red
tapes when the Company was initiated.”*”°

“We didn’t have any connection to the Government authorities
[and] needed somebody that will take us by our hand and show
us and pass us all these red tapes, institutes”*””

“Needless to say, it was helpful to Metal-Tech that Mr. Sultanov,
as the brother of the Prime Minister and a former Ministry of the
Interior official, had a direct relationship to many government
officials and could open many doors for us.”

351. On the basis of its review of the record, the Tribunal finds that (i) Mr. Sultanov was the
brother of the person who held the offices of Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister
from 1995 to 2006; (ii) Metal-Tech made substantial payments to Mr. Sultanov; (iii) Mr.
Sultanov was not qualified to perform the services for which he was allegedly retained;
(iv) there is no meaningful documentary evidence of any services rendered; and (v) the
odds turned against the Claimant shortly after Deputy Prime Minister Sultanov left the
Government. These facts impose the conclusion that Mr. Sultanov was paid to use his
family relationship to facilitate the establishment of Metal-Tech's investment in
Uzbekistan. This conclusion leads to the further conclusion that the Claimant acted in
breach of Articles 210-212 of the Uzbek Criminal Code. According to the commentaries
of these provisions, it is sufficient that the Claimant paid Mr. Sultanov to use his family
relations to further the Claimant's investment.

352. In summary, by paying Mr. Sultanov, the Claimant breached Articles 210-212 of the
Uzbek Criminal Code and, thereby, the legality requirement of Article 1(1) of the BIT.

iii. Mr. Ibragimov

(i) Respondent’s Position

353. According to the Respondent, the Claimant's payments to Mr. lbragimov were
suspiciously large (USD 900,000) and were made in return for services that have not
been proven or even explained. These payments were remitted through foreign
companies in a manner that links them to the payments made to Messrs Sultanov,
Chijenok, and Mikhailov. The Respondent emphasizes the following aspects:

4”8 Tr. 450:10-22 (emphasis added), see also Tr. 1635:22-1636:6.

“7 Tr 351:7-16.

ae Rosenberg WS Ill 7 (emphasis added). Further, when asked how Mr. Sultanov could have
performed services for Claimant if he was living abroad, Mr. Rosenberg testified that “[hJe had the
connections which were required” (Tr. 1635:22-1636:6). The Claimant also submitted that the
Consultants were mainly paid for “access to the relevant Government officials they afforded and, quite
frankly, for their ability to influence those Government officials.” (Tr. 1300:4-9).

121

i. An earlier project for which Mr. Ibragimov had managed the Claimant's

interests failed. Thus, according to the Respondent, Mr. Ibragimov’s business

experience was questionable.

ii. Mr. Rosenberg testified that he met Mr. Ibragimov in 1994, and that they had

made an oral agreement that Mr. lbragimov would receive 15% of Metal

Tech's net profit in any project. That understanding was subsequently modified

by the Consulting Services Agreement of 17 July 2003 between the Claimant

and Mr. lbragimov, which “substituted [the] oral agreement...made previously,

and lock[ed] in a fixed sum of money [payable to Mr. Ibragimov].”*”? The

Respondent stresses the following points about this agreement:

The agreement does not indicate what services Mr. Ibragimov is to
perform. Rather, it defines Mr. Ibragimov as the “consultant,” and
states that “the consultant is familiar with the company, provided and
provides consulting services to Metal-Tech regarding Uzmetal’s
activity.” This description, the Respondent submits, “is so vague as to
be meaningless and is prima facie evidence that Mr. Ibragimov did not

provide legitimate services”;

The contract contains Mr. Ibragimov’s declaration that he had received
payments of “the sums due to him” of USD 300,000 prior to 4 March
2002, that he “shall be entitled to part of the payments” to the Claimant
under the loan agreements, “if and when received, for a total up to
USD 500,000,” and that he “shall receive a total of US $100,000” from
2008 to 2009 in four installments.“®' Thus, according to the
Respondent, “[the Claimant] had to pay Mr. lbragimov — even if he did
nothing for the Claimant — as long as Uzmetal continued to make

payments under its loans.”4*

ii. The Claimant itself has provided no clear account of Mr. lbragimov's services.

In his first witness statement, Mr. Rosenberg did not mention Mr. Ibragimov.

Then, Mr. Rosenberg testified that Mr. Ibragimov “was instrumental in

122

launching the joint venture.”“° Further, the Claimant's counsel also noted that
Mr. Ibragimov was the “central figure” who helped implement the Claimant's
investment in Uzbekistan. Later, however, Mr. Rosenberg downplayed the
importance of Mr. Ibragimov. According to the Respondent, Mr. Rosenberg’s
later testimony was effectively that “[Mr. Ibragimov] was incapable of providing
the [assistance needed] to initiate the investment, and that [Mr. Rosenberg]
therefore turned to Messrs. Sultanov, Chijenok, and Mikhailov, who came up

with the idea of investing in the molybdenum industry.”4**

iv. Mr. Ibragimov’s yearly income from the consulting contract was approximately
USD 500,000. According to the Respondent, such compensation is high,
especially because payments were being made to Mr. Ibragimov for several
years while the JV struggled with its loan payments and did not make profits.

v. The Claimant failed to disclose USD 117,946 in payments to Mr. lbragimov,
including USD 54,657 paid on or before 4 March 2002, the date by which Mr.
Ibragimov was paid USD 300,000. Further, as of March 2002, Claimant paid
all of the money intended for Mr. Ibragimov to a succession of third-party
foreign companies. These companies, the Respondent points out, had bank
accounts at two banks in Riga, Latvia, but none of them was a legitimate
business. For example, Amber Trading Group LLC (to which the Claimant paid
at least USD 171,754 from 2002 to 2004), was declared “cancelled/void” in
2007. Similarly, other payees such as Trans Europe LLC and Nedler Trading
LLC (to which the Claimant paid at least USD 372,660 from 2005 to 2006)
have been administratively dissolved. Further, payments to another company,
Varmont Ventures Ltd. (to which the Claimant paid at least USD 92,400 from
2006 to 2007), are also questionable, as that company’s stated purpose is the
sale of human hair and wigs. Finally, the Respondent notes that Trans Europe
LLC and Nedler Trading LLC are both related to Lacey International, which,
being the payee under the February 2005 consulting contract, is in turn related
to the Consultants. *°

354. In light of these observations and of Mr. Rosenberg’s testimony that Messrs. Sultanov,

Chijenok, and Mikhailov — and not Mr. lbragimov — provided all of the assistance “on
the ground”, the Respondent submits that the Claimant has not even alleged a

123

legitimate basis for the amount of USD 900,000 paid to Mr. Ibragimov.“®® Accordingly,
the Respondent concludes that the purpose of these payments was to bribe
Government officials in order to obtain and maintain the Claimant's investment.

(ii) Claimant’s Position

355. The Claimant denies that it acted improperly in providing compensation to Mr.

Ibragimov. It submits that it paid all of Uzmetal’s General Directors an additional salary,
as this practice was “customary for large-scale projects that need to attract talented
expatriates to places like Uzbekistan, where local salaries do not reflect international
market rates.”4°” Mr. lbragimov's compensation was justified, the Claimant says,
because he was involved with Uzmetal from the beginning, and moreover was
responsible for bringing the project together.“

356. The Claimant argues that the Respondent has not identified any violation of Uzbek law

in respect of Mr. Ibragimov. For example, in its Reply, the Respondent merely
insinuated that Mr. Ibragimov had been paid an “exorbitant consulting fee” for engaging
in illicit transactions on Metal-Tech’s behalf. In its closing statement at the January
Hearing, the Respondent again attempted to create an impression of wrongdoing by
Mr. Ibragimov. However, here too, the Respondent did not state what its allegation

was.

357. In the Claimant's submission, Mr. lbragimov was paid for the substantial legitimate

consulting services which he provided to Metal-Tech. Mr. Rosenberg testified that Mr.
Ibragimov was “instrumental in launching the joint venture” by “bringing together the

parties”, among other services.“®° Mr. Mikhailov too “acknowledge[d] Mr. Ibragimov as

a legitimate business partner of Metal-Tech’, something which, according to the
Claimant, is further borne out by the contemporaneous evidence on record.**"

358. Finally, the Claimant emphasizes that the Respondent admits that it has not made its

case against Mr. Ibragimov. Indeed, at the January Hearing, the Respondent admitted
that it had not yet been able to determine “whether the payments to Ibragimov went to
others, were shared with some of the consulting team, or what happened to them.”

Although the Respondent indicated that it was “following up”, no evidence was
subsequently produced. “% As considerable time has since elapsed, the Claimant
submits that it can only be concluded that Mr. Ibragimov was a legitimate consultant.

(iii) Analysis
359. The Respondent's assessment is essentially that, as the Claimant has not accounted
for payments of USD 900,000 to Mr. Ibragimov, the Tribunal should conclude that the
purpose of these payments was to corrupt government officials. The Tribunal cannot
agree with this argument. It is true that the payments of USD 900,000 appear high in
relation to the services performed. However, it should be recalled that these payments
were first made under an oral agreement which was only later formalized in the

3,493

Consulting Services Agreement of 17 July 200: which agreement recognized that

payments were due to Mr. Ibragimov for past services.

360. Unlike the case with Messrs Sultanov and Chijenok, Mr. Ibragimov’s role in the
establishment of the Claimant's investment is well documented. Mr. Ibragimov was
Metal-Tech’s representative at the initial meetings with Uzbekistan to discuss the
creation of a joint venture in December 1998 and in 1999.*** Mr. Rosenberg testified
that Mr. Ibragimov was “instrumental in launching the joint venture,” and “was a special

case, as he was involved from the very beginning of this project and was credited with

495

bringing together the parties into...a successful joint venture. Mr. Ibragimov was

also Metal-Tech’s representative and Uzmetal’s General Director from January 2000
until January 2002, during which period a substantial portion of the payments (USD
245,343) were made. All of the general directors of Uzmetal received additional salary
from Metal-Tech.*%°

361. Further, all payments made to Mr. Ibragimov were either made under or documented in

the July 2003 Agreement, the existence of which was publicly disclosed.“” Such
disclosure weighs against any inference of an illegal purpose.

362. The Respondent observes that, at Mr. Ibragimov’s behest, the payments were made to

foreign entities linked to payments made to the Consultants and that the July 2003
contract does not specify the services performed or to be performed by Mr. lbragimov.
While these circumstances raise questions, they do not change the conclusion that
arises from the other facts on record. Unlike Mr. Sultanov, it is not alleged that Mr.
Ibragimov had relationships with ministers or other government officials. Unlike Mr.
Chijenok, Mr. lbragimov was not a government official himself at the time the Claimant
agreed to pay him. Moreover, Mr. Ibragimov's services are documented.

363. Moreover, the Respondent itself has recognized the weakness of its case against Mr.

Ibragimov. At the January Hearing, it stated that it did not know yet what had happened
to the sums paid to Mr. Ibragimov. Although it added that it expected to "have more on
that point,“ it has not substantiated its allegations since. This is all the more
noteworthy as in POs 3 and 5, the Tribunal ordered the disclosure of banking details in
respect of Mr. Ibragimov, and invited the Respondent to advise to the Tribunal of
relevant information acquired during the investigation that the authorities in Uzbekistan
were then pursuing concerning Mr. lbragimov.

364. In the circumstances, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent has shown no

breach of Uzbek law in respect of the payments to Mr. lbragimov. Grouping Mr.
Ibragimov along with the other Consultants, the Respondent merely makes a blanket
assertion that “where there is no evidence of any legitimate services having been
performed, the Tribunal should conclude that the purpose of all of these payments was
to corrupt Government officials.”“°° In the case of Mr. Ibragimov there is evidence of
legitimate services. While some facts surrounding payments to Mr. lbragimov may
raise doubts, they are insufficient to show a violation of Uzbek law.

iv. Mr. Mikhailov

365. The Tribunal does not understand the Respondent to have extended its allegations of

bribery to payments made to Mr. Mikhailov. It is true that the Respondent included Mr.
Mikhailov in a general statement asserting that the Claimant has paid more than USD

4.4 million to Messrs. Sultanov, Chijenok, Mikhailov, and Ibragimov, and argued that,
“where there is no evidence of any legitimate services having been performed, the
Tribunal should conclude that the purpose of all of these payments was to corrupt
Government officials in order to obtain and maintain Claimant's investment project.”>”
However, it has not developed this general statement in respect of Mr. Mikhailov and
the facts in the record do not support it. Consequently, the Claimant has understood
that, in the Respondent's submission, Mr. Mikhailov is the “one consultant not bribed by
Metal-Tech.”°°"

Considering that the Respondent raised no allegation in relation to Metal-Tech's
dealings with Mr. Mikhailov or, if — contrary to the Tribunal's understanding — the
Respondent meant to make an allegation, it has not substantiated it, and considering
further that no fact on record calls for ex officio scrutiny, the Tribunal will not engage in
a review of the Claimant's dealings involving Mr. Mikhailov.

v. | Messrs Shwa, Krespel, and Gurtovoi

Mr. Shwa was Uzmetal’s General Director from January 2000 until January 2002.

Mr. Krespel became Uzmetal’s Acting General Director in August 2002, and was its
General Director from November 2002 until September 2006, when he returned to
Israel to receive medical treatment. He negotiated and signed Export Contract No. 1
and all of its amendments on behalf of Uzmetal.°” Criminal proceedings were initiated
against him in Uzbekistan on 12 June 2006 on the ground that he had abused his
position of authority in Uzmetal and caused damage to Uzbekistan. When he left
Uzbekistan in the fall of 2006, Uzbekistan alleges, he was seeking to avoid criminal
charges. On 16 October 2006, he was formally charged as a criminal defendant and
the investigation was suspended until his return to Uzbekistan.°%°

When Mr. Krespel left Uzbekistan in the circumstances just described, no new General
Director of Uzmetal was appointed. Instead, Mr. Krespel delegated his powers to Mr.
Gurtovoi who, at the time, was Acting General Director. Mr. Gurtovoi continued in this
position until 2007, when the external bankruptcy manager took over the management
of Uzmetal.

374.

The Tribunal notes that Messrs Shwa, Krespel and Gurtovoi became associated with
the Uzmetal project after it was operational. It is not disputed that they played no role in
the establishment of the investment. Since the legality requirement in Article 1(1) of the
BIT is limited to conduct at the time when the investment was made, the Tribunal can
dispense with reviewing later events and actions, such as those involving Messrs
Shwa, Krespel and Gurtovoi.

In any event, the Tribunal notes that, in PO 4, in response to a document production
request seeking information concerning payments made to Messrs Shwa, Krespel, and
Gurtovoi, the Tribunal distinguished the situation of these individuals from the one of
Mr. Ibragimov. In particular, it noted that, unlike for Mr. Ibragimov, there were no
allegations of substantial payments and no consultancy agreements between Metal-
Tech and Messrs Shwa, Krespel, and Gurtovoi. The Tribunal also determined that the
Respondent could reasonably have been expected to ascertain whether Messrs Shwa,
Krespel or Gurtovoi received payments from the Claimant and, if so, to identify the
amounts paid. Subsequent to this determination, the Respondent has not made any
corruption allegations in respect of Messrs Shwa, Krespel, and Gurtovoi, and therefore,
there is no need for the Tribunal to pursue the matter.

vi. Conclusion

On the basis of the foregoing analysis, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that
corruption is established to an extent sufficient to violate Uzbekistan law in connection
with the establishment of the Claimant's investment in Uzbekistan. As a consequence,
the investment has not been “implemented in accordance with the laws and regulations
of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made” as required by
Article 1(1) of the BIT.

Uzbekistan’s consent to ICSID arbitration, as expressed in Article 8(1) of the BIT, is
restricted to disputes “concerning an investment.” Article 1(1) of the BIT defines
investments to mean only investments implemented in compliance with local law.
Accordingly, the present dispute does not come within the reach of Article 8(1) and is
not covered by Uzbekistan’s consent. This means that this dispute does not meet the
consent requirement set in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. Accordingly, failing
consent by the host state under the BIT and the ICSID Convention, this Tribunal lacks
jurisdiction over this dispute.

Having reached the conclusion that it lacks jurisdiction over the treaty claims, the
Tribunal can dispense with the analysis of the Respondent's other objections to

128

jurisdiction and admissibility in respect of these claims, including the objections based
on the violation of international public policy and transnational principles as well as on
fraud.

Cc. JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTIONS TO UZBEK LAW CLAIMS

375. In addition to the treaty claims, the Claimant has initially raised claims arising from the
violation of customary international law as well as claims concerning violations of
Uzbek law. In the course of the proceeding, it withdrew the claims derived from
customary international law.° Thus, the Tribunal will limit its review to the objections
against the claims based on violations of Uzbek law.

376. The Claimant submits that "even if Uzbekistan did not violate the standards of
treatment set forth in the BIT, Uzbekistan is liable for violating several of its own foreign
investment laws, whose standards of treatment are incorporated into the BIT through
Article 11."°°° Thus, the Claimant pursues its Uzbek law claims®® in reliance on Article
11 of the BIT.

377. Article 11 of the BIT states that if Uzbek or international law provide more favorable
protections to investments than the Treaty, then these protections shall prevail:

“If the provisions of law of either Contracting Party or obligations
under international law existing at present or established
hereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to the
present Agreement contain rules, whether general or specific,
entitling investments by Investors of one Contracting Party to a
treatment more favorable than is provided for by the present

54 Mem. M. n.314 (acknowledging that “[b]jecause the relevant norms are subsumed within

Uzbekistan’s BIT obligations, the Tribunal need not determine liability for violations of customary
international law separately from its consideration of Metal-Tech’s treaty claims.”).

°° Mem. M. $200.

5°8 The Tribunal notes that in its Request for Arbitration, the Claimant mentioned several violations of
Uzbek Law: Articles 9, 10 and 19 on the Law on Foreign Investments, Articles 3 and 5 of the Law on
Guarantees and Resolution No. 548 (RA 436). In its later submissions, the Claimant added a claim
concerning violation of Article 18 of the Law on Foreign Investments, and did not pursue and/or
establish its claims concerning Articles 9, 10 and 19 of the Law on Foreign Investments, Article 5 of
the Law on Guarantees or Resolution No. 548 (Mem. M. §§200-205 (footnote 378, however refers to
Articles 9 and 10 Law on Foreign Investments and 3 and 5 Law on Guarantees); Reply M. 49246 and
253; C-PHB 1 §108-109). In fact, the Claimant did not specifically object to the Respondent's position
that the Claimant had abandoned all its Uzbek law claims excluding the claims in respect of Article 3 of
the Law on Guarantees and Article 18 of the Foreign Investment Law (C-Mem. M. 560). Thus, the
Tribunal understands that there are only two Uzbek law bases for claims advanced by the Claimant:
Article 3 of the Law on Guarantees, and Article 18 of the Foreign Investment Law.

129

378.

379.

380.

381.

382.

Agreement, such rules shall to the extent that they are more
favorable prevail over the present Agreement” (emphasis
added).

The Tribunal understands Article 11 to refer to non-treaty substantive protections and
to open the access to dispute settlement under the Treaty, specifically under Article 8
of the BIT, for claims deriving from such substantive protections. Indeed, Article 8 of
the Treaty contains the consent of the Contracting Parties to submit to ICSID any "any
legal dispute ... concerning an investment of the latter in the territory of the former."
Article 8 is thus a broad dispute resolution clause not limited to claims arising under the
standards of protection of the BIT.

Article 8, like Article 11, refers to investments as defined in Article 1(1) of the Treaty. As
was seen above, Article 1(1) contains a legality requirement which the Claimant's
investment does not fulfill. Consequently, the Respondent has not given its consent in
Article 8 to arbitrate claims based on Article 11 in combination with Uzbek law. Put
simply, the illegality in the Claimant's investment bars jurisdiction over claims based on
Article 11 of the Treaty. Given this conclusion, there is no need for the Tribunal to
engage in a comparison of "favorability" of the protections existing under national law
and under the BIT.

Therefore, the Claimant cannot rely on Article 11 in conjunction with Article 8 of the BIT
as a basis for advancing its Uzbek law claims. Having reached this conclusion, the
Tribunal can dispense with analysing the admissibility and/or merits of the Claimant's
Uzbek law claims.

The Claimant also relies on Article 10 of the Law of Guarantees to submit that
“Uzbekistan has consented to ICSID arbitration of claims arising under its Foreign
Investment Laws in the Laws themselves.”®” In effect, the Claimant contends that the
Tribunal has jurisdiction to entertain the Claimant's Uzbek law claims, not only on the
basis of the Treaty, but also of Article 10 of the Law of Guarantees. For its part, the
Respondent submits that Article 10 of the Law on Guarantees does not provide the
basis for any such jurisdiction.°°

Article 10 of the Law of Guarantees provides:

5°7 Mem. M. 280.
598 C-Mem. M. n.1736.

130

“Disputes associated with foreign investments (investment
dispute) directly or indirectly, can be settled on agreement of
the parties by consultation between them. If the parties will not
be able to achieve agreed settlement, than such dispute should
be settled either by an economic court of the Republic of
Uzbekistan or by arbitration in accordance with the rules and
procedures of international agreements (conventions) on
settlement of investment disputes, to which the Republic of
Uzbekistan has been joined.

The parties involved in investment dispute can, on mutual
agreement, determine the authority settling such dispute, as
well as a county which can execute arbitration legal procedure
of investment dispute.”*”

383. To the Tribunal, Article 10 does not embody Uzbekistan's consent to submit disputes to
ICSID arbitration independently of the BIT. Paragraph (1) of Article 10 merely states
that a dispute which the Parties are unable to resolve amicably may be resolved by the
Economic Court of Uzbekistan or through arbitration. It contains no expression of
consent to a particular arbitral mechanism. More specifically, it embodies no offer by
the State to submit to dispute settlement in the ICSID framework; ICSID is not even
mentioned. The Tribunal notes that statutory provisions more specific than Article 10 —
even provisions expressly naming ICSID — have been held not to contain state consent
to ICSID arbitration.*"°

384. The second paragraph of Article 10 seems to the Tribunal to make it clear that “mutual
agreement” of the Parties is required to determine the arbitral authority to settle a
dispute. Thus, an agreement is needed designating an arbitral forum before a dispute
can be brought before that forum. In other words, Article 10 does not entitle the
investor to commence arbitral proceedings before ICSID, unless the state has
consented to ICSID beyond the general mention of arbitration in Article 10(1). As in

508 Although the Claimant cites Exh. R-15, which contains the text just quoted, the Claimant

reproduces Article 10 in a shorter version, which differs from the longer version for reasons which the
Tribunal has not been able to elucidate: "If the parties are not able to reach an amicable resolution,
such a dispute shall be resolved by the Economic Court of the Republic of Uzbekistan, or by
arbitration in accordance with the rules and procedures of the international agreements (treaties and
conventions) on settlement of investment disputes into which the Republic of Uzbekistan has entered."
(Mem. M. 9280).

131

Biwater, the Tribunal considers that the words "on mutual agreement" preclude relying
on the Law of Guarantees as a standing unilateral offer to arbitrate which can be
accepted by the investor.*"'

385. One could of course argue that Uzbekistan gave its consent to ICSID jurisdiction as
required by Article 10 of the Law on Guarantees through Article 8(1) of the Treaty. This
argument would, however, not further the Claimant's case: the Tribunal has already
held (section IV.B.6(c)(vi)) that Uzbekistan has not consented to arbitrate this particular
dispute in Article 8(1) of the Treaty.

386. In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that Uzbekistan has not consented to ICSID
jurisdiction through Article 10 of the Law of Guarantees and, therefore, the Tribunal
lacks jurisdiction over claims brought on this basis.

387. The Tribunal notes that in the initial stages of the arbitration, the Claimant seemed to
share this view. Indeed, in the Claimant’s Request for Arbitration, the Claimant
submitted that the Respondent “expressed its consent in Article 8 of the Israel-
Uzbekistan Bilateral Investment Treaty.”*"? Despite mentioning several provisions of
the Law on Guarantees, the Claimant nowhere stated that Uzbekistan had also
consented to ICSID jurisdiction under Article 10 of that Law. In fact, in its early
correspondence with the Tribunal, the Claimant appeared to have ruled out that the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction was founded on a domestic investment law.*"?

388. For these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Article 10 of the Law of Guarantees
does not provide the basis of consent to ICSID jurisdiction. Therefore, the Tribunal has
no jurisdiction over the Uzbek law claims.

D. CONCLUSION ON CLAIMS

389. As a result of the foregoing analysis, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over Metal-Tech's
treaty claims as well as over Metal-Tech's claims based on Uzbek law. While reaching

the conclusion that the claims are barred as a result of corruption, the Tribunal is
sensitive to the ongoing debate that findings on corruption often come down heavily on
claimants, while possibly exonerating defendants that may have themselves been
involved in the corrupt acts. It is true that the outcome in cases of corruption often
appears unsatisfactory because, at first sight at least, it seems to give an unfair
advantage to the defendant party. The idea, however, is not to punish one party at the
cost of the other, but rather to ensure the promotion of the rule of law, which entails
that a court or tribunal cannot grant assistance to a party that has engaged in a corrupt
act.

In this context, the Tribunal believes it should acknowledge the co-operative attitude of
Metal-Tech and its Chairman and CEO. Mr. Rosenberg was forthcoming and willing to
provide responses to the questions raised by the Parties and by the Tribunal. Indeed,
the Tribunal has no doubt that the Claimant did all it could to produce relevant and
contemporaneous documents to justify the services rendered by the Consultants. The
fact is that it was unable to do so, which contributed to the Tribunal’s reaching the
conclusions set forth above.

COUNTERCLAIMS

The Respondent's request for relief includes the prayer that "[t]he Tribunal, in addition
[to dismissing the claims], should grant Respondent's counterclaims.”*"* Accordingly,
the Tribunal will now proceed to consider the counterclaims.

. Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that its counterclaims fall within the Centre’s jurisdiction and
the Parties’ consent to arbitration provided in Article 8(1) of the BIT. It also asserts that
the counterclaims arise directly out of the subject matter of the dispute pursuant to
Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and Article 40(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. In
support of this proposition, the Respondent relies on Saluka v. Czech Republic, where
the tribunal explained that the “language of Article 8, in referring to ‘all disputes,’ is wide
enough to include disputes giving rise to counterclaims” and that “the need for a
dispute, if it is to fall within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, to be ‘between one Contracting

54 C-Mem. M. 2. See also R-PHB 1 9594; R-PHB 2 436.

393.

394.

395.

Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party’ carries with it no implication that

Article 8 applies only to disputes in which it is an investor which initiates claims.”5"°

It is the Respondent's submission that, as a result of the Claimant’s unlawful actions
and because the State has an ownership interest in AGMK and UzKTJM, the
Respondent has suffered damages due to the Claimant’s misrepresentations. Such
damages are in the form of "lost revenue that it would have earned had AGMK
received market price for its molybdenum middlings; lost revenue that it would have
received had Uzmetal manufactured and exported high value-added products; lost
revenue that it would have received had Uzmetal extracted rhenium and osmium for
AGMK; lost revenue that it would have received had Uzmetal entered into tolling
agreements with UzKTJM; revenue lost as a result of UZKTJM’s bankruptcy due to
Uzmetal’s failure to sell it required volumes of trioxide and to enter into tolling
agreements; and revenue lost as a consequence of Uzmetal having purchased
overvalued goods and services from the Claimant under the Construction Contract".5"
In addition, the Respondent submits that it has suffered direct damage arising from lost
tax, custom revenue and foreign exchange as a result of the Claimant's
misrepresentations and other violations of Uzbek law, as well as other consequential
damages, such as increased unemployment among its citizens.”

The Respondent denies the Claimant's allegations that its counterclaims are “vague
and undeveloped”. According to the Respondent, ICSID Arbitration Rule 40(2) merely
requires that a counterclaim be presented no later than in the counter-memorial. The
rule "does not provide a standard for the amount of factual detail required to maintain a

counterclaim."*"

In response to the Claimant's argument that the counterclaims are premised on
contractual losses suffered by AGMK or UzKTJM, the Respondent notes that it does
not seek recovery of the contractual losses suffered by these entities. The
counterclaims seek compensation for losses suffered by the Respondent as a State
and as a shareholder in AGMK and UzKTJM. Further, the Respondent’s counterclaims
do not arise out of contract. They are based on Article 8(1) of the BIT, which is broad

Counterclaim of 7 May 2004 (hereafter “Sa/uka”), 439.

enough to cover the counterclaims, as “they arise directly out of the investment at issue

rather than out of non-compliance with the general law of Uzbekistan.”*"

396. In answer to the Claimant’s further argument that the Respondent's counterclaims are

premised on the Claimant's failures to pay certain taxes and custom duties, the

Respondent stresses that its claims are not for tax or customs fraud or for the recovery

of tax or custom dues. Instead, the counterclaims concern “the damage caused to

Respondent by Claimant's fraudulent misrepresentations, breach of fundamental
» 520

investment obligations, and fraudulent transfer-pricing scheme”, which misconduct
relates to, and arises out of, the investment at issue.

397. The Respondent also submits that it does not seek to enforce its own tax or custom

laws. Instead, it is seeking to recover for injuries directly sustained by it on account of
the Claimant's breach of the investment obligations and fraudulent misconduct. Put
differently, the counterclaims seek the amounts that the Respondent would have
received had the Claimant fulfilled its investment obligations. Consequently, the
Claimant’s objection that the counterclaims are “premised on obligations and duties
contained in a host state’s domestic law” is wrong. In support, the Respondent relies on
the decision in Amco Asia.**'

398. Finally, the Respondent submits that its counterclaims must be admitted “because the

reciprocal obligations at the center of both the claims and counterclaims have a

“common origin”,°*

namely Resolutions Nos. 15 and 29-F. These instruments were
executed to realize a successful joint venture, and both claims and counterclaims arise
out of the Claimant’s and the Respondent's interpretations of these instruments as well

as conduct of the Parties concerned with the joint venture.

399. For all of these reasons, argues the Respondent, the Tribunal should “uphold its

jurisdiction over Respondent's counterclaims, find the Claimant liable for the damage
caused by its unlawful, fraudulent misconduct and breach of its fundamental
investment obligations, and set a date for further briefing on the quantification of the

damage owing to the Respondent”.*”°

2. Claimant’s Position

. According to the Claimant, Uzbekistan has failed to state viable counterclaims, simply
enumerating seven counterclaims in a single paragraph. The Claimant submits that the
Respondent's counterclaims must be rejected for three main reasons: (i) the
counterclaims are inadequately pled; (ii) Uzbekistan lacks standing to bring derivative
claims on behalf of UZKTJM and AGMK; and (iii) the one counterclaim not brought on
behalf of UZKTJM or AGMK is outside the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. In addition,
because the counterclaims appear to be premised on the very same arguments that
form the basis of Uzbekistan’s defense on the merits and objection to jurisdiction,
Uzbekistan’s counterclaims fail on the merits for the same reasons that Uzbekistan’s
defenses and jurisdictional objections fail. In any event according to the Claimant, the
counterclaims must be dismissed as they are too vague to permit a substantive
response. The Claimant would be prejudiced if they are allowed to stand.

First, the Claimant insists that the Respondent's counterclaims cannot be maintained
because Uzbekistan’s articulation in one paragraph of its Counter-Memorial on Merits
of seven assorted theories is insufficient to satisfy the requirement of ICSID Arbitration
Rule 40(2).°* That rule requires that counterclaims be presented no later than in the
counter-memorial. Uzbekistan’s defense that Rule 40(2) “does not provide a standard
for the amount of factual detail required to maintain a counterclaim” is not convincing
as Rule 40(2) does incorporate a standard of specificity adequate to give the opposing
party a fair opportunity to respond.°>

Second, the Claimant contends that Uzbekistan lacks standing to pursue counterclaims
for lost revenues on behalf of AGMK and UzKTJM, which are not organs of Uzbekistan
or parties to this arbitration. AGMK and UzKTJM may assert claims for lost revenue, if
at all, in an appropriate forum. The Respondent's submission that its counterclaims are
not brought on behalf of AGMK or UZKTJM, but rather on Uzbekistan’s own behalf for
losses suffered as AGMK and UzKTJM’s shareholder is wrong. In support of its
propositions, the Claimant relies on Hamester v. Ghana, where the Tribunal denied a

403. Third, the Claimant submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to entertain Uzbekistan’s
counterclaims seeking “lost tax and custom revenue and foreign exchange” and
“consequential damages, such as increased unemployment”.®”” The legal basis of
these counterclaims is the violation of Uzbek law. It involves rights and obligations
which are applicable to persons subject to Uzbekistan’s jurisdiction. These
counterclaims are not directly concerned with the Claimant’s investment. Neither are
they directly concerned with the subject matter of the dispute which deals with the
Respondent's violations of international law. For these reasons, contrary to the
Respondent's assertion, Article 8(1) of the BIT is not sufficiently broad to include
Uzbekistan’s consent to arbitrate these counterclaims.°”

404. Finally, the Claimant submits that the counterclaims based on “Claimant’s
misrepresentations and other violations of Uzbek law” are vague and speculative.
According to the Claimant, Uzbekistan has not connected the claimed
misrepresentations to the losses it allegedly suffered. The Claimant submits that “[t]he
generalized references to misrepresentations and the bare listing of alleged losses do
not provide enough information regarding the basis for Uzbekistan’s counterclaims to
allow the Claimant to form a substantive response.”*° The counterclaims should
therefore be dismissed as they have been insufficiently pled.

3. Analysis

405. Article 46 of the ICSID Convention allows for counterclaims in the following terms:

“Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall, if
requested by a party, determine any incidental or additional claims or
counterclaims arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute
provided that they are within the scope of the consent of the parties
and are otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.”

406. Rule 40 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules gives further specifications:

“(1) Except as the parties otherwise agree, a party may present an
incidental or additional claim or counter-claim arising directly out of
the subject-matter of the dispute, provided that such ancillary claim is
within the scope of the consent of the parties and is otherwise within
the jurisdiction of the Centre.

(2) An incidental or additional claim shall be presented not later than
in the reply and a counter-claim no later than in the counter-memorial,
unless the Tribunal, upon justification by the party presenting the
ancillary claim and upon considering any objection of the other party,
authorizes the presentation of the claim at a later stage in the
proceeding.”

As a result, two conditions must be met for an ICSID tribunal to entertain a
counterclaim: (i) the counterclaim must be within the jurisdiction of the Centre, which
includes the requirement of consent, and (ii) it must “aris[e] directly out of the subject-
matter of the dispute”, the second requirement also being known as_ the
“connectedness” requirement. Essentially, the second requirement supposes a
connection between the claims and the counterclaims. It is generally deemed an
admissibility and not a jurisdictional requirement.

The first requirement relates to jurisdiction and, in this respect, singles out the condition
of consent. The conditions for jurisdiction in ICSID arbitration are found in Article 25 of
the ICSID Convention and include the existence of a legal dispute and of an
investment, nationality, and consent. Subject to consent, these conditions are not
controversial here, and rightly so. The Tribunal must thus focus on consent.

In treaty arbitration, consent is achieved by the respondent State making an offer to
arbitrate when ratifying the investment treaty and the investor accepting that offer in
principle when filing the request for arbitration. The scope of the State’s offer is defined
in the investment treaty, in particular in the dispute resolution clause of that treaty.
When he initiates an arbitration under the treaty, the investor accepts the offer within
the scope defined in the treaty. If he chooses to resort to ICSID arbitration as one of
the dispute settlement options in the treaty, the investor also accepts the conditions set
in the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules.

In the present case, the dispute resolution provision in the BIT provides that “[eJach
Contracting Party hereby consents to submit to the International Centre for the
Settlement of Investment Disputes [...] any legal dispute arising between that
Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contracting Party concerning
an investment [...]” (emphasis added). Thus, Article 8(1) of the BIT is not restricted to
disputes initiated by an investor against a Contracting Party. It covers any dispute
about an investment.

138

411. The next question then is whether the counterclaims "concern an investment". The
definition of the term investment is found in Article 1(1) of the BIT. It includes a legality
requirement. As the Tribunal has concluded above, the Claimant’s “investment” does
not meet the legality requirement and thus does not constitute an investment in the
meaning of the BIT. In other words, the State’s offer to arbitrate did not extend to this
“non-investment” and the investor's acceptance included this limitation.

412. The Tribunal notes that its reference to the BIT condition of consent is in conformity
with the wording of Article 46 of the ICSID Convention that insists on consent. It is
further in line with the travaux préparatoires according to which Article 46 of the

Convention was “in no way intended to extend the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal”.°°°

531

It is similarly in accord with the decisions in Saluka,°°' Roussalis v. Romania ,°* and to

a major extent to Goetz v. Burundi.*°

413. It follows from the foregoing discussion that the first requirement set in Article 46 of the
ICSID Convention which relates to jurisdiction, including consent, is not met. As a
consequence of its having no jurisdiction over the claims, this Tribunal has no
jurisdiction over the counterclaims. It will thus abstain from reviewing whether the
counterclaims meet the second requirement of Article 46 dealing with admissibility and
demanding a connection with the claims. It will also abstain from analyzing whether the
counterclaims are well-founded and in particular whether they were sufficiently pled.

not disputed that Respondent expressed its consent to arbitration in the BIT and that Claimant
accepted Romania’s offer to arbitrate. Contrary to Claimant however, Respondent considers that such
consent included consent to arbitrate counterclaims. Whether it is so must be determined in the first
place by reference to the dispute resolution clause contained in the BIT. The investor's consent to the
BIT’s arbitration clause can only exist in relation to counterclaims if such counterclaims come within
the consent of the host State as expressed in the BIT.”)

583 Antoine Goetz and Consorts and another v Republic v Burundi, \CSID Case No ARB/01/2, Award,
9276 et. seq. While Goetz refers to the BIT conditions of consent, and in particular to the definition of
investment under the BIT, towards the end of its analysis it appears to endorse the dissenting opinion
of Professor Reisman in Roussalis, according to whom “[w]hen the States Parties to a BIT contingently
consent, inter alia, to ICSID jurisdiction, the consent component of Article 46 of the Washington
Convention is ipso facto imported into any ICSID arbitration which an investor elects to pursue”
(Spyridon Roussalis v. Romania, |\CSID Case No. ARB/06/1, Declaration of Prof. Reisman, 28
November 2011). The Tribunal understands the endorsement of the Goetz tribunal to refer to a
situation in which the dispute settlement clause only grants the right to bring claims to the investor.

COSTS

414. The Claimant's total costs incurred in connection with these proceedings amount to

USD 1,687,966.86, comprising legal fees and expenses of USD 1,112,966.86 and
payments to ICSID of USD 575,000.00. The Respondent's costs in connection with this
arbitration were USD 7,985,954.95, comprising legal fees and expenses of USD
7,435,954.95 and payments to ICSID of USD 575,000.00.

415. Each Party has asked that their costs be borne by the other Party. In its Memorial on

Costs, the Claimant requested “an award of the costs it has incurred in connection with
this arbitration, plus interest accrued until the date any such cost award is paid.”** For
the event that the Respondent would prevail, the Claimant submitted that the Tribunal
“should order the Parties to bear their own costs, with two exceptions: Respondent
should be ordered to pay the costs of both Parties, the Tribunal, and ICSID that are
attributable to (i) Respondent’s procedural decisions that are directly responsible for
the inefficiency and increase in costs of this proceeding and (ii) the untimely and
inefficient manner in which Respondent raised its jurisdictional allegations of

corruption.”°°5

416. In its Reply submission on costs, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to award the

Respondent “all of its costs, plus interest from the date of the Award.”®%

417. The Parties agree that conduct in the proceedings is a basis to shift costs from one

534

535

536

537

party to the other. Both Parties have pointed to examples of procedural conduct in an
endeavor to convince the Tribunal to award their costs. The Claimant requests the
Tribunal to adopt a “totality-of-the-circumstances” approach in awarding costs and to
bear in mind inter alia: “Respondent's baseless request for a sweeping confidentiality
order, its untimely claim to equal time division at the January hearing (despite the
Tribunal having already ruled on an allocation of time), its error-ridden submissions, its
mischaracterization of the record and failure to produce important exhibits, its 1009
pages of redirect documents, and its tactical decision to submit duplicative witness
statements and unqualified fact and expert witness testimony.”®’ Similarly, the
Respondent requests the Tribunal to award its costs as inter alia the Claimant

demanded arbitration in bad faith and with unclean hands; the Claimant refused the
Respondent's request to bifurcate the proceedings requiring the Respondent to defend
the Claimant's frivolous claims on merits; and the Claimant was solely responsible for
the May Hearing.

Under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, “the Tribunal shall, except as the parties
otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the
proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and
expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of
the Centre shall be paid.” This provision establishes the Tribunal’s discretion in
allocating the ICSID arbitration costs and the Parties' costs incurred in connection with
the arbitration, including legal fees.

Two approaches may be discerned in awarding costs in ICSID arbitrations. Some
tribunals apportion ICSID costs in equal shares and rule that each party should bear its
own costs. Others apply the principle pursuant to which “costs follow the event”, with
the result that the party that does not prevail bears all or part of the costs of the

proceedings, including those of the other party.°°*

In the circumstances of this case, the Tribunal believes that each Party should bear its
own costs and the Parties should share the ICSID costs. In this latter respect, it is
noted that the ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a statement of the case
account in due course.

The reasons for the Tribunal’s determination on the allocation of costs are essentially
the following. It is true that the Respondent prevails. At the same time, it is also true
that the Claimant sought to minimize the costs of the proceedings, which is not the
case of its opponent, as the disparity of the cost figures shows. The choice not to
bifurcate jurisdiction and liability, but only quantum, does not plead against the
Tribunal’s apportionment. Indeed, if jurisdiction was not bifurcated it is because the
Respondent's objections addressed facts that related to both jurisdiction and merits.

More important, the Tribunal’s determination is linked to the ground for denial of
jurisdiction. The Tribunal found that the rights of the investor against the host State,
including the right of access to arbitration, could not be protected because the
investment was tainted by illegal activities, specifically corruption. The law is clear —

588 See e.g., Plama 9321-322.

141

and rightly so — that in such a situation the investor is deprived of protection and,
consequently, the host State avoids any potential liability. That does not mean,
however, that the State has not participated in creating the situation that leads to the
dismissal of the claims. Because of this participation, which is implicit in the very nature
of corruption, it appears fair that the Parties share in the costs.

Vi. DECISION

423. For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal makes the following decision:

a. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the claims and the counterclaims before it;

b. The costs of the proceedings, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal
and the fees of ICSID, shall be borne by the Parties in equal shares;

c. Each Party shall bear the legal fees and other expenses it incurred in connection
with the arbitration; and,

d. All other requests for relief are dismissed.
