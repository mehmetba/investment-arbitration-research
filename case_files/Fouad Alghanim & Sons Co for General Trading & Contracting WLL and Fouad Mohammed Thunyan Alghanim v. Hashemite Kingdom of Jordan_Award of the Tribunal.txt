INTRODUCTION

The present dispute is submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes (ICSID) pursuant to the Agreement between the Government of the Hashemite
Kingdom of Jordan and the Government of the State of Kuwait for the Encouragement and
Reciprocal Protection of Investments (the BIT).?

The First Claimant is Fouad Alghanim & Sons Co for General Trading & Contracting WLL
(FASGTC), a company registered in Kuwait and carrying on business as part of a diversified
conglomerate. The Second Claimant is Mr Fouad Mohammed Thunyan Alghanim (Mr
Alghanim), a Kuwaiti national and the majority shareholder in and Chairman of FASGTC.
FASGTC and Mr Alghanim are jointly referred to herein as Claimants.

The Respondent is the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (Jordan).

The present arbitration concerns the Claimants’ interest in Umniah Telecommunications and
Technology LLC (UTT), a limited liability company registered in Jordan, in which the Claimants
have an interest (along with others who are not parties to the present arbitration). UTT was
used as a vehicle to hold a 66% interest in Umniah Mobile Company, PSC (UMC), a company
registered in Jordan. In 2004, UMC was awarded a licence to operate the third public mobile
telecommunications network in Jordan. In 2006, UTT sold its majority stake in UMC to a
Bahraini company, Bahrain Telecommunications Company (Batelco) for approximately
US$292 million and distributed its gain on the sale to its shareholders. In 2008, the directors
and shareholders of UTT resolved to place it into voluntary liquidation.

In the same year, the Income and Sales Tax Department of Jordan (ISTD) assessed UTT as liable
for income tax on the sale of the shares in UMC of approximately US$81 million (the Tax
Measure). UTT challenged that assessment through the Jordanian courts but was not
successful, with its final appeal being rejected by the Court of Cassation on 25 April 2012.

The Claimants allege that the Taxation Measure has no basis in Jordanian law and was
imposed in response to public disquiet at the quantum of UTT’s profit on the sale of its interest
in UMC. They have brought the present arbitration alleging that the Tax Measure was arbitrary
and breached a number of the substantive guarantees given by Jordan in the BIT.

The Respondent contests the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over the dispute. On the merits, it
maintains that the tax was lawfully imposed and that the Claimants’ allegations that the
Taxation Measure was arbitrary and politically motivated are unfounded. In those
circumstances, the Respondent maintains that it committed no breaches of the BIT, and the
Claimants’ claims on the merits must be dismissed.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

 

Request for arbitration and constitution of the Tribunal

On 11 December 2013, ICSID received a request for arbitration dated 4 December 2013,
together with Appendix 1 through Appendix 9 from the Claimants against the Respondent (the
Request).

On 24 December 2013, the Secretary-General registered the Request in accordance with
Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice
of the Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an
arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID’s Rules of Procedure
for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.

On 13 March 2014, the Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Article
37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention as follows: the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators,
with one arbitrator appointed by each Party, and the third, presiding arbitrator appointed by
agreement of the Parties. In the event that the Parties could not agree on a presiding
arbitrator, the appointment would be made by the two party-appointed arbitrators in
consultation with the Parties, failing which, ICSID would be asked to make the appointment.

The Tribunal is composed of Professor Campbell McLachlan, QC, a national of New Zealand,
as president, appointed by agreement of the party-appointed arbitrators in consultation with
the parties; the Honourable L. Yves Fortier PC CC OQ QC, a national of Canada, appointed by
the Claimants; and Professor Marcelo Kohen, a national of Argentina, appointed by the
Respondent.

On 27 June 2014, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of
Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the Arbitration Rules), notified the Parties that all
three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore
deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms Aissatou Diop, ICSID Legal Counsel, was
designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

On 15 October 2015, by agreement with the Parties, Mr Jack L W Wass was appointed
Assistant to the Tribunal on Terms of Appointment executed by the Tribunal, the Parties and
Mr Wass on that date.

First Session and application for provisional measures

Following the constitution of the Tribunal, the Claimants on 15 September 2014 filed a request
for the grant of provisional measures in accordance with Article 47 of the ICSID Convention.
The Claimants sought an order restraining certain proceedings taken in Jordan against the
Claimants and other parties. Those proceedings concerned the enforcement of the Tax
Measure underlying the present proceedings. The Claimants submitted that provisional
measures were necessary to protect the exclusivity of the present arbitral proceedings
guaranteed by Article 26 of the Convention. The Respondent filed observations on that
request on 28 September 2014.

15. On 2 October 2014, the Tribunal held its first session at the International Dispute Resolution

Centre, immediately followed by a hearing on the Claimants’ request for provisional
measures.

measures were:

17. On 16 October 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 1 (PO No 1). Annexed to the
Order was, inter alia, a timetable for the number and sequence of pleadings. The timetable
allowed for the possibility of the Respondent applying for bifurcation of the proceedings into
separate jurisdiction and merits phases. In the result, the Respondent did not apply for
bifurcation and accordingly this arbitration has proceeded in a single phase.

18. On 24 November 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 2 concerning provisional
measures (PO No 2). In that Order, the Tribunal by majority? recommended that until the

Tribunal’s jurisdiction in the present matter was finally determined:

(a) The Respondent refrain from prosecuting the Jordanian proceedings relating to the
enforcement of the Tax Measure against the First and Second Claimants and, jointly

2 Professor Kohen appended a dissenting opinion.

19.

(b)

with the Claimants, request that the Jordanian courts suspend those proceedings
against the Claimants; and

The Respondent otherwise desist from enforcing the Taxation Measures against the
Claimants.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

This section briefly summarises the background to the Claimants’ investment in Jordan, the
operation of UMC, the sale of their interest, the imposition of the Tax Measure and UTT’s
attempts to overturn it. Certain aspects of the factual record were in dispute between the
Parties. The Tribunal identifies these matters in this Part, but defers any findings on these
aspects that it is necessary to make until Part VI of the Award, following its exposition of the
Parties’ arguments in Part V.

The background to the establishment of UTT

FASGTC is a member of a diversified conglomerate based in Kuwait but with operations
throughout the Middle East and worldwide.*° Mr Alghanim is the Chairman and majority
shareholder in FASGTC and a Kuwaiti citizen."

Mr Alghanim’s experience of the telecommunications industry included the establishment of
Mobile Telecommunications Company (MTC) in Kuwait in 1983,.? which he subsequently sold.
He said in evidence that he was an extremely successful and well-connected businessman,
and that both he and his company enjoyed a high credit rating.’?

Mr Alghanim had known Mr Michael Dagher (Mr Dagher), a Jordanian and Lebanese national,
since 1991."* Mr Dagher had extensive experience in the telecommunications industry in the
Middle East. In particular, he organised a joint venture in Jordan in 1994 that established the
first Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) operator in Jordan, known as Fastlink.?*°

In 2003, Mr Dagher informed Mr Alghanim of an investment opportunity in Jordan, where the
Government had announced a plan to seek bids for a third GSM mobile telecommunications
licence.”

The privatisation of the Jordanian telecommunications market had begun in 1995, when the
existing Jordanian Telecommunications Group was transformed into a public shareholding
company (JTC), which was privatised in 2000.” In 1999 the ‘REACH’ initiative was developed
by the Jordan Computer Society in response to a request from King Abdullah to promote the
development of information and communication technology.*® In 2000, Jordan became a

member of the WTO.*® According to the Claimants, this led to the need to license a third
mobile operator as part of opening up the telecommunications market.”°

35. Mr Alghanim told the Tribunal that in 2003 he met the King of Jordan, King Abdullah Il, and
His Majesty assured Mr Alghanim that Jordan was a favourable place to invest.”*

36. Originally, the project was conducted jointly by FASGTC, Mr Alghanim’s company, and UTT,
Mr Dagher’s company.

37. The Claimants maintained that the opportunity to bid for a third mobile telecommunications
licence in Jordan was exciting but risky.” At the time, the Jordanian market was characterised
by a well-established duopoly. The Claimants maintain that the two incumbents (MobileCom
and Fastlink) actively tried to persuade the Government not to grant a third licence.?? The
Claimants allege that the duopoly offered the Government the sum of JD 88 million in
exchange for the Government not offering a new licence for a certain period” and to extend
their licences for another 15 years.”>

B. The bid process by the Te icati y Ce

38. The bid process was conducted by the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (TRC),
which issued a Notice Requesting Public Comment on 12 October 2003, 7° and held a
conference on 23 October 2003 accompanied by a public presentation which set out a four-
to five-month timeframe for the bid process.”” Mr Dagher participated in these processes.”®

39. On 23 November 2003, the TRC issued its formal pre-qualification requirements for
applicants. *° Pre-qualification submissions were due (after an extension) by 15 January
2004.*° In a meeting on 30 November 2003, Mr Dagher explained to Mr Alghanim the
financing requirements of the project, which involved US$10 million in capital, around US$15
million in operating capital, and a licence fee. A Chinese company, Huawei Technologies Co.
Ltd., would supply the technology.**

40. UTT and FASGTC submitted their Pre-Qualification Submission on 15 January 2004.* Five
other parties submitted pre-qualification applications, including Batelco and other
international investors.*? On 29 January 2004, TRC announced that two applicants had been
disqualified, and the remaining four were invited to proceed.* Shortly afterwards, Batelco
and one other applicant withdrew, leaving two applicants. The Claimants’ evidence is that
those applicants withdrew because they no longer regarded the investment as financially
feasible.

41. UTT and FASGTC established UMC as a vehicle to proceed with the bidding process on 21
March 2004.*° UMC was set up as a private shareholding company in accordance with a
Shareholders’ Agreement dated 16 March 2004. *’ The authorised capital was initially
JD 350,000, increasing JD 14 million in the event that UMC obtained the licence to. UTT would
hold 65% of UMC’s shares, and FASGTC 35%.** At this stage, the estimated cost of financing
UMC was USS$65 million.”

42. On 28 March 2004, UMC submitted its bid, which had been prepared with the assistance of
international consultants. “° The Claimants’ evidence is that during the extensive bid
preparation process, no question of capital gains tax on disposal arose, ** although their
evidence is that the investors had no plans to sell the company soon and accordingly exit costs
were not specifically assessed.*” Bridge Consulting was not engaged to assess exit costs.*?

43. Mr Alghanim testified that the Claimants relied on UMC to obtain legal advice, and did not
recall receiving advice on the tax implications of the sale but assumed that ‘my people’ had
‘probably’ done so.“ His evidence was to the same effect as regards advice sought after the
acceptance of the bid, which may have been written or verbal.*° Mr Dagher said that advice

44, Mr Dagher incurred upfront costs, which were reimbursed by the shareholders of UMC.*” The
initial capital expenditure of the project was estimated at JD 25 million, and as part of the
financing, both Mr Alghanim and Mr Dagher gave personal guarantees for several million
Jordanian Dinars.*® Mr Alghanim also wrote to the TRC on 23 May 2004 undertaking that he
and FASGTC would finance the balance of UTT’s shares in UMC’s capital if the bid was
successful.?

45. Mr Alghanim and Mr Dagher met the King, the Prime Minister and the Minister of
Telecommunications on 11 April 2004.°° Mr Alghanim testified that the King assured him that
the Kingdom would not accept the duopoly’s offers to pay cash in exchange for the
postponement of the licence process, and Mr Alghanim offered in response to the Prime
Minister’s request to donate 4% of the shares in UMC to the Jordanian Student Fund as a
benefit to Jordan.**

46. On 20 May 2004, TRC sought various clarifications from UTT, including in relation to the
benefits UMC would provide to Jordan.** Mr Dagher provided a commitment letter on behalf
of UMC on 21 July 2004.°

47. The TRC formally advised UMC that it would be awarded the Licence on 24 July 2004.**
Cc. The operation of the Licence

48. The 15-year Licence was entered into on 9 August 2004, despite what the Claimants describe
as further attempts by the existing licensees to prevent it.°*° The Claimants’ evidence is that
the Minister of Finance had recommended that the King accept the duopoly’s JD 88 million
offer, and that nearly 70 Members of Parliament had petitioned the Government not to go
ahead with the new licence.*®

The upfront cost of the Licence included an acquisition fee of JD 4 million, an additional fee of
JD 2 million, a signal frequency fee and an operating licence fee.*” UMC would also be required
to pay 10% of its gross revenue to Jordan and subscribers’ sales tax of 16%.** It also provided
other financial benefits to Jordan.*?

The Claimants’ evidence is that UMC was successful beyond their expectations, achieving
significant market penetration and introducing a number of innovative services and pricing
structures.© They say that they risked ‘about $100 million’ on the project.

The investors conducted a valuation of the company in August 2004,* and in 2005, they
decided to refinance UMC. On 31 July 2005, UMC entered into a shareholders’ agreement
with Global Investment House Company (Global) pursuant to which Global injected US$27.5
million into UMC and took a 30% shareholding.® Shortly afterwards, FASGTC exchanged its
35% interest in UMC for a stake in UTT.

As a consequence, UTT held 66% of UMC, the remaining 34% being held by Global and the
Jordanian Student Fund. By then, the directors of UTT were Mr Alghanim, Mr Dagher and
Mr Rami Hadidi.®°

The sale of UMC

In 2006, UTT entered into discussions with Batelco for the sale of its interest in UMC. The
Jordanian Student Fund wished to keep its share.® Mr Dagher, who led negotiations for UTT,
testified at the Hearing that goodwill ‘was discussed in broader terms with respect to capital
gains and potential other taxes as regards sale of shares’ but the parties did not make a
provision for it because the law was very clear.°”

Batelco conducted due diligence on the transaction. Mr Khateeb was involved in this process
and testified that his firm told Batelco at a meeting in June 2006 that, although the transaction
would not be taxable for UMC, it could be taxable for the seller depending on whether it
included goodwill, and that the goodwill would be the difference between the fair value of
the acquired assets and the sale price.® The Claimants vigorously challenge this testimony,

but the Respondent says the Claimants have not presented any witness testimony to
contradict it.”? Mr Khateeb confirmed under examination that his firm was instructed to
advise on the outstanding tax liabilities of UMC,” and that in the course of discussing the
report, Batelco’s representatives asked whether the transaction would have any tax
consequences for Batelco. The response was that it might have tax consequences for the seller
if it included goodwill, but not the buyer.” Mr Dagher’s evidence is that such possible taxation
was never raised by Batelco, and he would have expected it to have been if such advice had
been given.’? Mr Khateeb suggests that Batelco would have had no reason to disclose it.”*

After Batelco confirmed its intention to buy UMC, the shareholders convened an
extraordinary meeting on 22 June 2006 approving the sale.”* They decided to distribute the
sale proceeds on their receipt and reduce the share capital accordingly. ”° Mr Dagher’s
interests were due to receive approximately US$80 million.”” Mr Alghanim confirmed that he
was present in his capacity as deputy chairman and director of the company,”® but does not
recall whether there was a discussion of whether UTT was entitled to distribute the profits
prior to the end of the accounting year. He deposed that the decision would have been taken
on the basis of legal and accounting advice.’”? Mr Dagher agreed that that was a key issue, but
says that tax was not discussed.*° He maintained that the company was advised that Article
35 of its Articles permitted a distribution other than a dividend and that the company’s
advisers may have preferred that option.®! He recalled specific but verbal advice during the
meeting.®?

UMC wrote to TRC in May/June 2006 to seek authorisation for the transfer of ownership and
waiver of the requirement that Mr Dagher remain as general manager for a fixed term.®? The
TRC gave its approval on 15 June 2006."

On 24 June 2006, UTT, Global and Batelco entered into an agreement whereby Batelco
purchased 96% of the issued shares in UMC for a total price of US$415 million, of which UTT’s
share was US$292.5 million (the 2006 Transaction). *° Mr Dagher stated under cross-
examination that UTT received verbal advice from Mr Hadidi and Mr Mones Al-Madani (Chief

Financial Officer) on the tax consequences of the sale.®*° His own view was that goodwill tax
would usually be paid by the buyer, not the seller.®”

58. The Claimants maintain that the sale of UMC was met by significant public hostility.
Allegations were made in the media that the difference between the licence fee of JD 4 million
and the sale price indicated some form of wrongdoing and that the Government should have
benefitted from a higher licence fee or a tax on the sale profits.**

59. On 29 June 2006, the Director-General of ISTD, Mr Kudah, was reported as an ‘informed
source’ as saying that the 2006 Transaction would likely be taxable on the basis that it involved
the sale of goodwill.*? Mr Kudah deposed that he said it was taxable ‘in principle’; that any
assessment could only be done once ISTD had received the relevant documents; and that it
would be done in accordance with the law” (although he declined in oral evidence to express
a view on the correct tax position.)** He maintained that he does not review ISTD decisions,
and would rely on the relevant administrative officials to apply the law in accordance with the
Constitution.*? So too Mr Mawazreh, a subsequent Director-General, testified that in that
capacity he would not be involved in assessments or have direct supervision over assessors,
and had an exclusively administrative role.**

60. On 2 July 2006, the Ministry of Finance demanded payment of an additional 0.3% in stamp
duties together with penalties. Mr Dagher’s evidence is that the Minister told him that there
was so much political pressure and the investors had made so much money that the stamp
duty should be the least of their worries. Mr Dagher paid the duty under protest.**

61. According to Mr Kudah, his attention was drawn to the transaction by the ISTD
Communication and Media Directorate (although he had also seen newspaper reports before
giving the report described above®®), and he formed an internal committee to examine the
transaction (the 2006 Committee).°° On 5 July 2006, it produced a memorandum directed to
the legal department concluding that the profits of the sale were taxable in principle, but that
UTT needed to file its tax return before any further action could be taken.°”

In the context of completing its 2007 annual accounts, UTT commissioned a number of legal
opinions in September 2007 from Jordanian law firms, whose advice was that the transaction
fell within the exemption for capital gains and was accordingly not taxable." These were
provided to UTT’s auditors, Saba/Deloitte.*!*

The imposition of the Tax Measure

On 27 January 2008, UTT filed minutes of its General Assembly Meeting of 29 October 2007
approving its 2005 financial statements.*"* On 17 February 2008 it filed another set of minutes
approving financial statements of the same year.*“* The auditors’ report in respect of the 2005
statements is dated 22 October 2007."°

On 4 March 2008, UTT obtained a tax clearance certificate from the local tax directorate.
Mr Dagher said that his lawyers advised him that such a certificate would not be granted if an
obligation to file a tax return was outstanding or there was any evidence of taxable income."
Mr Kudah deposed that such a certificate should not have been issued as UTT had not filed
any tax returns.*!”

On 5 March 2008, UTT filed minutes recording the decision of 22 June 2006 to reduce its
capital, "8 but the Companies Control Department (CCD) required further information,° and
on 14 April 2008 refused to register the resolution until that was provided.’”°

On 8 March 2008, UTT approved in an extraordinary meeting to voluntarily liquidate UMC, 7?
and filed minutes recording this on 20 April 2008.*?2 The company remains in liquidation, but
that process was suspended by the CCD in response to a request from the ISTD, and the
Respondent maintains that it cannot be completed until financial statements for 2007 are filed
and all requisite clearances are obtained.

On 19 March 2008, UTT had filed the minutes of its meeting of 3 November 2007 approving
the auditors’ report of the same day in respect of the 2006 year.'**

On 15 April 2008, a three-person assessment committee was appointed within ISTD at Mr
Mawazreh’s request to establish whether UTT was liable for tax (the 2008 Assessment
Committee).*?° UTT had not filed any tax returns from the time of its establishment. The
Claimants’ witnesses testified that they had been advised that UTT was not required to file tax
returns, because it was a mere holding company, and did not generate any taxable returns.’7°
Mr Alghanim did not recall who advised him of this, or when.’”’ The Claimants say that to the
extent that there was such an obligation, neither the ISTD nor the Government informed UTT
of it.7® Mr Dagher testified that he had not seen the Instructions (discussed in the next
paragraph) on which the Respondent relies until the arbitration, ”° and also that he was
advised verbally that UTT was not obliged to file an annual financial statement. *°°

The Respondent points out that in addition to the obligation for taxpayers to file returns under
Article 26 of the Income Tax Law, public Instructions issued by ISTD under Article 27 require
all companies to file returns irrespective of whether they have a taxable income (and says
there is no exception for holding companies). If only taxpayers were caught by the
Instructions, Article 27 would add nothing to Article 26. *** Returns are required to be
submitted within four months of the end of the financial year (the end of April), and ISTD has
a further year from the submission of the tax return to complete its audit.*? The Respondent
states that a list is kept or generated of registered taxpayers (including companies) who have
not yet filed returns within the time specified, *3 they are referred to the relevant
directorate, 4 and that in such cases there is no fixed term for the ISTD’s initial assessment. 4°

The Claimants invite the Tribunal to find that such a list never existed.**° Asked why UTT’s case
was not flagged after it failed to file a return in April 2007, Mr Mawazreh suggested that the
assessors were busy auditing self-assessments.*?”

77.

The evidence of Mr Kudah (then Director-General of ISTD) is that at the end of each financial
year, a special committee is formed to distribute tax returns among the assessors.1** In 2008,
ISTD practice was to audit all large taxpayers’ tax returns; 3° Mr Mawazreh’s evidence is that
at the time (but apparently not in 2006**°) the threshold for the purview of the Large Tax
Payers’ Department (LTPD) was four to five million dinars." In addition, the Director-General
of the ISTD had a discretion to refer taxpayers to the LTPD.'*? Mr Mawazreh also suggested
that where a subsidiary (in this case UMC) was within the LTPD’s remit then so was the
shareholder. **3 Consistent with this, Mr Batarseh testified that the 2008 Assessment
Committee had been instructed to assess both UTT and UMC but does not recall the result of
the latter assessment.1*

Mr Kudah’s evidence is that the assessor, in conjunction with the audit committee, assesses
the tax return independently of the Director-General, except if there is a dispute which
involves general principle or point of law which is referred to the Director-General and the
Committee of Planning and Coordination.**° The Respondent’s evidence is that it was normal
procedure to refer the UTT tax file to a committee rather than an individual assessor given the
large income involved, and that the assessment committee was formed by Mr Mawazreh on
his own initiative. “°

Having obtained copies of UTT’s financial statements from the CCD, the 2008 ISTD Committee
attempted to contact UTT. The Parties’ witnesses take a different view on the adequacy of the
Committee’s attempts:44”

(a) It is common ground that the Committee rang Ms Huda Sabra, who was registered in
the records of the CCD as UTT’s representative, on her mobile telephone, and
Mr Nabil Zaarour, its liquidator. Mr Zaarour was apparently overseas at the time.
Mr Dagher’s evidence is that the Committee did not wait for his return, while the
Respondent says that he promised to contact the CCD when he returned but failed to
do so.

(b) Mr Dagher’s evidence is that UTT had submitted powers of attorney for both
Ms Amani Al-Hawari and Mr Abdullah Ahmed Al-Daas whom it should have contacted,
that it had records of UTT’s registered address, and that the Committee could have
done much more to contact UTT.

(c)

The Respondent’s evidence is that it was usual practice to contact the person listed in
the CCD’s records, and that the committee may not have had notice of the powers of
attorney because they were attached to the application for tax clearance
certificates.“

The Parties also differ on the significance of the time taken by the Committee:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

Mr Dagher maintains that the Committee proceeded with undue haste, having been
formed on 15 April 2008, met for the first time on 22 April 2008,’*° and imposed the
tax 8 days later on 30 April 2008. Mr Batarseh confirmed that the Committee started
work (or at least could have done so) on 15 April.1°°

Mr Batarseh’s evidence is that the Committee called Ms Sabra at 1.30pm, then
drafted the first paragraph of their note dated 22 April 2008 (which all three signed),
and on the same day one member of the Committee called the liquidator, and the
Committee drafted and signed the second paragraph before the end of the working
day. Mr Batarseh testified that there was nothing unusual in that. In cross-
examination, the Claimants put it to Mr Batarseh that the Committee had finished its
work on 24 April 2008, relying on a document of that date. Mr Batarseh’s evidence is
that this was a draft which was discussed with the Committee responsible for
approving decisions before the decision was audited on 28 April 2008 and issued on
30 April 2008.*% The difference in figures between that document and the final
decision was down to bank interest and additional income.’*?

The Respondent's evidence is that it is not unusual to complete the assessment
process within the period in this case.**

Mr Mawazreh testifies that he had no involvement in the 2008 ISTD Committee’s work
after its formation, and that the audit committee approved its decision. *° The
Respondent also testifies that the assessment committee was required to make its
decision on the basis of the information available, even if it is limited.*°*

On 21 April 2008, the ISTD wrote to inform the CCD that UTT had not filed its tax returns and
to request that the Controller not approve the liquidation until it had obtained the ISTD’s

80. On 29 April 2008, UTT received a demand from the Ministry of Finance for further stamp
duties; the Government subsequently accepted that UTT had paid the applicable stamp
duties. ***

81. Mr Mawazreh’s evidence is that the decision to impose tax on the difference between the
book value and the sale price would have been based on UTT’s lack of cooperation, and that
the administrative objection phase allowed UTT to challenge this.1°?

82. On 30 April 2008, the ISTD wrote to UTT to inform it of a tax liability of JD 47,170,584, together
with an additional tax of JD 10,377,528 (the Tax Measure).1°°

FL UTT’s challenge to the Tax Measure and subsequent developments

83. After the Tax Measure was imposed, UTT challenged the tax in accordance with the
procedures provided by Jordanian law:*®*

(a) On 29 May 2008 it filed its administrative objection,“ a hearing was held,*® and it
was rejected on 24 June 2008.**

(b) It lodged an appeal with the Tax Court of Appeal on 11 August 2008,1© which after
hearings? was rejected on 21 November 2011.1°”

(c) It then appealed to the Court of Cassation on 20 December 2011,1° which on 25 April
2012 dismissed the appeal and upheld the tax.*®

of the Tax Law;?”° and that it was surprising that the file was transferred to the Large

Taxpayers Department.’” The Respondent says that the taxpayer's right to be heard is at the
administrative objection stage, not the assessment stage.”

The Claimants’ evidence is that their pleadings were competently prepared by experienced
professionals, and they were sufficient. Mr Dagher recounts advice that arguments in the
administrative objection phase are generally brief, and that phase is seldom fruitful. 7?
Mr Dagher also notes that there were no factual disputes and the case revolved around a
question of law. *” Furthermore, UTT’s lawyers explained to him that it was ISTD’s
responsibility to bring evidence that the 2006 Transaction involved the disposal of goodwill,
and not for UTT to disprove that.’”*

The Respondent counters that the Claimants are now trying to reconstruct a case they failed
to put during the Jordanian procedures.’”° The Respondent maintains that the pleadings and
submissions filed and delivered on UTT’s behalf in the domestic proceedings were unusually
brief and inadequate, that it is surprising that no witnesses or experts were called, and that it
fell below the usual standard of the work of UTT’s advocate Mr Naeem Al Madani.” The
Respondent contrasts this with the Rowwad case.*”* Mr Almusned notes in particular that a
taxpayer is required to put forward in the administrative objection phase all objections that it

77° and concludes that

wishes to raise before the Tax Court of Appeal or Court of Cassation,
UTT did not seriously try to advance reasonable grounds in favour of UTT’s position.®° He also
testifies that the administrative objection phase is not ‘seldom fruitful’, as Mr Dagher
alleges.**! The Respondent notes, for example, that UTT did not raise before the Court of
Cassation the question of whether the capital gains exemption applies to private shareholding
companies, the relevance of the Tax Clearance Certificate or the lawfulness of imposing
Additional Tax for the failure to file a tax return.” Rather it focused on submitting that this
case did not involve the transfer of the entirety of the company.7®3

On 20 December 2012, FASGTC and Mr Alghanim received a notice from the LTPD advising
that a total of JD 109,435,754 (approximately $US160 million) was due and payable, consisting

On 2 January 2013, the liquidator of UTT wrote to ISTD informing that he had written to the

company’s shareholders seeking repayment of all the funds ‘illegitimately withdrawn’.1®°

On 14 January 2013, Mr Alghanim and Mr Dagher wrote to the Prime Minister to raise their
concerns.*8° A meeting was held that day between Mr Dagher, UTT’s lawyer Mr Rami Hadidi,
the Prime Minister and the Kuwaiti Ambassador to Jordan.1®’ The following day, FASGTC and
another shareholder in UTT wrote to the Prime Minister.*®

On 14 February 2013, the Prime Minister wrote to confirm that the tax would be enforced.

Mr Almusned, who was a member of the 2006 Committee, was also member of a committee
formed by the Prime Minister in 2013 to consider legal procedures for recovering unpaid tax
in the Rowwad and UTT cases. That Committee contained representatives of the judiciary, the
CCD and the ISTD.*%°

Subsequently, the ISTD confiscated a sum from UTT’s account at the Housing Bank for Trust
and Finance in November 2013,**! and Jordan initiated domestic proceedings against the
Claimants and the other directors of and shareholders in UTT in order to enforce the Tax
Measure (the Jordanian Enforcement Proceedings).’°? As described above, in PO No 2 the
Tribunal ordered that Jordan desist from prosecuting those proceedings or otherwise
enforcing the Tax Measure against the Claimants while the arbitration is pending.

JURISDICTION
Introduction

The Claimants invoke the substantive protections of the Jordan—Kuwait BIT, and in particular
the provisions of Article 3 (Protection of Investments), Article 4 (Treatment of Investments)
and Article 12 (Most-Favoured Nation Treatment).

The Claimants addressed the question of the Tribunal’s competence to hear the present case
in their Memorial, submitting that the Tribunal possessed jurisdiction:

(a) Ratione personae, because both FASGTC and Mr Alghanim qualify as investors in
terms of Article 1.2 of the BIT;1%3

(b) Ratione temporis, because they retain their shareholding in UTT, the dispute over the
Tax Measure arose after the BIT’s entry into force, there is no requirement that the
investment remain at the time arbitration is commenced (so the fact that they have
withdrawn their capital gains is irrelevant), and in any case the crystallised claim
would survive the termination of the investment;!** and

(c) Ratione materiae, because the Claimants meet the definitions of ‘investment’ in both
Article 1 of the BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.?°>

Since the Respondent protested the Tribunal’s jurisdiction but elected not to seek bifurcation
of the proceedings, it pleaded to its objections for the first time in its Counter-Memorial. The
Tribunal addresses each of the Respondent’s objections in turn.

The Parties’ submissions

 

The Respondent advances four objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal:1°°

(a) The Claimants no longer have an investment in respect of which they can assert the
breach of substantive guarantees;

(b) The Claimants cannot bring a claim on behalf of UTT;

(c) The Tribunal’s jurisdiction is precluded by the ‘tax carve-out’ in Article 4(3) of the BIT;
and

(d) There has been no harm and thus no loss has materialized.

194 Claimants’ Memorial, (151]-[159].

185 Claimants’ Memorial, (160]-[179].

196 As noted above, the evidence does not demonstrate that Mr Fouad Alghanim owns shares in UTT in his personal name,
but the Respondent does not raise this as a separate basis of objection.

100.

The Respondent did not press the third objection in its Reply or in oral submissions. +”

Although the Claimants express the view in their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction that the
Respondent has raised new objections in its Rejoinder that should be ruled inadmissible — in
particular, that the Claimants cannot establish the necessary contribution (presented as part
of the first objection) and that the dispute is theoretical (presented as part of its fourth
objection), the Tribunal will summarise them according to the rubric established in the first
exchange of pleadings.

1. The Claimants no longer have an investment

(i) The Respondent’s submissions

The Respondent submits that the Claimants may not rely on a ‘former investment’ in order to
establish the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.’ It asserts that the Claimants’ investment in Jordan
was terminated when UTT sold its shares in UMC, the existence of an investment must be
assessed at the time of the Request for Arbitration, and accordingly they cannot rely on an
investment in the form of ‘shares’ .?°°

Nor can the Claimants rely on an investment in the form of ‘returns’, submits the Respondent,
because there were no returns in the territory of Jordan at the time the Tax Measure was
imposed,”* and ‘returns’ only qualify as an ‘investment’ if they are ‘retained for the purposes
of reinvestment’ or are ‘resulting from liquidation’ and that the Claimants’ profit on the sale
is neither.?” So far as the Claimants rely on their present shareholding in UTT, the Respondent
says that this does not meet the objective requirements of ‘investment’ in the ICSID
Convention because UTT was merely a holding company, and any such jurisdiction would be
limited to determining whether the shareholding (as opposed to UTT itself) has been treated
in a manner that violates the BIT.7°3

(ii) The Claimants’ submissions

The Claimants say that this objection is based on the wilful disregard of the fact that FASGTC
remains a shareholder in UTT.”™ Even so, the Claimants say that the Respondent confuses the
Tribunal’s ratione temporis jurisdiction with the application ratione temporis of the
substantive provisions of the treaty, in the process failing to address Article 9 of the BIT;?°
the former question depends on when the dispute arose, and the dispute arose after the BIT
entered into force. As a matter of interpretation, the BIT covers the ‘entire life’ of investments

from their entry and acceptance to their liquidation and subsequent disputes, and both the
‘returns’ of the Claimants and their ‘shares’ in UTT qualify.2°° There is no relevant limitation
on the temporal application of the substantive protections, and the criteria necessary for the
establishment of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction were present at the date of the Request for
Arbitration;””” it is not necessary to still have an investment at the time (although they did).7°°

2. The Claimants cannot bring a claim on behalf of UTT

(i) The Respondent’s submissions

The Respondent alleges that the alleged mistreatment on which the Claimants rely related
only to the rights of UTT, not the Claimants, and the Claimants cannot sue for harm done to a
separate corporation.” It says that the Claimants’ claim is really for denial of justice, the ICSID
Convention requires a ‘direct link’ between the acts relied upon and the investment, and
Jordan’s acts were directed to UTT. It goes so far as to suggest that the Claimants fail to
establish any breach of the BIT that specifically relates to the Claimants’ 35% interest in UTT.72°

The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ reliance on ‘accessory’ or ‘incidental’ jurisdiction,
submitting that this cannot be invoked as a means of obtaining jurisdiction where there is
otherwise none.?*

(ii) The Claimants’ submissions

The Claimants respond that they are suing to vindicate their own rights as shareholders, and
seeking remedies to protect them in that capacity.” The shareholders’ rights in issue are the
rights to receive their dividends, and the right to decide to wind up the business of their
corporation.”"3 Jordan’s conduct, the Claimants submit, impaired those rights as shareholders,
by interfering with their ability to wind up the company and by taking enforcement measures
against the Claimants in their capacity as shareholders in UTT and (in Mr Alghanim’s case) an
officer of UTT.7

But even if the measures were solely concerned with UTT, the Tribunal would still have
incidental or ancillary jurisdiction because the question of whether Jordan is entitled to
demand from the shareholders payment of the tax levied on UTT is indivisible from the
question of the lawfulness of the Tax Measure.”"°

The Claimants say that the Respondent fails to respond to its other arguments under this
heading, and has not contested that the Claimants bring personal claims.”2°

3. The tax carve-out

Article 4(3) of the BIT provides that the provisions of that Article ‘shall not be construed as
binding a Contracting State to extend to the investors of the other Contracting State special
treatment or privilege resulting from...domestic legislation totally or mainly relating to
taxation.’ The Respondent submits in its Counter-Memorial that this excludes from the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction disputes over the imposition of tax, but does not pursue this objection
in its Reply. The Claimants maintain that the ‘carve-out’ does not apply to the fair and
equitable treatment guarantee, the Respondent’s construction would lead to an absurd
result, and even if the carve-out applied it would leave most of the Claimants’ claims intact.”

4. There has been no harm

(i) The Respondent’s submissions

The Respondent alleges that the Claimants have failed to establish the existence of an
investment dispute in terms of Article 9 of the BIT, because they have not suffered harm or
loss from the impugned measures.”!® It says that any harm or loss to the Claimants will not
materialise until the ongoing judicial process in Jordan against the Claimants is concluded, that
the Claimants may prevail in those proceedings, and that until then the dispute may be
‘theoretical’.?4°

(ii) The Claimants’ submissions

The Claimants characterise the Respondent's objection under this heading as constituting
three separate assertions:
economic damage is a condition precedent to standing under the BIT; and that the Claimants’
claims are premature.°

 

hat there is no investment dispute between the parties; that

The Claimants reject each of these allegations, submitting that: there is a dispute because
there is a clear difference on a point of law or fact; there is no requirement in the BIT or
general international law that damage is a condition precedent to international
responsibility;?2* and that the Respondent mischaracterises the Claimants’ case as a denial of
justice claim. They say that the Respondent confuses a claim arising out of the decisions of the
Jordanian Tax Court of Appeal and Court of Cassation with the effect of the subsequent

proceedings (noting that the Claimants do not allege the pending Jordanian Enforcement
Proceedings amount to a denial of justice, but that the Claimants will not have the opportunity
in the pending proceedings to contest the validity of the Tax Measure or the decisions which
upheld it), says that international law does not require that enforcement of an internationally
wrongful act have been completed before a claim can be brought, and finally that even if
economic damage were a necessary prerequisite it has been satisfied.?”>

So far as the Respondent has introduced a new argument that the dispute is ‘hypothetical’ or
‘academic’, the Claimants say that this appears to depend on the propositions that loss has
not materialised, and that the domestic proceedings ought to be allowed to come to their
conclusion.” The Claimants reject these suggestions, arguing that a favourable award would
have practical consequences, > and that Jordan’s objection is based on a hypothetical
outcome of proceedings it initiated.?7°

The Tribunal’s analysis of the jurisdictional objections
1. Objection 1: That the Claimants no longer have an investment

The BIT between Kuwait and Jordan came into force on 19 March 2004, before the Claimants
began their investment in Jordan through the creation of UMC. It remains in force.

There is no dispute between the Parties that the guarantees given by Jordan to investors of
Kuwait under the substantive provisions of the BIT were in force at the time the Claimants’
investment was made and continued to be in force at the time the present dispute was
notified to the Centre.

The Respondent does not contest that the Claimants originally made an investment when they
acquired shares in UMC in 2004 and when they subsequently exchanged that interest for
shares in UTT in 2005. Those shares constituted the legal materialisation of the Claimants’
‘investment’ within the express terms of Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT. It is not in dispute that the
Claimants continue to own their shares in UTT today.

The Claimants’ investment also had an economic materialisation in Jordan in the form of the
sums that the Claimants paid to acquire their telecommunications licence and to establish
their mobile telephone network.

The Respondent’s objection under this head relates not to the establishment of the Claimants’
investment, but rather to the alleged significance of the fact that, by the time that the Tax
Measure, which is the subject of the Claimants’ complaint, had been imposed on UTT in April
2008, UTT had sold its interest in UMC to Batelco some two years previously and the sale
proceeds had left Jordan. So, the Respondent says, the Claimants had no continuing

investment in Jordan at the time of the State measure of which they complain, still less at the
time the present arbitration proceedings were instituted in December 2013.

The Respondent’s argument must be rejected for the following reasons:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(a)

(e)

Once the Claimants had ‘made’ their investment in Jordan through the acquisition of
shares in UMC and subsequently UTT, they became entitled, according to the express
terms of the BIT, to the ongoing treaty protections set forth, inter alia, in Articles 3
and 4. Article 4 confirms this, emphasizing that the Contracting State’s guarantee
applies ‘at all times’. The Claimants continue to be shareholders in UTT and therefore
entitled to these protections.

In any event, Article 1(1) further provides that ‘[t]he term “investment” also applies
to “returns” ... resulting from “liquidation”, which is defined (in art 1(4)) as ‘any action
taken for the purpose of totally or partially terminating the investment.’ The
Claimants’ sale of UTT’s shares in UMC to Batelco, and the proceeds realized upon
that sale, represent returns resulting from the partial termination of the Claimants’
investment, pursuant to which they disposed of UTT’s interest in UMC, but retained
their shares in UTT.

The Claimants’ cause of action in these proceedings relates to the alleged effect upon
them as shareholders of the imposition of the Tax Measure upon UTT. That Measure
imposes a capital gains tax liability on UTT’s returns from termination of the
investment. As a result, the impugned Measure directly operates upon an element of
what the BIT defines as an ‘investment.’

Further, the Respondent alleges that the Claimants are personally liable for the tax
liability of UTT. It has brought proceedings in the Jordanian courts seeking to establish
the Claimants’ personal liability, which proceedings are currently stayed as a result of
the Tribunal’s PO No 2.

‘Disputes, arising between a Contracting State and the investor of the other
Contracting State, regarding an investment of the latter in the territory of the former’
may, under Article 9, be referred for settlement by means of international arbitration
at ICSID. There was, at the date of the institution of these proceedings, a dispute
between Jordan and the Claimants regarding the investment that the latter made in
Jordan, including as to the liability of both UTT, as the investment vehicle, and the
Claimants personally, to pay tax on the sale of their interest.

Once an investor has made an investment in the territory of another Contracting State under
an investment treaty, he obtains the benefit of the protections of that treaty in relation to
measures taken by the State that adversely affect his investment (including for this purpose
his returns upon liquidation of that investment in whole or in part). In the present case, the

118.

119.

121.

122.

123.

investors in fact continue to hold their shares in UTT. But this is not necessary. As the tribunal
held in Jan de Nul:””

Providing an effective remedy is part of the duties of fair and equitable treatment and of
continuous protection and security for investments. A violation of that duty after the
investment has come to an end does not change its nature. The duty to provide redress
for a violation of rights persists even if the rights as such have come to an end. ...

2. Objection 2: That the Claimants cannot bring a claim on behalf of UTT

In the second place, the Respondent alleges that the entity subject to the Tax Measure is UTT,
not the Claimants, and that the Claimants cannot bring a claim on UTT’s behalf.

This objection suffers from the difficulty that the Respondent itself alleges in the Jordanian
Enforcement Proceedings that the Claimants are themselves personally responsible for UTT’s
tax liability in the capacity of shareholder or director.

The Claimants submit that they sue in the present proceedings to vindicate their own rights
as shareholders in UTT. The Tribunal agrees. It is those shares, and the returns on them, that
constitute their ‘investment’ for the purpose of Article 1 of the BIT. It is precisely the purpose
of investment treaties to enable the foreign shareholder to bring a claim for losses to his
investment in a locally incorporated investment company. The availability of such a claim has
been regarded as ‘perfectly clear’ from the earliest decisions under investment treaties.?”*

In the present case, the link between the effect of the state’s measure upon the investment
company and the claim of the investor is a fortiori as a result of the Respondent's pursuit of a
direct claim to recover the sums that it claims UTT is liable to pay in tax from the Claimants.

3. Objection 3: The tax carve-out

Thirdly, the Respondent submitted that the present case is excluded from the jurisdiction of
the Tribunal as a result of Article 4(3)(b) which confirms that the Contracting States are not
bound to extend to investors any ‘special treatment, preference or privilege resulting
from...any domestic legislation totally or mainly relating to taxation’.

The Tribunal does not understand the gravamen of the Claimants’ case to be that it insists on
a ‘special treatment, preference or privilege’ in the field of taxation. On the contrary, the
Claimants allege that the proper application of the ordinary rules of Jordanian tax law
applicable to all taxpayers should have resulted in UTT’s gain on the disposal of its shares in
UMC not being liable to capital gains tax. They claim that the imposition of this tax in their
case was an arbitrary and discriminatory measure that singled them out from the ordinary
and proper application of the tax law in a manner that was unfair and inequitable.

(2006) (Ex RL-40), (135).

Manufacturing v Zaire) (Ex CL-66), (5.15).

124.

125.

126.

127.

128.

Article 4(3)(b) appears in a provision of the BIT that guarantees national and most-favoured
nation treatment as well as fair and equitable treatment. In this context, it is understandable
that the treaty drafters would have included an express clause providing that preferential tax
treatments not afforded to investors could not give rise to an investment treaty claim. This
provision in no way restricts the ability of an investor to claim that he has been subjected to
an arbitrary measure contrary to the ordinary application of the law otherwise applicable to
all.

4. Objection 4: That there has been no harm

Finally, the Respondent claims that the Claimants have suffered no harm since their own
personal liability might yet not be established in the Jordanian Enforcement Proceedings, so
their present claim is premature and speculative.

This objection is really the other side of the coin to Objection 2. In the Tribunal’s view, it suffers
from a similar infirmity. The Claimants are entitled by virtue of the BIT to pursue a claim for
the Respondent’s alleged breach of its obligations to them as a result of mistreatment of their
investment in UTT. The Respondent’s Tax Measure has already been imposed on UTT, and
finally confirmed by the decision of the Court of Cassation.

The cause of action under the Treaty does not require damage as a constituent element. Nor
a fortiori does it require the final establishment of direct damage to the Claimants. The
Claimants are entitled to sue for the breach of the obligations owed to them under the BIT to
protect their investment in UTT.

For these reasons, the Tribunal therefore concludes that each of the Respondent’s objections
to its jurisdiction fail. As a result, it is necessary to proceed to consider the Claimants’ claims
on their merits. This it will do by first setting forth a summary of the Parties’ submissions and
then turning to its own analysis.

MERITS: THE PARTIES’ SUBMISSIONS

Introduction

This Part summarises the Parties’ submissions on the merits of the Claimants’ case. It begins
with extracts of the most relevant legal texts.

The Parties adopted different structures for their submissions on the merits, consistently with
the different way in which they characterised the dispute. Those submissions also evolved
over the course of two rounds of written pleadings and oral argument:

(a)

(b)

The Claimants focused on establishing that the relevant acts were attributable to the
Respondent; that the Respondent's acts were internationally wrongful by reference
to each of the substantive guarantees (submitting, that is, that Jordan’s conduct was
arbitrary, was a breach of full protection and security, was a breach of the guarantee
of legal stability, violated legitimate expectations, was discriminatory, and impaired
the liquidation of the Claimants’ investment); and that Jordan’s breaches of the BIT
cannot be excused by its own judicial organs.

The Respondent, to some extent, reversed the enquiry, submitting first that it had
applied its taxation law to the transaction in a reasonable manner (submitting, in
particular, that the Claimants were now attempting to raise arguments that should
have been raised by UTT in the domestic proceedings, that the Respondent’s
interpretation of the tax legislation was open to it, and that the Tax Measure was not
politically motivated) and addressing each of the substantive guarantees in the BIT
against that background.

In either case, the question of whether the Tax Measure was imposed according to domestic
law is centrally important to both parties’ analysis — albeit not necessarily dispositive on either
party’s characterisation of the issues.” The Tribunal accordingly summarises the Parties’
submissions in the following sequence:

(a)
(b)
(c)
(a)

The key legal texts;
The validity of the Tax Measure;
The alleged political motivation of the Tax Measure;

The legal framework for the assessment of the Claimants’ claims, and in particular the
standard to be applied where the case revolves around the allegedly unlawful
application of domestic law; and

229 The Claimants submit that even if it is wrong that the gain on a share sale cannot be bifurcated, the Respondent’s conduct.
would still breach the obligation to accord legal predictability and stability: Tr Day 1, 15:3-17. The Respondent says that if
the Tribunal were to find that there was no reasonable basis in Jordanian law for the imposition of the tax measure, the
Tribunal would still have to be satisfied that its conduct fell below international standards (Tr Day 1, 129:15~131:5), although
that international responsibility would flow if the Tribunal was satisfied that the courts’ decisions were such that no
competent judge could reasonably have reached them (Tr Day 1, 144:6-21).

(e) The substantive guarantees which the Claimants allege have been breached,
including:

(i) Arbitrary treatment (Article 3(1) and Article 4);

(ii Full protection and security (Article 3(1)) and legal stability and predictability
(Article 12);

(iii) Legitimate expectations (Article 4);
(iv) Discrimination (Articles 3(1) and 4); and
(v) Impairment of rights to liquidate.
B, The key texts
1. The BIT

132. This section begins by extracting the most relevant provisions of the Jordan—Kuwait BIT
invoked by the Claimants.

133. The key investment protection guarantees on which the Claimants rely are as follows:?°°
Article 3
Protection of Investments

1. Investments, made by investors of either Contracting State, enjoy full protection and
security in the territory of the other Contracting State, in compliance with the
recognized principles of international law and with the provisions of this Agreement.
Neither Contracting State shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory
measures such investments or associated activities including the use and enjoyment
of the management, development, maintenance and expansion of these
investments or related activities.

 

Each of the Contracting States shall declare all laws, regulations, rules and
judgements related to or directly affecting investments or connected acti
territory of the other Contracting State.

 

3. Each of the two Contracting States must work on providing effective means to
confirm requests and implement rights with respect to investments. Each,
Contracting State shall guarantee to investors of the other Contracting State the right
to resort to courts, administrative agencies and all other authorities that exercise
judicial authority, as well as the right to appoint any person of their choice qualified
according to the applicable laws and regulations for the purposes of the confirmation
of claims and execution of rights concerning their investments and connected
activities.

 

The two Contracting States shall not impose on the investors of the other Contracting
State any compulsory discriminatory measures against investments made by
investors of the other Contracting State in favour of investments made by its own
investors or investors of a third State, requiring or restricting the purchase of
materials, energy, fuel or production facilities, transportation or processing of any

230 Ex C-1, The Parties’ submissions contain wording with slight differences that are not material.

kind or restricting the marketing of its products inside or outside the territory of the
host Contracting State.

v

Moreover, investments in the host Contracting State shall not be subject to
performance requirements which could be harmful, to its growth capabilities or
could have adverse effects on its usage, enjoyment, management, maintenance,
expansion or on other connected activities, unless such requirements were
considered vital for public health considerations, public order or the environment
and were applied in compliance with legal instruments of general application.

6.

Investments made by investors of either Contracting State in the host Contracting
State shall not be subject to sequestration, confiscation or any similar measures,
‘except in accordance with legal procedures and in conformity with the mandatory
principles of international law and the other specific provisions of this Agreement.

 

Each of the Contracting States shall observe any commitment or obligation to which
it is a party to, in connection with investments or related activities in its territory
made by investors of the other Contracting State.

Article 4
Treatment of Investments

1. Each Contracting State guarantees, at all times, fair and equitable treatment to
investments made in its territory by investors of the other Contracting State. This
treatment shall not be less favourable than the treatment granted in similar
circumstances to its own investors or to investors of a third State whichever is more
favourable.

2. Each Contracting State grants the investors of the other Contracting State, regarding
connected activities related to their investments including the use, enjoyment,
management, development, maintenance and expansion or disposal of these
investments, a treatment that is not less favourable than the one granted to its own
investors or to investors of a third State whichever is more favourable.

3. However, the provisions of this Article shall not be construed so as binding a
Contracting State to extend to the investors of the other Contracting State special
treatment, preference or privilege resulting from:

a) Any customs or economic union, free trade zone, monetary union, any kind of
regional economic arrangement or other similar international agreement
concluded between the two Contracting States or to which either of them is or
may later become a party;

b) Any international, regional or bilateral agreement or any similar arrangement

or any domestic legislation totally or mainly relating to taxation.
Article 12
Application of other Provisions

If the legislations of either Contracting State or obligations under international law
currently existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting States in
addition to the present Agreement, contain rules, whether general or specific, entitling
investments or connected activities by the investors of the other Contracting State to a
treatment more favourable than as provided for by the present Agreement, such rules,
to the extent that they are more favourable, prevail over the present Agreement.

2. Domestic legislation

134. As noted above, the application of Jordanian tax legislation is at the heart of the present
dispute. It is helpful to extract key provisions from that legislation to set the context for the
subsequent summary of the parties’ submissions.

135. It is common ground that the applicable taxation legislation was Income Tax Law No 57 of
1985 (1985 Tax Law), as amended. Although the parties and their experts explained in detail
the evolution of this law, it is accepted that at the time of the Transaction it read as follows:?**

Article (3)

a. Income accrued or earned in the Kingdom from the following sources by any person
shall be subject to tax-:

1. Profits or gains from any work, craft, business, profession or vocation...and from
any separate transaction or deal which is considered as trade or business.

7. Consideration for vacancy, key-money, and goodwill.

R

Profits or gains from any other source not included in items (1-11) of this
paragraph which have not been explicitly excluded from these items and which
have not been granted an exemption under this law or any other law.

Article (7)

a. It shall be totally exempt from tax

15. a. Capital gains, profits accrued from the buying and selling of lands, real estate,
shares and bonds shall be considered part of these capital profits except for
gains resulting from sale or transfer of ownership of assets included in the rules
of depreciation stipulated in this law, provided that the losses arising from the
sale or transfer of ownership of such assets included by the rules of depreciation
are deducted if they are realized. For the purposes of this law, this loss shall be
determined to be equal either to the depreciation deducted for the purposes
of this law or the incurred loss whichever is less.

b. 25% of the gains of purchasing and selling shares and bonds inside or outside
the Amman Stock Exchange and from distributions of Joint Investment Funds
accrued to banks and financial institutions provided that no amounts of
expenses will be returned to the gains of such companies in return to exempting
such a percentage of gains.

136. The Parties disagree on the correct interpretation of this Article. The Claimants maintain that
Article 7.A.15.a contains only one element (an exemption for capital gains and a list of
examples of such capital gains), an interpretation which they say is confirmed by the official

231 Originally annexed as Ex C-6 and subject to official translation

translation.” The Respondent says it contains two elements (an exemption for capital gains
and a list of sources which are deemed to be capital gains).?9?

137. Prior to 2001, the exemption for capital gains was found — in similar terms — in Article
7.A.11.?* The 2001 Amending Tax Law also introduced a specific reference to shuhra/goodwill
in Article 3.7%

138. The Parties also explained the evolution of the legislation applicable to the formation and
constitution of corporations in Jordan. Since this is relevant to the proper interpretation of
the tax law, it is helpful to recount briefly this history:77°

(a) The first comprehensive Jordanian legislation applicable to the formation of
companies was the 1964 Companies Law. It provided for two kinds of companies —
ordinary companies and shareholding companies. Shareholding companies, in turn,
were defined in Article 8 as ‘money/capital companies that include public
shareholding limited companies and (private) shareholding limited companies.’ 7?”
Article 39(2), meanwhile, provided that the share capital of a public shareholding
limited company consisted of ‘ashom shares that are tradable and may be offered
publicly’, whereas the share capital of a private shareholding limited company
consisted of ‘ashom shares which may not be publicly offered’.?**

(b) The 1989 Temporary Companies Law abolished the concept of private shareholding
companies.”*° Instead, Article 6 relevantly provided for two kinds of ‘money/capital
companies’ — public shareholding companies and limited liability companies:”*°

(i) Public shareholding companies were continued from the 1964 Law, and were
still constituted by ashom shares; and

(ii) Private shareholding companies were replaced by limited liability companies.
These were constituted, according to Article 54, by husas shares, while Article
56 provided that husas shares could not be offered publicly.”*

(c) The 1997 Companies Law maintained this structure, and continued to recognize
public shareholding companies and limited liability companies.

(d) The 2002 Amending Companies Law came into force on 17 February 2002, and (re-)
introduced a new form of ‘money/capital company’ known as private shareholding
companies in Article 66(a)(bis). These companies were constituted by ashom shares;
in Mr Rabah’s opinion they are ‘more akin’ to limited liability companies although Dr
Masa’deh disagrees.” Although Article 66(a)(bis)(C) of the 2002 Law permitted the
listing and public trading of private shareholding companies, Jordan’s Securities
Commission has not issued the necessary directives to enable this and private
shareholding companies are not traded on Jordan’s stock exchange.”“*

Thus, it is common ground that by the time of the Transaction, the 1997 Companies Law as
amended recognised:***

(a) Public shareholding companies and private shareholding companies constituted by
ashom shares; and

(b) Limited liability companies and partnerships constituted by husas shares.
It is also common ground that:7*°

(a) UTT is a limited liability company;*”

(b) UMC is a private shareholding company;*"* and
(c) The Transaction took the form of a sale of shares.”°
The validity of the Tax Measure

1. Introduction

A central dispute between the parties is whether the Tax Measure was lawfully imposed; that
is to say, whether UTT’s sale of its shares in UMC was taxable in accordance with the taxation
legislation in place in 2006.

The Claimants say that the Tax Measure was unlawful, because Article 7.A.15.a clearly
exempted from taxation profit representing capital gains on the sale of shares. They say, in
particular, that Article 7.A.15.a as officially translated confirms:?°°

243 Expert Report of Mr Nabil Rabah, [55]-[56]. See 2002 Amending Companies Law, Article 66(a)(bis) (Ex NR1, App 6, No 13);

251 Tr Day 5,

(a) All capital gains are fully exempt, because what follow are examples;

(b) There is no distinction between public and private shareholding companies as all
capital gains are exempt;

(c) There is nothing to support the bifurcation of profit into taxable and exempt
elements; and

(d) There is no distinction between buying and selling (trading) of shares, on the one
hand, and selling by founding partners.

The Claimants dispute the Respondent’s argument that Article 7.A.15.a contains a deeming
provision: their case is that capital gains are exempt, and the individual items are examples of
that exemption. 7 They say that if the Tribunal accepts this interpretation, then the
Respondent's case necessarily fails.7>*

The Respondent says that the ISTD interpreted Article 7.A.15.a correctly, or at least in a
manner that was open to it.7°? As noted above, the Respondent sees Article 7.A.15.a as
including two elements, so the Tribunal must answer two questions arising out of Article
7.A.15.a: was the entirety of the proceeds a capital gain (thus coming within the initial words
of the article) in which case the exemption would apply? If not, do the proceeds nevertheless
come within the ‘deeming’ provision?” In particular, it says that the exemption only applies
where the taxpayer has bought and sold ashom shares in a public shareholding company, and
because UMC was a private shareholding company, the exemption did not apply. Therefore,
the gains earned by UTT — equivalent to the goodwill or shuhra representing the difference
between the share cost of the company and the sale price — was taxable.”**

2. The scope of the exemption
(i) The Claimants’ submissions

On the question of statutory interpretation generally, Dr Masa’deh says that a provision will
(generally) be interpreted at the time it is enacted,*° that if the ‘text is clear, you don’t need
to go into interpretation matters’,”*’ but that an evolutionary approach to interpretation may
be consistent with the legislature’s intention.7**

146. The Claimants dispute the Respondent’s starting point that ‘all income is, in principle,
taxable’*°® as reversing the constitutional rule that no tax may be imposed except by law, and
no exemption may be applied except by law.” The rule is accordingly that profit is not taxable
unless the law so provides, and the burden of proving the generation of a taxable income lies
with the ISTD.?© According to Dr Masa’deh’s evidence under cross-examination, this extends
to proving the taxable element and the source of income,” and the source of this rule is
Article 3 and Article 29.A of the Tax Law (albeit that these articles do not use the term ‘burden
of proof’). So far as the relationship between the general principle and the exemption is
concerned, Dr Masa’deh agrees that an exemption should not be interpreted ‘extensively’,
but says that one cannot read the general principle in isolation from the exemption.” He also
notes the general principle of civil procedure that whoever asserts something must prove it.7°
So far as the interpretation of Article 3.A of the Income Tax Law is concerned, Dr Masa’deh
does not accept that paragraph 12 catches ‘profits or gains from any other source’, since in
his view it does not catch non-taxable sources of income: paragraph 12 must be read in the
context of the preceding 11 paragraphs, which are mainly concerned with operational
profits.7°° Mr Rabah accepts that when the legislator excluded land in paragraph 10 (it not
being a depreciable asset), it was not recaptured by the general provision in paragraph 12;7°”
on that basis, the Claimants argue that not all forms of income are subject to Article 3.7°°

147. The Claimants submit that the gains that UTT earned on the sale of its shares in UMC
constitute ‘capital gains’ or ‘capital profits’ in terms of Article 7.4.15.a of the 1985 Tax Law,
and accordingly should have been exempt from taxation.”® It is irrelevant that ‘capital gains’
is not defined because the sale of ashom shares is expressly included.?”°

148. The Claimants reject the argument that a share sale may give rise to both an exempt capital
gain and goodwill.?” The Claimants also reject the Respondent’s attempt to read down the
meaning of ‘capital gain’ Article 7.A.15.a: the Article provides that capital gains are ‘fully
exempt’.2”2

(ii) The Respondent’s submissions

149. On the general principles of statutory interpretation, the Respondent says that statutes must
be interpreted:?”

(a) In accordance with their plain meaning;

(b) In context, as a whole;

(c) In such a way as to give effect to all terms therein;

(d) In the context of tax, restrictively without expansion by analogy; and

(e) As they stood at the time they were enacted.

150. The Respondent starts from the proposition that profits earned from the sale of goodwill is
taxable, against the background of which the exemption in Article 7.A.15.a must be
interpreted.’ It maintains that the law does not contemplate ‘construing the provision in
order to make the exceptional provision flexible to include the originally not exempted from
tax into the exceptional exemption.’2”>

151. The Respondent submits there is nothing in Article 3 that suggests ‘a capital gain is not per se
taxable’; proceeds from the sale of shares fall within the concept of ‘profits or gains’ in the
catch-all paragraph 12.7” The starting point is that all income, including from a sale of shares,
is taxable.”” The exemption in Article 7.A.15.a then applies to all ‘capital profits’ and any
profits deemed to be capital gains.” In the Respondent's view, paragraph 12 is closely related
to the exemption in Article 7, since capital gains will come within the broad definition in
paragraph 12 to the extent they are not otherwise exempted.?”?

156.

(i) The Claimants’ submissions

The Claimants’ case is that the exemption applied to the sale of ashom shares in either a public
shareholding company or a private shareholding company. As UMC is a private shareholding
company, the exemption applied. Mr Almusned’s evidence is that no distinction was drawn at
the relevant time by ISTD between the taxation treatment of companies constituted by ashom
or husas as far as private shareholding companies were concerned.”*! Dr Masa’deh opined
that the focus of the exemption is on capital-based companies, and therefore the reference
to ashom shares should be read to include capital companies constituted by both ashom and
husas shares.”® He could not offer an explanation for why the legislator had used the term
husas for a company constituted by capital as opposed by the interest of the named
partners.?83

The Claimants reject the Respondent’s suggestion that the reference to ashom shares was
intended to refer only to public shareholding companies, and Mr Rabah accepted that there
was no precedent case for such a proposition. The Claimants disagree that an investor
should have been expected to know the history of how the companies legislation had evolved
in order to work out what the legislature meant by the reference to ashom shares — any sale
of ashom shares is exempt. Any other approach would be deceptive, breach legal stability,
and could not be in good faith.” They also say that the Respondent has failed to identify a
coherent reason for such a distinction.”°°

The exemption of capital gains arising on the sale of ashom shares has been in place since
1985, and applying the Respondent’s interpretative methodology the meaning of this term
should be interpreted by reference to the 1964 Companies Law — which recognized both
private and public shareholding companies.”*’ The Claimants also note that the Respondent
relies on the terms of the 1989 Temporary Companies Law which had been repealed since
1997.78

Accordingly, the Claimants submit that it is immaterial whether private shareholding
companies are (dis)similar to limited liability companies, since it is enough that they are
constituted by ashom shares.”*° The flawed premise of the Respondent’s theory, according to
the Claimants, is that the exemption cannot be extended to ‘new’ companies which were

created from 2002 onwards.*°° Applying an inter-temporal approach, only two moments
could be relevant — either 1985 or 2006 — but in either case the reference to ashom shares
would capture the shares in UMC.?* Parliament introduced the 2002 amendments in the
context of an existing exemption applicable to ashom shares, and Parliament could have
enacted legislation (in 1995 or at any point before 2006) to constrain the exemption.?

The Claimants also say that the ISTD and the Tax Court of Appeal focused on the wrong
company in determining whether the exemption applied; the enquiry should have been
concerned with UMC, not UTT.’°? Thus the Claimants say that a central paragraph of the Tax
Court of Appeal’s judgment: wrongly refers to UMC’s shares as husas instead of ashom;
focused on the character of the shares in UTT instead of UMC in order to determine whether
the exemption applied; and wrongly holds that the exemption did not apply because UMC
was a private, not public, shareholding company.*** They say that the Court of Cassation
perpetuated these errors.*°° Indeed, the Respondent’s acceptance in this arbitration that a
‘partial exemption’ is possible was not reflected in the Court of Appeal’s analysis: ‘It did not
at all see the exemption.’

The Claimants also say that the Respondent’s interpretation is discriminatory. The Respondent
implies that the seller of shares in public shareholding companies are not in ‘like
circumstances’ to the sellers of shares in non-public shareholding companies; 7®’ that is
inconsistent with Parliament’s intention, and ignores the fact that private shareholding
companies are ‘in principle’ tradable on the market.2%

(ii) The Respondent’s submissions

The Respondent’s case, relying on Mr Rabah’s evidence, is that Article 7 contains two
elements: an exception for capital gains, and a deeming provision whereby gains arising from
the sale of shares in a public shareholding company are treated as capital gains.*°? The
Respondent submitted that Dr Masa’deh is not truly expert in Jordanian tax law.3”

Although the official translation of Article 7.A.15.a does not use the verb ‘deemed’, the
Respondent maintains that the effect of the clause is to treat profits that would not otherwise
be exempt as exempt capital gains.*” On the linguistic point, the Respondent also referred to
a number of provisions of the Income Tax Law that supported its submission that the words

‘shall be considered’ had to be given meaning, otherwise the legislator would have used a
phrase such as ‘includes’.*°? The Claimants noted that these additional translations were not
referred to official translation, and submitted they were being taken out of context.*°? The
Tribunal reminded the Respondent that its analysis would have to consider Article 7.4.15.a in
its official translation.°™*

161. The Respondent says that the exemption in Article 7.4.15.a is subject to two limitations which
the Claimants do not recognise:*>

(a) The exemption only applies where the taxpayer has bought and sold (i.e. traded) the
shares; and

(b) The reference to ashom shares is understood to be limited to ashom shares of public
shareholding companies.

162. So far as the first qualification is concerned, however, the Claimants say Mr Rabah confirmed
in evidence that the tax treatment of a share sale did not depend on whether the sellers were
founding partners.°%

163. On the second argument, Mr Rabah opines that this is consistent with the legislative history
of the exemption.*°” According to Mr Batarseh, ISTD officials have understood the exemption
to be concerned only with the buying and selling of shares on the Amman Stock Exchange.
Accordingly, even though the 2002 amendments introduced the concept of private
shareholding companies constituted by ashom shares, ‘this exemption is not understood by
ISTD officials as applying to such companies as a matter of principle’.*°® Mr Kudah suggests
that the policy behind this distinction is that the price of shares traded publicly is determined
by the market, rather than between the parties, and the government wished to encourage
investment in the market.

164. The Respondent argues that this explanation is reflected in the decision rejecting the
administrative objection: the fact that UMC was not a public shareholding company whose
shares were traded, and the fact that UTT was a ‘founding partner’ (a reference, in the
Respondent’s submission, to the fact that UTT had not bought and sold the shares) took it
outside the scope of the exemption.*”° It also notes that the Tax Court of Appeal and Court of
Cassation both emphasised the exemption’s limitation to public shareholding companies.**?

The Respondent relies on the evolution of the companies legislation in support of its
interpretation of the reference to ashom shares. Mr Rabah says that the exemption in Article
7.A.15.a (as subsequently renumbered) was introduced in the 1995 amendments to the 1985
Tax Law (although an equivalent exemption had previously been found in Article 7.4.11). By
that time, the concept of private shareholding companies had been abolished by the
temporary law of 1989. Since the 1995 Amending Tax Law ‘is the first law that incorporated
the terms of the 1989 Temporary Companies Law within the provisions of the 1985 Tax Law’,
by introducing a new provision referring only to ashom shares Parliament must have intended
that it should only apply to public shareholding companies — the only form of company
constituted by ashom shares at the time: there was no such thing as a private shareholding
company under the 1989 Temporary Companies Law.?!”

Dr Masa’deh’s evidence for the Claimants is that this amendment only introduced the
depreciable assets exemption, and should accordingly be treated as amending and not
repealing and replacing Article 7.A.11.*43 The Respondent's case is that in 1995 the legislator
made a ‘positive decision to replace Article 7.A.11’; that the new provision refers to companies
constituted by ashom shares, and therefore the legislator must have had in mind the
companies constituted by ashom shares in 1995. The Respondent submits that the contrary
theory advanced by Dr Masa’deh (that because the amendment only introduced the reference
to depreciable assets it must be interpreted as it would have been when the original provision
was promulgated in 19857") is ‘completely implausible’ .**° It would entail that the legislator
did not in 1995 have in mind the forms of company that then existed but was looking back to
ashom shares as they existed under the regime established in 1964.

The Respondent accepts that the original exemption for ashom shares could be construed as
capturing both public and private shareholding companies (both of which existed in 1985),
but submits that this is ‘unlikely’ because its predecessor, a provision of the 1982 Temporary
Tax Law referred to ‘subscription, purchase and sale’, and because the reference to ‘buying
and selling’ connotes trading on the stock exchange. *!° So the Respondent argues that
Jordanian principles of constitutional law and statutory interpretation prevent an ‘implied or
automatic extension’ to the new form of company — particularly in circumstances where
private shareholding companies are akin to limited liability companies which do not benefit
from the exemption. #2’ If the legislator had intended to encompass all capital-based
companies, it could have added a reference to ‘company’ as defined in Article 2.3%

The Respondent also says that UTT never submitted during its administrative and judicial
challenges to the Tax Measure that the ISTD was wrong to exclude from the exemption the

sale of shares in private shareholding companies.*“° UTT’s submissions were ‘preoccupied’
with the distinction between public shareholding companies and limited liability companies
and apart from one reference in passing, its submissions in the Court of Cassation do not refer
to private shareholding companies at all.37° It acknowledges a ‘confusing reference to the
appellant company being a limited liability company’ in the judgment (which it ascribes partly
to UTT’s pleadings), but submits that the ‘critical point’ is the court’s understanding that the
reference to ashom shares only includes shares in public shareholding companies. *7* It
disputes that withholding tax should have been applied to Batelco, because the requirement
only applies to Jordanian companies.

4. The distinction between companies constituted by ashom and husas shares, and the
relationship between the sale of shares and the taxation of goodwill

(i) The Claimants’ submissions

The Claimants emphasise that the 1985 Tax Law distinguished between the sale of depreciable
assets, the sale of non-depreciable assets, and the sale of shares; goodwill is also recognised
as a separate concept. The fundamental distinction between goodwill (an asset) and shares is
the point of departure of the Claimants’ analysis. **3

So far as terminology is concerned, the Claimants emphasise the following points:324

(a) It is not disputed that goodwill/shuhra comes within the definition of ‘gross income’
pursuant to Article 3.A.7 of the 1985 Tax Law;

(b) It is also undisputed that the term ‘goodwill’ is not defined in the Tax Law;

(c) The Jordanian Law of Commerce, however, defines ‘goodwill’ as an intangible asset,
and according to a precedent of the Court of Cassation ‘taxation of profits generated
by goodwill ... occurs when ownership over assets is transferred’ ;*?°

(d) The reference to ‘goodwill’ was introduced into the Tax Law in 2001, and should be
interpreted as referring to a depreciable asset ‘and not part of companies’ share
capital that cannot be separated or depreciated from such a share.’?”° Dr Masa’deh
thus opines that assets which are not subject to depreciation are not caught by Article
3 at all, confirmed by the exemption in Article 7.°7”

The Claimants submit that its transaction was clearly a sale of shares, not the sale of the
underlying assets such as goodwill, and accordingly there was no basis on which to impose a
tax on any goodwill element.*”* If Parliament had intended that, they would have provided for
it;32° Dr Masa’deh opines that the policy behind the distinction is to foster investment.22°

The distinction between the sale of shares and the sale of assets is at the heart of the
Claimants’ case, since they say that the sale of shares cannot give rise to a taxable disposition
of goodwill. **4 They say that the sale of partnerships or ‘general ordinary companies’
constituted by husas shares takes the form of the sale of assets, and in those circumstances it
is necessary to make a distinction between taxable goodwill and exempt capital gain.** The
Claimants accept that when a natural person sells a partnership interest, they are selling a
portion of the underlying assets and the law will, if proof is satisfied, draw a distinction
between taxable goodwill and capital gains. 333 However they say that any such case is
distinguishable from a sale of shares.334

The proviso to the exemption provided in Article 7.4.15.a does not apply, because shares are
non-depreciable.*** They explain that the relevant provisions of the Tax Law (as they have
been amended by Parliament and interpreted by the courts) are designed to achieve
symmetry between taxable sources and deductible expenses: the sale of depreciable assets
gives rise to taxable income under Article 3 and a deductible expense under Article 9.3°° The
consequence is that the sale of capital assets is not taxable except for the sale of depreciable
assets.33”

As well as submitting that Jordanian law does not recognise the concept of bifurcating the sale
of shares into capital gain and goodwill, the Claimants say that tax is only due on goodwill
when the goodwill changes hands; if it stays in the company’s accounts, then there is no
taxable event.***

The Claimants thus distinguish the line of cases on which the Respondent relies on the basis
that they all involved partnerships and the sale of assets, and submit that the Tax Measure
was ‘unprecedented’.**? While they accept that a partnership has separate legal personality
under Jordanian law, *“° the Claimants submit:

(a) Daoud Al-lssa establishes the proposition that the sale of a partnership interest
(constituted by husas) involved the sale of a portion of the underlying assets, so might
give rise to a taxable goodwill component.**

(b) Hamdan involved the same partnership, and establishes that capital gain on a sale of
a partnership portion (measured by the appraised value of the assets at that date) is
not taxable.*?

(c) Ghassan Dhamen involved the sale of an interest in a private shareholding company

(under the 1964 Law, equivalent to a limited liability company under the 1997 Law).**?
Although the transaction was titled a share sale, the Court found that it in substance
(and as a matter of fact) it involved the sale of assets,>“* so that it gave rise to a
corresponding deduction and taxable income.**>

(d) Arab Public Shareholding stands for two propositions: that shuhra is only taxable
when it changes hands, and that the ISTD could not rely on the new depreciable assets
provision because it had been introduced after the transaction.*“° It does not support
the notion that where the whole of the shares in the company are sold then there is
a taxable event.*””

The Claimants say that the consequence of defining shuhra as the difference between the
nominal value of the shares and the sale price would be that all capital profits would be
considered goodwill.*#8 Mr Al-Akhras also maintains that the calculation of shuhra was not in
accordance with accounting standards.**° Mr Dweik notes that tax treatment is not the same
as accounting treatment;2*° he opines that the assessor should have calculated goodwill as
the difference between the ‘fair value of the assets or shares’ and the sale price, but instead
had calculated it as the difference between the cost of the shares and the sale price.**! The
Claimants say that the ISTD ignored the legal structure of the Transaction.**? The Claimants
submit that ISTD’s reliance on international accounting standards in support of the Tax
Measure is misplaced;**? it relies on Ms Jackson’s opinion that no goodwill would have been
accounted for in UTT’s accounts, to tax UTT on goodwill derived from a third party’s accounts

is ‘nonsense’, and the Respondent's bifurcation theory would be unique internationally.** Mr
Dweik accepted that goodwill cannot arise when one sells half a business, or when tangible
assets are sold.**°

An ordinary company constituted by husas shares—with separate legal personality—calculates
its profits and losses and files its own tax return. However, the obligation to actually pay the
tax rests on the individual partners according to their pro rata share in the ownership of the
company. Accordingly, the company itself does not pay tax.>*

(ii) The Respondent’s submissions

The Respondent does not accept the rubric of the Claimants’ analysis. Relying on the evidence
of witnesses of fact with experience in the ISTD, it says that the goodwill element of a share
sale may be taxable. It adopts the opinion of Mr Almusned:**”

In a sale transaction of ‘husas’ shares or ‘ashom’ shares involving, in effect, a sale of the
business as an ongoing concern and at a price above the fair value of the business taking
into account the cost of investment in the assets of the business, goodwill will be a part
of the transaction. The part of the price that is capital gain is exempt from tax, and the
part of the price that is goodwill is subject to tax pursuant to Article 3.A.7; although | note
that, where the taxpayer provides no documents like UTT did in this instance, the full
difference between the sale price and cost of investment will be treated as goodwill,
which the taxpayer can then challenge by subsequent administrative objection.

It also says that the ‘appropriateness’ of taxing goodwill and the quantification of goodwill as
the difference between the fair value and the sale price of the shares is reflected in the
contemporaneous record.*** The Respondent’s expert, Mr Rabah, accepted that goodwill is
an intangible asset of the company, and that the fair market price of a public shareholding
company is determined by its traded price, but opined that in the case of a private
shareholding company the agreed price is not always a fair price.**° One calculates the value
of the tangible and intangible assets in order to calculate the fair price, with the difference
between this and the sale price constituting goodwill.*°

Both capital-based and personal companies (including general partnership companies) enjoy

The Respondent put its interpretation of the relevant case law to Dr Masa’deh in cross-
examination.*® Dr Masa’deh accepts that a general ordinary company has separate legal
personality; is divided in husas shares which are held by the partners, form the capital of the
company and can be transferred; is capable of owning and selling assets in its own name; that
the company and not the partners have title to the assets, and that this basic position has not
changed through the 1964, 1989 and 1997 Companies Laws.*°? Dr Masa’deh could not point
to any provision in the 1964 Companies Law which said that an individual partner can sell
assets of the company.**

On the individual cases, the Respondent's interpretation starts from the proposition that the
entities to which the transactions related had separate legal personality.*® It submits that
these authorities form a line of jurisprudence with which the UTT decisions are consistent:3°°

(a) There is nothing in Daoud Al-Issa (Case 611/1981, which is referred to in the ISTD
Manual *°’) to suggest that the sale of husas in a general ordinary company or
partnership is a sale of the underlying assets. ** It was the sale of a share in a separate
legal person (which share is registered in the Companies Register in the same manner
as shares in any other company).**?

(b) The same is true of Hamdan.*”°

(c) In Arab Public Shareholding, the Court found that goodwill had not actually changed
hands. It follows from the judgment that if the shares in the limited company had
been transferred to a third party for value, then a portion of the price reflecting
goodwill would have been taxable.37*

(d) In two further decisions, there was no finding that the transaction involved the sale
1 372

of assets: ‘the focus is on the consideration and what the sale price reflects’.
(e) The appellant in Rowwad recognized that taxable goodwill could arise ona share sale;
it focused on putting forward evidence to prove that the sale did not involve a
goodwill element. *”3 The Court noted that the assessed goodwill matched that

recorded in the buyer’s consolidated financial statements.*”* The Respondent notes
that Batelco’s accounts record part of the share price as reflecting goodwill.3”° The
Respondent says that since the Claimants accept Rowwad did not involve the transfer
of assets, they are forced to contend it was wrongly decided.3”°

5. Precedent for the imposition of the tax
(i) The Claimants’ submissions

The Claimants submit that the Respondent has not produced a single example where it taxed
the profits arising from the sale of shares in limited liability and private shareholding
companies before June 2006.%”’ They say that the consistent understanding at the time was
that such transactions were not taxable, and that the burden of establishing otherwise should
rest on the Respondent.?” They cite a list of private shareholding and other companies sold
without the imposition of tax on goodwill,” and cite Dr Masa’deh’s opinion that the Court of
Cassation precedents identified by Mr Rabah are distinguishable. **° They say that the
Respondent's witnesses disproved the Respondent's assertion that the Rowwad case was well
known at the time.**

(ii) The Respondent’s submissions

The Respondent cites Mr Rabah’s reference to the judgments delivered before UTT’s
investment in Jordan referred above which upheld the taxation of goodwill included in the
sale of husas shares.** It cites in particular the ‘Rowwad’ or ‘Fastlink’ case, where Rowwad
obtained a shareholding in a limited liability company (Bella Investment Company WLL), and
Rowwad’s auditors, Saba/Deloitte, recorded in Rowwad’s financial statements
goodwill/shuhra as an asset resulting from the purchase of the shares. According to the
Respondent, when Rowwad sold its shares in Bella, the ISTD imposed a tax on the goodwill
element which was upheld by the Tax Court of Appeal and Court of Cassation.**3 While it
accepts that the Rowwad case concerned the sale of shares in a limited liability company
(constituted by husas rather than ashom shares) it says that the ‘factual parallels between the
two cases were otherwise very close’ and the basic principle of taxing the goodwill component
was present. It submits that responsible tax advisers and auditors at the time of the
Transaction would accordingly have advised of the potential tax liability on sales of companies

that were not public shareholding companies.*** The Respondent submits that the Court of
Cassation applied this line of cases.®° Recent cases also demonstrate that goodwill in the sale
of shares is taxable. *°°

The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ reliance on a list of private shareholding companies
which had been sold without the imposition of a goodwill tax, arguing that ISTD has
consistently sought to impose tax where it is applicable and is prevented by law from
commenting further on the cases of third party taxpayers.**” Ms Alexander also says there are
international precedents for bifurcating capital gain and goodwill on a share sale.***

The Tribunal asked Mr Kudah what internal procedures were in place to give policy guidance
to assessors in individual cases. He testified that an ‘assessment manual’ and a base of
knowledge for employees were available, and extracts from the former were produced in

evidence.**® The manual was updated from time to time.*”

The alleged political motivation of the Tax Measure

The Claimants argue that the Tax Measure was politically motivated, and that this contributes
to the breach of a number of the substantive guarantees in the BIT.

The parties take starkly different positions on this question. The Claimants allege that the Tax
Measure was imposed as a politically expedient reaction to popular dissatisfaction with
perceived failings in the process by which the Government had granted the Licence and the
profits made by UTT. The Respondent says that the Tax Measure was imposed in good faith
by public servants applying their genuine understanding of the relevant law, uninfluenced by
the political context.

The facts are summarised in Section III above. To a significant extent this section summarises
the different inferences which the Parties invite the Tribunal to draw from those primary facts.

1. The Claimants’ submissions

The Claimants submit that a decision based on political motivation is the ‘paragon’ of an
arbitrary decision under international law.*”"

It recounts the narrative of the political motivation behind the Tax Measure in the following
way:

(a)

The Claimants start with the process of granting the Licence in 2003, noting that the
duopoly offered increasingly large sums for the Government to defer that process.
They say that public concern was already developing about what was seen as a ‘loss’
to the Government, and it was this concern that reignited in 2006.”

The Minister of Finance recommended that the King accept the duopoly’s offer. But
the King instructed the CEO of the Board of Commissioners of the TRC, Ms Muna
Nijem, to tell the duopoly that the Government expected to receive long term
revenues of JD 200 million from the third Licence, and that the duopoly should be
required to pay this if they wished to prevent the grant of the third licence. When that
offer was rejected, the King explained in a further meeting that the Government's
priority should be the development of the economy rather than short-term returns to
the Treasury.*% At the same time, another member of the TRC, Ms Shuqair, expressed
the view that the process was tailored in favour of Mr Dagher and dissented from the
decision to grant the Licence.*™ Fastlink also challenged the grant of the Licence, a
challenge the Supreme Court rejected.*>

Turning to the sale in 2006, although the Claimants never hid the sale price from the
Respondent, Ms Shuqair demanded to see a copy of the SPA and again dissented from
the TRC’s approval of the transfer, referring to money being ‘transferred unjustifiably’
to Mr Dagher, noting public opinion and suggesting that ‘legal means available to take
necessary measures to return these amounts to the treasury should be studied.’ *°°
The sale itself was met by a ‘media uproar’ building on the existing impression that
UTT had ‘cheated’ in obtaining the Licence for JD 4 million.39”

Along with the pressure on UTT to pay double the required stamp duty, there then
began a lengthy campaign by Members of Parliament lasting into 2007, in an attempt
to recoup the profit made by UTT.*** This was followed, in 2013, by what the
Claimants describe as political interference in the enforcement of the Tax Measure. °°

The Claimants emphasise that they have brought this arbitration as a consequence of the
events since the Tax Measure was confirmed by the Court of Cassation, and in particular the
direct pursuit of the Claimants.“

The Claimants rely in particular on the political and media focus on the transaction in 2006
and 2007, recounted above, to submit that the Tax Measure had been predetermined. They

rely in particular on:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(a)

401

Mr Kudah’s press statement on 30 June 2006 that the transaction was in principle
subject to tax, which they claim was made without familiarizing himself with the law,
unprofessionally and perhaps in breach of confidentiality;*”

The July 2006 Committee which they maintain was highly likely to have been
politically steered and was created to find a justification;*

The Prime Minister’s Committee of September 2006, which they say was an
‘extraordinary act of targeting’ at the request of the Parliamentary group that had
originally been opposed to the grant of the licence, noting that the Committee used
the Arabic word for ‘collect’ not ‘assess’;** and

The allegation that the 2008 assessment was ‘wholly insufficient’ and comprised ‘a
few hand scribbles’ and was conducted hastily in violation of proper procedures.‘

Responding to a number of points made by the Respondent, the Claimants say:

(a)

(b)

The establishment of the Prime Minister’s 2006 Committee was not itself arbitrary,
but the decision of the Prime Minister to succumb to political pressure was. The
Respondent misrepresents its outcome by deliberately confusing it with the Council
of Ministers’ Committee of June 2006. The questions submitted were not submitted
by an MP but agreed on by all participants of the 5 July 2006 meeting.*°

The Claimants rely upon the Government's capitulation to Parliamentary and public
pressure. “°” The Claimants’ expert, Dr Masa’deh, does not maintain that the
Jordanian courts acted in bad faith,“ and does not contest the independent
character of the Jordanian judiciary.*°° The Claimants nevertheless submit that Jordan
is ‘a country which is all susceptible to political pressure’*!° and that the courts ‘were
left with no option but to go ahead with the decision and the request from both
Parliament and the Prime Minister’.“!*

The Claimants reject the evidence of the ISTD officials, Mr Kudah and Mr Mawazreh,
that the case was handled the same way as any other, noting in particular Mr Kudah’s
role both on the Committee and within the ISTD.*””

The Claimants submit that the 2006 (ISTD) Committee decided that tax should be
imposed on the Transaction regardless, consistent with the view publicly expressed
by Mr Kudah.** Noting that the Respondent had either failed or refused document
production requests in relation to the circumstances by which the Transaction came
to the attention of ISTD, the Claimants invite the Tribunal to find that it did not come
to ISTD in the ordinary way; rather, these developments were the product of a
predetermined conviction that the Transaction should be taxed.*”*

So too, the Claimants question the credibility of the Respondent’s evidence as to how
the taxability of the Transaction came before the ISTD in 2008. Instead of being drawn
to the ISTD’s attention by a list of taxpayers who had not filed a return, the Claimants
submit that the 2008 Assessment Committee was established in response to UTT’s
intentions to reduce its capital and enter liquidation.**

The Claimants submit that the assessment process in 2008 was not adequate or conducted in
accordance with legal requirements and ISTD practice. This is relevant both directly to the
Claimants’ allegations of Treaty breaches and also to the question of whether the Tax Measure
was correct as a matter of Jordanian law:*¥°

(a)

(b)

(c)

After waiting a year, the Assessment Committee was formed just after the ISTD
learned of the proposal to liquidate and was instructed to undertake the assessment
‘as soon as possible’.

The ISTD ‘deliberately prevented any involvement of UTT’ contrary to its usual
process.‘

The ISTD failed to comply with the notification provisions of the Income Tax Law, and
although it managed to contact UTT’s liquidator it ‘deliberately and knowingly took
the decision not to wait for his return to the country before deciding to impose the

invite companies that had failed to submit their tax returns to do so, and to participate in the assessment process at the

Mr Al Kudah said in that passage was ‘As for those people who have not submitted their tax returns, the assessors will be
instructed to make an initial assessment, and the purpose of this assessment, as globally accepted, is to oblige and direct the
taxpayers towards submitting their tax returns so that the submitted tax return replaces the initial assessment; and
thereafter if there is a tax return it will be reviewed and verified according to the principles’. In his Second Witness Statement,
n1, Mr Kudah clarified the translation of his First Witness Statement, [28] to state that the taxpayer ‘may’ be invited to ISTD.

Tax’ and the 2008 Assessment Committee ‘intentionally chose to expedite its decision
before UTT’s liquidator and legal representative returned’.

(d) The Assessment Committee reached its conclusion ‘just seven working days after its
formation on 24 April 2008’.

(e) In this context, the Claimants say that the extracts from the Assessment Manual
describing ‘Phases for the assessment procedure in case of failure to provide a tax
return’ are ‘hugely significant’ because they demonstrate a failure to comply with
establish procedures and thus arbitrariness and targeting. “!® Responding to the
Respondent's arguments, they say that the 27 January 2008 Circular does not change
the matter, and emphasise that the Assessment Manual is not expressed in optional

terms.‘

2. The Respondent’s submissions

The Respondent begins by recalling the high standard of proof implied by allegations of bad
faith,*2° which cannot be made out by inference in this case.*72

The Respondent says that the Claimants have failed to identify the ulterior objective, in
circumstances where a political motivation could only be wrongful if the motivation was to do
something other than apply the law properly.*” None of the classic forms of ulterior motive
are present.*”3 The Claimants have not established the link between what the Government is
said to have been implicitly directing and how the assessment was actually made.*74

The Respondent submits that the Claimants’ political motivation theory ‘petered out’ in cross-
examination. It says that there is no documentary or testimonial evidence from which to infer
a wrongful political motivation, noting in particular:*7°

(a) The Claimants did not challenge Mr Batarseh’s evidence that the assessment was not
politically motivated,“”° or that the Committee considered Article 7.A.15.a;*””

(b) The Claimants did not challenge evidence of other ISTD officials rebutting the
allegation; and

(c) The Claimants only raised the theory ‘obliquely’ with Mr Kudah and did not put to him
that there was any pressure from the Minister of Finance.

The Respondent says that the Claimants’ theory makes no temporal sense, since the ISTD
reached its preliminary conclusion on the taxability of the Transaction too quickly to be
influenced by political motivations or any media ‘uproar’ — noting that Mr Kudah expressed
his view 4 days after the public announcement of the Transaction and the 2006 Committee
reached their provisional view within a further 10 days — and the actual tax was imposed long
after the public interest has subsided.*”°

The Respondent says the Claimants have constructed their political motivation theory so
broadly that it lacks substantive credibility.° The Claimants’ theory implicates an implausibly
large number of Government organs and officials.**° The evidence supports the conclusion
that the ISTD reached its decision on the basis of its view of the merits. There is no basis for
the suggestion that officials were following the direction of Mr Kudah or political organs.***
Mr Kudah maintains that he does not recall political pressures and did not discuss the matter
with the Minister of Finance or any member of the government’ and did not act on
instructions.“

The Claimants misrepresent the report of the Prime Ministerial Committee convened in
September 2006.** The Committee made it clear that any tax would be imposed on the seller,
not UMC, and the question of taxation would be followed up ‘in accordance with the legal
procedures set out in the applicable Income Tax Law.’**°

The ISTD’s conclusion on the taxability of the Transaction was consistent and repeated over a
number of years — from the provisional view of the Director-General, Mr Kudah, on 29 June
2006, through the 2006 and 2008 Committees to the ultimate decision of the ISTD.**° The
consistency of this view should not be taken, says the Respondent, as a sign of
predetermination or submission to political pressure, but rather the consistent application of
an interpretation that was reasonable and open to ISTD — defeating any argument that the
Respondent is guilty of acting arbitrarily or otherwise in breach of the BIT.*7”

So too the Respondent says the process adopted by the ISTD is also above criticism. The proper
inference is that the ISTD learned of the intention to liquidate, and wanted to assess whether
tax was payable before that became an academic issue.**® The Respondent says that UTT was

not intentionally deprived of an opportunity to participate, because the ISTD is only obliged
to contact a taxpayer who has filed a return. It did attempt to contact UTT and a taxpayer's
opportunity to participate is guaranteed by the administrative objection procedure, not the
initial assessment procedure.**° The 2008 Assessment Committee completed the assessment
on the basis of the information available to it (UTT having failed to submit a return — which it
was obliged to do).“*° Finally, there is no basis to the complaint that the 2008 Assessment
Committee reached its decision too quickly for it to be legitimate.”

The Respondent refers to the Administrative Circular from the Ministry of Finance to the ISTD
dated 27 January 2008 concerning Article 30 of the Income Tax Law which makes no mention
of a duty to consult the taxpayer. It allows an assessment to be conducted on the basis of the
available information.”

The standard of review and the relevance of the domestic decisions
1. Introduction

The Claimants allege that the imposition of a domestic taxation measure, and its confirmation
by the domestic courts with jurisdiction to determine UTT’s challenge to it, constitute a breach
of Jordan’s international obligations.** It is common ground that the Tribunal’s role is to
determine whether the conduct attributable to the Respondent constitutes a breach of the
rules of public international law to which the Respondent is bound.“ But the Parties
advanced different frameworks for the analysis of the issues to which that allegation gives
rise. In summary:

(a) The Claimants say that the Tax Measure simply has no basis in Jordanian law and the
manner in which it was imposed gave rise to breaches of substantive guarantees in
the BIT. It says that Jordan’s liability for those breaches cannot be excused by its own
judicial organs, since the Respondent's breaches are independent of the Jordanian
courts and the characterization of these as unlawful under international law cannot
be affected by domestic decisions holding them lawful under Jordanian law.*#°

(b) The Respondent says that the Tribunal does not sit as a supplementary court of appeal
to review the decisions of the Jordanian courts. The imposition of the Tax Measure
was open to the ISTD and the Jordanian courts. So in circumstances where there is no
basis for the allegation of illegitimate political motivation, there cannot be a breach
of Jordan’s international obligations — even if its interpretation of the relevant tax may

have been actually wrong.““* In any case, it says that the Claimants face a ‘threshold
difficulty’, because UTT failed to raise before the Jordanian courts central arguments
— in particular that ISTD was wrong to conclude that Article 7.A.15.a did not apply to
the sale of shares in private shareholding companies, and arguments relating to
UMC'’s status as a private shareholding company — on which it now relies.**”

2. The Tribunal’s approach to questions of domestic law decided by domestic courts
(i) The Claimants’ submissions

The Claimants explain that the acts on which they rely as giving rise to internationally wrongful
conduct are attributable to the Respondent. “® They have not invoked the Respondent’s
international responsibility for the decisions of its courts. Rather they rely on breaches that
were not corrected by the courts.’ In particular, they refer to the decision of the CCD to
refuse to register the decision to liquidate UTT; the imposition of the Tax Measure; ISTD’s
alleged interference with the completion of the liquidation; the decisions of the courts to
uphold the Tax Measure; the confiscation of funds from UTT’s bank account in 2013; the
pressure exercised by politicians and the press; and the Jordanian Enforcement
Proceedings.*°

The Claimants then return to address the relevance of the decisions of the Jordanian judicial
system to explain why the Respondent is not entitled to rely on those decisions to excuse its
breaches.**! In this respect the order of the Claimants’ analysis is the inverse of that adopted
by the Respondent.

The Claimants submit that the characterisation of an act of a State as internationally wrongful
is governed by international law, and accordingly not affected by its characterisation as lawful
according to internal law.*** The Claimants submit that this leads to the conclusion that the
judgments of the Tax Court of Appeal and Court of Cassation finding the Tax Measure to be
valid under Jordanian law are ‘immaterial’.“°* The Claimants do not ask the Tribunal to sit as
an additional court of appeal on Jordanian law, or to find that Jordan is internationally
responsible for the breach of domestic law. Rather, the Tribunal must make findings of
domestic law in order to determine whether international responsibility is engaged.*** Thus
they distinguish ELS/ and rely on the Polish Nationals in Danzig case as establishing that
although the characterisation of an act as internationally wrongful is independent of its

characterisation under domestic law, this does not exclude the possibility of relying on the
misapplication of domestic law for the purpose of establishing an international wrong.*°°

209. Therefore, the Claimants say that international tribunals have ‘repeatedly ordered the
restitution of local taxes wrongfully imposed on foreigners.’**°

210. The Claimants submit that the proper approach in a case where an international tribunal is
confronted by a domestic court’s decision on the issues before it is established by the Chorzow
Factory case, where the Permanent Court of International Justice held that whatever the
effect of the Polish decision in municipal law, it could not displace the Court’s earlier finding
of a breach of the Geneva Convention.**” The same principle applies where the international
decision is second in time.***

211. The Claimants reject the proposition that an international tribunal ‘will accept the findings of
local courts.’*5? Azinian and like authorities are not on point because they ‘refer to domestic
decisions having previously considered the exact same issue ... [while here] the Respondent's
arbitrariness is based on elements which were not considered by the Jordanian Courts and
based on evidence and facts discovered and revealed thereafter.’ “® Azinian does not,
according to the Claimants, consider whether the characterisation of a sovereign act governed
by the Treaty as arbitrary could be affected by the findings of a domestic court since that case
concerned the existence of proprietary rights which was not an issue governed by
international law.*°*

212. The Claimants argue that the Respondent’s case is based on a non sequitur: if the
characterisation of a measure as unlawful under domestic law by a domestic tribunal is not
determinative of its characterisation as arbitrary under international law, it follows that
Jordanian decisions that the Tax Measure was lawful cannot be determinative. Those
decisions are ‘incapable of producing a presumption of lawfulness’ in circumstances where
the Tribunal is precisely requested to find that such decisions are internationally wrongful.4@
The Tribunal should apply municipal law as it would be applied in Jordan, paying ‘utmost
regard’ to the decisions of that country’s courts and, weighing that jurisprudence, selecting
the interpretation that it considers in conformity with the law.*® Taking into account the

jurisprudence of the Court of Cassation, the Tribunal should ‘conclude that the decisions from
the Amman Tax Court of Appeal and Court of Cassation concerning the Taxation Measure are
a clear departure from the well settled interpretation and application of Article 7/A/15’.“*
Rather than reflecting the law at the time, the Claimants say that these decisions should be
put aside because they are ‘not representative of the rules actually applied in Jordan’ .*°

The Claimants also rely on the fact they were not party to the Jordanian proceedings, and
UTT’s lawyers were instructed by the liquidator.*®* They accept that the first liquidator was
appointed by the Claimants but say he was not acting at their direction. The Claimants accept
that the proceedings were (and could only have been) taken by the Claimants’ underlying
investment vehicle. They nevertheless say that because they were not party to the court
decisions those decisions cannot affect the Claimants’ rights in this arbitration. In the
alternative, they are entitled to attack the decisions because they affect their rights. “9”
Moreover, the Claimants’ claims in this arbitration involve issues that were not litigated in
those proceedings, such as discrimination, predetermination, motivation, and failure to
comply with procedures and rely on new material.“

The Claimants thus conclude that Jordan is not entitled to rely on the decisions of its own
courts to contest the international wrongfulness of the Tax Measure, and the Tribunal is not
bound by those findings.*°°

(ii) The Respondent’s submissions

The Respondent argues that that the Jordanian courts reached a decision on the basis of the
material presented, and one that was open to them. The Claimants cannot now relitigate
those issues because a breach of domestic law does not per se give rise to a breach of the
state’s international obligations.‘”°

The Respondent relies on the following propositions:

(a) Investment treaty tribunals ‘are not appellate courts vis-a-vis decisions of the
domestic law by the courts of the host State’.*”? An unlawful act at domestic law does
not necessarily amount to arbitrariness under international law. There must be other
elements present sufficient to elevate it to the level of an international wrong.*”? The
Respondent does not dispute the principle reflected in Article 3 of the ILC Draft

an act under domestic law does not establish its lawfulness under international law.*”*

(b) Once local remedies have been invoked, the focus is no longer exclusively on the initial
acts but on the domestic courts’ review of that measure. Thus, the analysis adopted
by the Jordanian Courts is directly relevant to the present case. An appropriate
domestic forum was available; UTT failed to properly put its case in that forum and
the Claimants are now attempting to reargue it; and the challenge to the Tax Measure
was considered and dismissed by the Jordanian Courts.*” The Tribunal must take the
decisions of the Jordanian courts as ‘juridical facts’ unless it disavows the acts of the
judiciary itself.4”°

(c) Tribunals ‘are not bound by the underlying decisions but they will give due deference
to them.’*”° A tribunal will accept the findings of local courts unless they suffer from
deficiencies of such a nature ‘rendering these deficiencies unacceptable from the
viewpoint of international law, such as in the case of a denial of justice’,*”’ or

“pretence of form to achieve an internationally unlawful end.’*”*

(d) Investment treaty tribunals will hesitate to disturb the imposition of a tax by a State
pursuant to its own local law.*”? The investor must take the conditions of the host
State as he finds them,** and the tribunal must have ‘due deference to government
decisions’, which is particularly important in the context of taxation. The tribunal
should not ‘second-guess’ the decisions of the ISTD and the Jordanian courts.***

investment (such as breach of fair and equitable treatment) must be analysed as a
whole, * and the threshold for finding a denial of fair and equitable treatment is
high.*

3. Denial of justice
(i) The Claimants’ submissions

The Claimants argue that even if the Tribunal were to consider that the Respondent’s own
courts ‘settled the existence of a taxable event’ —i
of the Taxation Measure as a breach of the Treaty is affected by its characterization under
Jordanian law by [Jordanian] courts’ — it should nevertheless disregard those decisions
because they amount to a denial of justice.**° The Claimants say that the Jordanian courts’
decisions give rise to both a procedural and a substantive denial of justice.**°

if it concludes that ‘the characterization

 

In their Memorial, the Claimants allege that this denial of justice gave rise to both
international responsibility for breach of Jordan’s obligation to guarantee fair and equitable
treatment, and as a basis for disregarding the decisions of the Jordanian courts in relation to
the Tax Measure. In their Reply, they submit that they ‘have not invoked Jordan’s international
responsibility for the denial of justice committed by its courts’, but have argued that because
the Jordanian Courts’ decisions amount to a substantive denial of justice they cannot be
invoked by the Respondent in its defence, and should be disregarded by the Tribunal for the
purpose of determining whether Jordan breached its obligations under the BIT. “*” The
Claimants rely on the distinction between responsibility for an internationally wrongful act
and the non-opposability of a wrongful act; pursuant to the latter, a domestic rule, institution
or regime not in accordance with international law cannot be relied upon to defeat an
international claim.** In oral submissions, the Claimants confirm that their case is ‘not based
on a denial of justice’ but that Jordan cannot rely on those decisions to excuse its liability.“

The Claimants reject the Respondent’s argument that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction
to hear the denial of justice claim because it was UTT that was party to the domestic
proceedings.*” Indeed they rely on the fact that UTT was party to the tax proceedings (as
opposed to the Claimants themselves) to say that they are ‘suffering from a decision ... which
we never had the opportunity to participate in.’**

As to the applicable standard, the Claimants submit:

(a) International law recognises substantive denial of justice (misapplication of the law)
as well as procedural denial of justice (breach of due process).*” The review of the

decisions of domestic courts is a necessary corollary of the prohibition on committing
a denial of justice.“

A substantive denial of justice occurs where the state’s courts directly breach an
international obligation; there is a failure to satisfy a substantive minimum standard
of treatment; and a ‘manifestly unjust decision arising from the erroneous application
of domestic law.’*™ The analysis of a substantive denial of justice involves examining
as ‘objective facts’ the reasoning of the domestic court, and determining whether the
decision is manifestly one that no reasonable judge properly instructed could have
made.“

Denial of justice is produced by any misapplication of the law that is ‘inexcusable for
any impartial, reasonable and competent judge’.** The test is objective such that a
manifestly erroneous decision is itself evidence of a denial of justice without proof of
bad faith.“°” A merely negligent decision is not sufficient to produce a substantive
denial of justice; an ‘inexcusable mistake’ is necessary.“

On the facts, the Claimants say that the denial of justice arose from decisions that were not
based on evidence, relied on an ‘egregiously and manifestly wrong’ interpretation that no

impartial, reasonable and competent judge could have come to, and were unprecedented.*°
The Jordanian courts were faced with a straightforward question but avoided reaching the
correct answer through a sequence of manipulations and egregious mistakes.°~ They do not
criticise the Court of Cassation in general terms, but say that in this particular case the Court

was wrong, and inexcusably so.

501

In particular, the Claimants allege that the denial of justice arose in the following ways:

(a)

The Jordanian court decisions were based on the ‘egregious and inexcusable’ error of
examining UTT’s status as a limited liability company, whereas the application of the
exemption depended on the character of UMC, a shareholding company constituted
by ashom shares.°” The validation of the Tax Measure relies on an inexcusable
disregard of the ‘most basic factual elements of the case’ sufficient to meet the
threshold imposed by international law.°° International law does not require that an

the sale of ‘shares’ (ashom.... in Arabic), the fact that the seller UTT is a limited liability company composed of ‘stocks’ (houssa
in Arabic) was totally immaterial and irrelevant’.

argument must first have been raised in the domestic proceedings, because it is
sufficient to render a claim admissible that its essence was unsuccessfully taken
before the domestic tribunals. ** The decisions also depend on the
(re-)characterization of capital gains arising from the sale of shares as profit arising
from the transfer of an underlying asset.°°°

(b) The decisions breached ‘a substantive minimum international standard of treatment’
by disregarding the separate personality of UTT and UMC, and the fact that UTT did
not own UMC’s assets and could not sell them to Batelco.**° These are basic principles
respected by both Jordanian and international law.°”

(c) ISTD bore the obligation of establishing the occurrence of a taxable source of income,
and that the Jordanian courts without justification or evidence reversed that onus by
presuming that the price difference corresponded to goodwill.°” This was a wilful
neglect of duty giving rise to a substantive denial of justice.°°

(ii) The Respondent’s submissions

224. The Respondent submits that there has been no denial of justice in any case — whether as a
standalone breach or as a reason to exclude reference to the decisions of the Jordanian
courts.°"°

225. The Respondent submits that the denial of justice concept does not encompass a substantive
right arising out of a ‘manifestly unjust’ domestic judgment, but is limited to breach of due
process, and that the threshold is not met in the present case:

(a) There is no place for substantive denial of justice in modern international law, but an
egregious substantive error may be indicative of a due process error.*"" This standard
is effectively equivalent to the ELS/ standard of what constitutes arbitrary conduct.°!”

(b) Thus, the standard is high — only egregious conduct which is in bad faith, malicious,
outrageous, shocking or manifestly unjust — will qualify, with a correspondingly
onerous burden of proof.*" There is a presumption that domestic court decisions

have been fairly decided.*“* For that reason a merely incorrect application of host
State law will not give rise to a denial of justice.°">

(c) Applying this approach, the Respondent says there has been no denial of justice.
There is no basis for doubting that UTT had full access to the Respondent's judicial
system, there was no breach of due process, and it was UTT’s choice not to engage
more fully with the processes available to it.*“® To the extent that the substantive
merits of the Jordanian judgments can be investigated, those decisions were
reasonably open, and the Claimants’ criticism is misconceived.>””

The Respondent also rejects the Claimants’ submission that the alleged denial of justice
precludes the Respondent from relying on the decisions of its own courts to show that the Tax
Measure did not give rise to a breach of the BIT.** The decisions of the Jordanian courts are
part of the factual matrix by which to judge whether the approach of the ISTD was reasonably
open to it and whether the procedures involved in the administrative objection and appeal
phases were fair and equitable.*”°

The alleged treaty breaches

The Claimants allege that the Respondent’s conduct breaches a number of the substantive
guarantees in the BIT. This section summarises the parties’ submissions in relation to each of
the alleged breaches — namely:

(a) Arbitrary treatment and fair and equitable treatment (Article 3(1) and Article 4);

(b) Full protection and security (Article 3(1)) and legal stability and predictability (Article

(c) Legitimate expectations (Article 4);

equitable treatment standard (Article 4). In the Claimants’ submission, arbitrary conduct
describes actions which are an unreasonable, improperly motivated, unpredictable or unduly
unjust or oppressive use of governmental authority. Even acts which are normally entirely
lawful may be arbitrary in context.°° Arbitrariness is something contrary to the rule of law,
wilful disregard of the law and facts, or capricious or unreasonable exercise of authority.°7*
The prohibition has two purposes: to ensure that State conduct affecting investment is
‘objectively based’ and to prevent a State from making harmful decisions in wilful disregard
of the law.

Applying the canons of interpretation found in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties
(VCLT), the Claimants say that the meaning of ‘arbitrary’ cannot be equated with the few lines
from ELSI quoted by the Respondent.*”3 Adopting the language of UNCTAD, the Claimants say
that arbitrariness ‘has to do with the motivations and objectives behind the conduct
concerned’, and that a measure that ‘inflicts damage on the investor without serving any
legitimate purpose and without a rational explanation, but that instead rests on prejudice or
bias’, is arbitrary.°~ In any event the ‘ELS/ standard’ has been breached in this case, since that
standard is not confined to breaches of due process and asks whether the conduct in question
violates the rule of law.*% The Claimants emphasise that the arbitrariness standard is distinct
from the ‘specific international delict’ of denial of justice, with a different standard.*©

Asked whether the Tribunal is entitled to assess the whole course of the Respondent’s conduct
in determining the question of its international responsibility, the Claimants say that this
depends on whether the Respondent's obligation is characterised as an obligation of conduct
or result.*”” If arbitrariness is characterised as an obligation of conduct, then its breach occurs
when a specific act is not in conformity with the obligation, °° without reference to
subsequent actions.*”? The proposal by Judge Ago to include a distinction between obligations
of conduct and result in the ILC Draft Articles on State Responsibility did not survive to the
Final Draft, but it is nevertheless a useful tool.*?°

The Claimants accept that there is a distinction between accepting that a cause of action may
have come into existence at the date of the breach, and whether the Tribunal is obliged to
consider the context of what happened thereafter, including the fact that ‘remedies were
used or were attempted by the claimants.’°*4 Even considered as an obligation of result,

arbitrariness results when the Respondent’s subsequent conduct did not achieve the
necessary result, then perfecting the breach.°? The Claimants say that their approach is
consistent with ELS/, where the arbitrariness of the requisition order was reviewed on its own
as a first step, and its characterisation of arbitrariness was not affected by the determination
of the Italian courts.>%°

The Tax Measure was taken without legal basis and in wilful disregard of the law. The
Claimants submit that the Respondent breached the rule of law, a principle reflected in
international law and the Jordanian Constitution.** There was no legal basis under Jordanian
law for the taxation of profits in the present case **° and the ISTD disregarded proper
processes.**° The Jordanian authorities ‘ignored the legal structure of the 2006 Transaction’,
submitting that the decision to take the Transaction was made as early as June 2006, and that
the 2008 Tax Measure was imposed with a post hoc attempt to explain and legitimise it.°°”

The Tax Measure was not founded on reason or fact. Jordan examined the nature of the shares
in the wrong company, by focusing on the shareholding structure of UTT instead of UMC.°**
The characterisation of the Transaction as a transfer of goodwill was ‘factually impossible’.**?
No policy reason was advanced to support the tax.*“°

The Tax Measure was predetermined. The Respondent decided as soon as the transaction took
place to tax it, and the following events were an implementation of that intention.*”

The Tax Measure was politically motivated. The Tax Measure was politically motivated, was
not taken in accordance with the rule of law and is accordingly arbitrary in breach of the BIT.*“?
Taking into account the Prime Minister’s involvement, the Claimants submit that ‘external
elements were decisive.’**

The tax assessment was carried out in violation of the ISTD’s own procedures. The Claimants
also say that the ISTD failed to comply with its own procedures in imposing the tax.°*

(ii) The Respondent’s submissions

The BIT does not define arbitrariness. The Respondent relies on the definition in the ELS/ case:
something opposed to the rule of law, a ‘wilful disregard of due process of law, an act which

shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial impropriety.’*** The Claimants must establish
that an error was made by the Jordanian courts of a kind that no competent judge could
reasonably have made.*“° Predetermination amounting to a wrongful political motivation
could constitute arbitrary conduct (unless perhaps the courts got to the right answer for the
wrong reasons).°*”

The Respondent says that standard has not been met.

The Tax Measure was based on the law. As noted above, the Respondent contends that the
Tribunal must accept the decisions of the Jordanian courts unless it disavows the acts of the
judiciary itself, and must apply a presumption in favour of the legality of the ISTD’s decision.*“*
It says that the ISTD interpreted Article 7.A.15.a in a way that was open to it. Its approach was
consistent from the Director-General’s first comments in the days following the transaction.“
UTT failed to file a tax return as it was obliged to;*° it failed to cooperate with the ISTD; the
LTPD assessed tax in accordance with the law; it neglected to advance the challenges the
Claimants now rely on in the Jordanian procedures.

The ISTD acted in a consistent manner. The Respondent relies on its evidence that tax advisers
(as well as officials at the ISTD and Saba/Deloitte) at the time of the Transaction were aware
of the possibility that a transaction such as this would be taxable on the basis that part of the
income represented goodwill, and were aware that a similar issue had arisen in the Rowwad
case (arising out a transaction almost 2 years prior).**" It refers to four Court of Cassation
judgments upholding the taxation of transactions where goodwill was included in the sale of
husas shares,**? as well as the Rowwad case,**? and more recent cases*** to demonstrate the
longstanding principle that transfer of the ownership of capital effects a transfer of goodwill,
that goodwill was a taxable commercial gain, that that the sale of shares will be regarded as
having two components — an exempt capital gain and taxable goodwill.**° The history of the
relevant provisions supports the limitation of the exemption to buying and selling public
shareholding companies.°°°

The CCD acted in lawful manner. The Respondent says that the CCD did not refuse to permit
UTT’s liquidation, but sought further information in order to oversee the reduction of capital.

Instead of providing that information, UTT submitted a resolution purporting to record a
decision to liquidate the company. Notwithstanding the ISTD’s request, the CCD decided on 1
July 2008 to proceed with UTT’s liquidation. The liquidator appointed by UTT was able to
exercise his duties, but the liquidation cannot be completed until all taxes are paid.°°”

The Tax Measure had nothing to do with alleged public opposition.*** The Respondent rejects
any attribution of the acts of the duopoly, the media, or individual statements of Members of
Parliament to Jordan.**° The Respondent does not dispute that the duopoly opposed the grant
of the Licence, and that public concern greeted the Transaction given the circumstances. °°
The Prime Minister’s decision to set up a ministerial committee was reasonable and a
demonstration of good faith. But the question of whether tax was due was not a matter for
Ministers or Parliament, but for the ISTD who assessed the Transaction in the ordinary
fashion.** The Jordanian Enforcement Proceedings are nothing more than the exercise of the
state’s legitimate right to recover taxes.°

The Claimants’ conduct. The Claimants’ conduct is relevant, since either they were aware in
June 2006 that the transaction might be taxed (which would contradict the alleged lack of
foundation) or they were reckless in not taking advice.** The Respondent invites the Tribunal
to infer that advice would have been taken, and points to other factors consistent with the
Claimants having known of the risk that a tax would be imposed.°** There is no justification
for the Claimants’ failures (such as to file a tax return); the Claimants’ priority was to extract
the proceeds of the sale as soon as possible.°°

2. Full protection and security and legal stability
(i) The Claimants’ submissions

Full protection and security. The Claimants say that the Respondent breached the guarantee
of full protection and security by facilitating and capitulating to a hostile campaign against
UTT’s shareholders and ultimately capitulating to political and media pressure.* On this basis
they claim moral damages.°°”

Submitting that the standard is not concerned only with physical harm but with ‘due diligence’
more generally,* the Claimants say that the Respondent failed to protect them from a

‘concerted, lengthy and vicious campaign by Members of Parliament’ during 2006 and 2007,
in which it was the Members of Parliament themselves that suggested the imposition of a
‘goodwill tax’. It was the political pressure and harassment of those Members of Parliament
that ‘pushed the Government into imposing the Taxation Measure as a way of fending off
accusations that it was involved in the loss of public funds.’ The Respondent should have
reminded journalists and politicians of the criminal nature of defamation and the presumption
of innocence. Instead the Government facilitated the campaign by responding to questions,
allowing officials to comment to the press and apologising to Parliament.°”°

Legal stability. The Claimants also say that the Jordanian tax authorities’ departure from
previous practice amounted to a de facto amendment of Jordanian tax legislation and the
introduction of a new tax.” The Claimants rely on Article 12 of the BIT, which provides that
‘obligations under international law’ established between the Contracting Parties prevail over
those provided by the BIT to the extent they are more favourable, to import the guarantee of
legal stability in Article 2 of the Unified Agreement for the Investment of Arab Capital in the
Arab States (Unified Agreement).°” Even if Article 2 does not apply, the Claimants say that
‘the most-favourable fair and equitable treatment provided by Article 4 of the [BIT] required
Jordan to ensure a transparent and predictable framework for the investor’s business
activities’.*”? The Claimants say that the Respondent breached these obligations, because the
Tax Measure was unprecedented and could not have been predicted,>” and it amounted to a
retroactive taxation.*”°

Legal certainty does not prevent the tax administration or courts from adopting new
interpretations of legislation or amending it, but it prohibits surprising taxpayers years after a
transaction with a new interpretation that was not made public; the Claimants maintain that
the Tax Measure was unprecedented and unpredictable.*”°

(ii) The Respondent’s submissions

The Respondent alleges that this theory is a makeweight, recycling arguments made in
relation to arbitrariness.*”? The standard is the customary international minimum, which
applies where the State has failed to provide reasonable police protection against physical

invasions of the person or property of foreign investors.*”* The case does not even remotely
resemble the precedents cited by the Claimants.°”°

The Respondent says that the Claimants have cited no authority for the proposition that
failure by a State to exercise due diligence to prevent an alleged injury to an investor's credit,
reputation or prestige amounts to a breach of this provision. Where the Claimants suffered
no physical harm or threats, no relevant duty of the Respondent was engaged and it cannot
be liable for a failure to curb discussions in the media or by politi

 

As for legal stability, the Respondent notes that its legal taxation framework is complex, in
constant development and subject to judicial interpretation. A taxpayer’s subjective
interpretation cannot be deemed to constitute the law, and in any case the ISTD performed
its duties in accordance with the law.***

Article 12 is a savings clause, not a most-favoured nation provision. It does not operate to
import into the BIT any protections in another instrument, but just confirms that a claimant
may benefit from more favourable treatment to which it is otherwise entitled. And even if
it were a most-favoured nation provision, Article 2 could not be relied upon as establishing a
new obligation under the BIT.°®3

3. Legitimate expectations

The Claimants say that the Article 4(1) standard of fair and equitable treatment includes
respect for legitimate expectations, ** which is also an element of the international law
principle of good faith.°* A specific representation is not necessarily required, and in the
circumstances the Claimants were ‘reasonable’ in legitimately expecting that their capital
gains would not be taxed:** the terms of Article 7.4.15 are clear and unequivocal; the
exemption for capital gains was recalled in the ‘REACH Initiative’ of March 2000 (which the
Claimants characterise as a ‘formal Government document’ **’); the King explicitly gave
guarantees of legal stability to the Claimants (among others); the capital gains exemption had
been introduced to encourage investment; and the Respondent has identified no precedents

in the ISTD’s practice or the Court of Cassation’s jurisprudence to support the taxation of
goodwill in this manner.°%°

The Respondent says that Article 4(1) of the Treaty reflects the customary international
minimum standard of treatment, and State practice and opinio juris are insufficient to
establish the protection of legitimate expectations as a rule of international law. Decisions to
the contrary have been driven in particular by a reference to legal stability in the preamble of
the treaty that is absent here.*® It is particularly important in the context of taxation that a
claimant is able to establish a specific assurance, °°
its legitimate expectations when making the investment.**"

and the claimant must show it relied on

The Respondent says that the Claimants have not identified a specific legal commitment, and
any expectation the Claimants and UTT had at the time could not have been legitimate and
reasonable.*” In the absence of definitions of ‘capital gains’ and ‘goodwill’, Article 7.4.15.a
could not amount to a clear, unambiguous and specific commitment to a shareholder that a
share sale would under no circumstances be taxed.*”* The Claimants should have been aware
of Court of Cassation and ISTD precedents imposing tax on goodwill arising from share sales, ***
and the REACH Initiative merely recounted the content of the law at the time.°

4. Discrimination

The Claimants say that the BIT prohibits discriminatory treatment. *°° A discriminatory
measure is one that singles out a person or group without a reasonable basis, is not limited to
discrimination on the basis of nationality, and can include taxation measures.*”” Applying the
principle that discrimination may result from either intent or result, the Claimants say that
‘the new tax policy concerning capital gains implemented by Jordan ... has been applied
selectively’. The exclusion of the capital gains exemption from the sale of private shareholding
companies — even if it were valid as a matter of Jordanian law — was not reasonable or sensible
and resulted in discriminatory treatment.>* The discriminatory treatment arose from both
the different treatment of non-public shareholding companies, and companies specifically in
the telecommunications sector.**? They say that the proper comparator should be companies
generally, not specifically non-public or public shareholding companies.°°

The Respondent notes that the Parties agree that discrimination occurs where there are like
circumstances, a difference of treatment and absence of a reasonable ground for that
differential treatment.©

It rejects the suggestion that the ISTD targeted the telecommunications sector or that the
Court of Cassation acted in a discriminatory fashion by drawing a distinction between those
companies that trade on the stock exchange and those which do not. The precedents before
the cases of Rowwad and UTT did not involve the telecommunications sector; the 1995
Amending Tax Law clearly distinguished between companies listed on the stock exchange and
those which are not permitted to do so. The appropriate comparison would be with a similar
sale of shares of a non-public shareholding company. The evidence shows that other private
companies have been treated in a similar manner to UTT and that the ISTD has not targeted
only telecommunications companies.*” There is no question of discrimination against foreign
investors. Mr Alghanim declined to suggest that the Claimants had been targeted because of
their nationality.°

5. Impairment of the rights to liquidate

The Claimants say that Article 4 of the Treaty promises most-favoured nation treatment, and
in reliance on this guarantee, the Claimants invoke Article 3 of the Jordan—Algeria BIT and
Article 3(2) of the Jordan—Austria BIT, which prohibit the impairment of the liquidation of
investments. °* They say that Jordan has breached this obligation by ‘specifically and
intentionally preventing the shareholders of UTT ... from liquidating that company, on the
premise of its arbitrarily and discriminatorily imposed Taxation Measure’.®° The Claimants
also maintain that the Respondent acted in an arbitrary manner when it blocked the
liquidation, arguing that the imposition of the Taxation Measure was dictated by the decision
to liquidate or an ‘incredible coincidence’.®° The Claimants say that the ISTD and CCD’s
conduct was characterised by ‘complicity’.°”

The Respondent notes that the Claimants only mention this argument in their Reply in passing
and says that the evidence establishing the absence of any breach of the protections against
arbitrariness and discrimination also defeats this claim.°%

Relief and quantum
1. Non-pecuniary remedies and injunction
(i) The Claimants’ submissions

The Claimants submit that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to grant non-pecuniary remedies;
those remedies flow from the application of substantive international law rules on State
responsibility and are not a matter of the specific judicial powers of the Tribunal.°°° As long as
the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the case, it has the power to grant appropriate remedies.
Absent a specific limitation in the BIT, ICSID tribunals may grant the non-pecuniary remedies
provided by international law including annulment or rescission of domestic juridical acts and
cessation.©°

The Tax Measure is still in force and the Jordanian Enforcement Proceedings are ongoing —
giving rise to a ‘lasting or continuous breach.’*4 They thus ask the Tribunal to (i) order the
Respondent to refrain from prosecuting the Claimants for the non-payment of the tax; and (ii)
desist from enforcing the Tax Measures against the Claimants.

(ii) The Respondent’s submissions

The Respondent says that the relief sought by the Claimants must be refused, because they
have not suffered any damage as a consequence of the ISTD’s decision to impose the Tax
Measure.*? The Claimants are not entitled to compensation for injury they have not suffered.
The only remedy that would be available is a decision ordering Jordan to refrain from
enforcing the tax against the Claimants, but the Jordanian Enforcement Proceedings are
ongoing and it is possible that the defences to those proceedings will succeed, in which case
the present claim would be moot.**

The Respondent contends that the Tribunal’s power is limited to the claims brought by the
two Claimants in these proceedings, and has no power to order relief in respect of UTT or
other third parties.

2. Annulment of the Tax Measure or indemnity from the Respondent
(i) The Claimants’ submissions

The Claimants maintain that they are entitled to the annulment of the Tax Measure as
restitution.©° Restitution requires the State to re-establish the situation which existed before

the wrongful act. It is only by annulling the Tax Measure that the Claimants will be guaranteed
to be protected against the consequences of the Respondent’s wrongful act. °° The
Respondent cannot raise its domestic law as an obstacle to this relief.’ If the Tribunal
concludes that annulment of the Tax Measure is not appropriate because of the presence of
third parties who are not entitled to the protection of the Treaty, the Claimants are entitled
to an indemnity.°®

The Claimants say that the fact they were not party to the original proceedings is irrelevant.*?
It is precisely because annulment would affect Jordan’s right to pursue the tax against third
parties that it is an adequate remedy, °° and Jordan cannot rely on difficulties under its
domestic law to avoid the granting of relief.

(ii) The Respondent’s submissions

The Respondent says that the Tribunal should reject the Claimants’ request for annulment of
the Tax Measure because it was imposed against UTT, a third party, and the Tribunal does not
have jurisdiction over third parties (including Global, Mr Dagher, and UTT).*” It says that this
head of relief gives rise to a ‘legal and practical impossibility’, since the Tribunal does not have
jurisdiction to overturn a decision directed to a separate legal entity. It would affect Jordan’s
rights to pursue any legal action against third parties; and the Government does not have
authority to order the judicial branch to annul or prevent the enforcement of a judgment.

3. Moral damages

The Claimants submit that they are entitled to moral damages.©*

The Respondent says that the Claimant relies almost exclusively on International Court of
Justice cases involving personal injuries. It says the Tribunal only has jurisdiction in respect of
damage to property rights associated with an investment, and in any case ICISD tribunals have
‘regularly rejected claims for moral damages’ which will only be granted in the most egregious

of cases.©°

MERITS: THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS
Issues for determination

The present case is remarkable for the elaborate attention paid by both Parties to the proper
interpretation of the detailed provisions of Jordanian tax law. This is despite the fact that, as
both Parties accept, the present Tribunal is not constituted to determine a dispute as to
Jordanian tax law at all. Rather its sole task is to decide whether or not the Respondent is in
breach of the obligations that it assumed as a matter of public international law towards the
Claimants as Kuwaiti investors under the provisions of the BIT. It is therefore essential to begin
the Tribunal’s own analysis by placing the dispute on Jordanian tax law within the proper
context in which it arises on the plane of public international law before this Tribunal.

The Claimants allege that the Tax Measure was an ‘arbitrary or discriminatory measure[]’ and
that the Respondent breached Article 3(1) of the BIT, impairing the Claimants’ investment by
the imposition of such a measure. Such a measure also constituted unfair and inequitable
treatment in breach of the Respondent’s guarantee in Article 4(1). The essence of their
complaint is that the imposition of the Measure was predetermined as a result of political
pressure following a public and Parliamentary outcry at the perceived excessive profits
realised by the Claimants.

The Claimants’ investment vehicle UTT challenged the original imposition of the Measure
before the Jordanian courts. They ultimately failed in the domestic jurisdiction, the Court of
Cassation upholding the judgment of the Tax Court of Appeal that the tax on the sale proceeds
had been lawfully imposed. The Claimants say that the fate of their challenge in the Jordanian
courts is irrelevant to their present complaint, and that, to the extent that the Respondent
seeks to rely on those judgments, it is not entitled to do so because the Claimants were the
victims of a denial of justice before those courts. On any view, it is essential to clarify the status
and relevance of those decisions to the substantive issues that arise for decision in the present
proceedings.

The Tribunal determines that it must address the arguments of the Parties and assess the
evidence under three sub-issues:

(a) Effect of the Jordanian court decisions. What is the effect, if any, of the fact that UTT
challenged the Tax Measure in the Jordanian courts and of the judgments of those
courts on the legality of the Measure as a matter of Jordanian law for the question of
international law that this Tribunal must decide?

(b) Predetermination/political pressure. Subject to (a) above, was the imposition of the
Tax Measure by the ISTD in fact predetermined as a result of political pressure?

(c) Denial of justice. To the extent that the Tribunal determines under (a) above that the
judgments of the Jordanian courts are potentially relevant to its enquiry, should it
nevertheless disregard them because, as the Claimants contend, those decisions were

280.

inexcusable—decisions that no reasonably competent judge could make—and as a
result were a denial of justice?

Before proceeding to address each of these three sub-issues, the Tribunal first identifies a
number of matters that are agreed between the Parties or at least not in dispute between
them.

Matters agreed or not in dispute

The Tribunal’s task is assisted by a measure of agreement between the Parties on a number
of salient legal issues and by the fact that a number of other points are not in dispute between
them.

These matters relate to:

(a) The content of the arbitrary treatment standard under international law;
(b) The scope of the review standard for a substantive denial of justice; and
(c) The relevance of the allegation of political motivation.

Arbitrary treatment standard: The Parties achieved a measure of agreement on the content
of the arbitrary treatment standard prescribed by Art 3(1) BIT. The starting point is that
authoritatively stated by a Chamber of the ICJ in ELS/ namely:*°

Arbitrariness is not so much something opposed to a rule of law, as something opposed
to the rule of law.... It is a wilful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or
least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety.

The Respondent invokes this formulation of the standard as sufficient in itself.°?”

The Claimants submit that ELS/ does not set out an exhaustive definition of the concept of
arbitrariness in international law, but that in any event Respondent’s conduct breaches the
ELSI standard;®* since ‘arbitrariness ... is the opposition to the rule of law, wilful disregard of
law, capriciousness ... as explained in the ELSI case.’®° They add that conduct may also be
arbitrary if it is biased, not based on facts and politically motivated. In the Tribunal’s view
these are further potential indicia of a decision that is in opposition to the rule of law and are
therefore consistent with the ELS/ formulation.°°°

Review standard for substantive denial of justice. The Respondent accepts that, if the Tribunal
finds that it may or must assess the treatment of Claimants’ investment by the Jordanian
courts, it is not bound by the doctrine of res judicata to give effect to the decisions of those

courts:®*? ‘It is certainly correct that, if a denial of justice could be established, the Respondent
would not be able to rely upon the decisions of its courts.’

Further, the Parties agree that the Tribunal is entitled to find a denial of justice, even where
there was no failure in due process, if the substantive decision was one that is inexcusable,
being one that no reasonably competent judge could make.**

Three further consequences flow from the position that the Parties have adopted on the
review standard:

(a) The Claimants do not invite the Tribunal to act as a further court of appeal on the
correctness, as a matter of Jordanian law, of the imposition of the Tax Measure. The
Claimants stated that ‘[i]t is not our case, it is absolutely not our case.’®3*

(b) Conversely, the Respondent does not invite the Tribunal to give res judicata effect to

saying ... this is strictly a res judicata, and asking you to apply res judicata’ .©°

(c) Both Parties accept that a denial of justice may arise as a result of a decision of the
judicial branch in an individual case that is inexcusable. In view of this agreement, the
Tribunal is not required to decide itself two potentially disputed issues of international

law:

(i) Whether it is necessary to show some larger systemic failure in the judicial
system of the state;°*° or

(ii) Whether a denial of justice may be found on the ground of the substantive

content of the decision.

Relation to political motivation claim. The Respondent accepts that, if the ISTD’s decision to
impose the Tax Measure were predetermined as a result of a wrongful political motivation,
its actions might be capable of giving rise to a claim of arbitrary conduct, **” unless it could be
said that the Measure was nevertheless lawfully imposed. It will therefore be necessary to
decide on political motivation in any event.

Relevance of the Jordanian Court Decisions
1. Introduction

The Claimants’ principal complaint in these proceedings is that the imposition of the Tax
Measure (that UTT is liable for tax on the sale of its shares in UMC) is a breach of Jordan’s
international law obligations under the BIT, specifically the obligation not to ‘impair by
arbitrary or discriminatory measures’ (BIT, Article 3(1)) their investments.

The Claimants also allege that the same conduct gives rise to breaches of a number of other
provisions of the BIT: that it amounts to a failure to afford fair and equitable treatment
(including that it breached the Claimants’ legitimate expectations); that the Respondent failed
to afford the Claimants’ investment full protection and security; and that its conduct was
discriminatory. It also relies (through alleged incorporation by reference) on alleged duties to
provide legal stability and not to impair rights to liquidate.

Nevertheless, the allegation that the Tax Measure was arbitrary or discriminatory lies at the
heart of the Claimants’ case. In the Tribunal’s view, the claim is most appropriately analysed
under this head. It most directly addresses the substantive complaints that the Claimants
make about their treatment at the hands of the Respondent. Protection from arbitrary or
discriminatory conduct also forms part of the fair and equitable treatment standard.°** For
reasons explained below, it is scarcely to be thought that a different standard could apply to
the assessment of the arbitrary or discriminatory character of the state’s treatment under this
head than under Article 3(1).

The Tribunal therefore begins by analysing the relation between this standard and the
decisions of the Jordanian courts.

A principal ground upon which the Claimants base their allegation of arbitrary conduct is that
the imposition of the Tax Measure was unlawful as a matter of Jordanian law: ‘At the heart of
this case is the meaning of a key provision of Jordanian legislation and its (mis)application’.°*°
UTT challenged the Tax Measure in the Jordanian courts. On 25 April 2012, the Court of
Cassation upheld the imposition of the Tax Measure, dismissing UTT’s appeal.°*°

The Respondent alleges that the Claimants’ case ‘stands or falls on whether ... the decisions

of the Jordanian [T]ax Court of Appeal and the Court of Cassation are arbitrary.’©*

By contrast, the Claimants assert that ‘[t]he arbitrariness claim raised by the claimants hinges
on the ISTD’s taxation measure of UTT that Jordan is demanding the claimants to pay, not on
the Jordanian court’s [sic] decisions’.©?

The issue for the Tribunal’s decision on this part of the case may be stated as the following
question of law:

Is the Tribunal to assess whether the Respondent’s treatment of Claimants’ investment was
arbitrary for the purpose of Article 3(1) of the BIT by reference to:

(a) The Tax Measure alone (making for this purpose its own assessment of ISTD’s
application of Jordanian law); or

(b) The conduct of the State as a whole vis-a-vis the Claimants’ investment, taking into
account for that purpose the Jordanian court decisions on the Tax Measure,
considering whether the latter were themselves arbitrary, being a denial of justice?

In Azinian v Mexico, the Tribunal stated the following principle (the Azinian principle):

A governmental authority surely cannot be faulted for acting in a manner validated by its
courts unless the courts themselves are disavowed at the international level... What must
be shown is that the court decision itself constitutes a violation of the treaty.... For if there
is no complaint against a determination by a competent court that a contract governed
by Mexican law was invalid under Mexican law, there is by definition no contract to be
expropriated.

The Parties had raised this case in their written submissions, but had not fully joined issue
on the application of the above principle. The Tribunal specifically invited them to address the
relevance, if any, of the principle in their closing submissions.*>

The Respondent invoked the Azinian principle, pleading: ‘That dictum applies in this case’.©*°

The Claimants invited the Tribunal to reject Respondent’s reliance on the Azinian principle in
this case on a number of grounds.”

2. Claimants’ Objections
The Claimants raise two sets of arguments:**

(a) Positively they argue that the Tribunal should limit its consideration to the Tax
Measure alone, because the arbitrariness treaty standard imposes an obligation of

(b)

conduct, breach of which is complete upon the imposition of the Measure, not an
obligation of result; and

Negatively they dispute the application of the Azinian principle on four grounds:

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

That it is inapplicable ratione personae, the Jordanian proceedings having
been taken by UTT not Claimants;

That it is inapplicable ratione materiae, the Claimants’ claims in the
arbitration not being coincident with the issues decided in the Jordanian court
decision;

That the arbitrariness standard as stated in ELS/ does not support the
principle; and

That Azinian failed to take into consideration the principles invoked by
Claimants, including (in addition to (a) above): that municipal judicial
decisions are mere facts in international law; and that the characterisation of
an act as legal under national law does not affect its characterisation as illegal
under international law: Article 3 of the ILC Draft Articles on the
Responsibilities of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA).

3. Character of arbitrary measures obligation

298. The Claimants submit that the obligation not to impair by arbitrary measures is one of conduct

not result. They maintain that the Respondent has ignored the independent character of

the Claimants’ claims; equated arbitrariness with denial of justice; misapplied the arbitrariness

obligation, relying instead on authorities relevant to the fair and equitable treatment

standard; and sought to treat the whole course of events as a complex act to be construed as

if arbitrariness were an obligation of result.

299. The Respondent replies that the distinction that the Claimants seek to draw is not based in
customary international law and does not assist the Tribunal in interpreting an arbitrariness

provision. It maintains that the Tribunal is never going to be limited to what happened on 30
April 2008, unless nothing happened after that date.%°

300. The Respondent concludes:®?

In such a situation, where the precise issue decided by domestic courts is being placed
before an international tribunal (after the issue has been voluntarily placed before the
domestic courts by the investment vehicle), the intuitively correct approach is to accord
deference to the domestic court’s decision (absent any denial of justice). If it were
otherwise, the international tribunal would simply be operating as a final court of appeal.

In addition to Azinian, the Respondent cites in support:°*
(a) Bosca v Lithuania in which the Tribunal held, citing HeInan v Egypt, that:°**

when a tribunal is considering an issue of domestic law previously ruled upon by a
domestic court, the tribunal ‘will accept the findings of local courts as long as no
deficiencies, in procedure or substance, are shown in regard to the local proceedings
which are of a nature of rendering these deficiencies unacceptable from the viewpoint of
international law, such as in the case of a denial of justice.’

Awdi v Romania,*™* which repeated with approval the same dictum from Helnan; an\
b di ©54 Which d with Ith di fi ht id
(c) Mondev v USA,§*° which held:

It is one thing to deal with unremedied acts of the local constabulary and another to
second-guess the reasoned decisions of the highest courts of a State. Under NAFTA,
parties have the option to seek local remedies. If they do so and lose on the merits, itis
not the function of NAFTA tribunals to act as courts of appeal.

The Claimants base the distinction between obligations of conduct and obligations of result
on draft Articles 20 and 21 that were prepared by Ago for the first reading of ARSIWA.*° The
Claimants accepted in answer to a question from the Tribunal,®*” that these draft articles
were, on the proposal of Crawford, rejected on second reading and not adopted into the final
text of ARSIWA. As a result, the Claimants did not satisfy the Tribunal that the distinction,
which they invoke as interpreted by them, forms part of customary international law,
providing a rule of decision in the present case.

The distinction was not retained in ARSIWA, such a classification being ‘no substitute for the
interpretation and application of the norms themselves, taking into account their context and
their object and purpose’.**

Even if the distinction were to be applied to the arbitrary treatment standard in Article 3(1) of
the BIT, it would in any event likely be construed as an obligation of result not conduct since:

(a) The obligation arises in the context of the treatment of persons within the internal
legal order, not direct State-to-State relations;

(b) The obligation is not one of best efforts: it is a non-contingent guarantee; and

(c) The obligation does not prescribe the means to be adopted, only the outcome (that
the investment should not be subjected to arbitrary measures).°°

The Tribunal’s overriding duty is to interpret and apply the primary obligation in question,
namely Article 3(1) of the BIT, which provides:

Protection of investments

Investments, made by investors of either Contracting State, enjoy full protection and
security in the territory of the other Contracting State, in compliance with the recognized
principles of international law and with the provisions of this Agreement. Neither
Contracting State shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures such
investments or associated activities including the use and enjoyment of the management,
development, maintenance and expansion of these investments or related activities.

The Respondent accepts that, there being no obligation under the BIT or the ICSID Convention
to resort to local remedies, if there had been no application to the local courts, the Tribunal
would have been entitled to evaluate whether the Tax Measure alone constitutes an arbitrary
measure. ©?

To this extent, then, Article 3(1) may potentially be invoked in relation to a single measure if
it rises to the level of an international delict. This is not the present case. Here the measure
has been subject to challenge in the local courts. The question is the extent to which the
decisions of those courts are to be taken into account in the Tribunal’s overall assessment of
arbitrary conduct.

A Chamber of the ICJ held in ELS/: ‘Arbitrariness is not so much something opposed to a rule
of law, as something opposed to the rule of law.... It is a wilful disregard of due process of law,
an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety’.

The protection from arbitrary measures requires the Tribunal to assess whether the
investment has been subject to ‘a wilful disregard of due process of law’, not whether the act
is ‘opposed to a rule of law’. This necessarily entails consideration of the whole process of law
to which the investment was subjected.

The Claimants contend that the conduct of the courts is not relevant in a case where the
lawfulness of the conduct is confirmed by judicial process, but accept that it is relevant to
consider the availability of local fora to remedy a breach of the arbitrariness standard.°

It is difficult to see a basis for the distinction. Either the decisions of the local courts are
relevant and to be taken into account whatever the outcome or they are not. In the present
case, the real question is whether the decisions of the local courts are to be disavowed.

The standard requires consideration of the extent of ‘due process’ afforded to the investment.
This necessarily entails the judicial part of the process, since otherwise the Tribunal would be
unable to assess whether or not the Respondent’s conduct was ‘opposed to the rule of law’
and would not be assessing the treatment to which the investment was subject as a whole.

The requirement to view the state’s actions in relation to the investment, taken as a whole
would seem to be as applicable to impairment by arbitrary measures as to fair and equitable
treatment.®°?

The Tribunal accepts that each such cause of action is distinct and that fair and equitable
treatment involves consideration of a broader range of other factors that may not be in issue
in an arbitrary measures claim. Nevertheless, arbitrariness is a recognised factor in fair and
equitable treatment.®™ Both causes of action are concerned with a lack of due process.***

Both causes of action protect the treatment accorded to the investment in relation to
measures adopted by the host state. In this they may be contrasted with a claim for
expropriation, which crystallises at the moment the investor’s property is taken.°°

In summary, the alleged distinction between obligations of conduct and obligations of result:

(a) Does not operate as a general basis for classification of all obligations in international
law;
(b) If it were applied, would more likely lead to the protection from arbitrary measures

being categorised as an obligation of result; and,

(c) Does not in any event exclude from consideration the outcome of the investment
vehicle’s resort to the local courts.

Application of the primary obligation upon the State not to impair the investment by arbitrary
measures requires a tribunal to consider the totality of the state’s conduct vis-a-vis its
treatment of the investment, including the decisions of its courts.

This conclusion does not in itself determine what effect a tribunal is to give to such local court
decisions if they uphold the validity of the State measure under municipal law. It is this effect
that is the subject of the first element of the principle stated in Azinian: that a governmental
authority cannot be faulted for acting in a manner validated by its courts, unless the conduct
of the courts themselves constitutes a breach of treaty.

It is now necessary to consider the grounds relied upon by the Claimants to exclude the
application of this principle.

4. Applicability of the Azinian principle

 

320. Claimants identify four substantive grounds to exclude the application of the Azinian principle
in this case (summarised at [(b)] above).

321. Two of the grounds seek to distinguish Azinian on the facts in light of:

(a) The scope of national court proceedings ratione personae; and
(b) Their scope ratione materiae.
322. The other two grounds critique Azinian for its inconsistency as a matter of general
international law as to:
(a) The ELSI concept of arbitrariness; and
(b) The status of municipal law in international law.
It is necessary to take each of these points in turn.
(i) Scope of national court proceedings ratione personae

323. The Claimants submit that the Azinian principle cannot apply to their claim, since they were
not party to the Jordanian court proceedings, which were brought by the investment vehicle,
UTT, acting through its liquidator. The decisions, being res inter alios acta, cannot bind
them.°°”

324. This submission raises (a) a question of fact as to the capacity of the liquidator; and (b) a
question of law as to the relevance of decisions taken in respect of the claim of the investment
vehicle as opposed to the investor.

325.  Onthe facts, the liquidation being voluntary, the liquidator was appointed by the shareholders
and directors of UTT to act on UTT’s behalf.°**

326. The Claimants accept that the only person that could have contested the Tax Measure before
the Jordanian courts under Jordanian law is the taxpayer — here UTT.®®° The Claimants submit
that they are entitled to bring their own treaty claim. For that purpose, they are entitled to
allege a denial of justice perpetrated on the underlying company through which their
investment was made.”

327. The Respondent had argued in its written pleadings that, since only UTT and not the Claimants
were party to the Jordanian court proceedings, the Claimants could not themselves have
suffered a denial of justice.°’”*

328. The Claimants dispute this proposition and contend that they are entitled to bring a claim of
a denial of justice perpetrated on their investment vehicle. They point out that the tribunal in
Arif v Moldova had had no authority cited to it for its proposition that the investor could not
assert a denial of justice claim where it had not itself been a party to the local court
proceedings.*”*

329. The Claimants submit that the proposition in Arif is incorrect. They invoke Cotesworth and
Powell v Colombia®’? in which the tribunal decided a claim by two individual British investors
that the partnership that they had formed with two other investors in Colombia had been the
subject of a denial of justice. The tribunal held:°”*

The administration of justice, guaranteed to all persons living in a civilized country, interests all.
It especially interests all parties who are either mediately or remotely affected by it. To illustrate:
If the sentence of a judge, given in a suit of A versus B, be illegal and manifestly injust, and in its
consequence directly affecting the interests of C, the latter may ask a revision of the proceeding;
and this although he may not have had previous occasion or necessity to take part in the suit. In
the present case, the claimants were not bound to take part in the proceeding which led to the
decision. Therefore if irregularities had taken place in the bankruptcy proceeding, before the date
mentioned, they directly affected the interests of the claimants; and for this reason they had a
right to demand that justice be administered according to the laws of the country.

330. The award in Cotesworth is widely cited as authoritative on denial of justice.*”* Its reasoning
that the perpetration of an injustice on their investment (in that case through a joint venture)
‘directly affected the interests of the claimants’ is equally applicable here to the investment
made by the Claimants through a company in which they were shareholders with other
investors.

331. In the present case, the Claimant investors adopt as the basis of their claim the harm done to
their investment vehicle. The Claimants cannot approbate and reprobate by relying on such
harm as the basis for their claim without taking into account the steps taken by the investment
vehicle to redress the allegedly unlawful assessment, which forms part of the overall
treatment of the investment.

Although in Helnan, Bosca and Awdi the claimant was itself a party to the local proceedings,
in Azinian the US claimants sued in international arbitration for harm allegedly done to their
Mexican investment company — the plaintiff in the local Mexican proceedings.°”>

In ELSI, a Chamber of the ICJ declared admissible a claim of arbitrary conduct brought by the
United States on behalf of the American investors in relation to conduct affecting their Italian
investment company, though the local proceedings had been brought by the trustee in
bankruptcy for the local subsidiary and not by the investors themselves.°” It follows that it is
not determinative that the liquidator appointed by the Claimants (or his successor) did not act
on the Claimants’ instructions or represent them directly in the Jordanian proceedings.

If the Claimants are entitled to bring an international claim for a denial of justice perpetrated
on their investment vehicle:

(a) They are not bound by a national court decision if it constitutes a denial of justice
under international law, including where that decision is inexcusable because no
reasonably competent judge could have rendered it; but

(b) It does not follow that such a decision is irrelevant where the national court
proceedings meet the international law standard, not constituting a denial of justice.

The Tribunal therefore concludes that this first ground of objection is not well founded and
must be rejected.

(ii) Scope of national court proceedings ratione materiae

The Claimants also object to the application of the Azinian principle to the present case on the
ground that the Jordanian court proceedings did not have the same scope ratione materiae,
observing that the claim in the Jordanian courts dealt only with the question whether the Tax
Measure was legally imposed under Jordanian law and not with the Claimants’ other
complaints about the process by which the Measure was imposed, and further evidence has
since come to light.°”*

The Claimants’ observation is correct. How far does it serve to distinguish the Azinian
principle? The Respondent accepts that the Tribunal is entitled to evaluate in any event the
Claimants’ case on predetermination and political influence. The Azinian principle in this case
only goes to the question whether the Tax Measure was arbitrary on the ground that it was
not lawfully imposed as a matter of Jordanian law and that the Respondent failed to afford
redress for its unlawful conduct.®”? Nevertheless, the Claimants accept that this is the most
important issue in the case. This ground of objection does not address the central question of

the relevance of the Jordanian court proceedings in so far as they do rule on the legality of
the Tax Measure.

(iii) The ELS/ concept of arbitrariness

Without prejudice to their submission that the concept of arbitrariness is broader than that
articulated in ELS/, the Claimants submit that, as a matter of international law, the Azinian
principle is inconsistent with the test of arbitrary conduct applied by a Chamber of the ICJ in
that case.®° The Claimants construe ELS/ as establishing that each State measure is to be
assessed separately for its consistency with the protection from arbitrariness, so that the
subsequent decisions of the local courts will not be dispositive as to the character of the
original measure. The Claimants parse for this purpose the reasoning of the Chamber.®* The
Tribunal must therefore carefully consider the manner in which the Chamber approached the
question before it.

The original measure in that case (the Order issued by the Mayor of Palermo for the
requisition of the claimant's factory) had been the subject of criticism by the Prefect and Court
of Appeal of Palermo. The United States relied on those criticisms as evidence of arbitrary
conduct.® The Chamber held that it was appropriate for it to consider the grounds advanced
in those subsequent decisions in order to assess whether they were equivalent to a finding of
arbitrary action.

It was in that context that the Chamber observed that:°

the fact that an act of a public authority may have been unlawful in municipal law does not
necessarily mean that that act was unlawful in international law, as a breach of treaty or
otherwise. A finding of the local courts that an act was unlawful may well be relevant to an
argument that it was also arbitrary; but by itself, and without more, unlawfulness cannot be said
to amount to arbitrariness. It would be absurd if measures later quashed by higher authority or
a superior court could, for that reason, be said to have been arbitrary in the sense of international
law. To identify arbitrariness with mere unlawfulness would be to deprive it of any useful meaning
in its own right. Nor does it follow from a finding by a municipal court that an act was unjustified,
or unreasonable, or arbitrary, that that act is necessarily to be classed as arbitrary in international
law, though the qualification given to the impugned act by a municipal authority may be a
valuable indication,

In this passage, the Chamber is addressing the reverse position to that which pertained in
Azinian and in the present case. It is dealing with the effect of local court judgments critical of
the original measure as unlawful according to municipal law, not judgments upholding the
lawfulness of the measure under municipal law.

In any event, the passage does not support the proposition that the Claimants advance. The
Chamber finds that, where a measure is subsequently quashed by a local court, it would be
absurd if it could ‘for that reason, be said to have been arbitrary in the sense of international
law’. The necessary implication is that, while the subsequent quashing of a measure might not

ipso facto remove its arbitrary character, nevertheless the measure must be assessed in the
light of its subsequent fate on the municipal plane. The Chamber had already proceeded on
the basis that it would consider the reasoning of the local courts in its assessment for
international law purposes (even though such decisions were not binding upon it).°*

In the present Tribunal’s view, if local decisions are relevant where the underlying measure is
quashed, they will also be relevant where they have upheld the measure.

(iv) Status of municipal law in international law

Finally, the Claimants submit that the Azinian principle is inconsistent with the general rules
that it invokes on the status of municipal law in international law: (a) the rule that municipal
law is to be treated as fact not law in the international sphere; and (b) the rule that ‘[t]he
characterization of an act of a State as internationally wrongful is governed by international
law. Such characterization is not affected by the characterization of the same act as lawful by
internal law’.©° The Claimants argue that Azinian and the other tribunals that approved its
approach did not consider and apply these principles and that the Azinian principle is, as a
result, not well founded in international law.°°

The general proposition that international law treats municipal law as fact is a corollary of the
second principle invoked by the Claimants. It is for international law to determine for itself
and in accordance with its own rules the legality of the acts of States. If it were bound as a
matter of law by the internal law of the State whose responsibility is invoked, the international
tribunal would not fulfil its mandate to judge the conduct of that State by applying
international law to the matters before it.

Does this principle assist with the resolution of the problem in the present case?

In the first place, it is not disputed that the Tribunal is to apply an international law standard
(being that set forth in Article 3(1) of the BIT, as interpreted in accordance with general
international law) to determine whether the Respondent subjected the Claimants’ investment
to arbitrary conduct. To this question, the decisions of municipal courts cannot be binding
upon the Tribunal. Nor is this question answered by reference to internal Jordanian law.

In the second place, the law applicable to the Tribunal is not simply international law.
Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that:

The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed
by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the
Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such
rules of international law as may be applicable.

The Claimants accept in answer to a question from the Tribunal that this requires the Tribunal
to characterise the issues before it and to decide which issues are governed by international
law and which by national law.°*”

They point out correctly that, in the passage cited from the Azinian award, the tribunal was
concerned with the effect of a local court decision on a question that could only be decided
according to national law: the validity of the termination of a contract.** This is not an issue
that can be determined by international law. A determination by a local court (that is not
subject to criticism on grounds of denial of justice) that a contract has been validly terminated
may be issue-dispositive, because if there is no contract, the claimant will have no continuing
property interest that can form the basis for an international claim of expropriation. That is
what the Azinian tribunal holds in the second element of the principle as cited above (‘For if
there is no complaint against a determination by a competent court that a contract governed
by Mexican law was invalid under Mexican law, there is by definition no contract to be
expropriated’.).©°

The Claimants distinguish the present case on the basis that taxation is a sovereign prerogative
and international law can — indeed must — be applied directly to such measures. °°

The Tribunal accepts that there is indeed a difference between the context of the question as
it arose in Azinian and the present case. In Azinian, there was certainly an incidental question
that had to be decided according to municipal law, namely whether or not the contract had
been validly terminated.

Does this distinction exclude the application of the Azinian principle in the present context?
The decisions in Awdi and Bosca do not indicate any such limitation. In Bosca, for example,
the tribunal, while finding that it was not bound by decisions of the Lithuanian courts in
making its own assessment of whether the fair and equitable treatment standard had been
breached, nevertheless endorsed the proposition that it should give due deference to such
decisions unless there was evidence of a denial of justice, which there was not.

In the present case, the Tribunal is called upon to decide the international law question of
whether the Respondent’s conduct breached the treaty standard of protection of investments
from arbitrary measures. It is not called upon to determine per se the legality vel non of the
Tax Measure under Jordanian law. Nevertheless, the Claimants invite the Tribunal, as part of
its assessment of whether the Tax Measure was arbitrary, to consider whether it had a legal
basis under Jordanian law. Both Parties advance very detailed evidence, including many other
decisions of the Jordanian courts, on that question. The Claimants’ case is not that Jordan had
no right to tax the transaction. Rather it is that, properly construed, Jordanian law did not tax
the transaction and that the ISTD and the courts misapplied that law. This allegation
necessarily requires the Tribunal to assess Jordanian law.

The fact/law distinction invoked by the Claimants as their first principle under this head does
not assist the Tribunal to determine the relevance of the Jordanian decisions relating to the
instant case to its task. Nor does it provide a sufficient ground upon which those decisions are
to be excluded in its assessment of arbitrary conduct.

If the totality of the state’s conduct is to be taken into account (as concluded at [317] above),
the Tribunal is still obliged to determine the effect of the Jordanian court decisions on whether
the underlying Tax Measure was arbitrary. On this question, the first element in the Azinian
formulation (‘A governmental authority surely cannot be faulted for acting in a manner
validated by its courts .... What must be shown is that the court decision itself constitutes a
violation of the treaty’) is still applicable.

In the third place, however the Tribunal treats Jordanian law, it is bound to seek to construe
it faithfully in the manner that it would be applied by the higher Jordanian courts. It may not
simply disregard the doctrine of the municipal courts and arrive at its own interpretation. The
Permanent Court of International Justice so held in Brazilian Loans,®* a decision relied upon
by the Claimants on this part of their argument. The Court said:

Once the Court has arrived at the conclusion that it is necessary to apply the municipal
law of a particular country, there seems no doubt that it must seek to apply it as it would
be applied in that country. It would not be applying the municipal law of a country if it
were to apply it ina manner different from that in which that law would be applied in the
country in which it is in force.

It follows that the Court must pay the utmost regard to the decisions of the municipal
courts of a country, for it is with the aid of their jurisprudence that it will be enabled to
decide what are the rules which, in actual fact, are applied in the country the law of which
is recognized as applicable in a given case. If the Court were obliged to disregard the
decisions of municipal courts, the result would be that it might in certain circumstances
apply rules other than those actually applied; this would seem to be contrary to the whole
theory on which the application of municipal law is based.

Of course, the Court will endeavour to make a just appreciation of the jurisprudence of
municipal courts. It this is uncertain or divided, it will rest with the Court to select the
interpretation which it considers most in conformity with the law. But to compel the Court
to disregard that jurisprudence would not be in conformity with its function when
applying municipal law.

Brazilian Loans states a rule about how an international tribunal is to approach a question of
domestic law when such a question arises in the course of its decision. The requirement is to
take the domestic jurisprudence into account.

If this were, as the Claimants submit, the applicable rule, the Tribunal would be bound to ‘pay
the utmost regard’ to the decision of the Court of Cassation at issue in the present case. The
Respondent does not contend that the Tribunal is obliged to give res judicata effect to the
local court decisions in this case. It submits that Brazilian Loans requires the Tribunal to
approach those decisions with due deference.® In this way, it will make ‘a just appreciation
of the jurisprudence of municipal courts’.

366.

In the fourth place, however,®** these cases are not concerned with, and do not establish the
dispositive principle in relation to, the effect of municipal court decisions rendered in the
context of the very dispute at issue.

Where the local court decision is rendered in the instant case, the international tribunal,
applying the standards of international law, is obliged to disregard the decision if it comes to
the view that it must do so because the claimant has been subject to a denial of justice or that
the decision must otherwise be disavowed in application of the applicable international law
standards. Further, for the reasons already explained, the decision will not necessarily be
finally dispositive of the international law issue.

Equally this essential qualification upon the applicability of the local court decision does not
justify the Tribunal in departing from the local court decision where it finds that there has
been no denial of justice. Otherwise it would set itself up as a further court of appeal on
questions of national law.

Contrary to the Claimants’ submission, this conclusion is consistent with ARSIWA Article 3. It
is precisely because the Tribunal is applying an international law standard to judge the
conduct of the Respondent that it will determine whether the Claimants have been the subject
of a denial of justice in the Respondent's courts. At the same time, a misapplication of national
law by those courts that does not amount to a denial of justice will not breach the
international standard.

5. Conclusion

For these reasons (and subject to the qualifications already noted), the Azinian principle is
well founded and applicable to the present case.

The Tribunal therefore concludes that, in assessing whether the Respondent’s treatment of
Claimants’ investment was arbitrary for the purpose of Article 3(1) of the BIT, it will consider
the whole course of Respondent’s conduct, taking into account not only the Tax Measure but
also the decisions of the Jordanian courts, assessing whether the latter constituted a denial of
justice.

This finding has the following five consequences:

(a) The Tribunal will not set itself up as a court of further appeal to determine the
correctness of the decision of either the ISTD or the Jordanian courts as a matter of
Jordanian law.

(b) Rather, it will consider whether the judgment of the Court of Cassation was
inexcusable (being one that no reasonably competent court could arrive at) in order
to decide whether the Claimants have suffered a denial of justice and thus been
subjected to arbitrary treatment.

370.

(c) The Tribunal will refer to Jordanian law for the purpose of making this assessment,
but not for the purpose of substituting its decision for that of the Court of Cassation.

(d) Unless the Tribunal finds that the judgments of the Jordanian courts gave rise to a
denial of justice, the consequence will be that the ISTD cannot be faulted for having
acted on a construction of the law validated by the courts.

(e) The Tribunal will take its assessment on this issue into account, together with its
assessment of the evidence as to whether the Tax Measure was politically motivated
and predetermined, in arriving at its overall decision as to whether the Respondent
has breached Article 3(1) of the BIT.

Was the ISTD’s imposition of the Tax Measure predetermined/politically motivated?

The second major issue that arises for the Tribunal’s decision is whether the ISTD’s imposition
of the Tax Measure upon UTT was predetermined and politically motivated as a result of
political pressure, such that it was taken for an improper purpose other than to apply the law
properly.

This issue must be addressed as a question of fact upon the Tribunal’s appreciation of all
relevant aspects of the evidence adduced before it. In this context, the Tribunal is in the
fortunate position that it has not only a voluminous documentary file, containing both publicly
available documentation and internal Jordanian Government documents, but also the oral
evidence of many of the key witnesses.

Of particular relevance to this part of the case, the Tribunal had the benefit of hearing oral
evidence at the hearing from the following witnesses produced by the Claimants:

(a) Mr Fouad Alghanim, the Chairman and majority shareholder in the First Claimant and
the Second Claimant in his own right. He gave evidence as to the reaction in Jordan to
the sale of UMC’s investment in UTT to Batelco and the levying of the Tax Measure;*™*
and

(b) Mr Michael Dagher, a director of and shareholder in UTT. He too gave evidence as to
the same matters.°>

Further, the Tribunal heard evidence from the following officials from the Jordanian Tax
Department as follows:

Committee formed to review the taxability of the sale;** and

(d) Mr Aktham Batarseh, the assessor in the LTPD, who was a member of the 2008
Assessment Committee that decided that tax was payable on the sale.°

Each of these witnesses was cross-examined by counsel for the opposing party and also
answered questions from the Tribunal.

The Tribunal has already set forth in Part Ill sections D and E above a detailed narrative of the
events surrounding the sale of UMC and the subsequent imposition of the Tax Measure. Its
purpose now is to appraise that evidence in its significance to the question whether the Tax
Measure was imposed for an improper political purpose.

The Claimants put their case on the evidence in two ways:

(a) Events following the sale in 2006. First, they invite the Tribunal to conclude that the
Respondent had already taken the decision to tax UTT’s sale proceeds in 2006 at the
time when the sale was announced and that it had done so as a result of media and
Parliamentary pressure on the Government in view of a public perception of an
illegitimate profit on the sale.

(b) Events leading to the imposition of the Tax Measure in 2008. Second, the Claimants
maintain that the actions of the ISTD leading to the actual imposition of the Tax
Measure in 2008 demonstrate that, so far from making a proper determination
according to law, the Department was merely following through on the Government's
determination to impose a politically motivated tax on UTT rather than making a
proper assessment according to law.

1. Events following the sale in 2006

Immediate ISTD reaction to taxability of sale. There is no doubt that, almost immediately
following the completion of the UTT’s sale of its shares in UMC to Batelco on 24 June 2006,’”
the Jordanian press voiced criticisms of the deal. The newspaper editorials questioned
whether the Government had granted UTT its licence too cheaply in light of the sale price.
They went on to suggest that the Government ought at least to condition its approval of the
sale on the payment of the requisite tax on the sale.’°*

The Press sought explanations from Government Ministers and from responsible officials,
including from the Director-General of the ISTD, Mr Kudah.’° He is quoted as ‘an informed
source’ in the following terms:’°3

From his side, an informed source at the Income and Sales Tax Department has said that in
principle the deal is subject to income and sales taxes, stressing that his Department has not
received any documents in relation with the sale process yet. He added that the deal would be
handled in accordance with the law, i.e., it will be subjected to tax after studying its tax and
accounting file. He regarded it unlikely that the deal be exempted from income and sales taxes.

The Claimants allege that this passage demonstrates that, in response to the press criticism,
Mr Kudah acted ina ‘highly irregular’” manner and had predetermined that it would be taxed
irrespective of the legal position and despite the fact that any assessment for tax purposes
would not be due until at the earliest the following year.”

There is certainly evidence that the press disclosures placed the Government under pressure.
Mr Dagher informed Mr Alghanim, when he sent him a copy of the press report on 30 June
2006, ‘Lots of pressure from the government and | have been told by the Minister of trade
and industries that we may have to pay an additional 3/1000 for stamp duties’. This sum
was levied by the Ministry of Finance on 3 July 2006 and paid by Mr Dagher under protest.”°”

The issue for the Tribunal is what effect, if any, that media and political pressure had on the
ISTD. Mr Kudah was pressed at length under cross-examination about his statement to the
press reported on 30 June 2006. He maintained his evidence that he had not discussed the
matter with the Minister of Finance.’ His evidence that the ISTD was not put under pressure
from the Minister of Finance or anyone else in Government”” was not challenged under cross-
examination. He insisted that the answer that he had given did not prejudge the Department’s
actual assessment of the tax due on the sale, but rather indicated his view only ‘in principle’
prior to examination of the file.”"°

A majority of the Tribunal found Mr Kudah to be a reliable witness and sees no reason to
doubt his testimony on this issue, which is consistent with a fair reading of his reported words
at the time. His initial reaction does not suggest pre-determination. Rather, Mr Kudah insisted
at the time that a decision as to taxability would only be taken ‘in accordance with the law’
and ‘after studying [UTT’s] tax and accounting file’.

Mr Kudah certainly went on to say that ‘[h]e regarded it unlikely that the deal be exempted
from income and sales taxes’. The Tribunal certainly has reservations about the basis on which

Mr Kudah felt able to make this statement even expressed in the qualified manner that it is.
He readily accepted at the Hearing that he is not and never has been a tax assessor and is not
qualified to express a view on the detailed provisions of the Tax Law including the exemption
in question.’ There had been no tax assessment of UTT and one was not due until 2007 at
the earliest. Nevertheless, the question whether this statement itself suggests that a decision
would be made otherwise than in accordance with the law depends upon whether there was
a credible legal basis for the imposition of the Taxation Measure, an issue to which the
Tribunal will return when it considers that question in the context of the decisions of the
Jordanian courts in section E below.

2006 ISTD internal committee report. In response to the initial press reports, Mr Kudah formed
an internal technical committee within the ISTD to investigate further the taxability of the
transaction and to report to him.’ This Committee included Mr Almusned, who gave
evidence before the Tribunal. The Committee reported on 5 July 2006. It concluded:’!3

From reading the provisions of the Income Tax Law we find that Article (3) stated a general
rule of subjecting the income earned within the Kingdom for any person or gained from
it. And it asserted on subjecting profits or gains of any source unless it was expressly
excluded or exempt by the Tax Law or any other Law.

Therefore, and in principle, the profits of the deal between the two parties are subject to
tax, as there was a profit made for the parties who sold their shares and they received an
income in the Kingdom, where it is fact in this deal that there was a big difference
between the sale price and the net investment value in the sold shares which includes
taxable income from the goodwill (shuhra) or the re-evaluating of the right to use the
Operating Licence or ...... Where as the value of the shares in the capital is about (29)
Million Dinars and the value of all the Company's Assets is about (62) Million Dinars while
the sale value was about (300) Million Dinars. Deciding what this deal was precisely and
stating the legal description requires the review of all the documents relating to the
subject including the Sale Contract between the parties.

In his written statement, Mr Almusned denies that the 2006 Committee ‘reached the view
that profits from the transaction between the parties were subject to tax because we were
following a “smear campaign” against UTT’ or that it was influenced by the media coverage.
He deposes: ‘The committee only discussed the issue referred to it from a legal and accounting
perspective’.’* Mr Almusned was taken to this paragraph in cross-examination and confirmed
it.”° His evidence on this point was not challenged.

A majority of the Tribunal concludes that this internal report does not support a finding of
political pressure or pre-determination. On the contrary, it approaches the matter ‘in
principle’ and on the basis of the law. At the same time, it adds the proviso that an actual
assessment will require ‘review of all the documents’. The Report refers to a distinction
between the sale price and what it refers to as ‘the net investment value in the sold shares

which includes taxable income from the goodwill (shuhra)’ as well as ‘the value of shares in
the capital...and the value of all the Company’s Assets’.

As will be seen, this distinction between goodwill and capital was treated as material to the
subsequent determinations of both the ISTD and the Jordanian Courts as to the tax treatment
of the transaction. It is not necessary at this stage in the analysis for the Tribunal to reach a

 

view as to the tenability of the distinction drawn in the memorandum. It is sufficient to
observe that the memorandum is consistent with an assessment, necessarily provisional at
that stage given that no tax assessment was then due or could be made, as to the legal basis
upon which any such assessment would have to be made.

Parliamentary questions to the Government. In the meantime, Parliament was seeking further
explanations from the Government as to the grant of the UMC licence and the subsequent
sale, including its taxability.”° This led to a number of official enquiries.

In September 2006, the Prime Minister formed a Committee comprising a number of persons
including Mr Kudah to address four questions that had been raised by the Parliamentary
Financial and Economics Committee.’!” The second of those questions was, in relevant part:
‘Why was there no imposition of income tax on the (goodwill of the company)’.”1®

Mr Kudah accepted, in answer to a question from a member of the Tribunal, that, although it
was normal for the Prime Minister to establish a committee of the relevant specialist organs
of the State to respond to a question from Parliament, he could not recall another occasion
on which such a committee had been formed to consider the affairs of another taxpayer.’!°

The Committee reported to the Prime Minister on 15 January 2007.’*° On the relevant portion
of the second question that had been raised, the Committee concluded:”*

Article 3 of the Income Tax Law No. 57 of 1985, as amended, provides as follows:

a. Income accrued or earned in the Kingdom from the following sources by any person
shall be subject to tax:

7. Key money and goodwill

As regards collecting income tax on goodwill, this claim should be against the sellers who
acquire income from goodwill, i.e. the sellers who sold their shares in the Company and
generated income in the Kingdom as a result of goodwill. The claim should not be against
the Company because the Company has not realized any income from the sale of the
shares by the former owners to the current owners. The Income and Sales Department
will follow up the collection of the tax dues on the sellers of their shares in Umniah

Company at the end of the year in which the sale was carried out in accordance with the
legal procedures set out in the applicable Income Tax Law.

The District Attorney’s 2007 investigation. In March 2007, on further application by members
of Parliament to the Speaker of the House, Parliament requested that the Public Prosecutor
investigate the grant of the licence to UMC. On 30 October 2007, the District Attorney issued
his Report following investigation, which report was approved by the Attorney General.’ The
District Attorney concluded that the licence had been awarded to UMC in accordance with
the law and in pursuance of Government policy; that the Government had addressed all
Parliamentary questions in a detailed and unambiguous manner and that there was nothing
to denote a suspicion of the occurrence of a felony or misdemeanour that warranted
prosecution.

Mr Alghanim maintained in his witness statement that ‘Following the sale of UMC to Batelco,
there has been continued hostility against UTT by the Respondent’. ”* Under cross-
examination, he accepted the following propositions that were put to him by counsel
following a review of the press and Parliamentary objections and the District Attorney’s
report:’4

Q. In fact, what is really happening is that certain concerns have been expressed about
the issue of the licence to UMC, and we see that in certain of the press reports, and the
Jordanian Government then acts to verify that there were no irregularities in the issue of
that licence, and it concluded that there was no irregularity.

A. Correct.
Q. And that treatment is entirely what you would expect, isn’t it?
A. Correct.

A majority of the Tribunal concludes from its review of this material that it does not serve to
establish that the Government had pressured the ISTD to tax the transaction regardless of the
law. Rather, in responding to questions from Parliament, the Government had acted to be
able to assure itself and Parliament that the original grant of the licence had been in
accordance with the law and as to the proper basis on which any tax consequences were to
be determined. The Tribunal accepts that it was unusual, even unprecedented, that a Prime
Ministerial Committee should be asked to consider the taxability of a specific transaction as
part of its remit. It finds however that this follows from the nature of the questions that the
Press and Parliamentarians were asking. It is understandable that a Prime Minister should
then seek to inform himself as to the tax position in relation to the transaction.

The Committee’s view on the legality of the grant of the licence was then also confirmed by
the District Attorney in an independent investigation requested directly by Parliament.

In the view of a majority of the Tribunal,’° these steps are all consistent with a State
conducting itself according to basic principles of constitutional government and the Rule of
Law.

The specific passage in the Committee Report dealing with tax addresses a specific question
as to the collection of tax on goodwill raised by Parliament. It confirms that tax is payable on
goodwill by the sellers and that the ISTD will follow up once that tax becomes due ‘in
accordance with the legal procedures set out in the applicable Income Tax Law.’

In the Tribunal’s opinion, this passage is consistent with a decision to apply the law, not a
decision to proceed to collect a tax irrespective of the provisions of the law.

Accordingly, a majority of the Tribunal does not find in the events of 2006-2007 that the
Respondent acted in an arbitrary manner vis-a-vis the Claimants’ investment by deciding to
impose a tax on the sale irrespective of the provisions of the law in response to press or
political pressure.

Arbitrator Fortier has come to a different conclusion on the significance of the political events.
He explains his view of the matter in his Separate Opinion. In view of the fact, however, that
he agrees with the Tribunal’s analysis of the position at international law vis-a-vis the decisions
of the Jordanian courts, he joins in the Tribunal’s dispositif.

It is now necessary to consider the process by which the ISTD in fact imposed the Tax Measure
in 2008.

2. Events leading to the imposition of the Tax Measure in 2008

UTT’s tax returns. Pursuant to Article 26(a) of the 1985 Tax Law, at least if UTT had a source
of taxable income, it would have been required to submit a tax return in respect of the year
to 31 December 2006 by 30 April 2007. It is common ground that UTT did not file any tax
returns from the time of its establishment. The Claimants say that this is because it was a
holding company that did not produce income; the Respondent contends that all companies
must file an annual return whether or not they are income producing or a mere holding
company.”** It is not necessary for the Tribunal to resolve this point. The simple fact is that
UTT did not file a return setting forth its statement of its tax position.

UTT’s annual company returns. Moreover, UTT was not up-to-date with the filing of its Annual
Returns, including financial statements, with the CCD. It did not file any set of financial returns
until filing its 2005 Financial Statements (dated 29 October 2007) on 27 January 2008.’”’ The
CCD responded on the same date by requesting statements for the period 2003-2007.’ This
exchange initiated internal memoranda within the CCD and further correspondence with UTT.

Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) of 22 June 2006 that had authorised the sale of its
interest in UMC to Batelco and the related reduction of share capital and payments to
shareholders.’

Three days later, on 8 March 2008, UTT held another EGM at which the shareholders decided
to place the Company into voluntary liquidation.”°

On 19 March 2008, UTT filed its Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2006
(the year of the sale), together with the auditor’s report thereon dated 3 November 2007.72

In its internal report of 31 March 2008, the CCD noted the sale and the opinion of the
management and the auditors that no tax was payable on the sale.’* The CCD concluded that
the proposed reduction in capital as a result of the shareholders’ withdrawals did not appear
to be justified by the company’s balance sheet.’*? On 14 April 2008, the CCD directed UTT to
file financial statements for 2007 so that the Department could ascertain the up-to-date
position and consider UTT’s request for a decrease in the Company’s capital.”*

The 2008 tax assessment. It is against this background that Mr Mawazreh, Director of the LTPD
at ISTD, decided on 15 April 2008 to form a committee of three assessors (the 2008
Assessment Committee), including Mr Batarseh, to assess and audit UTT and UMC for income
and sales tax for all unassessed years until the end of 2006.7°

Mr Mawazreh was unable to recall or explain precisely why it was that the matter of UTT’s tax
assessment for the period to 31 December 2006 came to his attention, resulting in the
appointment of the assessment committee in April 2008, rather than in 2007, when (in the
view of the Department) UTT failed to file a tax return as it ought to have done. In oral
evidence in answer to the President’s question, he accepted that ‘[iJ]n reality, | don’t know
why this didn’t happen after 30 April or 30 May or 30 June 2007’.”°

The Tribunal finds that the most likely explanation for the ISTD’s formation of an assessment
committee on 15 April 2008 was the shareholders’ decision to place UTT into voluntary
liquidation and its belated filings with the CCD that disclosed the proposed capital reduction.
If tax were due on the disposal, the ISTD would have to assess it and issue an assessment
notice before the company was wound up and the opportunity to claim the tax was lost. This
is consistent with the ISTD’s letter of 21 April 2008 (signed by Mr Mawazreh on Mr Kudah’s
behalf) to CCD informing the Companies Controller that UTT had not filed its tax returns and

requesting him not to approve the liquidation until the CCD had obtained the ISTD’s
clearance.”*”

The 2008 Assessment Committee’s working paper, the Form for Auditing Annual Tax Returns
and Assessment Decisions, for UTT was completed between 24 and 28 April 2008.”**

The Committee minuted its Decision on 30 April 2008.7*° It found, in relevant part:

On 26/6/2006, [UTT] sold its entire ashom shares as amounted to 18717600 ashom share
which represents the cost of investment in [UMC] and which is equivalent to 66% of its
capital to [Batelco] for an amount of 207,382,500 Jordanian Dinars.

There is no clear address for the company in order to audit its accounts. The balance
sheets of the Company were obtained from the Ministry of Industry and Trade/Company
Control.

Given the above, the Commission sees that the amount realized from the share sale
profits which is the share of the company above in [UMC] represents goodwill resulting
from the husas shares sale transaction in [UMC] where there isa large difference between
the sale price and the investment cost and this difference represents goodwill.

The Committee then assessed UTT’s taxable income on the basis of the net income declared
in the accounts (after some adjustments not material for present purposes) at JD 188,682,338,
resulting in income tax at 25% of JD 47,170,584 + an additional tax penalty as a result of not
submitting a tax return of 22% of that sum, namely JD 10,377,528. On the same date, it issued
a notification to UTT (the Tax Measure) estimating UTT’s income and the tax due thereon.’*°

As further grounds upon which the Claimants base their claim that this Tax Measure was
arbitrary, they allege that it was reached in undue haste and that UTT was effectively
prevented from being heard, as the ISTD made inadequate attempts to contact UTT’s
representatives. ”“*

The Tribunal has set forth in some detail at paragraphs [77] to [82] above the evidence that
was given about this by both Parties. Mr Batarseh, a member of the Assessment Committee,
gave evidence before the Tribunal about the Committee’s working procedures. He was cross-
examined at length about this, and in particular about the time taken to make the assessment
and the Committee’s efforts to contact UTT. The Tribunal found him to be a careful witness
that gave consistent evidence about the manner in which the Committee worked.

The Tribunal has concluded that the ISTD cannot be said to have acted in an arbitrary manner
in the way in which it carried out the tax assessment. The facts are that UTT had not filed any

tax returns. Its position’?

was that it was not liable to tax on the sale proceeds and that, since
it had not generated any taxable income it was not required to file a tax return. The result was
that, if the ISTD took a different view, it would have to proceed on the basis of information
that it collected. This was a step provided for by Article 30 of the 1985 Tax Law which

provides:

In the instances where the taxpayer has not submitted the Return as provided in Article
(26) & (27) of this law at the dates specified therein, the assessor shall conduct the
assessment on that Taxpayer in the light of the information available to him and he shall
notify him a notice of the Tax due on him.

The Claimants complain that the ISTD did not utilise all of the external information that might
have been available to it.”* The Tribunal finds that the ISTD acted reasonably in the
circumstances in obtaining from the CCD UTT’s financial information, including its 2006
Accounts that the Company had just filed one month previously.

The Tribunal would make two observations as a matter of common sense about these
complaints: the first as to the significance of the voluntary liquidation and the second as to
the nature of the assessment.

On 8 March 2008, UTT had decided to place itself into voluntary liquidation, notice of which
was filed on 20 April 2008. As Mr Batarseh fairly observed in his statement, this fact ‘required
the committee to proceed ... without delay’ .”*°

The Claimants complain that insufficient effort was made to contact the Company’s
representatives. They do not contest the facts that ISTD did contact the representative who
had been registered on the CCD file (Ms Sabra), who declined to assist, and Mr Zaarour, the
voluntary liquidator, who was out of the country and said that he would attend to the matter
on his return. Once the shareholders had decided one month previously on 8 March 2008 to
place UTT into voluntary liquidation, it was surely incumbent upon UTT to ensure that the
liquidator was available to represent the Company in its dealings with the Jordanian
regulatory authorities. In the absence of a tax return filed by the taxpayer, the assessor is
empowered by Article 30 of the 1985 Tax Law to conduct his assessment ‘in light of the
information available to him’.”° It is only at that point that the assessor is obliged to notify
the taxpayer by notice (as to which the provisions of Article 25 as to service of notices apply).

74 Claimants refer to the section of the ISTD internal memorandum (Ex C-227) dealing with administrative assessments in
the case of a failure to provide a tax return. This memorandum sets out a number of pieces of information that an assessor
may take into consideration in reaching his assessment. The Tribunal does not regard these steps as mandatory or as
qualifying the general words of Article 30. Accordingly, a failure to follow any one or more of the steps there set out is not
of itself arbitrary conduct.

Following due service, the taxpayer is entitled under Article 31(c) to object to the
assessment.”*”

The second point is that the assessment that ISTD had to conduct was not complex. UTT had
not produced any income in the years prior to 2006. In 2006, it reported one very significant
item, namely the proceeds of the sale of its shares in UMC to Batelco. No doubt there was
(and is) a diametric opposition of views between UTT and ISTD about the taxability of those
proceeds. This does not in itself call into question the procedure that the ISTD adopted up to
the notice of assessment, provided that there was a proper opportunity for the taxpayer to
contest the assessment according to the law.

It is not disputed that Jordanian law provided for such an opportunity, first by administrative
objection and then by appeal to the Tax Court of Appeal and ultimately to the Court of
Cassation. As detailed in paragraph 83 above, UTT pursued these avenues of appeal. The
Tribunal will consider the question whether in international law terms, they amounted to a
denial of justice in the next section.

At this stage in its analysis, the critical question for the Tribunal is whether the evidence
demonstrates that the Assessment Committee was motivated by considerations other than a
proper application of Jordanian tax law in arriving at and imposing the Tax Measure.

Mr Batarseh deposed in his statement:”*

I confirm that neither | nor my two colleagues on the assessment committee imposed the
tax for any reason other than the law required to do so. That was our job. We are tax
assessment professionals, and my colleagues and | take our duties very seriously. We
certainly did not take any political considerations into account when conducting our
assessment.

He confirmed this statement orally before the Tribunal.”° His evidence on this point was not
challenged.

The Tribunal finds that the Tax Measure itself was not an arbitrary measure in the sense of
being imposed for reasons other than a proper application of the law.

This does not, however, conclude the analysis. The question whether the Tax Measure was
properly imposed under Jordanian law was contested by UTT in the Jordanian courts, but
ultimately upheld by the Court of Cassation. As the Tribunal has already found, the Measure
might still be found to be arbitrary as a matter of international law if and to the extent that
the decision of the Court of Cassation was inexcusable, being one that no reasonably
competent judge could make.

The claim of discrimination. Before approaching this issue, the Tribunal must conclude this
section by dealing briefly with the question whether the Tax Measure was discriminatory for
the purpose of Article 3 of the BIT. The Claimants’ claim in this respect was that the tax

treatment accorded to the sale of shares in private shareholding companies — even if it were
valid as a matter of Jordanian law — was discriminatory because it drew an unjustified
distinction between such companies and the sale of shares in other companies, which were
not subject to tax; they also maintain that companies in the telecommunications sector
specifically were the subject of discrimination.’°°

The Claimants do not in this case allege that they were targeted because of their Kuwaiti
nationality. A member of the Tribunal specifically asked Mr Alghanim about this and he replied
“| don’t want to accuse anybody of this’.”°2

The substantive protection from discrimination in investment treaties fulfils an important
function in proscribing, as the Waste Management |I tribunal observed, conduct that is
‘discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice’. This element in
the standard does not, however, require an international tribunal to undertake a substantive
review generally of distinctions drawn in domestic law between different categories of
persons, which distinctions are not drawn on such prejudicial grounds. A common feature of
tax laws is to draw precise distinctions between different forms of corporate organisation and
transactions in terms of their taxability. This does not in itself constitute discrimination.
Accordingly, this element of the Claimants’ claim must also be rejected.

Was the decision of the Jordanian Court of Cassation inexcusable?

The Tribunal turns finally to consider the decisions of the Jordanian courts — in particular that
of the Court of Cassation as the final court of appeal — in light of the treaty standards.

The Tribunal’s approach. \t recalls its earlier analysis in section C above, which led it to apply
the Azinian principle that ‘[a] governmental authority surely cannot be faulted for acting in a
manner validated by its courts unless the courts themselves are disavowed at the
international level’.”**

It summarised the consequences relevant to this part of the enquiry as:7>*

(a) The Tribunal will not set itself up as a court of further appeal to determine the
correctness of the decision of either the ISTD or the Jordanian courts as a matter of
Jordanian law.

(b) Rather, it will consider whether the judgment of the Court of Cassation was
inexcusable (being one that no reasonably competent court could arrive at) in order
to decide whether the Claimants have suffered a denial of justice and thus been
subjected to arbitrary treatment.

(c) The Tribunal will refer to Jordanian law for the purpose of making this assessment,
but not for the purpose of substituting its decision for that of the Court of Cassation.

(d) Unless the Tribunal finds that the judgments of the Jordanian courts were a denial of
justice, the consequence will be that the ISTD cannot be faulted for having acted on a
construction of the law validated by the courts.

It is important to keep these parameters in mind. Both Parties accepted that the Tribunal is
not a court of further appeal on matters of Jordanian law. Yet the Tribunal was invited to
consider detailed expert evidence and supporting authorities adduced by both Parties about
Jordanian law and tax practice (and indeed also about international tax practice).

The experts who filed opinions and were examined at the hearing were:
(a) For the Claimants:
(i) Dr Ahmad Masa’deh of the Jordanian Bar'”*>
(ii) Mr Mohammed Al-Akhras, a Jordanian tax expert;’°° and
(iii) Ms Pam Jackson, an international tax expert.’°”
(b) For the Respondent:
(i) Mr Nabil Rabah of the Jordanian Bar;’**
(ii) Mr Rafiq Dweik, a Jordanian tax expert;”*° and
(iii) Ms Kate Alexander, an international tax expert.”

The Tribunal will examine this evidence for the purpose, and to the extent, that it helps to
illuminate the question for it, which — to repeat — is not the correctness vel non of the decision
of the Jordanian courts as a matter of Jordanian law, still less the reasonableness of the
distinctions actually drawn in the substantive provisions of Jordanian law. Rather the Tribunal
is tasked with answering the very different question of whether the decisions were ones that
no reasonably competent court applying Jordanian law could have come to.

In this regard, it is no disrespect to the very considerable specialist expertise provided to the
Tribunal to observe that the nature of the Tribunal’s task means that it is principally interested

in the legal provisions themselves and their application in the instant case by the Jordanian
courts against the background of prior Jordanian legal authority.

The 1985 Tax Law. At the heart of this question lie two provisions of the 1985 Tax Law’*!— a
taxing provision and an exemption:

(a) The taxing provision is Article 3.A, which provides in relevant part that:

Income accrued or earned in the Kingdom from the following sources by any person shall
be subject to tax—:

7. Consideration for vacancy, key-money, and goodwill.

12. Profits or gains from any other source...which have not been granted an exemption
under this law or any other law.

(b) The exemption that is in issue is Article 7.A.15.a, which provides in relevant part that:

It shall be totally exempt from tax:

15.a. Capital gains, profits accrued from the buying and selling of lands, real estate, shares
and bonds shalll be considered part of these capital profits except for gains resulting from
sale or transfer of ownership of assets included in the rules of depreciation stipulated in
this law, provided that the losses arising from the sale or transfer of ownership of such
assets included by the rules of depreciation are deducted if they are realized. For the
purposes of this law, this loss shall be determined to be equal either to the depreciation
deducted for the purposes of this law or the incurred loss whichever is less.

UTT’s essential ground of challenge to the Tax Measure before the Jordanian courts was that
its profit on the sale of its shares in UMC was an exempt capital gain as ‘profits accrued from
the ... selling of ... shares’ within the meaning of Article 7.4.15.a. It was not taxable ‘[p]rofits
or gains’ earned in the Kingdom from ‘goodwill’.

The Tribunal has summarised the steps taken by UTT to challenge the Tax Measure in Part III
Section F above. Each of its appeals was rejected, concluding with the judgment of the Court
of Cassation on 25 April 2012.7

In view of the fact that the Claimants’ objection before this Tribunal is as to the substance of
the decision arrived at, the Tribunal will focus its consideration on the reasoning adopted by
the Court of Cassation, the final court of appeal within the Jordanian legal system.

761 Ex C-6 (emphasis added).
782 Ex C-128.

112

438. Court of Cassation judgment. After reciting the procedure, UTT’s grounds of appeal and the
facts of the case, the Court of Cassation continued:’

The realized income was considered as commercial profits realized in return of goodwill,
and the profits realized from the goodwill income is what a company may obtain moral
value in a given market resulting from a number of elements leading to the increase in
the company value in the market, such as good reputation with clients or the quality of
services and the concession;

The income realized from goodwill is assessed by deducting the sale consideration from
investment cost, and itis difficult to separate goodwill from the company upon its sale or
transfer or merger;

the jurisprudence of the Court of Cassation is e(s}tablished that goodwill is considered
commercial profit accumulated during the life of the enterprise{75]

Looking back at the submitted evidence, it appears from that the Claimant did not submit
any proof evidencing that these profits are not consideration for goodwill;

It also appears to us that the Claimant is a limited liability company and that its
contribution to the capital in this company is husas shares that are not tradable on the
stock exchange...

439. The Court proceeded to cite the pertinent provisions of the Companies Law before

concluding:”®

 

Therefore, the sale of the husas shares of the limited liability company is a commercial
act.

Whereas Article 7 of the Income Tax Law provides specifies the following:

 

a- It shall be totally exempt from tax

1.5/1 Capital profits, profits accrued from the buying and selling of lands, real estate,
shares and bonds shall be considered part of these capital profits.

It is understood from this text that what is intended by the exempted ashom shares are
the ashom shares of shareholding companies and the ashom shares issued by the
government which are tradable and which sale or trading in is not deemed a commercial
act, while the profits realized from the sale of the partners husas shares in a limited
liability company is not excluded from income tax because the sale relates to husas shares
which are sold by virtue of the method specified in accordance with Article 73 of the
Companies Law and the profits realized by the Appellant are profits in consideration of
goodwill arising from the sale of husas shares in a company providing services throughout
the Kingdom and which obtained the concession right to invest in the field of
telecommunication.

440. The central reasoning of the Court is that the exemption in Article 7.A.15.a for profits accrued
from the selling of shares applies only to profits made from selling publicly traded shares on
the Stock Exchange. Where, by contrast, the sale is of shares that may not be publicly traded

113

and the sale price includes an element of goodwill, that portion will be taxable under Article
3.A.7.

441, Was this an inexcusable decision that no reasonable court applying Jordanian law could come
to?

442. The question of interpretation. As a general proposition (not specific to Jordanian law) the
value of a share in a company may well include not only the material assets of the company
but also an element in respect of goodwill, that is to say: a valuation of the portion of the
internally-generated value of the share in the company represented by the reasonably-to-be-
expected future economic benefits arising from the company’s business as opposed to assets
that can be separately identified and recognised.’°° It is upon the sale of a share in the
company that any valuation of the goodwill will be tested, since the buyer is acquiring a share
in an ongoing concern and not merely a share in a set of specific assets.

443. That the price of UTT’s sale of its shares in UMC to Batelco included such a goodwill element
is supported by the fact that Batelco included a sum in respect of such goodwill on the sale
when it produced its Consolidated Accounts after the acquisition.”°”

444. The 1985 Tax Law provides that goodwill is included amongst income that is subject to
taxation. At the same time, it exempts capital gains and provides that ‘profits accrued from
the buying and selling of ... shares and bonds shall be considered part of these capital profits’.

445. There is, in the Tribunal’s view, and irrespective of the actual decision of the Court of Cassation
in the instant case, an apparent tension between these provisions of the Jordanian law. Such
a tension is not unusual in tax legislation generally, since a common legislative technique in
taxing statutes is for the legislator to impose taxes in one operative provision and then carve
out exemptions from that which would otherwise be taxable in an exemption provision.

446. Such an apparent tension can only be resolved by seeking to apply to both provisions a good
faith interpretation that gives each provision an effet utile in light of their legislative history
and context and the manner in which the provisions have been interpreted by the Court of
Cassation prior to this case.’°*

786 |FRS 3 (2015) App A defines goodwill as: ‘An asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets
acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognised’: Expert Report of Ms
Kate Alexander, Ex EY-36; Expert Report of Ms Pam Jackson, App 1, (38]-[39]; Expert Report of Ms Kate Alexander, (2.1.15]
& App C.

787 Note 8 to these Accounts listed the total consideration for the purchase of UMC (in ‘000 Bahrani Dinars) as 156,849, the
fair value of the assets acquired as (32,469) and goodwill as 124,380. It stated: ‘The goodwill is attributable to the growth
prospects of the acquired business and the significant synergies that are expected to arise after Batelco’s acquisition of
Umniah’: Ex C-158, p 46.

768 The question of the proper approach to interpretation of taxing statutes under Jordanian law was a matter of some debate
between the experts, summarised at (145]-[150] above. In the end, the Tribunal does not consider that it is necessary to
resolve all aspects of this debate in order to resolve the questions before it.

The relevant context under Jordanian law. The exemption on which the Claimants rely, Article
7.A.15.a, was enacted in its current form in 19957°° (and last amended in 2001).’”° The Arabic
word for shares used in that paragraph is ‘ashom’.

The Tribunal has recounted in detail in paragraphs [138] to [140] above the evolution of the
relevant provisions of the Companies Acts.

For present purposes, the relevant point is that the precise form of company adopted for
UMC-the private shareholding company limited by ashom shares—was only re-introduced into
Jordanian company law by an amendment to the Companies Law in 2002.’ Between 1989
and 2002, the only form of capital-based company constituted by ashom shares was a public
shareholding company, whose shares could be traded on the Jordanian Stock Exchange.

The 2002 Companies Law provided for the possibility that the shares in this new version of
the private shareholding company could be publicly listed and traded. The Claimants
explained in their submissions that this provision was introduced, and the expression ‘ashom’
shares used, so as to facilitate equity stock option schemes for workers and to facilitate the
exit of such companies on the capital market.’” But it is common ground that these provisions
have not been given effect and that private shareholding companies are not currently traded
on the Amman Stock Exchange.

Therefore in 1995, when the exemption in Article 7.A.15.a was introduced into the Tax Law,
the only persons that could take advantage of the specific exemption for gains on the selling
of ashom shares were those persons that held shares in public shareholding companies.

By contrast, Jordanian law has, since the inception of the 1964 Companies Law, recognised a
category of company originally called the ordinary company.” It is common ground that such
a company has a corporate personality, separate from that of the partners that hold shares in
it, and that it is the company and not the partners in it that own the company’s assets.7”*

It is also common ground that, upon the sale of his share (for which the Arabic word is ‘husas’),
the shareholder or partner in such a company would be liable to tax on the goodwill element
in the sale price of their share constituted by the difference between the fair market price of

the underlying assets and the actual sale price.””*

This is what the Court of Cassation decided in a consistent line of cases.’”° Characteristic of
this reasoning is the following passage from the Hamdan decision:”””

[T]he owners of the Ordinary Company sold 60% of the Ordinary Company's Hussa shares
s» They received 930,000 JOD as the sale price of the sold Hussa shares and this amount
represents the estimated value of the Hussa shares aforementioned, in addition to
consideration for goodwill.

The Assessor for Income Tax did not charge the Appellants except for on the amount
representing Goodwill.

And this amount is subject to tax, in accordance with Article 3 paragraph (a) item (1) which
subjects the Income generated from the profits or gains from any transaction or separate
deal that is considered as business or trade for the reason that goodwill consideration is
only a commercial gain accumulated during the life of the establishment and was received
by its owne[r] upon the sale.

Whereas the increase in the share’s value which is the difference between the book value
of these shares and the value as estimated on the date of the sale, and therefore is not
taxable as it is considered a Capital Gain pursuant to Article 7 a 11 of the Income Tax Law.

The position was the same in relation to the original form of private shareholding company
established under the 1964 Companies Law and maintained until its replacement by the
limited liability company in 1989. The shares in such companies were referred to in the
legislation as ‘ashom’, but they could not be publicly traded.

The Court of Cassation held in its decision in Ghassan Dhamen’” that the sale of Mr Ghassan’s
share in the Al-Amal Company’” included an amount in respect of goodwill and that ‘the
amounts that were subjected to tax are the consideration for goodwill and consideration for
goodwill is part of the profits and as such is taxable because it is profits’.

The position is also the same where what is sold is a share in a limited liability company — the
form of corporation established under the 1989 Temporary Companies Law in place of the
original type of private shareholding company and continued even after the 2002 reforms.
Such shares were referred to in the legislation as ‘husas’ shares and could not be offered
publicly.”°°

This was confirmed by the Court of Cassation in Rowwad,”*" a case that also involved the sale
of shares in a company operating a telecommunications business in Jordan. The Court held
that ‘whereas goodwill represents a source of income as per Article 3/a/7 of the income tax
law, then subjecting it to tax agrees with the provisions of the Law’. The Court went on to

reject an argument that this goodwill was not owned by the ultimate shareholder. It held that
as Rowwad ‘owns husas shares in Bella, which in turn owns husas shares in Fastlink [the
operating company]. Therefore, goodwill belongs to [Rowwad] (Appellant), since it owns the
largest shares in the Company from which goodwill is realized’.

What, then, is the position where the sale is of ‘ashom’ shares in a private shareholding
company established under the 2002 Companies Act? Does the exemption under Article 7
apply to exempt the whole of the sale proceeds of shares in a private shareholding company
from tax, even if part of the value of those shares is represented by goodwill in the company,
or is the exemption limited to profits from ‘ashom’ shares publicly traded on the Jordan Stock
Exchange?

Prior to the decisions of the Jordanian courts in the instant case, the Tribunal has not been
referred to any judicial authority or authoritative commentary directly on point either way.

The Tribunal is not itself charged with answering this question of Jordanian law itself. It must
only consider whether the decision arrived at by the Court of Cassation was one that no
reasonably competent court could have reached.

The Claimants’ criticisms. The Claimants allege that the judgment ‘is full of serious mistakes
that no competent judge would have made’.”*? They say specifically that:

(a) The judgment wrongly shifted the burden of proof from the ISTD onto the taxpayer
and failed to ensure that ISTD had identified and correctly calculated a source of
income;

(b) It rejected the application of the exemption based on the manner by which UTT’s
shares (not UMC) are sold thus focusing on the wrong company;

(c) It imposed a requirement of a non-commercial act for share sales not found in Article
7.A.15.a; and,
(d) It wrongly held that UTT’s profit came from consideration for the transfer of goodwill,

and did so on the basis of an illogical connection between the type of services
provided by UMC and the definition of goodwill.

The Tribunal has carefully reviewed the judgment of the Court of Cassation. The Court’s
reasons are expressed in compressed form. This in itself is not unusual for a judgment
rendered by a Court in the Civil Law system. Considering each of the Claimants’ points in turn:

(a) The Tribunal does not read the judgment as shifting the burden of proof. In the
passage cited by the Claimants, the Court observes that ‘[l]ooking back at the
submitted evidence it appears from that the Claimant did not submit any proof
evidencing that these profits are not consideration for goodwill’.”*? The Tribunal has

already found above that, since UTT did not submit a tax return, the ISTD was entitled
under the 1985 Tax Law to proceed to make an assessment on the basis of the
information that it was able to obtain. Dr Masa’deh, the Claimants’ expert, accepted
that, if a taxpayer wished to contest the assessment, the taxpayer bears the burden
of proof to establish the basis for his contention.”

The Tribunal does not consider that the Court confused the position of UTT with that
of UMC. When the Court states: ‘the Claimant is a limited liability company and that
its contribution to the capital in this company is husas shares that are not tradable on
the stock exchange’,”*° the Court’s reference to the ‘its contribution to the capital of
this Company’ is, when read in the context of the preceding paragraph, a reference to
UTT’s shares in UMC. It is these shares that were the subject of the sale and of the Tax
Measure. It is correct that UTT’s shares in UMC were not tradable on the Exchange.
The Court’s substantive reasoning is clear and does not depend on the particular term
used.

The Court introduces the concept of ‘commercial act’ as part of its explanation of the
reasons in principle for a distinction between what it rules to be tax exempt gains
from publicly traded shares and non-exempt gains from goodwill made by commercial
companies. This is a matter of the proper construction of the statute. It cannot, in the
Tribunal’s view, be characterised as incompetent or inexcusable.

The Court’s reference to UTT’s profit from the sale of its shares as arising from the
sale of shares ‘in a company providing services throughout the Kingdom and which
obtained the concession right to invest in the field of telecommunication’ establishes
the predicate for the requirement under Article 3.a.7 referenced in the next sentence
for ‘income accrued in the Kingdom’ from, inter alia ‘goodwill’. It does not introduce
an irrelevant element.

Asa result, the Tribunal does not find that, on a fair reading of the text, the Court’s reasoning
contains ‘numerous serious mistakes’, as the Claimants contend.

The Claimants emphasise that UTT’s shares in UMC were ‘ashom’ shares — the expression used
in Article 7.A.15.a.

In the Tribunal’s view, the particular expression used could not, in itself, reasonably be treated
as determinative of the scope of the exemption:

(a)

When asked by the President ‘whether there is a difference in the legal character
arising from the use of the word ashom as distinct from husas’, Dr Masa’deh, the
Claimants’ expert, replied:”°°

There is no difference in terms of the issue of ownership for whoever holds this share,
husa or ashom. Probably there is a difference in terms of their selling and tradability.

Ashoms are sold on the stock market, and husas of limited liability companies are sold via
a simple sale transaction at the Controller of Companies. Other than that, they are just an
indication of the ownership of a certain element of the company.

(b) It is apparent that the Jordanian legislature has used both terms variously for shares
in the different forms of private companies that it has created since 1964. Further the
Jordanian Courts do not appear to have treated either term as a term of art when
determining the tax implications of the disposal of shares.

(c) Where the Courts have been invited to decide on the tax implications of the sale of
shares (however described) in private companies, they have consistently held the
portion of the sale price that is attributable to goodwill to be taxable.

(d) At the time the current exemption was introduced, the only form of ‘ashom’ shares
in Jordan were shares in public companies traded on the Stock Exchange.

(e) It appears that the possibility that shares in private shareholding companies could be
publicly traded may have justified the use of term ‘ashom’ in the 2002 legislation—
though in the event this possibility has not become a reality.

The Respondent emphasises that its reading of the exemption is consistent with the reference
in the text to ‘profits accrued from the buying and selling of ... shares’. This, it maintains, is
consistent only with transactions on an Exchange where shares may be freely traded — bought
and sold — and not with the sale of an undertaking by means of a share sale. The Claimants
say that this argument was rejected by the Respondent’s expert, Mr Rabah.”*’ The Tribunal
has examined the evidence given on this point and finds that Mr Rabah deposed that,
whatever the name ascribed to the type of shares, if in substance the sale price for the sale of
a private business by way of a transfer of shares is negotiated directly between the parties
and involves an element of goodwill, that element will be taxable.’®* By contrast, in his
opinion, the trading of shares in public companies is not taxable, whether or not the seller was
an original subscriber.”®?

The Tribunal can understand a legislative policy that would encourage trading in shares
quoted on the Stock Exchange by exempting such gains from tax. The value of such shares
may go up or down from day-to-day dependent on many factors outside the control of the
shareholder. The price of the shares is determined by the market and not by negotiation
between the seller and the buyer. Mr Kudah explained the purpose of the exemption in the
1985 Tax Act as being ‘a wish by the government to move to public shareholding companies
and it was considered to be a kind of encouragement for investment and developing the

market.’

For the above reasons, the Tribunal finds the interpretation of the 1985 Tax Law upheld by
the Court of Cassation in this matter to have been reasonably open to it. The Tribunal does
not consider that the judgment is inexcusable.

Relation to the international law standard. Standing back from a close analysis of the approach
of the Court, there is a larger point that goes to the test that this Tribunal must apply. It is this.
The reason for considering whether the judgment of the Court was ‘inexcusable’ as a matter
of public international law is in order to determine whether, in the totality including the
actions of the judicial organs of the state, the Respondent’s treatment of the Claimants’
investment was arbitrary.

Where an international tribunal finds that a municipal court judgment is one that no
reasonably competent judge could render, it will do so because it is left with ‘justified
concerns as to the judicial propriety of the outcome’ such that it ‘can conclude in the light of
all the available facts that the impugned decision was clearly improper and discreditable, with
the result that the investment has been subjected to unfair and inequitable treatment’.”*

In their pleadings, the Claimants alleged that the Court of Cassation’s judgment was one that
‘no impartial, reasonable and competent judge would have rendered’.’*? The mistakes were
such that ‘no competent judge would have committed when acting in good faith’.’°? But this
allegation is not supported by the evidence the Claimants adduced.

While heavily criticizing the reasoning of the Court of Cassation in this matter as incorrect as
a matter of Jordanian law, the Claimants’ expert, Dr Masa’deh, was equally clear that he was
not criticizing the fairness of the Court of Cassation. He said in terms in his Second Report
that:7

Finally and as a matter of principle | regret and reject the accusations contained in the
Rabah Report claiming that | question the fairness of the Court of Cassation and in
particular the Honorable Judge Nasrawi. Those accusations are false and
unsubstantiated...

Dr Masa’deh was questioned about this statement at length under cross-examination and did
not resile from it.”°° He explained that:7%°

(When | said, for instance, this is in violation of the law, this is inconceivable, this is
unthought of or unheard of, these are ways that we as practitioners or academics often
review and criticize man-made law...

He confirmed, in answer to a question from a member of the Tribunal that he did not contest
the independent character of the Jordanian judiciary.’*”

This point is a very important one. The Claimants insist that they do not invite the Tribunal to
act as a further court of appeal on matters of Jordanian law. This necessarily means that, even
if the Court of Cassation were wrong about Jordanian law, Jordan would commit no breach of
the treaty protection from arbitrary treatment in this respect unless the judgment was
‘improper and discreditable, with the result that the investment has been subjected to unfair
and inequitable treatment’. But the evidence given before the Tribunal does not support such
a finding.

Finally, the Tribunal looks at the conduct of the Respondent State in the round against what
it has found to be the standard applicable to the protection from arbitrary measures and the
assurance of fair and equitable treatment. The Tribunal has considered both the claim that
the original Tax Measure was predetermined and politically motivated and the question
whether the subsequent judgment of the Court of Cassation upholding the validity of the Tax
Measure was inexcusable.

A majority of the Tribunal has found that the Claimants have not made out their case on the
evidence that the original Tax Measure was politically motivated (Arbitrator Fortier takes a
different view on this aspect for the reasons that he explains in his Separate Opinion).

The whole Tribunal has found that the decision of the Court of Cassation cannot be impugned
at the international law level as arbitrary — as being a decision that no reasonably competent
tribunal could reach. Nor is there any sensible suggestion that the Court was itself politically
motivated or acting in bad faith. In the circumstances the Tribunal finds that the Tax Measure
was imposed according to an interpretation of Jordanian law upheld by the Court of Cassation
in a decision that is not itself a breach of the State’s international law obligations. For these
reasons, the claim of arbitrary measures must fail.

The Claimants’ other claims

As summarised above,’ in addition to their claim of arbitrary treatment, the Claimants also
allege the following treaty breaches:

(a) Full protection and security (Article 3(1));

(b) Legal stability and predictability (Article 12);
(c) Legitimate expectations (Article 4);

(d) Discrimination (Article 3(1) and Article 4); and,

(e) Impairment of rights to liquidate.

487.

The Tribunal has already explained in Section A above its reasons for considering that the
Claimants’ claims are to be analysed primarily by reference to the protection in Article 3(1) of
the BIT from arbitrary measures.

It has concluded that, on the claims as raised in the present proceedings, the protection from
arbitrary treatment is also included within the more general requirement in Article 4(1) to
afford ‘fair and equitable treatment’.””

The Tribunal has explained its reasons for concluding that the present claim cannot be
considered as apt to invoke the protection in Article 3(1) from ‘discriminatory’ measures — an
element that is also comprised within the Article 4(1) assurance of fair and equitable
treatment.®” As a result of these two conclusions, the claim of breach of the fair and equitable
treatment standard must also fail.

The Claimants also put their case in a number of other ways. They allege breaches of the
assurance of full protection and security (Article 3(1)) and legal stability and predictability,
which they submit is applicable under the Unified Agreement pursuant to Article 12). They
allege that the Respondent's actions breached their legitimate expectations as to the tax
position, which expectations were protected by the assurance of fair and equitable treatment.
Finally, they allege impairment of their rights to liquidate their investment (a specific
protection found in other BITs concluded by Jordan on which they rely pursuant to the
assurance of most-favoured nation treatment under Article 4).

The Tribunal can deal with these claims shortly, since, in its view, they do not give rise to
materially different considerations than those that it has already considered at length in
relation to the primary claim of arbitrary treatment. They all depend upon the Claimants’
primary assertion that the imposition of the Tax Measure by the ISTD, the validity of which
was confirmed by the Court of Cassation, was politically motivated and based upon an
interpretation of the 1985 Tax Law that was arbitrary, being one that no reasonably
competent court applying the law in good faith could have reached.

If the Tribunal had found this to be so, it might well have occasioned other breaches of the
Respondent's international law obligations (though there might then have been a question
whether these additional claims added anything to the primary claim). But this is not the case.
A majority of the Tribunal has rejected the claim that the Tax Measure was politically
motivated on the evidence. The Tribunal as a whole has found that the decision of the Court
of Cassation was not arbitrary: it was a decision that was reasonably open to the Court on the
basis of the law.

It is therefore not necessary for the purpose of this case to decide two legal issues that the
Parties debated in their written pleadings, namely:

(a) Whether the obligation to afford full protection and security may extend beyond the
exercise of the police power to a more general obligation of due diligence;* and

(b) Whether Article 12 of the BIT is apt to incorporate a specific obligation to afford legal
stability and predictability found in the Unified Agreement.°*

The evidence before the Tribunal does not support the Claimants’ allegation that they had a
legitimate expectation that any disposal of their investment would not be subject to tax. The
Claimants based this allegation primarily on a document entitled ‘REACH Initiative’ of March
2000. ®3 This document contains in its Annex Al an ‘Analysis of Laws and Regulations
Concerning Information Technology in Jordan.’ In summarising the 1995 Law it states ‘Article
3(a) THE GENERAL RULE is that income earned in or generated from the Kingdom is subject to
income tax’.* It then notes under Exemptions: ‘CAPITAL GAINS shall be exempted from
income tax’ .®°°

Mr Alghanim placed some reliance on this document at the hearing in support of his
statement that ‘one of the reasons that made me invest in Jordan was specifically that the
sale of shares was exempt from taxation’.*°° He accepted that he had not discussed tax
treatment with His Majesty King Abdullah during his meeting with him.*°” He deposed that he
had been shown one page of the document ‘which was given to me by my people, which
stated that the capital gains is exempt from tax’.°

The Tribunal has carefully examined this document. It falls far short of the sort of specific
assurance from the Government that could form the subject of a legitimate expectation as to
the tax treatment that would be applied in Jordan on a sale of shares. Though addressed to
the King, it was prepared by members of a private organisation, the Jordan Computer
Society. ®° It presents a proposed national strategy for Jordan’s information technology
services sector. It does not represent itself to be an official Government document. Its analysis
of the legal position with regard to tax simply summarises the effect of the 1995 Law. It does
not address let alone answer the central question that arose in the present case as to the
treatment of the goodwill portion of a private share sale.

The Claimants do not otherwise suggest that they received specific assurances from the
Government as to this question that their transaction would be treated in any manner
different than that required by the existing Jordanian tax law.®?°

For these reasons, the Tribunal does not consider that the Claimants’ allegation that they had

Costs

The Tribunal turns finally to the issue of costs.

Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention addresses assessment and allocation of the costs of an
ICSID arbitration:

(2) In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties
otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the
proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses
of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre
shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.

The Convention thus addresses three elements of costs: expenses incurred by the parties, fees
and expenses of the members of the tribunal, and ICSID’s own charges. Unlike some other
arbitration texts, the Convention does not indicate principles or presumptions regarding the
allocation of costs. Instead, Article 61(2) confers very broad discretion on the tribunal in
deciding how and by whom costs are to be borne.

Rule 28(2) of the ICSID’s Arbitration Rules then provides:

(2) Promptly after the closure of the proceeding, each party shall submit to the Tribunal
a statement of costs reasonably incurred or borne by it in the proceeding and the
Secretary-General shall submit to the Tribunal an account of all amounts paid by each
party to the Centre and ofall costs incurred by the Centre for the proceeding. The Tribunal
may, before the award has been rendered, request the parties and the Secretary-General
to provide additional information concerning the cost of the proceeding.

In accordance with the Tribunal’s directions, the Parties filed Submissions on Costs on 4
August 2016 (supplemented in the Respondent’s case on 1 September 2016), followed by
Reply Submissions on Costs on 8 September 2016.

1. The Claimants’ submission on costs

The Claimants submit that they have incurred the following costs in connection with this
arbitration:

CsI, 130. This passage consists of a summary of the provisions of the 1995 Law and does not amount to a representation
by Jordan as to their meaning and effect.

811 The Tribunal understands this figure to consist of $500,000 paid in advances under ICSID Administrative and Financial
Regulation 14(3)(d) and $25,000 paid as the non-refundable lodging fee upon the filing of the Request for Arbitration.

provide the Parties with a detailed financial statement, and any remaining balance will be
reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the advances they made.

Each Party has contributed to date to the Secretariat’s requests for advances on costs in
accordance with paragraph 8 of PO No 1. These contributions amount to:

(a) For the Claimants: US$500,000.**°
(b) For the Respondent: US$498,500.*°
4. The Tribunal’s decision on allocation of costs

Article 61(2) confers a broad discretion on the Tribunal as to the assessment and allocation of
costs as between the Parties.

However, in the present case, both Parties are agreed as to the general approach that the
Tribunal ought to take to allocation, namely that the successful party ought to recover its costs
whatever the outcome (subject always to its consideration of whether particular costs were
reasonably incurred).*17

As the Respondent has in the event prevailed on the merits, it is entitled to reimbursement
from the Claimants of its reasonably incurred costs.

The Tribunal has examined the Respondent’s claim for costs and the Claimants’ submissions
onit. It notes that, on any view, the Respondent's costs were very considerably less than those
incurred by the Claimants. They amount to US$1,794,829.97 plus their share of the advances
required by the Centre of US$500,000, totalling US$2,294,829.97.

The Claimants explain the discrepancy between the costs of the respective Parties that ‘the
Respondent was able to secure heavily discounted services of counsel and experts, sometimes
operating at significant loss’.°!*

Nevertheless, the Claimants submit that the Respondent’s conduct of the proceedings
increased the costs generally. They refer in particular to:

(a) The Respondent’s pursuit of the Jordanian proceedings, which necessitated
Claimants’ application for provisional measures, the costs of which the Claimants seek

(c) The Respondent’s alleged uncooperative approach, in particular in relation to
document requests and translations.*"°

The Respondent replies that:

(a) As to the provisional measures application, ‘[i]f the Respondent is successful on the
merits, then the Jordanian proceedings will proceed against the Claimants having
been wrongly interrupted, and the Claimants’ complaints will have been
unfounded’;®°

(b) It denies having revised its case on a rolling basis, submitting that it has merely
responded to the Claimants’ case as it has developed; and

(c) It submits that its applications for document production were necessary and that the
Claimants are as much responsible for increased translation costs.

The Tribunal has considered these factors. In the end, it does not regard any of them as
sufficiently material to warrant an adjustment of the costs to be awarded:

(a) The fact that the Respondent has ultimately succeeded on the merits and that the
Tribunal’s provisional measures order must now be set aside does not have the
consequence that the order should never have been granted. Nevertheless, the costs
of this application (which neither Party has separately itemised) will have been
modest in the scheme of the arbitration as a whole. Oral argument was conducted on
the basis of limited written submissions at a hearing that was also devoted to other
procedural issues.

(b) The Tribunal does not consider that the manner in which the Parties developed their
arguments during the written phase was substantially out of the ordinary for a case
of this kind. On any view, the issues raised were of some doubt and difficulty and
called for evidence from (amongst other witnesses) experts on Jordanian law, whose
successive reports, though lengthy, sought to respond to the issues as they were
developed.

(c) As detailed in paragraph [20] above, the Tribunal had to issue a number of procedural
orders during the production of documents phase of this arbitration, including as to
the production of documents from third parties. It considers that these orders
provided it with useful assurance as to the scope of evidence produced to it. Equally,
the preparation of reliable translations of Arabic documents was of fundamental
importance to the Parties and to the Tribunal. The Tribunal is well aware that legal
translation is a highly specialised and difficult art. Although a number of directions
had to be made to achieve a set of translations that were either agreed or officially

prepared, the Tribunal does not consider that either Party sought to obstruct this
process.

Nevertheless, the Tribunal is mindful of the fact that, while the Respondent has ultimately
succeeded on the merits, it did not prevail on any of its jurisdictional objections. These were
the subject of extensive pleading through the two rounds of the written phase and also of oral
argument. The Parties have not in their costs outlines separately itemised the costs
attributable to these arguments in their submissions, issues of jurisdiction having been dealt
with together with the merits. In the exercise of its overall discretion as to apportionment of
costs, and taking account of both the fact that the Respondent should not recover its own
costs attributable to the jurisdiction issues and that the Claimants have incurred their own
unnecessary costs on these issues, the Tribunal decides to reduce the total sum to be awarded
to the Respondent by 20%.

The Tribunal has examined for itself the Respondent’s breakdown of its claim for costs. It finds
the sum claimed to have been generally reasonable, subject to two items which it has
determined should be disallowed:

(a) A sum of US$307,110 is claimed in respect of fees incurred to Baker & McKenzie in
respect of an ‘International Tax Expert’. This is in addition to the sum of US$500,881
claimed in respect of Ernst & Young for the same category of work. Whilst the Tribunal
was assisted by the expert evidence of Ms Kate Alexander of Ernst & Young, it received
no evidence from any member of Baker & McKenzie nor was that firm counsel of
record in the arbitration. The Respondent has not provided any explanation for this
line item in its costs submissions. The Tribunal disallows it.

(b) A sum of US$12,977.64 is claimed in respect of fees incurred to Bond Solon for
‘witness familiarisation’. The Respondent has not furnished any further information
as to this item. The Tribunal does not consider that this is a cost that ought to be borne
by the opposing party. Accordingly, it is also disallowed.

These two items together total US$320,087.64. Once this amount is subtracted from the
Respondent’s total claimed costs of $2,294,829.97, it leaves a sum of $1,974,742.33. The
Tribunal has decided that this sum is to be reduced by 20%, being $394,948.46, in respect of
costs attributable to jurisdiction issues. Once $394,948.46 is deducted from $1,974,742.34,
the amount payable is US$1,579,793.87.

As a result, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants are to pay the Respondent the sum of
US$1,579,793.87 in respect of its costs.

SEPARATE OPINION OF THE HONORABLE L. YVES FORTIER

2 October 2017

1. lagree with the conclusion of the Tribunal that the decision of the Court of Cassation cannot be
impugned at the international law level as arbitrary, being a decision that no reasonably competent

tribunal could reach.

2. also agree that there is no evidence that the Court was politically motivated or acting in bad faith.

3. lalso join in the Tribunal’s conclusion that the Tax Measure was imposed according to an
interpretation of Jordanian law which was upheld by the Court of Cassation in a decision that is not

itself a breach of the State’s international law obligation.

4. Accordingly, the Claimants’ claim of arbitrary treatment must fail as do all their claims of other

breaches of the Respondent’s international law obligations, to wit:

a. Fair and equitable treatment (Article 4 of the BIT);

b. Full protection and security and legal stability and predictability (Articles 3(1) and 12 of the
BIT);

c. Legitimate expectations (Article 4);

d. Discrimination (Articles 3(1) and 4 of the BIT); and

e. Impairment of rights to liquidate

for the reasons given in paragraphs 476 to 488 of the Award.

5. These are the reasons why | have joined in the dispositif.

6. However, where | part company with my friends and distinguished colleagues is in my appraisal of the

evidence which led to the imposition of the Tax Measure in 2008.

7. Having reviewed carefully the totality of the evidence, in particular the testimony of the Director
General of the ISTD, Mr. Al Kudah, as well as the testimony of Mr. Almusned, | have formed the view
that, as submitted by the Claimants, the Respondent acted in an arbitrary manner vis-a-vis the
Claimants’ investment by deciding to impose a tax on the sale by UTT of its shares in UMC to Batelco
in 2006 in response to media and Parliamentary pressure on the Government in the light of the public
perception of an illegitimate profit on the sale and irrespective of the provisions of the law.

Where my colleagues found Mr. Al Kudah to be a reliable witness, | found his evidence totally

unconvincing.

A few days after the transaction and strident criticism of the deal by the Jordanian press, the die was
cast when Mr. Al Kudah issued a statement which concluded that “it [was] unlikely that the deal be

exempted from income and sales taxes”.

In my opinion, the initial reaction to the transaction by the Director General of the ISTD does suggest

a pre-determination to impose a tax on UTT. | found his denial under cross-examination unpersuasive.

Mr. Al Kudah then set up an internal technical committee (the “Committee”) within the ISTD to

investigate further the taxability of the transaction (para. 378 of the award).

Amere 5 days later, the Committee reported that “the profits of the deal between the two parties

are subject to tax”.

| note that my colleagues attach importance to the words “in principle” which precede that sentence.

. After having listened to the evidence of Mr. Almusned, who was a member of the Committee, those
words strike me as a mere fig leaf. In short, | was not impressed by the testimony of Mr. Almusned,

who appeared to me to be simply parroting Mr. Al Kudah.

After the Committee issued its report, the pressure from members of Parliament continued

unabated’.

. The process which gives me pause was then followed by the unprecedented constitution by the Prime
Minister of a committee to address questions which had been raised by the Parliamentary Financial
and Economics Committee (para. 383 of the award). | note that Mr. Al Kudah was a member of that
special committee. He acknowledged that he could not recall another instance where a Prime
Ministerial Committee was asked to consider the taxability of a specific transaction and the tax liability

of a taxpayer.

See paragraphs 58, 59 and 382 of the Award.

One of the questions which was put to the Committee evidences, in my opinion, the pre-
determination of the Respondent to levy a tax on UTT irrespective of the provisions of the law. That
leading question was: “Why was there no imposition of income tax on the (good will of the

company)?”

In short, these are the reasons why | reach the conclusion that the events of 2006-2007 demonstrate

that the Respondent acted in an arbitrary manner vis-a

 

vis the Claimants’ investment by deciding to
impose a tax on the sale in response to media and political pressure and irrespective of the provisions

of the law.

However, as noted earlier, | agree with the Tribunal’s analysis of the position at international law vis-
a-vis the decisions of the Jordanian Courts and | accordingly join in the Tribunal’s dispositif. There was

no denial of justice in this case.

If the Claimants had filed their request for arbitration immediately after the imposition of the Tax
Measure in 2008, my decision may well have been different. But they chose to have recourse to the
Jordanian courts rather than an international venue. The break of the link between the administrative

decision and their recourse to the Jordanian courts is fatal to the Claimants’ case.
