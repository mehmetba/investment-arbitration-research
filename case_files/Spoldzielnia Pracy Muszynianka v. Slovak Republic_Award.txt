Il FACTUAL BACKGROUND

A. THE LEGNAVA REGION

8.  Legnava is a municipality of the Stara Lubovia district (PreSov region) in the northern
part of the Slovak Republic, an area reputed for the high presence of mineral water. It is
located on the left bank of the Poprad river, a natural boundary defining part of the border
between the Slovak Republic and the Republic of Poland.

9. The Legnava area has a network of “primitive roads” connecting its more remote areas®
and is only accessible through State Road 3183, a 3 degree road.® Land transportation
from Legnava to Muszyna requires a 45-minute trip via State Road 3138,” despite being

B. GOLDFRUCT AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF GFT SLOVAKIA

GFT-Goldfruct Sp. z 0.0. (“Goldfruct”) is a Polish company active in the mineral water
production and bottling sector. Goldfruct is the producer of “Kinga Pieninska’, a medium-
mineralized water extracted from and bottled in the Polish Municipality of KroScienko nad
Dunajcem.'°

Intending to expand its business, Goldfruct focused its attention on the Slovak side of
the border and considered Legnava the nearest convenient area for the exploration and
exploitation of mineral water in the Slovak Republic."

To that effect, on 22 October 2001, Goldfruct established a local subsidiary, GFT
Slovakia s.r.o (“GFT Slovakia”). With its registered seat in Legnava, GFT Slovakia was
90% owned by Goldfruct.'2 The remaining 10% shareholding was held by natural
persons. *?

c. THE DISCOVERY OF THE LEGNAVA SOURCES AND INITIAL PERMITS
1. Borehole LH-1A (2002-2005)

In 2002, GFT Slovakia sought authorization from the Ministry of Environment to carry out
exploration activities in the Legnava area.

On 24 May 2002, the Ministry of Environment delineated a first exploration area in the
municipality of Legnava, and allowed GFT Slovakia to perform a “detailed
hydrogeological” survey focusing on the “verification” of mineral water abundance in said
area (the “Exploration Permit |”).'4

On 8 November 2002, the Ministry of Environment determined a second neighboring
exploration area and authorized GFT Slovakia to conduct an “exploratory
hydrogeological” survey, again focusing on the “verification” of mineral water abundance
in the delimited area (the “Exploration Permit II”).15

In August 2004, upon the conclusion of the hydrogeological survey in both exploration
areas, GFT Slovakia issued a final report summarizing its findings (the “2004 Final

Report”).'® It memorialized the discovery of borehole LH-1 (situated southwest in the
Legnava municipality)? as a “new source of carbonic mineral water”. '®

On 17 February 2005, based on the calculation of groundwater quantities in the
hydrogeological survey contained in the 2004 Final Report, the Ministry of Environment
set the maximum usable amounts of water with respect to borehole LH-1 at 1.70 I.s* (the
“LH-1 Maximum Quantities Decision’). '9

On 23 March 2005, the Ministry of Health of the Slovak Republic issued a decree
whereby it recognized LH-1 “as a spring of natural mineral water” (the “LH-1 Natural
Mineral Water Recognition”).2°

2. Boreholes LH-2A, LH-3, LH-4, and LH-5 (2005-2009)

In addition to continuing its works under Exploration Permits | and Il, GFT Slovakia
submitted an application for the determination of a third exploration area. On 23 February
2006, the Ministry of Environment granted the request and authorized GFT Slovakia to
carry out a “prospecting hydrogeological survey” in a newly delineated exploration area

On 20 December 2008, GFT Slovakia issued a final report summarizing its findings with
respect to the further hydrogeological surveys executed between 2005 and 2008 (the
“2008 Final Report”).?? Like the 2004 Final Report, the 2008 Final Report memorialized
the discovery of Boreholes LH-2A, LH-3, LH-4 and LH-5 (together with Borehole LH-1,
the “Legnava Sources”), located northeast of the Legnava Municipality.

On 21 May 2009, the Ministry of Environment approved the 2008 Final Report and set
the maximum usable amounts of water of the new boreholes as follows: 2.83 I.s' for LH-
2A, 2.30 I.s" for LH-3, 2.40 I.s for LH-4, and 1.70 I.s™ for LH-5 (“LH-2A to LH-5 Maximum

On 6 July 2009, the State Spa Committee of the Slovak Republic recognized Boreholes
LH-2A, LH-3, LH-4, and LH-5 as springs of natural mineral water (“LH-2A to LH-5 Natural
Mineral Water Recognition”).25 The State Spa Committee is an administrative authority
organized and operating under the Ministry of Health that, from January 2006 onwards,
was in charge of the recognition of natural mineral waters previously exercised directly
by the Ministry of Health.2

Upon discovery of Borehole LH-1 in 2004, GFT Slovakia contemplated the possibility of
building a bottling plant on lots No. 362/3 and 366/1 (adjacent to State Road 3138)

The location contemplated for the bottling plant did not change with the discovery of
Boreholes LH-2A, LH-3, LH-4 and LH-5, northeast of Legnava. Rather, GFT Slovakia
intended to transport the water extracted from the newly discovered boreholes to the site
surrounding Borehole LH-1 through a “2 kilometres long pipeline”.*° Local authorities
assisted GFT Slovakia to acquire shares in several properties to allow for the
construction of that pipeline.*'

GFT Slovakia later informed the Slovak authorities, however, that constructing a bottling
plant near Borehole LH-1 “was conditional on the reconstruction of the Maly Lipnik —
Legnava access road [(i.e., a segment of State Road 3138)] with a total length of
4,500 m’”.% It is undisputed that such reconstruction has not taken place to date. Indeed,
while the PreSov Self-Governing Region (an autonomous territorial and administrative
entity of the Slovak Republic in which Legnava is situated) initiated the first phase of
reconstruction of State Road 3138 (including the 4.5 km portion between Maly Lipnik
and Legnava),®* the works comprised only the “stabilization of landslides”.** Also, while
the PreSov Self-Governing Region agreed to commence a more comprehensive second

phase, the approval for such undertaking was obtained after the initiation of the present
proceedings.®>

Between 2006 and 2008, as a second alternative, GFT Slovakia contemplated building
the bottling plant in proximity to Boreholes LH-2A and LH-5. This prospect was prompted
by preliminary discussions between Slovak and Polish authorities on the construction of
a bridge connecting Legnava and Milik in Poland.°° The bridge “would have made it
possible to transport bottled water from a bottling plant [in the newly envisaged location]
by trucks using the road infrastructure on the Polish side, regardless of the technical
condition of the road leading to Legnava on the Slovak side”.3”

To that effect, in 2007 Goldfruct contacted the District Office in Stara Luboviia requesting
the construction of the bridge in the following terms:

In connection with the obtained information about the project of building a footbridge
with limited carrying capacity between Legnava in Slovakia and Milik - Andrzejowka
in Poland, we kindly ask you to consider the possibility of designing and building a
bridge at this place of not very large dimensions - one lane with street lighting - but
with a high carrying capacity enabling the movement of heavy vehicles [...].

An example that confirms the real need for the proposed solution is the situation of
GFT Slovakia [...].The outlays and the works already carried out confirm the
possibility of obtaining high quality mineral waters on an industrial scale in the
Legnava region. In order to implement this project it is necessary to build a modern
mineral water bottling plant [...]. Due to the current condition of the roads in the
Legnava area, such a solution is not possible. The construction of a bridge
connecting Legnava with the road system on the Polish side would make the planned

investment possible.**

 

It is common ground that the bridge in question was never built due to financial

constraints.°°

On 24 March 2010, GFT Slovakia requested a preliminary opinion from the Inspectorate
of Spas and Springs of the Slovak Republic (the “Inspectorate”) on a third alternative:
the construction of a bottling plant in Poland to be supplied with water extracted from the
Legnava Sources through pipelines placed under the Poprad river after being treated in
Slovak territory.4°

On 30 March 2010, the Inspectorate replied that it had “no objections against [GFT
Slovakia’s] plan of us[ing] the natural mineral sources in Legnava’.“' It also pointed out
that EU law did not permit mixing the water from the Legnava Sources, and that the
company with the right to exploit the Legnava Sources “would also have to be the
company bottling the water in consumer packaging”.“?

On 4 November 2010, the Polish National Institute of Public Health (“PNIPH”) issued an
“opinion” in response to a previous inquiry filed by Goldfruct (which is not on the record
of this arbitration) on the possibility of “combining water from 5 boreholes located in
Slovakia [(i-e., the Legnava Sources)] and using it to produce bottled water in a bottling
plant in Poland”.* In particular, the PNIPH stated that Polish law permitted the mixing of
the water from the Legnava Sources in Poland in the following terms:
On the basis of the data submitted regarding the basic mineral composition of the
water from the abovementioned five boreholes drilled in Legnava (Slovakia), to a
depth of 140 to 160 m, it is concluded that the water from all boreholes is of the same
chemical type, i.e. HCOs-Ca-Mg - naturally carbonated in the deposit. Waters from

these boreholes can therefore be combined to obtain raw material for the production
of bottled natural mineral water.“ [...]

At the same time, it is stated that all activities related to water extraction, protection

of intakes and preparation of the water for bottling (separation of unstable elements:

Fe and Mn), should be carried out in compliance with Directive 2009/54/EC and

Codex Stan 1081984 (as amended in 1985 and 1991). Compliance with the

recommendations set out in this legislation should be confirmed by the competent

institutions in Slovakia.*®
On 22 November 2010, GFT Slovakia requested a second preliminary opinion from the
Inspectorate on the inspection of the Legnava Sources.“ In particular, GFT Slovakia
sought (i) confirmation of its understanding that, in the Slovak Republic, the Inspectorate
would “inspect the quality of water in the sources and after its treatment, its quantity and
compliance with other applicable legislation”; and (ii) confirmation “that in Slovakia the
inspections will be carried out according to the applicable EU directives and Slovak
law”.47

The Inspectorate’s answer was the following:

[W]e announce that the natural mineral springs in Legnava have been recognized
under the existing legislation as well as proceedings for an authorization for the use
and treatment of water from sources as well as the consequent inspection of
resources and the inspection of compliance with statutory conditions and conditions
arising from decisions on resource use and treatment of water from resources will
be carried out under the legislation of the Slovak Republic.

Since the natural mineral water will be filled into consumer packages in the bottling
plant located in the territory of the Republic of Poland, the process of inspection and
checking of compliance of the consumer packaging of the natural mineral waters
shall be subject to the legislative regulations in force in the Republic of Poland and
will be carried out by the competent authorities of the Republic of Poland.*®

On 10 December 2010, GFT Slovakia described its business plan to the Ministry of
Environment of the Slovak Republic by setting out the three alternatives for the bottling
plant, and the reasons for not implementing the first two.

With respect to the first alternative,°° GFT Slovakia stated it had to be discarded on the
basis that there were no “major reconstructions” planned on the 4.5 km tranche of State
Road 3138 connecting Maly Lipnik with Legnava.*' Hence, the condition of the access
road to Legnava, which GFT Slovakia reported had “spot defects” and had been
“damaged by floods in 2010”, would make it “impossible” for the “heavy trucks” necessary
to distribute the water to transit.*

Regarding the second alternative,*? GFT Slovakia stated it could not be executed given
that the plan to build a bridge over the Poprad river (thus connecting Legnava with Milik)
“will not be implemented” by the Slovak and Polish authorities “in the extent [GFT
Slovakia] required due to financial reasons”.®4

Turning to the third and final alternative,5°> GFT Slovakia described the construction of a
bottling plant in Muszyna as the only viable option to exploit the Legnava Sources as
follows:

The only feasible solution in the current and future circumstances is to connect the
bottling plant to the Polish transport infrastructure. This solution involves the division

of technology into two parts: extraction and treatment of mineral water in the Slovak

Republic, its subsequent transport by a pipeline under the Poprad River and its

bottling into consumer packaging in Poland. Land with an area of 35,000 m? was

purchased for this purpose in the cadastral territory of the town of Muszyna. We have

received an approving opinion for the plan from the Spa and Spring Inspectorate of

the Ministry of Health of the Slovak Republic.¢
On 14 November 2011, GFT Slovakia received an answer from the Mayor of Legnava
regarding a previous inquiry on “the possibility of using heavy lorries on local roads in
the municipality’.5’ According to the Mayor, “[d]riving heavy vehicles through the
municipality is not possible due to the width of roads and their technical condition, and
the distance of family houses from the roads. The roads end in the built-up area of the
municipality”.**

E. EXPLOITATION PERMIT - PHASE | (DECEMBER 2011 APPLICATION - FEBRUARY

2012 Stay)
On 22 December 2011, pursuant to Article 11 of the Act on Mineral Waters,°? GFT
Slovakia applied to the State Soa Committee for a license to exploit the Legnava Sources
(an “Exploitation Permit” or “Mineral Water Permit”).® In its application, GFT Slovakia
declared its intention to extract the natural mineral water from the Legnava Sources and
“pipe it to the bottling plant, which [would] be located on plot No. 996/1 owned by the
company”. In particular, GFT Slovakia stated that it would (i) build containers and
facilities intended for separating iron and manganese compounds in a water treatment
plant; and (ii) transport the water from the treatment plant to the bottling plant using
pipelines under the Poprad river, where water would be ‘filled in consumer packages”
under the product name “Skarb Muszyny”.®

The State Spa Committee considered the application and concluded that “the documents
accompanied thereto [did] not meet all the requirements set out in [Article] 11 of the [Act
on Mineral Waters]”.®* Moreover, the Committee considered it “impossible to continue
the proceedings due to the need to first resolve the preliminary issue regarding the
possibility of exploitation and treatment of natural mineral water sources in Slovakia and

its subsequent transport by pipeline to the Polish territory in order to have it filled in
consumer packages in [a] bottling plant for mineral waters in Poland, and therefore the
issue of building the intake duct under the river of Poprad to Poland”.&*

On 8 February 2012, the State Spa Committee thus decided to “stay” the Exploitation
Permit proceedings and requested GFT Slovakia to (i) “complete [and] remedy the
defects in its application” by providing a series of listed documents within 180 days;®
and (ii) provide “a building permit issued by the competent building authority” on the
construction of the proposed pipeline under the Poprad river.®

F. ZONING PERMIT (DECEMBER 2011 To JUNE 2012)

On 22 December 2011, in addition to the Exploitation Permit application,®” GFT Slovakia
submitted an application before the Municipality of Legnava to obtain a zoning permit
over the location of a water treatment plant in Legnava and the pipelines through the
Poprad river.®

On 15 June 2012, the Municipality of Legnava granted the requested permit (the “Zoning
Permit”) and thus accepted the “placement” of both a water treatment plant in Legnava
and “of drill piping to the treatment plant and towards the bottling plant after treatment
[through the Poprad river]” into Poland.®® The Zoning Permit, however, did not include
the bottling plant itself, as it was considered to be an issue “to be dealt with in the Polish
Republic”.7°

In granting the Zoning Permit pursuant to Slovak law, the Municipality of Legnava
assessed and incorporated the opinions submitted by all other relevant authorities, in
particular, the following:

i. The District Environmental Office in Stara Lubovia stated that the
“construction concerned [was] possible from the aspect of water condition
protection”. It pointed out, however, “that a building permit must be

requested” from the District Environmental Office in Stara Lubovia for the

The Regional Environmental Office in PreSov (the “REOP”) initially stated
that the “given water structure [was] possible [as regards] water regime
protection”,’* subject to, inter alia, the discussion and conclusion of an inter-
governmental agreement between the Slovak Republic and the Republic of
Poland regulating the “rights and obligations” of “ground water as a
commodity [...] extracted in Slovakia and exploited in Poland”.”? The REOP
would later amend its position stating that, “after repeated discussion about
the given requirement with the Ministry of Environment of the Slovak
Republic, it [would] not apply the requirement to conclude an inter-
governmental agreement [...]”.74

EXPLOITATION PERMIT - PHASE Il (AUGUST 2012 FIRST SUPPLEMENT —
SEPTEMBER 2012 CONTINUED STAY)

On 1 August 2012, within the applicable 180-day deadline, GFT Slovakia supplemented

its Exploitation Permit application by submitting the documents previously identified by

the State Spa Committee as missing.’

On 19 September 2012, the State Spa Committee deemed “completed” the “particulars
to the application” for the issuance of an Exploitation Permit as regards its decision of
8 February 2012.76 The Committee held, however, that it could not “continue” with the
Exploitation Permit proceedings given that the “resolution of the preliminary issue”
regarding the building permit for the construction of the pipeline under the Poprad river
had “not been documented so far”. 77 The proceedings were thus ordered to “remain
suspended pending such resolution and documentation”.”8

H. — MUSZYNIANKA’S PURCHASE OF GFT SLOVAKIA (JULY 2012 - DECEMBER 2012)

49. Upon the receipt of the Zoning Permit,”? Goldfruct decided to sell GFT Slovakia. While
the reason for the sale is contentious, it is undisputed that, as a first step, Goldfruct
engaged Warsaw Equity Advisors sp. z 0.0. (“Warsaw Equity” or “WEA”) to provide an
expert opinion.

50. In July 2012, Warsaw Equity issued an information memorandum covering the
transborder transportation of water extracted from the Legnava Sources to a mineral
water bottling plant in Muszyna (the “Information Memorandum’).®' This Information
Memorandum, prepared for Goldfruct and GFT Slovakia’s prospective buyers, contained
the following relevant statements:

i. Regarding a bottling plant in Muszyna:

An attractive location in the neighborhood of a Polish mountain health
resort — Muszyna, surrounded by untouched nature, on territories which
are pollution-free and not used for intense agricultural crops constitute
important advantages in the promotional campaign. The proximity to
the dynamically developing water markets of Central and Eastern
Europe and to the big German market increases the market and logistic
attractiveness of the project.®

L-]
2.2 Key investment issues: [...]

8. Reducing investment outlays (capex) by locating the plant in
Muszyna, on the territory which has access to the necessary
infrastructure

+ The cross-border concept of locating the plant on the territories with a
permit for the foundation of such a plant, with the full utility infrastructure
(water supply, sewage system, electricity, gas supply) renders it
possible to significantly reduce investment outlays.

+ Locating the plant directly on national road No. 971 which will provide
a convenient access to the plant.®

The initial project concept assumed the construction of the bottling plant
on the property of GFT Slovakia in Legnava, however, it was excluded

due to the logistic and transport needs of the future plant and the current
poor road infrastructure in Legnava.

After the analysis of legal, logistic and infrastructure conditions of the
project, SLOV Company decided that the optimal solution was to build
a cross-border mineral water bottling plant which would be located on
both sides of the border in Poland and in Slovakia.

This project renders it possible to e.g.:

+ reduce investment outlays — locating the plant on the developed land
in Muszyna which is directly connected with national road network

+ use favourable formal and legal conditions applicable in each country;

+ extend, in the future when the communication infrastructure in the
neighbourhood of Legnava is developed, the logistic and technical
capabilities by building new buildings on the territories of the Company
in Legnava, which might be important in the case of developing sales
in the countries of Southern Europe as well as in Germany, Austria and
others. ®4

Regarding the resources and chemical composition of the Legnava Sources,
as well as the mixing and sale of the extracted water, the Information
Memorandum set out the following explanations:

The geophysical tests conducted upon request of GFT Slovakia and the
knowledge about the geological structure of those areas obtained while
drilling the current wellbores render it possible to assume that there are
huge resources of water of the uniform type and with higher
mineralisation on the land owned by GFT Slovakia. [...] Natural mineral
water with the high content magnesium and calcium, insignificant
amount of chlorides and small amount of sodium (around 50 mg/dm°)
is obtained from all wellbores. The water is of the uniform type and
contains no unwanted elements in amounts exceeding the norms
applicable in Poland, Slovakia and other EU countries. The water does
not contain any constituents indicating its contact with the external
environment.®

LJ

The concept of building the cross-border mineral water bottling plant
assumes: [...] 3. Building the water bottling plant on the land parcel in
Muszyna (Polska), in which the water transported through water pipes
from the territory of Slovakia will be mixed, bottled and sold according
to the provisions applicable in Poland and the EU.®

In November 2010, the official position of the Department of Health
Resort Materials of the National Institute of Public Health of the National
Institute of Hygiene of the Republic of Poland was obtained, which
allows for mixing water from 5 above-mentioned wellbores and using it

for the production of bottled water in the bottling plant on the territory of
Poland, which is located 200 m from the Polish and Slovakian border.

On the basis of the data concerning the basic mineral composition of
water from the above-mentioned wellbores drilled in depth of 140-160
m, it was stated that all wellbores provide water of the same chemical
type, i.e. HCO3-Ca-Mg — naturally saturated with carbon dioxide in the
deposit. Therefore, the water from those wellbores can be mixed,
bottled and market as natural mineral water under one brand (name).®”

iii. | The Information Memorandum continued in respect of the information relied
upon and the accuracy of the findings:

This Analysis was prepared with due diligence on the basis of the public
information as well as information provided by GFT Slovakia s.r.o, GFT
Goldfruct Sp z 0.0. and their shareholders, however, WEA does not
guarantee the accuracy or completeness of the Memorandum, in
particular if the information which constituted the basis for preparing the
Analysis turned out to be inaccurate, incomplete or not fully reflecting
the facts. The information included in the Memorandum was not the
subject of an independent verification or the verification of WEA, in
particular concerning the legal status, geological as well as physical and
chemical tests and in every case, it may be subject to changes and
modifications. °°

I. THE BUILDING PERMIT (OCTOBER 2013 — MAY 2014)

On 30 October 2013, pursuant to the State Spa Committee’s and the district authorities’
previous decisions,** GFT Slovakia (now owned by Muszynianka) applied to the District
Office in PreSov for a building permit.°>

On 30 May 2014, the District Office in PreSov granted GFT Slovakia the permit to build
the water treatment plant, the pipelines connecting it with both the relevant boreholes
and a bottling plant in Poland, and all other related structures (the “Building Permit”).%
Similar to the Zoning Permit,2” the Building Permit approved project documentation
dealing with “the inlet of mineral water from individual existing drills through water pipe
connections to the hall for the mineral water treatment and its consequent transport to
the bottling plant in the Polish Republic”, but stated that the bottling plant was not part of
its scope.°*

Accordingly, the Building Permit’s “[bJinding terms and conditions” required that “relevant
permits must be obtained in line with applicable laws of the Polish Republic”, in order for
GFT Slovakia to carry out the “micro-tunneling of the pipeline under the border river of
Poprad [...] in the territory of the Polish Republic”.°° These terms and conditions further
mandated for GFT Slovakia to submit the Building Permit (upon it “becom[ing] effective”)
to “the State Spa Commission [...] for the purposes of issuing a permit for the use of
natural mineral resources”. '° In addition, the “general provisions” stated that the Building
Permit would “cease to be valid” if “construction” was not “started within two years” of its
effective date. 1°

As in the proceedings culminating with the Zoning Permit, '° the District Office in PreSov
assessed and incorporated into the Building Permit the opinions rendered by various
other relevant authorities. Notably, the State Soa Committee had submitted a statement
agreeing with the issuance of the building permit requested by GFT Slovakia, “provided
that the protection conditions for natural medicinal sources in Legnava are met”.'°3 To
that effect, the State Spa Committee set out a number of measures to be implemented
by GFT Slovakia.'°* The State Soa Committee’s opinion moreover made the following
clarifications:

The Commission also informs the applicant of the fact that this [positive] opinion
does not replace the preliminary issue related to the issue of a permit to exploit
natural mineral sources LH-1, LH-2A, LH-3, LH-4 a LH-5 in Legnava for their
company under paragraph 1 of Decision of the State Spa Commission [...] of
8 February 2012 on the suspension of proceedings/the possibility of extracting and
treating natural mineral water from Legnava sources in Slovakia and transporting the
water by pipeline to Poland to be bottled in consumer packaging at the existing
mineral water bottling plant in Poland, i.e. the matter of the supply pipeline
construction under the Poprad River to Poland — obtaining the relevant permit to
construct the water structure to Poland. '°5

J. EXPLOITATION PERMIT - PHASE III (JULY 2014 SECOND SUPPLEMENT — JANUARY
2015 REJECTION)
On 11 July 2014, pursuant to the Building Permit’s instructions and the State Spa
Committee’s determination in February 2012,'°° GFT Slovakia submitted the Building
Permit to supplement its Exploitation Permit application.”

On 8 October 2014, GFT Slovakia filed a complaint before the Supreme Court of the
Slovak Republic (the “Supreme Court”) against the State Spa Committee, '8 seeking that
the latter (i) be declared in breach of the time limits set out in Article 49 of the Slovak
Administrative Procedure Code (“Administrative Procedure Code” or “APC”);'°9 and,
consequently (ii) be ordered to issue its decision within a month of the Supreme Court’s
ruling.11°

On 9 December 2014, the State Spa Committee reverted to GFT Slovakia, informing it
of a recent amendment to the Constitution of the Slovak Republic prohibiting the cross-
border transport of unbottled water. The State Soa Committee thus invited GFT Slovakia
to state whether it insisted on the original Exploitation Permit application or whether it
intended to amend it. In the former case, the State Soa Committee informed that it would
not be in the position to grant the Exploitation Permit.'"'

On 18 December 2014, GFT Slovakia rejected the State Spa Committee’s invitation to
modify the application and insisted on its original terms. It noted that the transport
infrastructure in the Legnava area was poor and it thus had “no other choice” but to
“bottle the water in consumer containers in the bottling plant in the Republic of Poland”.
It also specified that the “bottled water” would “fully remain” in GFT Slovakia’s
“ownership”. "12

On 26 January 2015, the State Spa Commission therefore denied the Exploitation
Permit.11

K. THE ROAD TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT (MARCH 2012 — DECEMBER
2014)
On 10 March 2012, the Slovak Social Democratic Party (“SMER”) won the national
elections with a historic majority in Parliament (83 out of 150 seats).15 The SMER’s
campaign had been partly based on the “rational utilization and protection of natural
resources” such as water, and the “regulat[ion]” of “relationships with entities using
water”.116

During the same month, prior to GFT Slovakia’s first supplement to the Exploitation
Permit application,"'” the SMER published its Programme Declaration for the 2012-2016
governmental period (“Programme Declaration”).''® The Programme Declaration made
several mentions to hydrological resources in general and water provision and
preservation in particular."

On 24 October 2012, in line with the SMER’s Programme Declaration, the Ministry of
Environment, headed by Minister Peter Ziga, published a report recommending that
legislation should recognize groundwater as a “strategic raw material of the state” (the
“Water Report”).'2°

The Water Report took a preventive approach to ensure water availability for future
generations.'?' Therefore, it called for “any cross-border exploitation” to require the
approval of the Slovak Government, to be “granted on a case-by-case basis”, subject to
the payment of a fee and considering whether the applicant could demonstrate that
drinking water demand in the Slovak Republic would still be satisfied despite the
extraction.’ The Water Report further stressed that groundwater, natural healing
waters, and surface waters, were raw materials of “particular importance” owned by the

State. As such, the Slovak Government would support the “versatile protection” and
“rational exploitation” of water, while “reserv[ing] the right to make decisions on the
disposal, transport and transfers of groundwater resources outside the territory of the
[Slovak Republic] in accordance [with] the public interest of the state”.'23

On the same day, over two months prior to Muszynianka’s acquisition of GFT Slovakia, '74
the Water Report was taken up by the Slovak Cabinet, which issued Resolution 583 of
24 October 2012 (the “Water Resolution” or “Resolution No. 583/2012”).125

In addition to approving the Water Report and declaring water as a “raw material of the
State” subject to its “national interests”,'7° the Water Resolution instructed the Ministry of
Environment, inter alia, to: (i) “amend [the Act on Waters] so that water is defined a
strategic raw material of the State which is subject to the national interests”; and (ii)
“submit to the Government for discussion a proposal for transport or transmission of
groundwater through a State border individually for each request for transport or
transmission, which will specify the conditions and procedure”. '2”

In June 2013, pursuant to the Water Resolution, the Ministry of Environment published
a first draft amendment to the Act on Waters, '78 and submitted it to an “interdepartmental
commenting procedure”, which was also open to private persons. '2

By the time of the closing of such procedure in mid-July 2013,'°° numerous comments
had been submitted by various stakeholders, including multiple Government entities, '°'

industry groups and associations, '*? private companies, '*° private individuals, '* and the
public in general.'%° GFT Slovakia submitted no comments.

On 6 June 2014, after the issuance of GFT Slovakia’s Building Permit, the Slovak
Cabinet introduced a revised draft amendment to the Act on Waters to Parliament for
discussion.'® It incorporated some of the points gathered during the commenting
procedure and maintained (i) the recognition of water as a strategic raw material subject
to the State’s national interests; (ii) the need for each cross-border (transport or
transmission) operation to be approved pursuant to certain conditions established in the
law; and (iii) the requirement for the payment of a fee for the issuance of the permit
allowing such cross-border activities. 137

On 2 July 2014, a first parliamentary session took place to discuss the revised draft
amendment to the Act on Waters. Minister Ziga opened the floor by stating inter alia that
the draft amendment intended to address Slovakia’s regulatory gap regarding the cross-
border transportation of groundwater, whereby the legal framework did not either
“regulate or prohibit” such activity and thus State authorities had no “legal basis to
dismiss or restrict a motion of this type”. '%*

During the debate, some Members of the Parliament (“MPs”) supported the bill from the
outset, agreeing with the objective that underground water needed to be preventively
preserved irrespective of current availability.1°° Others disputed the existence of a
regulatory gap, finding that, in the absence of a specific legal basis providing otherwise,
cross-border transportation of groundwater was in principle prohibited. As the Slovak
Republic already controlled the granting of permits for exploitation and exportation of

water, the proposed amendment to the Act on Waters was said to be unnecessary. '°
Throughout the 2 July 2015 debate,’ as well as in other parliamentary sessions
discussing the regulatory gap on water export,"“? Minister Ziga directly or indirectly
referred to the Legnava Sources, Goldfruct or Muszynianka.

On 8 July 2014, prior to GFT Slovakia supplementing its Exploitation Permit application
with the Building Permit,’ Prime Minister Fico and Minister Ziga announced that some
of the changes sought by the Government through the proposed amendment to the Act
on Waters would instead be pursued through a constitutional amendment." During the
parliamentary session of the same day, Minister Ziga explained that, in the interest of
prohibiting speculation in water resources, the constitutional amendment would consist
of a ban on water exports, which would not apply to water packaged in Slovakia or to
water needed in emergency situations. '45

On 22 August 2014, the Government introduced to Parliament a draft amendment
seeking to supplement Article 4 of the Constitution.'** The amendment sought to
establish a ban on large-scale cross-border water transportation (i.e., exports through
“pipelines, cisterns, tanks, or other water transport means”),'4” with certain exceptions
(i.e., water in consumer packaging, and water needed for personal consumption,
emergency situations and humanitarian aid).'4° For the Government, this “special
protection” was justified on the basis that, given “its sensitive predisposition to
vulnerability, as well as an increasing impact of the climate change and its expected
negative impacts on the environment, waters included, it [was] necessary [for] the State
[to] protec[t], sustai[n] and maintai[n] its water resources as a valuable and irreplaceable
raw material”.149

On 21 October 2014, after debates in Parliament on 10 September and 17 October
2014, 15° the draft constitutional amendment was approved by a qualified majority of 102
over 5 votes (“Constitutional Amendment”’).'*' As a result, the following language was
added to Article 4 of the Slovak Constitution and came into force as of 1 December 2014:

[..-] (2) The transport of water taken from water bodies located in the territory of the

Slovak Republic across the borders of the Slovak Republic by means of transport or

by pipelines is banned; the ban shall not apply to water for personal consumption,

drinking water packaged in consumer packaging in the territory of the Slovak

Republic and natural mineral water packaged in consumer packaging in the territory

of the Slovak Republic, and to provision of humanitarian aid and help in emergency

situations. Details of conditions of transport of water for personal consumption and

water to provide humanitarian aid and help in emergency situations shall be laid

down by law. 52
On 2 December 2014, the Parliament also passed the amendment to the Act on Waters,
which had continued its course through the legislative process in parallel with the
Constitutional Amendment. '*° The amended Act on Waters dealt with those aspects not
settled through the Constitutional Amendment.'* It set out in more detail the exceptions
to the Constitutional Amendment's prohibition of cross-border transportation other than
in consumer packaging, namely, water for personal consumption and for humanitarian

aid or emergency assistance. "55

L. MUSZYNIANKA’S CHALLENGE OF THE STATE SPA COMMITTEE’S DECISION

On 17 February 2015, GFT Slovakia challenged the decision of the State Spa Committee
to deny the Exploitation Permit.'5° On 25 February 2015, after reviewing GFT Slovakia’s
submission, the State Spa Committee saw “no reason to change its decision” and
forwarded the file to the Ministry of Health.157

On 24 September 2015, the Minister of Health rejected GFT Slovakia’s challenge and
confirmed the State Spa Committee’s decision denying the Exploitation Permit.'** The
Minister did so after having extended the deadline to render its decision on 24 March

to revoke the Minister of Health’s and the State Spa Committee’s adverse decisions. '*'

Il OVERVIEW OF THE DISPUTE

83. The Claimant argues that the Constitutional Amendment and the denial of the
Exploitation Permit (together the “Measures”) breached several of the Treaty’s
substantive standards.'® According to the Claimant, the Measures expropriated and
impaired its investment in Slovakia through unreasonable and discriminatory measures,
and also constituted unfair and inequitable treatment.

84. The Respondent disputes the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on several grounds, denies any
breach of the BIT, and argues that there is no causation between the Measures and the
claimed damages. In particular, the Respondent submits that the Constitutional
Amendment is a legitimate exercise of police powers, which precludes liability under
international law. It also argues that the Claimant was not entitled nor could have it

165 The Tribunal notes that, in its Statement of Claim, the Claimant submitted that the amendment to the Act on
Mineral Waters also constituted “an individual breach of Respondent's international obligations under the Treaty”
(SoC, § 410). Yet, throughout this arbitration the Claimant has not attempted to elaborate on how this amendment
independently breaches the BIT. Rather, the Claimant's submissions show that, in its view, it is the Constitutional
Amendment, together with the amendment to the Act on Waters (as a measure that implements the Constitutional
Amendment), that violates the Treaty. Notably, the Claimant refers to both of these State measures, jointly, as “Lex
Muzynianka” or the “Water Ban” (SoC, 4 5). The Tribunal will not adopt the terms “Lex Muzynianka” or “Water Ban”.

However, for the sake of clarity, the Tribunal’s references and findings regarding the Constitutional Amendment
must be understood as also including its legislative implementation, namely, the amendment to the Act on Waters.

legitimately expected to obtain the Exploitation Permit, because its business plan was

illegal.
PROCEDURAL HISTORY
A. INITIATION OF THE ARBITRATION

On 18 August 2016, the Claimant submitted the Notice of Arbitration (the “NoA’),
pursuant to Article 7(2) of the Agreement between the Republic of Poland and the Slovak
Republic on the reciprocal promotion and protection of investments of 18 August 1994 (
“BIT” or “Treaty”), along with Exhibits C-1 to C-34 and Legal Authorities CLA-1 to CLA-
9. In its NoA, the Claimant appointed Mr. Stanimir Alexandrov as its party-appointed
arbitrator.

By letter of 19 September 2016, the Respondent appointed Mr. J. Christopher Thomas
QC as its party-appointed arbitrator.

On 5 September 2016, the Respondent challenged Mr. Alexandrov on the basis of his
past role as counsel for the claimant in the claim advanced against the Slovak Republic
in HICEE v. Slovak Republic.‘

On 20 September 2016, the Claimant opposed the Respondent's challenge to
Mr. Alexandrov.

On the same day, the Respondent wrote to the Claimant on certain procedural matters
raised in the NoA, namely, the applicable version of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules,
the selection of the presiding arbitrator, and the place of arbitration.

On 27 September 2016, the Claimant replied to the Respondent's letter of 20 September
2016.

By separate communications on 20 October 2016 and 21 October 2016, the Parties
wrote to the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (“PCA”) requesting
that he rule on the challenge submitted by the Respondent.

On 14 December 2016, Mr. Alexandrov resigned.

By letter of 19 December 2016, following Mr. Alexandrov’s resignation further to the
Respondent's challenge, the Claimant appointed Prof. Robert G. Volterra as its party-
appointed arbitrator.

On 16 February 2017, the two party-appointed arbitrators informed the Parties that
Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler had been selected pursuant to Article 7(1) of the 1976
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules to act as President of the Tribunal.

By letter of 17 February 2017, Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler confirmed the acceptance of her
appointment as President of the Tribunal and likewise confirmed the constitution of the
Tribunal.

On 27 February 2017, Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler informed the PCA that the Parties had
agreed that the PCA act in an administrative and fund-holding capacity.

On 16 March 2017, the Respondent submitted the Answer to the Notice of Arbitration
(“Answer”), along with Exhibits R-18 to R-34 and legal authorities RLA-17 to RLA-37.

On 12 May 2017, the Tribunal held the first procedural hearing with the Parties by
telephone conference.

On 16 May 2017, the Tribunal adopted the Terms of Appointment (“ToA”) and issued
Procedural Order No. 1, inter alia appointing Mr. Lukas Montoya as Arbitral Secretary
and fixing the procedural calendar setting out two scenarios for bifurcated and non-
bifurcated proceedings.

B. THE WRITTEN PHASE

On 15 September 2017, the Claimant filed the Statement of Claim (“SoC”), along with
Exhibits C-35 to C-142, Legal Authorities CLA-10 to CLA-80, Witness Statements CWS-
1 to CWS-4, and Expert Report CER-1, together with Appendices 1 to 6.

On 10 October 2017, the Tribunal noted that the Respondent had not submitted a
request for bifurcation by 6 October 2017 in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1.
The Tribunal further noted that the proceedings would therefore follow the non-bifurcated
procedural calendar referred to as Scenario 2 in Annex 1 to Procedural Order No. 1.

On 27 November 2017, after considering the Parties’ comments on the matter, the
Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 whereby it determined that the seat of arbitration
shall be Geneva, Switzerland.

RWS-1 and RWS-2, and Expert Reports RER-1 to RER-5.

By letter of 22 January 2018, the Tribunal noted that the SoD did not include a request
for the bifurcation of the proceedings, with the result that the proceedings would continue
in line with the non-bifurcated procedural calendar set out in Scenario 2 in Annex 1 to
Procedural Order No. 1.

On 26 January 2018, the Respondent sought to admit into the record corrected versions
of its Statement of Defense, List of Documents, and Expert Report RER-3. On
29 January 2018, the Tribunal invited the Parties’ comments on the Respondent’s
request. After considering the Parties’ comments, the Tribunal decided on 14 February
2018 to admit the corrected versions into the record.

On 30 March 2018, the Respondent requested the bifurcation of the proceedings on the
basis of the judgment rendered by the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”)
in the Slovak Republic v. Achmea B.V. case (“Achmea’ or “Achmea Judgment’).

On 10 April 2018, the Claimant submitted its answer to the Respondent's bifurcation
request.

On 17 April 2018, the Respondent replied to the Claimant’s answer on bifurcation.
On 20 April 2018, the Claimant submitted its rejoinder on bifurcation.

On 1 May 2018, the Tribunal denied the Respondent’s request for bifurcation and revised
the Procedural Calendar.

Between 16 February and 30 March 2018, the Parties exchanged their respective
requests, objections and replies on document production.

On 16 May 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 on document production,
directing the Parties to produce the documents responsive to requests that had been
fully or partially granted, and inviting the Parties to set out any objections they may have
in respect of documents for which privilege or confidentiality were invoked.

On 5 June 2018, the Claimant submitted certain objections to the Respondent's
document production on the basis of privilege and confidentiality, as well as other

document production issues. The Respondent responded to these objections on 13 June
2018.

On 27 June 2018, the Tribunal ruled on the Claimant's objections to the Respondent's
privilege log and other document production issues unrelated to privilege or
confidentiality.

On 20 July 2018, the Claimant filed the Reply on Jurisdiction, Merits and Quantum
(‘Reply’), along with supplements to Exhibits C-18, C-22, C-87, and Exhibits C-143 to C-
181, Legal Authorities CLA-81 to CLA-129, Witness Statements CWS-5 to CWS-7, and
Expert Reports CER-2 to CER-6 together with their accompanying exhibits.

On 11 October 2018, the European Commission (“EU Commission”) filed an application
for leave to intervene as a Non-Disputing Third Person (“NDTP”) or Amicus Curiae in
these proceedings, with respect to the legal consequences of Achmea in the present
case.

On 31 October 2018, the Respondent submitted its comments and observations on the
EU Commission’s application to intervene as a NDTP, along with Legal Authorities RLA-
109 to RLA-117. On the same date, the Claimant submitted its comments and
observations on the same, along with Exhibit C-182 and Legal Authorities CLA-130 to
CLA-141.

On 21 November 2018, the Respondent filed the Rejoinder (“Rejoinder”), along with
Exhibits R-199 to R-414, Legal Authorities RLA-118 to RLA-167, Witness Statements
RWS-3 and RWS-4, and Expert Reports RER-6 to RER-11.

On 27 November 2018, the Tribunal granted leave to the EU Commission to participate
as a NTDP and therefore to file an amicus curiae brief on the legal consequences of
Achmea in these proceedings.

On 14 December 2018, the EU Commission filed its amicus curiae brief, along with
Annexes EC-1 to EC-30.

On 14 January 2019, the Claimant requested the inclusion of additional exhibits into the
record, namely Exhibits C-183 and C-184.

On 15 January 2019, the Parties filed their comments on the EU Commission’s amicus
curiae brief. The Claimant submitted Legal Authorities CLA-142 to CLA-162 along with
its comments.

of Exhibits C-183 and C-184 into the record.

On 17 January 2019, the Respondent requested further clarification from the Claimant
regarding Exhibit C-185.

On 17 January 2019, the Tribunal denied the inclusion of Exhibit C-184 into the record
but allowed Exhibit C-183 to become part of the record.

On 19 January 2019, further to clarifications provided by the Claimant regarding Exhibit
C-185, the Respondent agreed that the said Exhibit become part of the record.

c. THE ORAL PHASE

On 2 July 2018, the Tribunal fixed the Peace Palace at The Hague, the Netherlands as
the venue for the Hearing scheduled between 21 and 25 January 2019.

On 3 December 2018, following the Pre-Hearing Telephone Conference held on
29 November 2018 between the Parties and the Tribunal, the Tribunal issued Procedural

D. THE POST-HEARING PHASE

On 4 February 2019, the Tribunal issued the Procedural Order No. 5 on post-Hearing
matters.

On 17 April 2019, further to the Tribunal’s decision at the Hearing to admit into the record
the declarations issued by various EU Member States on 15-16 January 2019 regarding
the legal consequences of the Achmea Judgment on investment protection in the
European Union (the “Achmea Declarations”), the Respondent filed inter alia Exhibits R-

415 (the “Main Achmea Declaration” of 15 January 2019, executed by 22 EU Member
States including Slovakia and Poland), and R-416 (the “Secondary Achmea Declaration”
of 16 January 2019, executed by Finland, Luxembourg, Malta, Slovenia and Sweden).

On 25 April 2019, the Respondent submitted an application requesting the production of
a report issued by Deloitte in the context of GFT Slovakia’s sale by Goldfruct to
Muszynianka (“Deloitte Report’).

On 29 April 2019, the Claimant objected to the Respondent’s request for the production
of the Deloitte Report.

On 8 May 2019, the Respondent replied to the Claimant’s objection regarding the
production of the Deloitte Report

By letter of 13 May 2019, the Tribunal rejected the Respondent’s application for the
production of the Deloitte Report.

On 13 May 2019, the Claimant submitted its first Post-Hearing Brief (“C-PHB”) along with
Legal Authorities CLA-163 to CLA-170. On the same day, the Respondent filed its first
Post-Hearing Brief ( “R-PHB”), along with Exhibits R-42, R-220, and R-415 to R-419, and
Legal Authorities RLA-168 to RLA 169.

On 3 June 2019, the Claimant and the Respondent each filed their reply Post-Hearing
Brief on the Achmea Declarations (“C-PHB 2” and “R-PHB 2”, respectively).

On 24 June 2019, the Claimant and the Respondent each submitted their costs
statements (“C-Statement on Costs” and “R-Statement on Costs”, respectively).

On 4 July 2019, the Claimant and the Respondent each submitted their reply to the other
Party’s costs statement (“C-Reply on Costs” and “R-Reply on Costs”, respectively).

On 3 and 9 September 2019, the Parties submitted updated cost statements.

On 2 March 2020, the Tribunal received a communication by Ms. Joanna Bek, an official
of the Ministry of Economic Development of the Republic of Poland (“Ms. Bek’s
Communication”). Ms. Bek’s Communication attached, allegedly upon the request of the
Slovak Republic, the following documents:

i. The Main Achmea Declaration.

43

143.

144.

145.

146.

ii. A Note Verbale, dated 8 November 2019, issued by the Embassy of the
Slovak Republic in Warsaw and addressed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
of the Republic of Poland (the “Slovak Note Verbale’).

ii. | A Note Verbale, dated 24 January 2020, issued by the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs of the Republic of Poland to the Embassy of the Slovak Republic in
Warsaw (the “Polish Note Verbale”; together with the Slovak Note Verbale,
the “Notes Verbales’).

On 4 March 2020, the Tribunal invited the Parties to comment on (i) the admissibility and
(ii) the substance and effects of Ms. Bek’s Communication, in particular of the attached
Notes Verbales. To that effect, the Tribunal scheduled two rounds of submissions.

On 5 and 9 March 2020, the Parties exchanged submissions regarding a request by the
Claimant that the Tribunal (i) confirm that the Claimant was entitled to request document
production with respect to Ms. Bek’s Communication and the Notes Verbales; and (ii)
order the Respondent to produce documents to be indicated in further submissions.

On 13 March 2020, the Tribunal determined that it was not in a position to make a
meaningful determination on the Claimant's document production request without
knowing the content and scope of such request. The Tribunal therefore adjusted the
timetable established on 4 March 2020, with which the Parties complied, as follows:

i. On 18 March 2020, the Respondent filed its comments on Ms. Bek’s
Communication and the Notes Verbales (“Comments NV”);

ii. On 1 April 2020, the Claimant filed its response and requests for document
production (“Response NV”);

iii. | On 9 April 2020, the Respondents filed its reply and objections to document
production (“Reply NV”);

iv. On 20 April 2020, the Claimant filed its rejoinder and replies on document
production (“Rejoinder NV”).

On 30 April 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6, whereby it (i) declared the
Notes Verbales admissible and part of the record; (ii) reserved its decision on the
characterization and legal effects of the Notes Verbales on its jurisdiction for this Award;
and (iii) denied the Claimant’s document production requests concerning the Notes
Verbales.

On 5 May 2020, 23 EU Member States, including the Slovak Republic and the Republic
of Poland, signed the “Agreement for the Termination of Bilateral Investment Treaties
Between the Member States of the European Union” (the “Termination Agreement’).

On 12 May 2020, the Tribunal considered it appropriate to hear the Parties on the
significance and effects of the Termination Agreement on its jurisdiction. Therefore, it
gave the Parties an opportunity to file simultaneous submissions to that effect by 29 May
2020.

On 13 May 2020, the Respondent requested leave to admit into the record a decision by
the Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic confirming the decision by the Regional Court
in Bratislava that had upheld the State Spa Committee’s denial of the Exploitation
Permit. 1°”

On 26 May 2020, the Claimant objected to the Respondent's request to introduce the
Supreme Court’s decision into the record.

On 28 May 2020, the Tribunal allowed the Supreme Court’s decision to be introduced
into the record. It recalled being aware from the Parties’ main submissions in this
arbitration that GFT Slovakia was pursuing a challenge before the Supreme Court
against the decision of the Regional Court in Bratislava.'®® Therefore, introducing the
Supreme Court's decision in the record would complete the factual matrix of the dispute.
The decision was introduced as Exhibit R-420.

On the same day, further to a request by the Respondent not opposed by the Claimant,
the Tribunal granted an extension for the Parties to file their submissions on the
Termination Agreement by 3 June 2020.

On 3 June 2020, the Claimant and the Respondent each filed their submission on the
Termination Agreement (“CTA” and “RTA” respectively). The Claimant submitted Legal
Authorities CLA-171 to CLA-179 along with its CTA and the Respondent submitted RLA-
170 with the RTA.

On 29 June, 10 July, and 2 and 9 September 2020, the Parties submitted updated cost
statements.

V. PRAYERS FOR RELIEF

A. THE CLAIMANT

155. In its C-PHB, the Claimant requests the Tribunal to:

DECLARE that:

(ii)

(ii)

B. THE RESPONDENT

156. In its SoD and its Rejoinder, the Respondent requests:

(a)

a declaration dismissing Muszynianka’s claims;

169 C-PHB, 9/415.

46

157.

Vi.

158.

159.

(b) an order that Muszynianka pay the costs of these arbitral proceedings,
including the cost of the Arbitral Tribunal and the legal and other costs incurred
by the Slovak Republic, on a full indemnity basis; and

(c) _ interest on any costs awarded to the Slovak Republic, in an amount to be
determined by the Tribunal. 17°

In its R-PHB, the Respondent repeated its requests in a different form:

Muszynianka has failed to carry its burden to overcome even one of the four hurdles
it must clear before it can recover anything from the Slovak Republic: no jurisdiction;
no breach; no causation; and no damages. For the foregoing reasons, and those set
forth in its prior submissions (all incorporated herein by reference), the Slovak
Republic respectfully requests that the Tribunal reject Muszynianka’s case in its
entirety and award the full costs of the proceeding to the Slovak Republic. '7'

APPLICABLE LAW
A. LAW GOVERNING THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS

This proceeding is a treaty-based investment arbitration seated in Geneva, and
conducted under the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (“UNCITRAL Rules”). It is thus
primarily governed by any procedural rules contained in the Treaty, the /ex arbitri, i.e.,
Chapter 12 of the Swiss Private International Law Act (“PILA”), and the UNCITRAL
Rules. Section 45 of the Terms of Appointment lists the relevant sets of rules in their
order of priority:

The mandatory rules of the law on international arbitration applicable at the seat of

the arbitration;

The 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, save where modified by these Terms of
Appointment or the procedural rules issued by the Tribunal (as will be reflected in
Procedural Order No. 1, and any amendments thereof);

These Terms of Appointment and the procedural rules issued by the Tribunal, as will
be reflected in Procedural Order No. 1 and any amendments thereof. '72

B. LAW GOVERNING JURISDICTION

The Tribunal’s jurisdiction derives from a treaty and is thus governed by international
law, first and foremost by the BIT, which must be interpreted by application of Articles 31
to 33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the “VCLT”).'”? The Republic of
Poland and the Slovak Republic have been parties to the VCLT since 1990 and 1993,
respectively. In any event, the VCLT’s rules on treaty interpretation are widely considered
to reflect the rules of customary international law on treaty interpretation. The national

164.

laws of the Contracting Parties to the BIT may also be relevant in respect of certain
issues, in particular if a jurisdictional requirement in the BIT contains a reference to
national law'” or uses a term that can be understood only by reference to national law.

The arbitration is seated in Switzerland and therefore Articles 177 and 178 of the PILA
are also applicable to the validity of the arbitration agreement and thus to the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction. The determination of the law governing jurisdiction just set out is in line with
Article 178 of the PILA. As to its form, there is no question that the arbitration agreement
is in writing under Article 178(1) of the PILA. As to the law governing the substantive
validity of the arbitration agreement, that determination is at least in conformity with the
second option of Article 178(2) of the PILA (the law governing the merits). It should finally
be specified that contracting States consent to jurisdiction when concluding the treaty
and the investor consents when it initiates an arbitration under the treaty.

A particular question arises in connection with the applicability of EU law in matters of
jurisdiction, which is discussed in the analysis below. ‘75
Cc. LAW GOVERNING THE MERITS

Article 7(3) of the BIT contains the following choice of law clause:

The arbitration award shall be based on:
- the provisions of this Agreement;

the national law of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was
made, including the rules relative to conflict of laws;

the rules and the universally accepted principles of international law.

The Tribunal will revert to the issue of governing law in its analysis. '”°

D. IURA NOVIT CURIA

When applying the governing law, be it in the context of jurisdiction, admissibility, or
merits, the Tribunal is not bound by the arguments and sources invoked by the Parties.
Under the maxim jura novit curia-or more accurately iura novit arbiter-the Tribunal is
required to apply the law of its own motion, provided it seeks the Parties’ views if it

intends to base its decision on a legal theory that was not addressed by the Parties and
that the Parties could not reasonably anticipate. '””

In this context, Section 44 of the Terms of Appointment must also be noted:

The Parties shall establish the content of the applicable law, being understood that
the Tribunal may, but is not required to, make its own inquiries into the content of the
applicable law.

E. THE RELEVANCE OF PRIOR DECISIONS

The Tribunal notes that the Parties have referred to a large number of awards of
investment tribunals and other decisions dealing with international law. In this regard, the
Tribunal considers that it is not bound by prior decisions. At the same time, it finds that it
should give due consideration to earlier decisions of international courts and tribunals.
More specifically, it is of the view that, subject to compelling contrary grounds, it should
follow legal principles applied in a consistent line of cases, provided of course it gives
due regard to the applicable BIT and to the specifics of the particular case. The Tribunal
adopts this approach with a view to promoting legal certainty and the rule of law.

As is set out in his dissenting opinion, Arbitrator Volterra is in strong disagreement with
the views expressed in the preceding paragraph as a matter of principle under public
international law. For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal clarifies that it has reached its
own conclusions on the basis of the record without in any way considering that it is bound
by prior decisions. This said, the Tribunal has cited prior awards in the spirit of the
preceding paragraph and because it is often informative and helpful to consider how
other tribunals have considered identical or similar issues, not to speak of the fact that
the Parties have often drawn the Tribunal’s attention to these decisions.

JURISDICTION

The Respondent challenges the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on three grounds: the BIT is
incompatible with EU law and therefore inoperable (A); the Claimant has made no
investment pursuant to Article 1(2) of the BIT (B); and the Claimant's alleged investment
is in any event illegal and thus not protected by the BIT(C).

172.

173.

By contrast, it is undisputed that the Claimant is an investor in accordance with
Article 1(1) of the BIT.'78 There is no controversy either on the fulfillment of pre-arbitration
conditions. In the exercise of its ex officio power to assess its treaty-based jurisdiction,
the Tribunal shares the Parties’ views that these other requirements are all met.

Insofar as necessary, the Parties’ positions are summarized prior to the Tribunal’s
analysis, where the latter may also consider additional arguments of the Parties. The
Tribunal has considered all the Parties’ submissions, even when a particular allegation
or argument is not expressly referred to in this Award.

A. INTRA-EU OBJECTION
1. | The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that, as a result of Slovakia’s accession to the EU on 1 May
2004 and it becoming a party to the Treaty on European Union (“TEU”) and the TFEU
(together, the “EU Treaties”), the BIT, being an earlier treaty, became immediately
inoperable. 179

The following sections set out the Respondent's position in more detail.

a. The BIT and the EU Treaties share the same subject matter

According to the Respondent, the BIT and the EU Treaties share the same subject
matter. '®° EU law has created a Single Market within which investors and investments
from other EU Member States enjoy a vast array of rights, such as freedom of movement
of goods, services, capital, and persons within the EU. '*! Hence, EU law, just as the BIT,
promotes and protects economic cooperation and “favorable conditions for investments
by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party”.'®? In
addition, the EU Treaties and the BIT both address “the manner of resolution of disputes
between EU Member States, on the one hand, and investors from the other EU Member
States, on the other”.

178 SoC, 9] 365-368; BIT, C-1, Art. 1(1)(b) (‘The term ‘investor’ refers with regard to either Contracting Party to: [...]
legal entities, including i i business iatic and other izatic which are
constituted or otherwise duly organized under the law of that Contracting Party and have their seat, together with
real economic activities, in the territory of that same Contracting Party”).

183 Rejoinder, § 110.

175.

b. The BIT and the EU Treaties are incompatible

For the Respondent, “a fundamental incompatibility exists between the substantive
protections invoked by Muszynianka under the BIT and the overlapping (but not
coextensive) protections granted under EU law in the same sphere of economic
activity”."** This incompatibility affects the dispute resolution provision in the BIT.1%
Therefore, Slovakia’s offer to arbitrate under Article 7 of the BIT, “as well as more
generally the Contracting States’ conferral of rights on third-party beneficiaries”, have
become inoperative, thus precluding the Tribunal from accepting jurisdiction over the
present dispute. '°

In order to establish the incompatibility between the BIT and the EU Treaties, the
Respondent refers to various rules of the VCLT and EU law.'®’ It first submits that the
BIT has become inoperable by virtue of Article 59(1)(b) of the VCLT,'®® under which a
treaty is implicitly terminated “if there is incompatibility between the provisions of the
earlier and the later treaty, which makes it impossible to apply both treaties
simultaneously”. '® In this regard, Article 7 of the BIT is fully incompatible with Articles 18,
267, and 344 of the TFEU, as well as Article 4(3) of the TEU." In particular:

i. Article 344 of the TFEU intends to preserve the autonomy of the EU legal
system by ensuring that questions involving “the interpretation and
application of EU law are only adjudicated by the competent European court
and not by private arbitral tribunals." It does not cover only disputes
between EU Member States, but also disputes between EU Member States
and private parties from other EU Member States. '? EU law is central to the
present case and its adjudication by this Tribunal would impermissibly
deprive the CJEU of its judicial competence, creating a risk for the autonomy
of the EU legal system.'?

ii. Article 267 of the TFEU protects the autonomy of EU law through the
significant role assigned to the domestic courts of the EU Member States,
which can or must request preliminary rulings from the CJEU on matters of
EU law;'% a prerogative that arbitral tribunals lack.'®> While an EU national
court, when faced with an annulment or enforcement request, could seek a
preliminary ruling from the CJEU, this would not suffice to ensure the
effectiveness of EU law as the scope of judicial review is narrow.'°° This is
even more so in the present case, where the seat of the arbitration is not
within the EU.'”

iii. | The consent of the Contracting Parties to the BIT to arbitrate disputes with
one another's nationals, but not other EU nationals, breaches the prohibition
of discrimination in Article 18(1) of the TFEU. '%

iv. Investor-State arbitration is born “from a fundamental mistrust of the other
State’s judicial system”, which runs contrary to the principle of mutual trust
enshrined in Article 4(3) of the TEU. '%°

176. The Respondent adds that the BIT is incompatible with EU law by virtue of Article 30(3)
of the VCLT, pursuant to which the later treaty takes priority over the earlier one if (i) “the
parties to the earlier treaty and later treaty are not the same, but there are State parties
to both treaties; (ii) the two treaties relate to the same subject matter; and (ii) there is an
incompatibility between the provisions of the two treaties”.2°° Unlike Article 59(1)(b) of
the VCLT, which applies in cases of “broader incompatibility” between an earlier and
later treaty, Article 30(3) of the VCLT is triggered by the “slightest incompatibility”.2°"
Pursuant to the CJEU in Achmea, “Article 7 of the Poland-Slovak Republic BIT is
incompatible with [...] Article 4(3) of the TEU and Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU”.02

The Claimant's reliance on intra-EU arbitral awards to the contrary is inapposite, as
Achmea has authoritatively lifted any ambiguity.?°°

177. An incompatibility also exists under Article 30(3) of the VCLT between the substantive
protections of the BIT and “the overlapping (but not coextensive) protections granted
under EU law in the same sphere of economic activity”. Although Achmea did not rule
on the incompatibility of substantive provisions, “it is clear that the same result [...] would
follow under both EU law and the VCLT with respect to those provisions, too”.2°5

c. The Achmea Judgment confirmed the incompatibility and binds
the Tribunal
178. According to the Respondent, the CJEU has the final authority to adjudicate on questions
of compatibility between EU law and international treaties of EU Member States by virtue
of Article 19 of the TEU and CJEU case law.?°° Accordingly, Achmea is binding on the
Tribunal:

i. EU law is “unambiguously part of international law’ and therefore is the
applicable law in this arbitration according to Article 7(3) of the BIT.2°”

ii. EU law is part of the Slovak legal order.?°° Hence, it is equally part of the
governing law as mandated by Article 7(3) of the BIT.2°

iii. | EU lawis also relevant pursuant to Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT, according to
which the BIT’s interpretation shall take into account rules of international law
applicable between the parties, EU law constituting such rules.?"°

This is not a dispute where one could argue that EU law does not apply. To
the contrary, the illegality of the Claimant’s business plans requires an
interpretation of EU law.?"!

The Claimant errs when suggesting that “while Slovak law and EU law are
inapplicable, Swiss law is somehow applicable”.?'? Not only is this argument
novel and contrary to earlier submissions, but it is also unsupported.?"? The
Claimant merely invokes the section of the Terms of Appointment on
“applicable procedural rules”, which is irrelevant for purposes of substantive
law.2'* The pertinent section of the Terms of Appointment on “applicable
substantive law” precisely cites Article 7(3) of the BIT.*'5 Still, even if Swiss
law governs the issue (quod non), the VCLT is an integral part of Swiss law
and international public policy resulting from the VCLT forms a basis of Swiss
mandatory law.*'® Moreover, Articles 18, 267, and 344 of the TFEU and
Article 4(3) of the TEU would have to be taken into account as foreign
mandatory rules under the rules of public policy.?'”

The Tribunal has a “fundamental duty” to avoid issuing an annullable and
unenforceable award, and any award not in accord with Achmea would
breach that standard.?'® Any set-aside proceedings before the Swiss courts
will consider the Tribunal’s jurisdiction by reference to EU law and
international law.?"? Therefore, “[i]Jf a Swiss court applies Swiss law to this
question, then it must [...] apply the VCLT as part of the Swiss legal system,
which would lead to the conclusion that the arbitration clause is invalid”.?°
The same considerations are applicable if EU public policy is considered.”

179. In short, it is the Respondent's submission that Article 7 of the BIT is invalid, as now
confirmed by the CJEU.”” Achmea, which is in line with the CJEU’s previous case law,
gives an interpretation of what EU law has “always meant”.?*? It follows that the
Respondent's offer to arbitrate was rendered incompatible with EU law on the date of
the Slovak Republic’s and Poland’s accession to the EU.?%

180. Similarly, the Claimant could not have any legitimate expectations post-accession that
the BIT’s arbitration agreement was valid, assuming (quod non) that expectations could
be relevant at all.?25 In this context, it bears observing that a number of EU Member
States terminated their intra-EU investment treaties consensually, including the sunset
clauses therein.??° There has been no suggestion that this consensual conduct was
legally invalid.?2” If no vested rights of third parties were implicated in that scenario, then

none would be involved here.”

d. Subsequent practice and agreements

181. For the Respondent, having regard to Article 31(3) of the VCLT, the subsequent
agreements and practice of Slovakia and Poland show that the BIT is inoperable.?°°

182. The two states have publicly stated that the BIT is incompatible with EU law. Slovakia
did so in the Achmea proceedings and Poland noted its position in communications with
the Slovak Republic, in its motion to reopen Achmea supporting the Slovak Republic’s
position, and in specialized press reports.?°° These converging “unilateral statements”
constitute “subsequent conduct”.231

This conduct is reinforced by the Achmea Declarations, endorsed by both Poland and
Slovakia.**? As the Achmea Declarations constitute a “subsequent agreement” between
the Contracting Parties to the BIT under Article 31(3) VCLT, the Tribunal must consider
that the intra-EU arbitration clauses in BITs are “contrary to Union law and thus
inapplicable”.*°> The fact that the Achmea Declarations were not signed “in connection”
with the BIT but rather “in relation” to Achmea misses the point,?** as the “in connection
with” requirement “appears not in Article 31(3)(a) [...] but, rather, in Article 31(2)(a)” of
the VCLT.?*5 A subsequent agreement within the meaning of Article 31(3)(a) of the VCLT
is not limited to the interpretation of the BIT and may concern “the interpretation of the
treaty or the application of its provisions”.?°° Here, Slovakia and Poland, through the
Achmea Declarations, have expressed their shared understanding about the
“application” of the BIT.?°”

Accordingly, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal must take into account the
Achmea Declarations “with respect to at least two matters”: (i) “the interpretation of
Article 7(3) of the BIT, including matters such as the existence of a conflict and/or overlap
between the provisions of the BIT and the constitutional EU law treaties also binding on
the Slovak Republic and Poland”; and (ii) “the application of Article 7(3) of the BIT, in
light of provisions of the VCLT like Articles 30 and 59 governing the relationship between
the various treaties to which the Slovak Republic and Poland belong”.”°

According to the Respondent, the Notes Verbales exchanged between the Slovak and
Polish Governments confirm the shared understanding to “implement” the Main Achmea
Declaration.?°° The Notes Verbales jointly declare that, pursuant to Article 30(3) of the
VCTL, Article 7 of the BIT is not applicable from 1 May 2004 onwards given its

incompatibility with the EU Treaties, as confirmed in the Achmea Judgment.” They
further state that this joint “declaration is to be regarded as a subsequent agreement
between the Parties to the treaty regarding the interpretation of the treaty and the
application of its provisions under Article 31(3)(a) of the [VCLT]”.*4' Therefore, the
Respondent submits that the Notes Verbales are an “authoritative interpretation of the
application of the BIT”, as they “need not be limited to authoritatively interpreting the
BIT, but may extend to its application”.2“? The Respondent notes that Slovakia and
Poland did not “amend the meaning of any article of the BIT”, but rather “interpreted the
legal status of the application of the BIT in view of supervening legal develooments—
namely, both States Party's accession to the EU in May 2004”.244

e. The Termination Agreement

186. The Respondent puts forward three main reasons why the Termination Agreement is
relevant to the Tribunal’s decision.

187. First, like the Main Achmea Declaration and the Notes Verbales, the Termination
Agreement is a subsequent agreement between the Contracting Parties to the BIT within
the meaning of Article 31(3)(a) of the VCLT that subscribes the inapplicability of Article 7
of the BIT, given its incompatibility with EU law since 1 May 2004.45 According to the
Respondent, upon Slovakia’s and Poland’s accession to the EU it became clear that the
“place for resolving intra-EU investment disputes is the EU legal order” only, i.e., EU
national courts.?“° In this regard, the Respondent notes that Muszynianka pursued claims
before the Slovak courts.”4”

188. Second, upon entering into force, the Termination Agreement will terminate the BIT with
immediate albeit “prospective effect”,*4* and will form part of the law applicable in these
proceedings be it as international or Slovak law.?4° In this context, the Respondent
stresses that, because Article 7 of the BIT has been inoperable since May 2004 and the

Termination Agreement applies prospectively, “[n]o concerns of retroactivity arise”.?°°
This is all the more true considering that, pursuant to Article 28 of the VCLT, the “non-
retroactivity of treaties does not apply” where “a different intention appears from the
treaty”, as is the case with the Termination Agreement.?*'

Third, even assuming that the Claimant can establish that the Tribunal has jurisdiction
and that the Slovak Republic has breached the BIT, quod non, the termination of the BIT
will put an end to its effects, including any protection it might have granted to the Polish
investors.*5? Subsequent to the BIT’s termination, no breach can occur and, in the
absence of breach, no damage can be claimed.”°° Therefore, the Respondent contends
that Muszynianka could at most claim damages up to the termination of the BIT.

2. The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant seeks to refute the Respondent's position®®> and submits that the BIT was
in force at the time of its breach by the Respondent, with the result that the Tribunal has
jurisdiction ratione temporis to decide on its claims.°°

According to the Claimant, the BIT is exclusively governed by public international law
and hence by the rules of the VCLT.?9” International law thus governs the validity of the
arbitration agreement under Article 178(2) of the PILA.75°

In this context, the Claimant argues that legal certainty demands that the consent to
arbitrate disputes must be formally withdrawn or invalidated in accordance with the BIT
and the VCLT.?° Under Article 42 of the VCLT, the Respondent is precluded from
invoking any grounds affecting the applicability of the BIT, unless the VCLT or the BIT
so permits.?© In this vein, there is no evidence that the BIT has been terminated pursuant

to its Article 13(1).26" No formal step was taken in the form of a notification to terminate
the BIT under Article 65 of the VCLT either. Thus, the BIT enjoys a presumption of
continued validity under Article 42(2) of the VCLT.?® Additionally, there can be no
invalidation of consent on the basis of Article 46(1) of the VCLT for manifest disregard of
internal law related to the competence to conclude treaties, as any alleged incompatibility
with between the BIT and EU law would not be manifest.” But even then, a termination
would have to comply with Articles 65 to 67 the VCLT, which is not the case here.?°

Furthermore, the Claimant argues that the Respondent “continues to struggle with proper
legal qualification of the objection as based on either EU Treaty, Article 30 of the VCLT
or Article 59 of the VCLT”.® Be this as it may, these provisions are only relevant when
the later treaty covers the same subject matter as the earlier one, which is not the
case.” Moreover, there is no inconsistency between the “obligations under the [BIT]
and [EU Treaties], including those with respect to dispute settlement mechanism”,”© nor
a common intent of the Contracting Parties to terminate the BIT.?°° Finally, contrary to
the Respondent's position, this Tribunal is not bound by the recent judgment of the CUEU
in Achmea, which constitutes a “new development” in this case,?”° and there is no
subsequent conduct of the Contracting Parties in the form of practice or agreements that
would have terminated the BIT or rendered it inapplicable. 2”!

For all these reasons, the Respondent's contention that Article 7 of the BIT is inoperable
must fail.27
a. The BIT and the EU Treaties do not share the same subject matter

The Claimant submits that the Slovak Republic has failed to show that the BIT and the
EU Treaties have the “same subject matter” in accordance with Articles 31 and 59 of the

VCLT, i.e., to show that “their object is identical and presents a comparable degree of
generality’.?”° For the Claimant, the “TFEU does not provide for substantive obligations
comparable to the Treaty and does not provide for effective or adequate international
remedy against violations of those obligations”.?”* The Claimant relies on a number of
awards in support of its position.?”°

b. The BIT and the EU Treaties are not incompatible

196. According to the Claimant, the Respondent has failed to substantiate that the BIT and
the EU Treaties are incompatible.?”° There is no inconsistency between the obligations
existing under the BIT and under the EU Treaties, including the obligation related to
dispute settlement.?”” Here again, the Claimant refers to prior awards of investment
treaty arbitrations to substantiate its arguments.?”°

197. The Claimant acknowledges that Achmea came to a different conclusion particularly with
respect to the CJEU’s alleged monopoly over EU law. However, it points out that the
Achmea Judgment did so without providing insight as to the alleged uniqueness of an
arbitration agreement concluded by the acceptance of a standing offer in a BIT compared
to arbitration agreements in a commercial contract potentially involving the interpretation
of EU law.?”° Notably, even the European Court of Human Rights “took liberty to implicitly
elaborate on consistency of EU law with the European Convention on Human Rights in
disputes between individuals and EU Member States, not to mention numerous
arbitration tribunals in commercial disputes”. It follows that, although the BIT provides

for an additional remedy for the “breach of substantive standards which may correlate to
fundamental freedoms of the EU Internal Market”, such remedy does not contradict the
“unique role” of the CJEU in applying and interpreting EU law.”®' This is particularly so
as there exists “no rule of EU law that prohibits investor-State arbitration”.?62

c. The Achmea Judgment is not binding on this Tribunal

198. According to the Claimant, it is a well-established principle of international law that
jurisdiction is assessed as of the date on which the act instituting proceedings was
filed.283 Achmea is a new development occurring after the initiation of this arbitration and
as a result does not affect the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.2* Yet even if Achmea applied ex
tunc in the EU legal order, that rule would only govern in the courts of the EU Member
States.” Moreover, the multiplicity of awards denying the intra-EU BIT objection allowed
the Claimant to “legitimately assume that the binding nature of the Treaty would be
unquestionable”. 286

199. In any event, the Tribunal is not bound by Achmea for the following main reasons:

i. While Achmea may have some impact on the EU Member States, it has no
effect on the validity of the BIT under international law as the Achmea
Judgment makes no reference at all to the VCLT.”8” This a consequence of

the CJEU’s limited jurisdiction, which cannot decide on the termination of an
international agreement concluded between the Member States.”

The Tribunal is not part of the EU judicial system. Therefore, any obligation
under EU law to follow the interpretation of the CUEU does not extend to the
Tribunal, more so considering that its seat is located in a third State.76° For
the same reason, Swiss courts “controlling the prospective award will not be
bound by [Achmea] either”.”°° In short, “the Tribunal is the sole guardian of
its competence including the validity of the arbitration agreement concluded
between the Claimant and the Respondent”.2*

Irrespective of the “threats” by the Respondent concerning enforcement, a
prospective award is capable of creating international legal effects, including
the obligation on the part of the Slovak Republic to pay compensation and
comply with other orders issued by the Tribunal.?°* Given that the
Respondent is not a “State failing to observe basic principles of rule of law,
the Tribunal should not assume the Respondent's failure to observe the
abovementioned obligations”.”°? The fact that the forthcoming award may be
challenged in set aside proceedings does not change these
considerations.

d. No subsequent practice or agreement

200. The Claimant disputes that the subsequent conduct of Poland and Slovakia has rendered
the BIT inoperative.2°° There was no intent of termination, either express or implied,
under Article 59(1)(a) of the VCLT.7%6

201. First, Poland’s motion to reopen the Achmea proceedings before the CJEU cannot
qualify as “subsequent practice” under Article 31(3)(b) of the VCLT as it was a position
taken in legal proceedings. 79”

202. Second, Poland's diplomatic note on the proposal to initiate negotiations on the mutual
termination of the BIT does not constitute a “subsequent agreement” to that effect under
Article 31(3)(a).7%8 Indeed, the note indicates that the BIT has not been terminated and
merely states an intent to negotiate.”°

203. Third, according to the Claimant the Achmea Declarations are not a “subsequent
agreement” under Article 31(3)(a) of the VCLT, as they were signed in relation to Achmea
and not to the BIT.°° More specifically, the Claimant’s argument is threefold.

i. Having been signed two years after the initiation of this arbitration, the
Achmea Declarations have no effect on the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.°*'
Slovakia’s consent was perfected on 18 August 2016 and cannot be
withdrawn unilaterally.°° It created vested rights which are protected under
international and EU law. °° The Declarations only create obligations pro
futuro, expressing the “inten[t] to terminate” intra-EU BITs.°% They do not
state that such BITs are “invalid or non-existent’, only that they are
incompatible with EU law.°°° No EU Member State considers that its intra-
EU BITs have automatically been terminated by virtue of either the Achmea
Judgment or the Achmea Declarations.°°°

ii. The Achmea Declarations do not constitute a subsequent agreement
regarding the interpretation of the BIT as provided in Article 31(3)(a) of the
VCLT.%°” They do not interpret the BIT; they “reflect” only upon the
interpretation of EU law by the CJEU.%® Moreover, the purpose of
Article 31(3)(a) of the VCLT “relates to the specific question as to whether an
understanding reached during the negotiations concerning the meaning of a
provision was or was not intended to constitute an agreed basis for its
interpretation”.°°° By contrast, “[alfter the treaty comes into force, its parties
may either amend it through prescribed procedures or interpret what already
is contained by the treaty”.°"° In this respect, “[nJeither the Achmea Judgment
nor the Achmea Declarations assert that any understanding regarding the
arbitration clauses under intra-EU BITs was reached during its
negotiations”.5"' Overall, “interpretation or application may not diminish the
rights and obligations of the parties to the treaty”, which in this case includes
the Respondent's obligation to “accept” the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal
established under Article 7 of the BIT.°"2

iii. | The Achmea Declarations cannot produce any effect as they contravene
international and EU law, namely (i) the principle of pacta sunt servanda in
Article 26 of the VCLT; (ii) the principle of security of the legal order; (iii) the
general principle of investors’ acquired and vested rights; (iv) the Tribunal’s

is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an
independent and impartial tribunal previously established by law”.°?

204. Fourth, to the extent that they do not refer to the Treaty’s interpretation or application,

the filing of the Notice of Arbitration, and cannot be affected by subsequent events.°'°
Neither the Achmea Declarations nor the Notes Verbales can retroactively impact a

e. The Termination Agreement

. The Claimant disputes that the Termination Agreement is of any consequence to the

present dispute.°"” Its argument is two-fold.

First, the Treaty was in force at the time of the asserted breaches in 2014-2015 and at
the time of Muszynianka’s acceptance of Slovakia’s offer to arbitrate by commencing
these proceedings in August 2016.°'® Jurisdiction must be assessed at the time of the
initiation of the proceedings.*'? Subsequent events, such as the Termination Agreement,
are irrelevant for jurisdictional purposes.°*° Similarly, the Termination Agreement does
not change the position that Slovakia’s responsibility is governed by the law in force at
the time of the allegedly wrongful act, namely by the BIT’s substantive standards.°*"

Second, the application of the Termination Agreement to these proceedings would be
retroactive, and would thus violate the principle of legal certainty and be contrary to the
protection of vested rights.%* It would also violate public policy within the meaning of
Article 190(2)(e) of the PILA,°3 amount to a denial of justice as Muszynianka lacks other
means of redress,>*4 and be in conflict with a peremptory norm of international law,
namely the right to a fair trial.°25

longer valid due to Slovakia’s accession to the EU Treaties in 2004. To resolve this
objection, the Tribunal must start by determining the law governing the question whether
the EU Treaties override the dispute resolution clause of the BIT. For the Claimant, this

Disputes between one of the Parties and an investor of the other Party shall
be notified in writing, including a detailed information, by the investor to the
host Contracting Party of the investment. As far as possible the Parties shall
endeavour to settle these differences by means of a friendly agreement.

If these disputes cannot be settled in this way within six months from the date
of the written notification mentioned in paragraph (1) the dispute shall be
submitted, at choice of the investor to:

a court of arbitration in accordance with the Rules of Procedure of the
Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce;

the court of arbitration of the Paris International Chamber of Commerce;

the ad - hoc court of arbitration established under the Arbitration Rules of
Procedure of the United Nations Commission for International Trade Law;

the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)set
up by the "Convention on Settlement of Investment Disputes between
States and Nationals of other States", in case both Contracting Parties
have become signatories of this Convention.

The arbitration decisions shall be final and binding for the Parties to the
disputes. Each Contracting Party undertakes to execute the decisions in
accordance with its national law.

The Contracting Party which is a party to the dispute shall at no time
whatsoever during the procedures involving investments disputes, assert as
a defence its immunity or the fact that investor bas received compensation
under an insurance contract covering the whole or part of the incurred damage
or loss.

question is exclusively subject to international law,°?” while the Respondent considers
that EU law is also relevant in accordance with Article 7(3) of the BIT, as this choice of
law provision refers to national law and general principles of international law, which
incorporate or allude to EU law.°8

The Tribunal has already set out its understanding of the law governing jurisdiction, to
which it refers.°?9 In addition, it notes that EU law is a sui generis legal order, which, as
was extensively discussed in Electrabel v. Hungary, is both international and national
law.5%° As such, it may be relevant to the analysis of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. This being
so, as stated earlier, the Tribunal remains a tribunal established on the basis of an
international treaty whose primary role is to apply international law and in particular that
treaty.

Before reviewing whether the EU Treaties prevail over the arbitration provision in
Article 7 of the BIT in application of the VCLT, the Tribunal will examine the Respondent’s
submissions that it is bound by the Achmea Judgment (a) and both the Achmea
Declarations and the Notes Verbales (b).

a. The relevance of the Achmea Judgment
In the Achmea Judgment, the CJEU held that:

Articles 267 and 344 [of the TFEU] must be interpreted as precluding a provision in

an international agreement concluded between Member States [...] under which an

investor from one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning

investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member

State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken

to accept.33"
Pursuant to Article 186(1) of the PILA, the Tribunal “shall itself decide on its jurisdiction”.
Similarly, under Article 21(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal “shall have the power
to rule on objections that it has no jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to
the existence or validity of the arbitration clause [...]”. In other words, the Tribunal has
Kompetenz-Kompetenz and in the exercise of such power, it must analyze whether there

is a valid consent to arbitrate under Article 7 of the BIT. It cannot abandon this mission
and, instead, simply endorse the ruling of another adjudicatory body.

In any event, the CJEU’s interpretative authority extends to the interpretation and
application of the EU Treaties.*°* It does not encompass an exclusive or ultimate
mandate in respect of the interpretation of the BIT or the VCLT rules on treaty conflicts.
Moreover, to decide whether Article 7 of the BIT is inoperable on the ground of the EU
Treaties, one must interpret not only the EU Treaties but also the BIT and assess their
interaction. A decision by the CUEU on EU law does not prejudge the critical questions
under Articles 30 and 59 of the VCLT of whether the BIT and the EU Treaties govern the
same subject matter; and, if so, whether there is a normative conflict between the EU
Treaties and the BIT.

The CJEU has not addressed these issues in Achmea, but has no exclusive authority to
do so in any event. A review of the Achmea Judgment shows that the CJEU carried out
no conflict analysis under the VCLT. As noted in United Utilities v. Estonia, the CJEU
appears to have assumed that the alleged incompatibility between the EU Treaties and
intra-EU BITs “must be considered through, and only through, the lens of EU law”.°? The
Tribunal makes no observation about this, insofar as it relates to EU law; it notes,
however, that the CJEU’s assumption is not compatible with public international law,
whether customary or conventional.

Therefore, the Achmea Judgment gives no guidance on the relevant issues before the
Tribunal, which must conduct an independent analysis to determine whether the EU
Treaties have rendered the BIT inoperable under public international law.

b. The relevance of the Achmea Declarations and the Notes Verbales

On 15 January 2019, 22 EU Member States, including Poland and Slovakia, concluded
the Main Achmea Declaration on the legal consequences of the Achmea Judgment,
affirming that “all investor-State arbitration clauses contained in bilateral investment
treaties concluded between Member States are contrary to Union law and thus
inapplicable”.°** The Slovak and Polish Governments confirmed this statement

specifically in relation to the Treaty through the Notes Verbales exchanged between
November 2019 and January 2020.%°>

The Respondent does not argue that the Main Achmea Declaration or the Notes
Verbales for that matter terminated the BIT and rightly so. The Declaration manifests the
intent of the signatories to terminate their investment treaties in the future, i.e., in
December 2019.°°° Had the Main Achmea Declaration and the Notes Verbales
themselves been sufficient to put an end to the intra-EU BITs, the scheduled December
2019 termination, now materialized in the Termination Agreement, would have made no

sense being unnecessary.

The Respondent also argues that the Main Achmea Declaration and the Notes Verbales
constitute subsequent agreements “between the parties regarding the interpretation of
the treaty or the application of its provisions” as contemplated in Article 31(3)(a) of the
VCLT. Accordingly, the Declaration and the Notes Verbales would dictate that Article 7
of the BIT be interpreted as incompatible with EU law and, hence, inapplicable.

However, the Main Achmea Declaration does not appear to offer a joint interpretation of
the intra-EU BITs. Its title, “Declaration [...] on the Legal Consequences of the Judgment
of the Court of Justice in Achmea and on Investment Protection in the European Union”,
suggests that the EU Member States seek to explain the legal consequences of the
Achmea Judgment, rather than to give an interpretation of Article 7 of the BIT.

Be that as it may, interpretative declarations within the meaning of Article 31(3)(a) of the
VCLT are not an exclusive and dispositive method of treaty interpretation. They are
merely one element that “shall be taken into account, together with the context” of the
relevant treaty terms. Context is itself a means of interpretation under Article 31(1) of the
VCLT, together with the ordinary meaning and object and purpose of the treaty.

The treaty provision that is purportedly the subject of interpretation is Article 7 of the BIT,
quoted above.**” Their ordinary meaning leaves no doubt that the words used in it are
the expression of a binding consent to arbitrate. In the face of such clear text,
interpretative declarations pursuant to Article 31(3)(a) of the VCLT cannot be employed

Achmea Declaration on 16 January 2019 (supra, J 132). To the extent that the Contracting Parties to the BIT did
not subscribe the Secondary Achmea Declaration, the latter has no bearing on the present dispute and the Tribunal
therefore will dispense with its analysis.

as “a trump card to allow States to offer new interpretations of old treaty language, simply
to override unpopular treaty interpretations based on the plain meaning of the terms
actually used”.*°

224. The observation that a subsequent agreement may relate to the application of a treaty
does not alter the outcome of the analysis. Under Article 31(3)(a) of the VCLT,
subsequent agreements must be considered, together with the context, as interpretative
tools only.*39 They may thus clarify the meaning or scope of a treaty provision, but
“cannot modify treaty obligations’—their value is limited to “interpreting [a] treaty in
accordance with the general rule of interpretation of treaties’.*“° The Achmea
Declarations, however, purport to prevent intra-EU investors from relying on clear
language which, in its ordinary meaning, gives them the ability to resort to arbitration.
Such a result goes beyond what can be achieved through interpretation and thus
disqualifies the Main Achmea Declaration from being a subsequent agreement in
accordance with Article 31(3)(a) of the VCLT.

225. Turning to the Notes Verbales, they indeed contain an affirmation that they constitute a
subsequent agreement in the meaning of Article 31(3)(a) of the VCLT.*' Yet, the
characterization of the true nature of the Notes requires an objective assessment.
Otherwise, parties to international treaties could easily and impermissibly circumvent
international customary law as codified in the VCLT. The content of the Notes Verbales
shows that they were exchanged in implementation and furtherance of the Main Achmea
Declaration and the Achmea Judgment,*4? which is confirmed by the Respondent

388 Eskosol S.p.A. in liquidazione v. Italian Republic, |CSID Case No. ARB/15/50, Decision on Termination Request
and Intra-EU Objection, 7 May 2019, CLA-164, § 223.

389 The Respondent appears to concede this when stating, albeit in the context of its submissions on the Notes
Verbales, that the latter are an “authoritative interpretation of the application of the BIT” (Reply NV, 4 19) (emphasis
added).

340 See International Law Commission's 2011 Guide to Practice on Reservations to Treaties, Guideline 4.7.1.1 (“An
interpretative declaration does not modify treaty obligations. It may only specify or clarify the meaning or scope
which its author attributes to a treaty or to certain provisions thereof and may, as appropriate, constitute an element
to be taken into account in i ing the treaty in with the general rule of ir of treaties”)
(emphasis added).

the Slovak Republic on the legal consequences of the [Achmea Judgment]. [...] The [Slovak Note Verbale] and this
Note Verbale constitute [a] Declaration between the Government of the Republic of Poland and the Government of
the Slovak Republic on the legal consequences of the [Achmea Judgment]”.). Although not dispositive, the Tribunal

itself.°“° Hence, for the reasons set out above in connection with the Main Achmea
Declaration and the Achmea Judgment, applicable here mutatis mutandis, the Tribunal
comes to the conclusion that the Notes Verbales cannot constitute a subsequent
agreement for interpreting the BIT in accordance with the VCLT.

As a result of the foregoing analysis, the Tribunal considers that the Main Achmea
Declaration and the Notes Verbales do not determine the outcome of its analysis
regarding the alleged incompatibility of the EU Treaties and the BIT’s arbitration clause.
The Tribunal must thus conduct its own analysis into such conflict, if any, on the basis of
the VCLT rules on treaty conflict.

c. Article 7 of the BIT and the EU Treaties

Both Parties refer to the conflict rules in Articles 30 and 59 of the VCLT. However, they
disagree on whether, as a result of these rules, Articles 267, 344, and 18(1) of the TFEU
and Article 4(3) of the TEU invalidate Article 7 or terminate the BIT in general.

Article 30 of the VCLT sets forth rules to resolve conflicts between “successive treaties
relating to the same subject matter”. In relevant parts, it reads as follows:

1. Subject to Article 103 of the Charter of the United Nations, the rights and
obligations of States Parties to successive treaties relating to the same subject
matter shall be determined in accordance with the following paragraphs.

2. When a treaty specifies that it is subject to, or that it is not to be considered
as incompatible with, an earlier or later treaty, the provisions of that other
treaty prevail.

3. When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the later treaty but
the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in operation under article 59,
the earlier treaty applies only to the extent that its provisions are compatible
with those of the later treaty.

4. When the parties to the later treaty do not include all the parties to the earlier

(a) as between States Parties to both treaties the same rule applies as in
paragraph 3;

(b) as between a State party to both treaties and a State party to only one

of the treaties, the treaty to which both States are parties governs their
mutual rights and obligations.

further notes that Ms. Bek's Communication, through which the Notes Verbales were brought to its attention (supra,
4 135), states that the Notes Verbales “result[] from paragraph 2” of the Main Achmea Declaration.

343 Comments NV, 915,16 (“The Notes Verbales were thus sent in order to implement these provisions of the [Main
Achmea] Declaration, which reflect EU law. [...] The Notes Verbales are done in furtherance of the Declaration

i

y’).

231.

232.

233.

Article 59 of the VCLT regulates the “[t]Jermination or suspension of the operation of a
treaty implied by conclusion of a later treaty” also sharing the “same subject matter”. In
relevant part, Article 59 VCLT reads as follows:

1. A treaty shall be considered as terminated if all the parties to it conclude a
later treaty relating to the same subject matter and:

(a) it appears from the later treaty or is otherwise established that the
parties intended that the matter should be governed by that treaty; or

(b) the provisions of the later treaty are so far incompatible with those of
the earlier one that the two treaties are not capable of being applied at
the same time.

. Accordingly, the first question for the Tribunal is whether the BIT and the EU Treaties

have the same subject matter ((i) below). If so, the next step will be to review whether
the BIT and in particular Article 7 of the BIT are in conflict with Articles 267, 344, and
18(1) of the TFEU and Article 4(3) of the TEU ((ii) below).

i. |The same subject matter requirement

The Respondent refers to Articles 30(3) and 59(1)(b) of the VCLT to submit that the BIT
has been rendered inoperative as a result of Slovakia’s and Poland’s accession to the
EU. The applicability of these provisions is contingent on finding that the EU Treaties
and the BIT share the “same subject-matter’.

According to certain highly qualified publicists, the term “same subject-matter” should be
understood widely.*** However, the Tribunal concludes that this cannot be reduced to a
requirement that the two treaties be potentially applicable to or govern the same set of
circumstances or facts. As noted by the tribunal in EURAM:

Even if two different rules deal with issues arising from the same facts, it does not
necessarily mean that they have the same subject matter. This can be seen from a
simple example: a treaty on environmental protection and a treaty on trade may both
apply to the same factual situation but the subject matter with which they deal is quite
different.245

In this context, investment arbitration tribunals have held that subject matter identity of
treaties is defined by the matters with which the treaty’s constituent provisions deal. For
instance, the Oostergete/ tribunal held:

The requirement [...] that the two treaties relate to the "same subject matter" has to
be construed in line with the dominant view expressed in scholarly writings to the
effect that two treaties can be considered to relate to the "same subject matter" only
if the overall objective of these treaties is identical and they share a degree of general
comparability.°46

234. In respect of the EU Treaties, investment arbitration tribunals have held that investment
treaties do not share the subject matter with the EU Treaties. The Wirtgen tribunal
considered it “obvious” that intra-EU investment treaties and EU Treaties did not have
identical subject matters.**” As noted in Marfin, the EU Treaties and BITs do not only
have a different objective, but the protections afforded by the latter are not coextensive
or exhausted by the former.*“° Similarly, the Eastern Sugar tribunal had earlier observed
that:

[BITs provide] for fair and equitable treatment of the investor during the investor's
investment in the host country, prohibits expropriation, and guarantees full protection
and security and the like. The BIT[s] also provide[] for a special procedural protection
in the form of arbitration between the investor state and the host state and, especially
arbitration of a "mixed" or "diagonal" type between the investor and the host state,
as in the present case.

From the point of view of the promotion and protection of investments, the arbitration
clause is in practice the most essential provision of Bilateral Investment Treaties.
Whereas general principles such as fair and equitable treatment or full security and
protection of the investment are found in many international, regional or national
legal systems, the investor's right arising from the BIT's dispute settlement clause to
address an international arbitral tribunal independent from the host state is the best
guarantee that the investment will be protected against potential undue
infringements by the host state. EU law does not provide such a guarantee.%49

235. The findings in Eastern Sugar were recently stressed by the tribunal in Magyar as follows:

[Als the most evident distinction [between the EU Treaties and investment treaties],
the application of [BITs] is contingent upon an investor of one State making a cross-
border investment in the other State. In turn, the EU Treaties provide guarantees for
nationals of the EU Member States irrespective of an investment. Due to this crucial
distinction, the substantive protections afforded to a foreign investor under the Treaty
are unsurprisingly not comparable to, or of the same nature as, those offered to EU
nationals under the BIT. By way of an example, as the Eureko v. Slovakia tribunal
observed, the protections afforded by BITs under the FET standard are not limited
to the existing EU law provisions prohibiting discrimination. Similarly, while EU law

may condition expropriatory takings upon public interest and fair compensation, it
has not been established that it offers comparable protections to those available
under the Treaty in case of indirect expropriations, or that it applies the protections
to “every kind of asset”.

The BIT and the EU Treaties also differ in their overarching goals. As the Oostergetel
tribunal underscored, the EU treaties’ objective is to promote economic integration,
including by creating a common market, among the Member States, whereas the
objective of BITs (including the Treaty) is to provide for specific guarantees in order
to encourage the international flows of investment into particular States.2°

The Tribunal shares the views expressed in these decisions. Therefore, it comes to the
conclusion that the BIT and the EU Treaties do not share the same subject matter for
the purposes of the VCLT. For this reason, Articles 30 and 59 of the VCLT are
inapplicable to the present case.

The Parties have not invoked any principle or customary norm of international law that
would govern a possible conflict between treaties that do not share the same subject
matter. Article 42(1) of the VCLT in turn states that “[t]he validity of a treaty or of the
consent of a State to be bound by a treaty may be impeached only through the
application of the present Convention”.

As a result, since the BIT and the EU Treaties lack the same subject matter, there is no
legal basis for the Tribunal to conclude that Slovakia’s and Poland’s accession to the EU
Treaties in May 2004 rendered the BIT inoperable. Consequently, Slovakia’s standing
offer to arbitrate, contained in Article 7 of the BIT, was valid when the Claimant accepted
it by filing its Notice of Arbitration in August 2016. This conclusion allows the Tribunal to
dispense with resolving the question whether the EU Treaties are in conflict with the BIT
and the offer to arbitrate, and the analysis could thus end here. Given that the Parties
have extensively briefed the issue of a possible conflict, the Tribunal will nevertheless
address it in the following section.

ii. The conflict requirement

Assuming the Tribunal were to accept that the BIT and the EU Treaties have the same
subject matter, quod non, the BIT and the offer to arbitrate which it includes would not
be precluded by operation of the EU Treaties. Indeed, there is no incompatibility between
Article 7 of the BIT and Articles 267, 344, and 18(1) of the TFEU and Article 4(3) of the
TEU under Articles 30 or 59 of the VCLT.

244,

When States subscribe to successive treaties, without terminating or amending the
“earlier in time” treaty (or treaties), it should be presumed that they did not intend to
create a normative conflict. This presumption derives from the principle of harmonious
interpretation of international law:
There is a general rule under international law whereby the interpreter tries to smooth
out or even to avoid conflict by way of “harmonizing interpretation” (presumption of
non-conflict). This rule is based on the assumption that when States wanted different
rules to be applicable they could not at the same time have wanted normative
contradiction. 951
As a leading commentary to the VCLT suggests, if “the apparently conflicting treaty
provisions can be interpreted in such a way that they are compatible with each other,
this approach is the first to be chosen.”*? Harmonious interpretation should not be
regarded as an incentive to ignore outright conflicts. An outright conflict “arises only
where a Party to the two treaties cannot simultaneously comply with its obligations under
both treaties,”* or in different words:
Treaties are incompatible with each other if their obligations cannot be complied with
simultaneously, ie if a State Party to both treaties cannot comply with one of them
without breaching the other.*54
On this basis, the Tribunal sees no conflict between Article 7 of the BIT and Articles 344,
267, and 18(1) of the TFEU and Article 4(3) of the TEU.

Article 344 of the TFEU reads as follows:

Member States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or
application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other than those provided for
therein.

This provision is not a general prohibition on EU Member States creating and using
treaties other than the EU Treaties to govern relations between them. Rather, it limits the
power of the Member States to litigate or arbitrate disputes concerning the interpretation
or application of the EU Treaties by means not foreseen in those treaties. It cannot be
understood to affirm that investor-State disputes based on investment treaties may not
be resolved by adjudicatory bodies other than those provided in the EU Treaties.

247.

This being so, Article 7 of the BIT does not deal with disputes “concerning the
interpretation or application of the [EU] Treaties”. In its first paragraph, Article 7 speaks
of “[d]isputes between one of the Parties and an investor of the other Party” and, in its
fifth paragraph, of “investment disputes”.°® It is true that such an investment dispute may
in certain circumstances involve matters calling for the interpretation or application of the
EU Treaties as issues incidental or preliminary to the application of the investment
treaty.°° Yet, even where this is so, the dispute remains one concerning the
interpretation and application of the investment treaty and the resulting award will carry
res judicata effects under international law solely in respect of the claims brought under
that treaty. Indeed, “tribunals are established under BITs to resolve disputes over the
interpretation and application of the obligations set out in the BIT in question. They are
not established to resolve disputes under EU law”.99”

The next relevant provision is Article 267 of the TFEU, which reads as follows:

The Court of Justice of the European Union shall have jurisdiction to give preliminary
rulings concerning:

(a) _ the interpretation of the Treaties;

(b) the validity and interpretation of acts of the institutions, bodies, offices or
agencies of the Union[.]

This provision empowers the CJEU to render preliminary rulings on the interpretation of
the EU Treaties. Investment treaty arbitration tribunals may not resort to the CUEU to
that effect. Still, the Tribunal fails to see the risk of a normative conflict between Article
267 and the submission of a dispute to international arbitration pursuant to Article 7 of
the BIT. Article 267 does not impose an obligation to ensure that all adjudicatory bodies
potentially dealing with EU law seek a preliminary ruling from the CJEU. Even national
courts of EU Member States are not all required to refer matters of interpretation of EU
law to the CJEU. If such an obligation existed, it would be routinely breached by tribunals
in commercial arbitration and extra-EU investment treaty arbitration, which are
occasionally called upon to interpret and apply EU law and are not empowered to seek

preliminary rulings. Yet the compatibility of these dispute settlement mechanisms with
Article 267, or with Article 344, for that matter, is not questioned.

248. Overall, the Tribunal holds that there is no conflict between Articles 344 and 267 of the
TFEU and intra-EU investor-State dispute resolution. The Tribunal notes that numerous
investment awards have reached the same conclusion.**

249. The Respondent also refers to Article 18(1) of the TFEU as a third provision that conflicts

with Article 7 of the BIT. Article 18(1) prohibits discrimination in the following terms:
Within the scope of application of the Treaties, and without prejudice to any special
provisions contained therein, any discrimination on grounds of nationality shall be
prohibited.

250. According to the Respondent, Slovakia’s and Poland's consent to arbitrate dispute with
Polish and Slovak investors, but not with other EU nationals is incompatible with the
prohibition of discrimination in Article 18(1) of the TFEU.%° Referring to the CUEU’s
judgment in Commission v. Belgium,*®° the Respondent submits that a breach of
Article 18(1) results from the “mere existence of the discriminating provision in the
international instrument in question”, and not from possible conduct in application of that
provision.3*

251. The Respondent's reliance on Commission v. Belgium is inapposite. In that case the
CJEU dealt with an extra-EU bilateral agreement between Belgium and the United States
on open skies and air transport services. The CJEU noted that the clause at issue in that
agreement (i) obligated the United States to grant certain rights to airlines registered in
Belgium and owned or controlled by Belgium or Belgian nationals;3 and (ii)
simultaneously permitted the United States to “withdraw, suspend or limit” those same

rights to airlines registered in Belgium but not owned or controlled by Belgium or Belgian
nationals. °°

252. It followed that non-Belgian EU airlines could “always be excluded from the benefit of the
air transport agreement between the Kingdom of Belgium and the United States of
America, while that benefit [was] assured to Belgian airlines”.°** The CJEU therefore
deemed discriminatory the relevant clause in the US-Belgium agreement, as non-
Belgian EU airlines would be prevented from “benefiting from the treatment which the
host Member State, namely the Kingdom of Belgium, accords to its own nationals”.°® It
is in this context that, as noted by the Respondent, the CJEU held that the “direct source”
of the discrimination was not the “possible conduct” of the United States, but the “clause”
that “specifically acknowledge[d] the right of the United States [...] to act in that way”.°®°

253. The present situation is distinguishable from the issue raised in Commission v. Belgium.
Article 7 of the BIT at no point prevents either Slovakia or Poland from granting the same
treatment to other EU Member States.°°” Accordingly, it cannot be construed as a “direct
source” of discrimination, if any. Moreover, the Tribunal shares the view of the tribunal in
EURAM, which held that “any possible discrimination might be taken up by the European
institutions to sanction a Member State for violation of EU law”, adding that “such
discrimination has no consequence on the validity of the treaty under public international
law: ‘this is an internal EU law problem and not an issue of treaty compatibility”.°°° The
Tribunal agrees and therefore finds no conflict with Article 18(1) of the TFEU.

254. Lastly, the Respondent argues that Article 7 of the BIT is incompatible with the principle
of mutual trust and cooperation between EU Member States enshrined in Article 4(3) of
the TEU,%® which reads as follows:

Pursuant to the principle of sincere cooperation, the Union and the Member States
shall, in full mutual respect, assist each other in carrying out tasks which flow from
the Treaties.

. According to the Respondent, the conflict lies in that this principle requires Member

States to trust each other's judicial systems and investor-State arbitration “is born, by
contrast, from a fundamental mistrust of the other state’s judicial system’.°”° The
Respondent stresses that the “core aim’ of Article 7 of the BIT is impermissibly to remove
disputes from the judicial system of the host State and thus also from the EU legal
order.°”" It adds that the “violation of the principle of mutual trust under Article 4(3) of the
TEU goes hand-in-hand with the violations of Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU”.°”2

. The Tribunal has already established that no conflict exists between the two latter

provisions and Article 7 of the BIT. The Tribunal cannot see the existence of a non-
judicial dispute settlement mechanism as a threat much less a breach of the principle of
mutual trust. Resort to commercial arbitration, including by EU Member States acting
jure gestionis, is not regarded as such,°’° yet precisely the same objection could be made
(i.e., that removing a commercial dispute from the jurisdiction of a court of an EU Member
State could be regarded as signifying a lack of confidence in that court’s ability to resolve
such a dispute) and one does not see why investment treaty arbitration would be different
in this respect.

For these reasons, subject to its analysis of the Respondent’s other jurisdictional
objections below, the Tribunal confirms its conclusion that Slovakia’s offer to arbitrate
was effective in August 2016 and that the Claimant's acceptance formed a valid
arbitration agreement.

In this context, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent has also submitted that a
“fundamental incompatibility” exists between the BIT’s substantive provisions and EU
law.?”4 While this submission has no bearing on jurisdiction, the Tribunal addresses it
here for the sake of convenience. It observes that the Respondent has not substantiated
the alleged incompatibility between the BIT’s substantive standards and EU law. Both
regimes can coexist. The Tribunal has reached the same conclusion, in this respect, as
prior investment treaty arbitration tribunals dealing with intra-EU BIT issues. For

example, as noted by the tribunal in Eureko, while a BIT’s substantive protections may
“extend beyond the protections afforded by EU law’, there is “no reason why those rights
should not be fulfilled and upheld in addition to the rights [and obligations] protected by
EU law”. Similarly, as recognized by the tribunal in WNC in reference to Eastern Sugar:
The fact that the BIT affords certain rights not available to other EU investors does
not make the BIT discriminatory; there is nothing in the BIT that prevents investors

of other states claiming equal rights under the BIT. It also does not bar investors of
non-party states from accessing commensurate protections under EU law.°7°

. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds no incompatibility between the BIT’s substantive

standards and the EU Treaties.

d. The Termination Agreement

On 5 May 2020, pursuant to the Achmea Declarations,°”” Slovakia and Poland, along
with 21 other EU Member States, signed an agreement, referred to as the Termination
Agreement, which provided that, upon its entry into force, it would terminate all
outstanding bilateral investment treaties.°”

The Respondent submits that the Termination Agreement is a subsequent agreement
between Slovakia and Poland pursuant to Article 31(3)(a) of the VCLT as to the
incompatibility and invalidity of the BIT in light of EU law, and that it confirms the previous
subsequent agreements to the same effect, i.e., the Main Achmea Declaration and the
Notes Verbales.°”? On this basis, it argues that the Termination Agreement, which
applies prospectively, does not give rise to any retroactivity concerns, as Article 7 of the
BIT has been inoperable since Slovakia’s and Poland’s accession to the EU in May
2004.%8°

The preceding sections establish that the Main Achmea Declaration and the Notes
Verbales are not subsequent agreements pursuant to Article 31(3)(a) of the VCLT; that

incompatible”.).

the BIT and the EU Treaties do not share the same subject matter; and that the BIT
(including its Article 7) is not incompatible with EU law. While the Termination Agreement
does restate the alleged inoperability of arbitration clauses in intra-EU BITs in light of EU
law,°*! it adds nothing to what the Tribunal has already considered and dismissed in this
same respect. Consequently, it would serve no purpose for the Tribunal to elaborate
further. It cannot but repeat the conclusion of its earlier analysis: Slovakia’s offer to
arbitrate was valid when Muszynianka accepted it.

263. This being so, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the Termination Agreement
raises no issues of retroactivity, nor could it.5® First, the Termination Agreement is not
yet in force between the Slovak Republic and the Republic of Poland and thus carries no
effects, be they prospective or retroactive. Even in force, the Termination Agreement
would still have no bearing on the present dispute. It is a well- settled principle that
jurisdiction is determined at the time of the institution of the proceedings,**° here on 18
August 2016 when the Notice of Arbitration was filed.°®* Thus, if jurisdiction existed on
that date (subject to the Respondent’s remaining jurisdictional objections), it will remain
so regardless of subsequent events,°®° including the termination of the BIT.2®°

264. The BIT’s substantive treaty protections would remain equally unaffected. As early noted
in Island of Palmas, “a juridical fact must be appreciated in the light of the law

381 See Termination Agreement, Preamble and Art. 4(1).

382 Indeed, the Respondent's reliance on Articles 28 and 70(1)(b) of the VCLT to suggest the contrary is inapposite
(RTA, fn. 11; supra, J 188). It is true that Article 28 recognizes that, if expressed in the treaty or otherwise
established, States can be bound by the provisions of a treaty “in relation to any act or fact which took place or any
situation which ceased to exist before the date of the entry into force of the treaty”, hence retroactively. However, it
does not govern retroactivity in relation to treaties already in force at the time of the alleged breaches. It is also true
that, pursuant to Article 70(1)(b), Contracting Parties may agree to terminate a treaty and “affect [the] right[s],
obligation[s] or legal situation[s] of the parties created through the execution of the treaty prior to its termination”.
Yet, the International Law Commission (“ILC”) made “it clear that [this article] is not in any way concerned with the
question of the ‘vested interests’ of individuals” (ILC Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties, Article 66 § 3), here
protected investors.

contemporary with it, and not of the law in force at the time when a dispute in regard to
it arises or falls to be settled”.°°” In this context, the Tribunal recalls that the BIT was in
force and thus binding on the Respondent at the time of the alleged breaches. As a
result, in line with the ICJ’s judgment in Northern Cameroons,>®° the Respondent's
responsibility as well as the monetary consequences of a breach are governed by the
BIT irrespective of the latter's termination.*°°

265. On this basis, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the Termination Agreement is
of no consequence in this arbitration. As a result, it can dispense with addressing the
Claimant's submissions on vested rights, public policy, jus cogens, or denial of justice.°*"

266. As a threshold matter, the Respondent argues that the Claimant bears the burden of
proving that the Tribunal has jurisdiction.°%

267. The Respondent argues that the Claimant has not established its primary contention,
i.e., that its investment must be seen as a “bundle of rights” (also referred to as “unity of
investment”)*°? for the following reasons.

268. First, Article 1(2) of the Treaty makes clear that an “investment” under the BIT is a
specific type of asset.°% Second, none of the arbitral decisions relied upon by the
Claimant are of assistance to its case. While the tribunals in Electrabel, Joy Mining, and
ATA adopted the Claimant’s “holistic” approach, they did so only with respect to

387 See Island of Palmas case (Netherlands, USA), United Nations Reports of International Arbitration Awards,
Vol. Il, 1928, CLA-21, p. 845.

388 A “breach of an international obligation” occurs if the wrongful act is perpetrated while the “State is bound by the
obligation in question” (see ILC Articles onResponsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, Art. 13).

in violation of the terms of the Trusteeship Agreement which resulted in damage to another Member of the United
Nations or to one of its nationals, a claim for reparation would not be liquidated by the ternination of the Trust”.).

390 Indeed, “once responsibility has accrued as a result of an internationally wrongful act, it is not affected by the
subsequent termination of the obligation, whether as a result of the termination of the treaty which has been
breached or of a change in international law” (ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful

Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, which does not apply here,°%° and proceeded to
consider the investor's relevant assets individually under the applicable investment
treaty.29° Moreover, the Mytilineos award invoked by the Claimant only referred to the
combined assets in obiter dictum, after it had found that each of the assets at issue
constituted an investment in its own right.297

269. The Respondent further submits that, even if the Claimant's “holistic” approach were
correct, quod non, the Claimant would still have to show that its alleged investment meets
the objective ordinary meaning of the term investment used in the BIT. As such, the
Claimant must demonstrate the existence of a contribution of resources, made for a
certain period of time, with attendant risk, and a contribution to the host State’s
economy. According to the Respondent, these criteria are relevant not only in ICSID
cases but in non-ICSID cases, such as the present one,3%° as well, and the Claimant
satisfies none of the criteria.

270. More specifically, the only meaningful activity that was planned to take place in the
territory of the Slovak Republic was the large-scale extraction of mineral water for
transport to Poland for bottling. It is difficult to distinguish this from a simple sale of an
asset abroad which cannot be deemed a “contribution”. The Tribunal notes that
investment treaty arbitration tribunals have reached similar conclusions in other cases.*°

outside the Slovak Republic, is insufficient to fulfill the first component of the objective
definition of an investment.*°2

Further, the Claimant’s “would-be” investment only sought to expand its business by
acquiring new water sources capable of filling the growing demand for Muszynianka
Water. Such a “sale and purchase arrangement”, even “over some time”, does not create
the necessary duration to constitute an investment.43 Neither does it entail a sufficient
degree of investment risk, as the Claimant has represented that its growth was limited
only by its ability to acquire water.4°*

Finally, the Claimant only intended to extract water from the Legnava Sources and pump
it into Poland, keeping the possible benefits of such economic operation outside of the
Slovak Republic and inside of Poland. All the costs and investment expenditures (with
the exception of the base minimum required for water extraction) were to be incurred
and made in Poland. Only Muszynianka, a Polish company, would be the entity receiving,
bottling, marketing, and selling the water in Poland. As a result, all the financial benefits
of the operation would accrue in Poland, GFT Slovakia being a mere shell. A project
such as this is not in conformity with the BIT’s purpose, which is to promote investments
from Poland into the Slovak Republic (or vice-versa), and can hardly be deemed as a
contribution to the development of the host State.45

In any event, the Respondent submits that the constituent elements of the Claimant's
alleged overall investment cannot be considered as self-standing investments under the
BIT. The Claimant has failed to adduce any evidence regarding the alleged “know-how”
relating to the “exploration, identification and assessment” of the Legnava Sources
pursuant to Article 1(2)(d) of the BIT.4° In addition, the categorization of an alleged
“entitlement” to the Exploitation Permit as an investment under Article 1(2)(e) of the BIT
is baseless.4°”7 GFT Slovakia never obtained the Exploitation Permit, nor was it assured
that the permit would be granted. It thus never acquired the “right” to “carry out [the]

economic activity” pursuant to the Exploitation Permit and a “mere expectation” does not
qualify as a protected investment under the BIT.48

2. The Claimant’s position

274. At the outset, the Claimant refers to the BIT’s preamble to show the treaty’s objective to
“promote and protect foreign investments with the aim to foster the economic prosperity
of both” the Slovak Republic and the Republic of Poland.4° It argues that no other activity
could be more beneficial to both Contracting States than the “trans-border infrastructural
venture” sought by Muszynianka.*° The Claimant further submits that, in any event, the
commitment of significant resources in the region by the Muszynianka was the “first and
by now the only” way to reverse the economic struggles of Legnava,*"' which was of
considerable importance to the local community.*!2 Therefore, so insists the Claimant, it
is evident that a contribution was made in the territory of the Slovak Republic to the
benefit of Legnava and its surroundings.“"3

275. Further, the Claimant invokes the chapeau of Article 1(2) of the BIT, which defines the
term investment as “any kind of asset invested” and is followed by a non-exhaustive list
of forms of qualifying assets.*"* According to the Claimant, under international investment
law such definition “capture[s] investments in the broadest sense possible”,‘"> including
“everything of economic value, virtually without limitation”.4"®

276. In this context, the Claimant submits that its investment, “understood as [the] entire
operation [...] needed for bottling mineral water from the Legnava Sources, meets the
definition of investment’ in the BIT.4’7 Indeed, the Claimant's exploration, extraction, and
commercial exploitation of the Legnava Sources (the “Project”) should be considered as
an “indivisible whole”.*'® All of its “parts”, i.e., the Exploration Permits, the Maximum
Quantities Decisions, the know-how and rights under such administrative acts, the real
estate and supporting infrastructure, the Building Permit, and the “entitlement” to receive
the Exploitation Permit,‘1? are interconnected and necessary to utilize the Legnava
Sources.

277. For the same reasons “[t]he fact that the ‘operation’ is conducted through [GFT Slovakia]
via ownership of its shares should have no bearing on identifying the [i]nvestment as a
single asset having economic value”.‘?° This is so as the main purpose of the overall
investment was to “synerg[ize]” Muszynianka’s core business (i.e., the sale of
Muszynianka Water) with the natural mineral resources in Legnava.‘?! As such, the
Claimant's and Goldfruct’s presence in Legnava through GFT Slovakia went beyond
receiving dividends and other benefits associated with shareholding. In fact, GFT
Slovakia was a mere “investment vehicle”.422

278. The Claimant therefore submits that the Tribunal’s ratione materiae jurisdiction must
extend to the investment as a whole, “irrespective of qualification of individual assets as
protected investments under Article 1(2) of the Treaty’.42 From an economic
perspective, it would be “impractical” to break the Claimant's venture into pieces in order
to assess which individual part is within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction and which one is not.‘
From a legal perspective, “a series of coherent arbitral awards” have followed a “holistic”

279. The Claimant recognizes that these doctrines have mostly been developed in the ICSID
context. It is, however, of the view that decisions of ICSID arbitration tribunals are helpful
where the measures taken by the host state are directed against “the whole activity of
an investor in that state”, as is the case here.** It also points to Mytilineos as an instance
where an UNCITRAL tribunal adopted a “holistic” view. 4?”

280. Alternatively, the Claimant argues that each of the constituent parts of the overall
investment qualifies as a self-standing investment in accordance with Article 1(2) of the
BIT, a provision that needs to be read strictly in order to give due deference to the
Contracting Parties’ consent. Therefore, the Tribunal need not go further than to
ascertain whether a particular asset falls within the list of protected investments in Article
1(2).428 In this vein, the Claimant makes the following submissions:

i. Muszynianka’s 100% shareholding in GFT Slovakia falls under Article 1(2)(b)
of the BIT.‘#° This provision is “clear and unambiguous” as to “shares” being
qualified investments,” which is sufficient to find that the Claimant has made
an investment protected by the BIT.43"

The Building Permit and the Maximum Quantities Decisions, “5 which contain

“considered comparable” to a right to carry out an economic activity pursuant
Article 1(2)(e).48° The Respondent’s arguments that no such entitlement ever

for the purpose of utilizing the Legnava Sources”.“45 The investment also involved a risk,
as the Claimant was not certain that it would realize profits at the time it purchased GFT
Slovakia.“4°

283. Finally, although only germane to ICSID proceedings and thus not applicable here,*#” the
evidence indicates that the investment would contribute to the development of
Slovakia.““* Indeed, in addition to the know-how contributed,*49 the substantial part of the
infrastructure needed to exploit the Legnava Sources was intended to be located in the
Slovak Republic. This infrastructure included the real estate owned by GFT Slovakia, the
water treatment plant, any other constructions necessary to operate the boreholes, the
connecting pipelines, and part of the cross-border pipeline.*®° In particular, the water
treatment plant was to be a fully equipped one-story building of 417.35m? (consisting of
a hall for technological purposes and auxiliary premises serving as an office space for at
least five employees).*5' The operations of the infrastructure situated in Legnava would
have required recruiting local employees. 45?

284. In this regard, the Claimant submits that the fact that the investment is closely linked to
its activity in Poland, or that the proceeds of the investment would be distributed in one
way or another within Muszynianka’s “capital group”, has no bearing on the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction.45° Nothing in the BIT conditions investment protection to undertakings that

expressly grants investors the right to profit from their investments and distribute such

3. Analysis

285. Article 1(2) of the BIT defines an “investment” as follows:

286.

287.

The term ‘investment’ means any kind of asset invested by an investor of one
Contracting Party, provided that they have been made in accordance with the laws
and regulations of the other Contracting Party and shall include in particular though
not exclusively:

a) movable and immovable property as well as any other rights in rem,
such as servitudes, mortgages, liens, pledges;

b) shares, stocks and debentures of companies, parts or any other kinds
of participation in companies;

c) claims to money or to any performance having an economic value;

d) copyrights, industrial property (such as patents, utility models, industrial
[designs] or models, trade or service marks, trade names, indications
of origin) know-how and goodwill;

e) tights granted by a public authority to carry out an economic activity,
including concessions, for example to search for, extract or exploit
natural resources.

According to the Respondent, holding an asset enumerated in Article 1(2) of the BIT is
not sufficient to conclude that an investor has a protected investment. In addition, so the
Respondent submits, a purported investment must meet the so-called objective
definition, involving an allocation of resources, a duration, a risk, and a contribution to
the host State’s development.*® By contrast, for the Claimant, its shareholding in GFT
Slovakia is sufficient to determine that it has a protected investment under the Treaty. *°
However, in the event that the Tribunal were to resort to the objective definition of
investment, the Claimant asserts that the definition only comprises the elements or
allocation of resources, duration and risk.45”

It follows from the wording of the Treaty definition that an asset qualifies as an investment
if it is “invested” and falls within one of the non-exhaustive categories listed in Article 1(2)
of the BIT. In addition, the investment must have been made “in accordance with the
laws and regulations of the [host State]”. This latter condition is relevant in the context of
the Parties’ dispute regarding the alleged illegalities underlying the Project**® and is

addressed separately.“°° For present purposes, the Tribunal is concerned only with the
Respondent's submission that the Claimant does not own a protected investment.

288. In application of the treaty interpretation rules codified in the VCLT, the Tribunal must
give to the word “invested” used in Article 1(2) its ordinary meaning. That meaning has
been elicited through arbitral decisions resulting in what is often called the “objective”
definition of investment. It is true that investment tribunals, starting with the one in
Salini,“© have elaborated that definition in relation with Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention and that this arbitration is not subject to the ICSID regime. It is also true that
some tribunals have held that the objective definition should not be transposed into a
non-ICSID context.**' Other tribunals, however, have considered that the objective
definition is “inherent” to the notion of investment,‘ or that the term investment has a
meaning of its own that cannot be ignored when considering a list of different forms in
which an investment can take, such as that contained in the BIT.‘ Whatever the
controversy, this Treaty expressly speaks of assets “invested”, a characterization that
calls for the application of the objective definition in addition to the presence of an asset
falling within the categories of the Treaty list.

289. In connection with the components of the objective definition, the Parties agree, and
rightly so, on the elements of allocation of resources, duration, and risk. By contrast, they
disagree on the need for a contribution to the development of the host State economy.
The Tribunal is of the opinion that the development of the local economy is an expected
consequence of the investment, but not a self-standing condition of the latter's existence,
an opinion shared by a number of prior investment awards.**

290. Having described the legal requirements posed to the existence of a protected
investment, the Tribunal now turns to the application of these requirements to the facts.
It is undisputed that, on 31 December 2012, Muszynianka acquired 100% of the shares
in GFT Slovakia, a Slovak company.‘ Muszynianka’s shareholding in GFT Slovakia
undoubtedly falls within the asset categories listed in the BIT, specifically within
Article 1(2)(b). As a result, the Claimant does hold an asset under Article 1(2) of the BIT.

291. It remains to be established that this asset is the result of an investment as defined
above. In respect of the first element related to a contribution or allocation of resources,
the record shows that Muszynianka allocated capital towards its acquisition of GFT
Slovakia in an amount of PLN 18,433,478 million (approximately EUR 4.5 million).4% It
also shows that throughout 2013 Muszynianka increased its share capital in GFT
Slovakia by PLN 4,032,691 (approximately EUR 1 million).*°” Moreover, it is common
ground that GFT Slovakia’s activities have been financed by its “mother-company”,
initially Goldfruct and then Muszynianka, through debt or equity.*¢*

292. Regarding the element of duration, GFT Slovakia operated uninterruptedly in Slovakia
since its establishment in October 2001 by Goldfruct, and the Claimant has owned its
investment, i.e., GFT Slovakia, since 31 December 2012. In addition, the Tribunal has
no doubt that Muszynianka (through GFT Slovakia) intended a long-term water
exploitation operation in Slovakia.

293. As to risk, Muszynianka’s acquisition of GFT Slovakia implied an assumption of
investment risk, i.e., the risk that the value of the shares could increase, decrease, or

paid for GFT, to make it a profitable business (in fact it already invested PLN 4.0 million (EUR 1.0 million) in GFT
in 2013)’).

even be lost entirely.“©° The risk here is heightened by the fact that a decision on the
Exploitation Permit, a sine qua non condition to the generation of profits, was still pending
when Muszynianka acquired GFT Slovakia.

294. In conclusion, the Claimant’s shares in GFT Slovakia meet the objective definition of
investment in addition to constituting an asset under Article 1(2)(b) of the Treaty.

295. Subject to its findings on illegality,“”° this conclusion suffices to establish ratione materiae
jurisdiction.‘”' Therefore, for the sake of procedural economy, the Tribunal dispenses
with analyzing whether the Claimant holds other assets in Slovakia capable of
constituting protected investments. Likewise, it need not assess whether these assets
may cumulatively form one protected investment.

C. THE LEGALITY OF THE INVESTMENT
1. | The Respondent’s Position

296. As a third and last jurisdictional defense, the Slovak Republic alleges that the Claimant's
investment does not meet the legality requirement contained in Article 1(2) of the BIT.
Specifically, it asserts that Muszynianka intended to sell Slovak-sourced mineral
groundwater under the Muszynianka Water brand;4”? to mix the water from the Legnava
Sources among themselves and/or with water extracted from Polish boreholes;473 for
GFT Slovakia to sell or transfer the water from the Legnava Sources to Muszynianka
prior to bottling;#”* and to bottle the mixed water in Muszyna.475

297. The Respondent argues that each of these actions that are part of the Claimant's
business plan breach EU, Slovak, and/or Polish law.‘ In respect of EU law, it refers to
the Mineral Water Directive. For the Respondent, unlawful investments are outside the
scope of the BIT and thus the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over disputes arising out of such
investments.477

2. The Claimant’s Position

298. The Claimant opposes this objection. It challenges the applicability of the laws that the
Respondent invokes and especially of the Mineral Water Directive.‘’* It also disputes
that its business plan involved any unlawful actions, stressing that the said plan was EU,
Slovak and Polish law-compliant in all aspects,*”? and that the Respondent has
developed the illegality argument “solely for the purpose of the present arbitration”.
According to the Claimant, at no point prior to these proceedings did a Slovak authority
express doubts as to any illegality regarding the exploitation of the Legnava Sources or
Muszynianka’s business plans.**'

3. Analysis

299. Article 1(2) of the BIT defines the term investment used in the States’ offer to arbitrate
enshrined in Article 7, as “any kind of asset invested by an investor of one Contracting
Party, provided that they [sic] have been made in accordance with the laws and
regulations of the other Contracting Party [...]’.482 In other words, access to treaty
protection, including arbitration, is conditional upon the legality of the investment.48

300. Specifically, to fall within the host State’s consent to arbitrate, an investment must be
“made” in accordance with the law. The use of the word “made” indicates the point in
time when the investment must comply with the law. In this respect, it is well-settled that
the “jurisdictional significance” of a legality requirement found in the definition of an
investment, like the one contained in Article 1(2) of the BIT, “is exhausted once the
investment has been made”.*®* Only an illegality that exists at the time of “entry”,
“procurement”, “initiation” or “establishment” of the investment may preclude the
existence of a protected investment.*® This is particularly clear in the present treaty from

the use of the verb to “make”, which is synonymous to “establish”. In addition, the Treaty
employs the past tense “made”, which confirms that the illegality test applies at the time
of making of the investment.‘

301.

By contrast, if the breach of law occurs during the life of the investment after it has been
established, then it is generally accepted that the illegality does not bar access to
arbitration.*®” It may constitute an objection to admissibility or a defense against the claim
on the merits, but these are different matters.

302. Hence, the question for the Tribunal is whether the Claimant made its investment in a
lawful manner. As was discussed above, that investment consisted in the purchase of
the equity of GFT Slovakia. Nothing in the record suggests an illegality in Muszynianka’s
acquisition of GFT Slovakia and, in fact, none is alleged. Rather, the Respondent argues
that the illegalities concern the “implementation” of the Claimant’s business plan.‘
Accordingly, there is no question that the Claimant has “made” an investment “in
accordance with the laws and regulations” of the Slovak Republic, as required by
Article 1(2) of the BIT.

303. There is thus no need for the Tribunal to delve further into the Respondent's illegality
allegations at this stage. While it will have to revert to this topic later, at this juncture it
suffices to note that there is no indication of any illegality in the making of the investment,
with the result that the illegality objection must be denied.

304. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that Muszynianka’s shareholding in GFT Slovakia
constitutes a protected investment under the Treaty and that it has ratione materiae
jurisdiction.

In conclusion, the Tribunal holds that it has jurisdiction over the dispute before it because
all of the Treaty’s jurisdictional requirements are met. In particular, it considers that the
objections raised against its jurisdiction are not well-founded:

i. Slovakia and Poland’s respective accessions to the EU Treaties has not
rendered the BIT inoperable and the Claimant has validly accepted the
Respondent's offer to arbitrate under the BIT;

ii. The Claimant holds an investment in the form of its shareholding in GFT
Slovakia; and

iii. | That investment was made in accordance with the laws of the Slovak
Republic.

ADMISSIBILITY
A. THE RESPONDENT'S POSITION

According to the Respondent, the Claimant seeks damages for the alleged diminution of
the value of its shares in GFT Slovakia due to the measures adopted by the Slovak
Republic.*°° Such claims, the Respondent states, are only admissible if “(i) the assets of
the company have been expropriated by the host contracting state party so that the
shareholding has been rendered worthless; or (ii) the company is without or has been
deprived of a remedy to redress the injury it has suffered; or (iii) the company is without
or has been deprived of the capacity to sue either under the /ex societatis or de facto; or
(iv) the company has been subjected to a denial of justice in the pursuit of a remedy in
the system for the administration of justice of the host contracting state party”.4%°

This being so, for the Respondent, none of these requirements are satisfied. The shares
in GFT Slovakia are not worthless as GFT Slovakia retains the rights that it acquired in
respect of the Legnava Sources. Muszynianka can still exploit the Legnava Sources if it
makes the necessary investments. Further, GFT Slovakia has not been deprived of local
remedies to reassess the harm, nor has there been a denial of justice, and indeed none

is argued.*9' Therefore, claims regarding the diminution in value of its shareholding GFT
Slovakia are inadmissible.‘9

308. Alternatively, the Respondent contends that the claims are inadmissible because the
Claimant's investment is illegal.49°

B. THE CLAIMANT’S POSITION

309. At the outset, the Claimant notes that the Respondent raises this admissibility defense
only in relation to the shareholding in GFT Slovakia as a protected investment and not in
respect of other elements of its investment. In this regard, the Claimant submits that
its case is premised “not on the mere decrease of value of shares or other shares-related
injury” but on the “deprivation in toto” of the investment pursued through GFT Slovakia.‘
Therefore, it chiefly claims redress for the “direct harm” incurred by Muszynianka
(resulting from the Slovak Republic’s unlawful actions), which can be assessed both with
respect to the loss of value of GFT Slovakia’s shares and of the assets owned by GFT
Slovakia. Indeed, for the Claimant, prior decisions of investment treaty tribunals
consistently show that “shareholders of a company incorporated in a host state are
entitled to pursue their claims for injuries made directly to that company”.4%° This is so
particularly when the locally incorporated company is an investment vehicle fully owned
by the claiming shareholder, as is the case here.49”

310. The Claimant further argues that its case stands even if the Tribunal were to favor the
Respondent’s approach.“°8 Indeed, all of GFT Slovakia’s assets have been indirectly yet
effectively expropriated, with the result that Muszynianka’s shares have lost their full
value. Furthermore, GFT Slovakia has no legal remedy to redress this injury because

the measures impugned took the form of a Constitutional Amendment that, by definition,
cannot be the subject of judicial or administrative review in Slovakia.499

Lastly, the Claimant submits that its investment meets all legality requirements and
therefore the claims in this arbitration are admissible.

c. ANALYSIS

The Tribunal has established that the Claimant's shares in GFT Slovakia constitute a
protected investment under the Treaty. It is undisputed that the Measures impeded
the cross-border exploitation of the Legnava Sources. It is equally undisputed that GFT
Slovakia had no business in the Slovak Republic other than the Project.

In this regard, the Tribunal has no difficulty in accepting that the value of Muszynianka’s
shares in GFT Slovakia, or at least a considerable part thereof, was linked to the ability
to carry out the Project as originally intended.°°' The Measures have thus impacted the
value of the Claimant’s shareholding in GFT Slovakia. Such value-reducing or value-
destroying impact represents a loss which the Claimant incurs directly. Whether that loss
is compensable because the Measures engage the international responsibility of the
State is a different matter that goes to the merits.

The Tribunal has also already determined that the Claimant's investment was not illegal
at the time when it was made.° Whether the implementation of the Claimant’s business
plan would have been illegal as the Respondent claims, is again an issue that pertains
to the merits. When illegality allegations refer to the operation or performance of the
investment, they fall within the scope of the merits. The Tribunal notes that this holding
has also been adopted in earlier investment awards, for example in Urbaser.®® This is
particularly clear here, as the Respondent alleges the illegalities in Muszynianka’s
business plan primarily as a defense on the merits,°“* and only mentions them in the
context of admissibility in passing.

For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the claims before it are admissible.

LIABILITY

The Claimants asserts that the Slovak Republic breached the Treaty standards in
respect of fair and equitable treatment (B), expropriation (C), and non-impairment (D).
As a first defense, the Respondent submits that all of the claims with respect to the
Constitutional Amendment are barred by the doctrine of police powers.®° For a clearer
structure of the legal analysis, the Tribunal will address the police powers doctrine after
the alleged breaches. The Slovak Republic also objects that the planned operation of
the investment, and more specifically the Claimant's business plan, was illegal. It does
so to refute the existence of legitimate expectations under FET®® and in the context of
causation.®°” Yet, on the merits,°° illegality may also play a role in the framework of an
alleged entitlement to the Exploitation Permit.5°° Because it has an impact on several
areas of the analysis, the Tribunal reviews the legality of Muszynianka’s business at the
outset (A).

A. LEGALITY OF MUSZYNIANKA’S BUSINESS PLAN
1. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent's allegations of unlawfulness target the plans to sell or transfer the
water before bottling (a); to bottle other than at source (b); to mix the water (c); and to
sell the water under the Muszynianka brand (d).

a. GFT Slovakia could not have sold or transferred the extracted
water to another entity prior to bottling

According to the Respondent, the Claimant “has consistently argued in this arbitration
that it intended to use GFT Slovakia as a supplier of raw material—i.e., Slovak-sourced
natural mineral water—to increase the production of the water that Muszynianka itself
was bottling and selling under its ‘Muszynianka Water’ brand”.5"° Such a plan, however,
constituted an “illegal change-in-ownership” of the water, which would be transferred for
bottling to an entity other than the one having permission to extract it.6'' Considering the

Inspectorate’s preliminary opinion of 30 March 2010,°"? the Claimant was aware of such
illegality.5"* Indeed, presumably because of the Inspectorate’s position, GFT Slovakia
later changed its position stating that it would “fully” retain “ownership” of the water at all
times.o* For the Respondent, the Claimant's new allegations regarding how
Muszynianka would have devised alternatives ensuring that the extracted water would
be bottled by GFT Slovakia, are baseless and lack any detail.°'

b. The water from the Legnava Sources could not have been bottled
other than at its source

The Respondent submits that the Claimant's overall business plan was “incompatible”
with the “bottle-at-source” principle found in the Mineral Water Directive, according to
which EU law “does not allow for the cross-border transfer of [unbottled] natural mineral
water”.5'® Therefore, the Respondent was under an obligation to access every stage of
the production of the Slovak-sourced natural mineral water, including bottling.®'” In
particular, Article 1(1), 1(5), Annex Il (2), (3), (4)(b), and Article 11 of the Mineral Water
Directive require “one and the same Member State”, namely the State where the water
is extracted, to: “(i) recognize that the water is natural mineral water; (ii) ensure that it is
produced in compliance with the Directive, including as regards bottling; and (iii) remain
responsible for the safety of that water on an ongoing basis”.°'®

According to the Respondent, contrary to the evidence of Claimant’s EU law expert
Prof. Miller-Graff,°"° the fact that the Mineral Water Directive prevents the export of
unbottled mineral water is not contrary to EU primary law on free movement of goods
between Member States. First, unbottled water is not a “good” within the meaning of EU
law and is thus not subject to free movement.*° Second, even if unbottled water were a

good (quod non), the Mineral Water Directive constitutes “vertical legislation” that
legitimately restricts free movement of goods in the interest of protecting consumers.°*"

In any event, even if the Mineral Water Directive were to be found to be illegal due to its
alleged incompatibility with primary EU law, the Slovak Republic would nonetheless be
bound by it as long as it is not declared illegal by the CUEU.° Indeed, the Mineral Water
Directive could not be interpreted contrary to its express wording so as to make it
consistent with EU primary law.°

c. The Legnava Sources could not have been mixed among each
other or with Polish sources
It is the Respondent’s submission that mixing of water from the Legnava Sources among
them or with Polish water would be contrary to EU, Slovak, and Polish law.

Relying on its expert witnesses, Mr. O'Rourke and Dr. Marcin, the Respondent submits
that the Claimant's plan to mix Slovak-sourced and Polish-sourced natural mineral water
is incompatible with the Mineral Water Directive for three reasons: “(i) both waters’
original characteristics would be altered by the process of mixing; (ii) the resulting mix
would not originate from a single Member State or state-of-origin; and (iii) the resulting
mix would not have a single ‘provenance’ [...]’.54

The Respondent further explains that the Mineral Water Directive distinguishes “natural
mineral water” from “ordinary drinking water” by its nature, i.e., the water’s “mineral
content” and its “original purity’.°° The Mineral Water Directive provides that both
characteristics must be “preserved intact because of the underground origin of such
water” (i.e., an “underground water table or deposit”) and protected from “all risk of
pollution’.®*° Therefore, unless mineral water comes from the same “hydraulic and
geological origin” and has the same chemical composition, “mixing mineral water is self-
evidently incompatible with these rules”.5*” According to the Respondent, the expert
evidence on record shows that “the water from Legnava Sources alone does not have

the same chemical composition”.°*° Moreover, “the water from the Legnava Sources and

from Polish Sources not only lack the same chemical composition [...], but do not belong

to the same underground water deposit”, as recognized by the Claimant's own expert at

the Hearing.*°

325. The Respondent further observes that mixing the waters from the Legnava Sources

would have breached Slovak law, which applies even if the mixing takes place in Poland,

for the following reasons:

Slovak law is applicable by virtue of the state-of-origin principle of the Mineral
Water Directive.

At no point has the Slovak Republic consented to the bottling of the mineral
water of the Legnava Sources, including its potential mixing, branding and
labelling, being subject to Polish law. The Claimant's reliance on the
Inspectorate’s letter of 16 December 2010 to argue the contrary is
misplaced.©° Prior to this arbitration, neither GFT Slovakia, nor Goldfruct or
Muszynianka ever disclosed to the Slovak authorities their plan to mix the
mineral water extracted from the Legnava Sources.**! Moreover, despite the
“express instructions” given by the PNIPH in its letter of 4 November 2010,5°?
GFT Slovakia, Goldfruct or Muszynianka never sought clearance from the
State Spa Committee to ensure that “their [business] plan complied with the
[Mineral Water Directive], including its provisions on mixing”.*** Differently
stated, the Inspectorate was “kept in the dark about [the Claimant's] mixing
plans” and “therefore could not have agreed that the mixing would be
governed by Polish law’. In any event, the Inspectorate’s letter of 16
December 2010 “makes no reference to mixing whatsoever”.5%

As explained by Ms. Bozikova at the Hearing, had the State Spa Committee
known that the water from the Legnava Sources would be mixed in Poland,

that would have been considered “a problem and [the State Spa Comittee]
would have [had] to deal with that”.°° The Inspectorate is under a duty to
register recognized mineral waters in Slovakia within the list of mineral
waters administered by the EU Commission.**’ That list specifies the source
of the water and confirms that the conditions for bottling and consumer
packaging have been met.** Therefore, a potential Exploitation Permit would
have listed the conditions under which the water could be bottled, packaged
and branded in Poland.%*? It would be “unthinkable” for the State Spa
Committee to simply “leave an information for the EU Commission that water
is from Legnava and it's being mixed and bottled” in Poland.“° For instance,
to prevent mixing, the Exploitation Permit would have required that “water be
bottled through individual bottling lines for each individual source”.5“!
Notably, if this and any other conditions in the Exploitation Permit were
breached, the State Soa Committee could initiate proceedings to cancel the
Exploitation Permit.54

iv. Pursuant to the Act on Mineral Waters, the Inspectorate must ensure that
mineral water maintains its “quality” throughout its production process.
Accordingly, the Inspectorate conducts assessments of the mineral water at
each production stage, namely extraction, treatment, accumulation, and
bottling.**° To this end, sampling devices must be installed at each stage.°“
In the present case, the last stage, i.e., bottling, would have occurred in
Poland, where the Inspectorate has no competence.®“ For that reason, in
December 2010, the Inspectorate agreed that “the quality of water in those
bottles [could] be inspected by the [Polish agency PNIPH]”,5“° which would

have proceeded on the basis of Polish legislation.°*” However, the fact that
the Polish authorities would have carried out inspections pursuant to Polish
law would not have relieved the Inspectorate from discharging its duty under
Slovak law. Had an Exploitation Permit been issued, the State Spa
Committee would have included a condition that GFT Slovakia provide an
analysis of water quality in accordance with Slovak law from an independent
laboratory to “compare parameters” between the extraction and bottling
stages.54

Based on the Inspectorate’s preliminary opinion of 30 March 2010,5° the Slovak
Republic stresses that the Claimant was aware that mixing was unlawful under Slovak
law.55° Indeed, for its Zoning Permit application, GFT Slovakia submitted construction
plans providing for the construction of six separate pipelines, one for each of the Legnava
Sources with two for reserve.%>' This design indicated that Muszynianka planned to
comply with the Inspectorate’s preliminary opinion “regarding the impossibility to mix
water from different sources”.552

In particular, the mixing would have breached Article 9(2) of the Slovak Food Code,53
thus incurring in counterfeiting of mineral water.5* This provision states that mixed
mineral water can only be placed on the market under the same brand if it fulfills the
following strict conditions: (i) all sources of water must be from one output area; (ii) the
water must be of the same type as regards its chemical composition; and (iii) the total
mineralization of individual sources may not differ more than the natural fluctuation of the
total mineralization of the main source of mineral water determined by a long-term regime
monitoring.%° The Claimant’s business plan could not have met these cumulative
requirements.

Regarding the first requirement (one output area), the Legnava and Polish sources are
not from one output area just because of their proximity and location in the “same

geological and hydrogeological area”.5° Even though they opined “that any division
between [the] continuous hydrogeological structure of this area is unjustified”,®” the
Claimant's experts, Profs. Szczepanska-Plewa and Szczepanski, did not determine that
mineral water in the Legnava and Muszyna regions come from one output area within
the meaning of Article 9(2) of the Slovak Food Code.** By contrast, Dr. Marcin, the
Respondent’s expert, concluded that borehole LH-1 has a distinct output area, while
boreholes LH-2A to LH-5 share the same (all of these output areas being located within
the Slovak Republic).*° According to the Respondent, Dr. Marcin’s findings confirm
those of its other expert,5®° Prof. Zenigova, who affirmed that the natural mineral water
from boreholes LH-2A to LH-5 are from the same output area,®*' but from another output
area than the Polish sources.*®

As to the second requirement in Article 9(2) of the Slovak Food Code (same chemical
composition), the Legnava and Muszyna sources have a different chemical
composition.%* The Respondent’s expert Prof. ZeniSova stated that (i) “the water from
the LH-2A and LH-5 sources differs from the water from the LH-3 and LH-4 sources due
to the higher magnesium levels”;*® (ii) the water from borehole LH-2A “significantly
differs” from the other Legnava Sources as it has lower mineralization;5*° and (iii) the
Legnava Sources and the Polish sources have different chemical types, especially with
respect to their content of sodium, potassium, and sulfates.5®

The Respondent concedes that, through the LH-2A to LH-5 Maximum Quantities
Decision, the Ministry of Environment found that the waters from the Legnava Sources
were of the same chemical type.°°” However, it submits that the Ministry reached that
conclusion on the basis of a hydrogeological study commissioned by GFT Slovakia and

not as a result of the Ministry's own investigation.°° According to the Respondent, the
“expert analysis carried out for this arbitration now concludes that [the study and the
conclusions in the Maximum Quantities Decision] were inaccurate”.°°° Consequently, the
Claimant “could not have based its expectations to mix Legnava Sources on the
Ministry's approval of the study, because it is the real factual situation—and the correct
calculations of the chemical type—that are decisive”.5”°

With respect to the third requirement (total mineralization), the Respondent disputes the
Claimant’s assertions,5”' since “no combination of the Legnava Sources meets the
necessary criteria of mineralization”.5” Moreover, according to Prof ZeniSova, even a
“preliminary review” indicates “evident” and “significant” differences in mineralization of
the Legnava and Polish Sources.5”

Finally, the Respondent submits that mixing of the Legnava Sources would also be
contrary to Polish law.574

First, under Article 34 of the Polish Act on Nutrition Safety, mineral water “traded” in
Poland must be recognized®’> by the Polish Chief Sanitary Inspector if “the water has
been extracted from a hole located in the Republic of Poland”, or by a “competent body
of a different European Union Member State” if “the water has been extracted from a
hole located in that state’.o”° The recognition by the relevant authority covers the name
of the mineral water to be introduced into the market and the source from which the water
is extracted.’ It follows that the Polish authorities could not recognize the Claimant's
mixed product, as it would contain Slovak water over which Polish authorities lacked
authority.5”

Second, even if it were correct that the Claimant could have sold a mix of Slovak and
Polish-sourced waters pursuant to Article 20(3) of the Polish Mineral Water
Regulation,’”° that provision must be read in conjunction with Article 20(1),5% which
provides that bottled natural mineral water, having a single trade name, may be drawn
from “specific groundwater resources” using one or more “holes that are a water intake”.
Such wording must be interpreted in light of the Mineral Water Directive and the CJEU’s
decisions, which suggest that the relevant criteria is whether the extracted water (to be
mixed) originates from the same underground deposit or accumulation area.**! Contrary
to Prof. Szczepariski’s statements at the Hearing, the relevant criteria cannot be that the
water come from the same aquifer or water table (i.e., the Piwniczna Sandstones or, in
Slovak terminology, Krynica Flysh).*®* Otherwise, considering the broad extension of the
Krynica Flysh, one could mix waters of the same chemical composition that are hundreds
of kilometers apart, which cannot be the meaning of the law.®® In reliance on Dr. Marcin,
the Respondent submits that the Legnava and Polish sources do not originate in the
same underground deposit,5*4 which is not disputed by Prof. Szczepariski.5®°

Third, the Claimant’s reliance on the position taken by the PNIPH in November 2010 is
ill-conceived.®° That position required that “all activities related to”, inter alia, the
“preparation of the water for bottling” (“i.e., mixing”) be compliant with Slovak law.%°7

d. The Legnava Sources could not have been sold under the
Muszynianka brand
The Respondent submits that the Claimant’s plan to sell the water extracted from the
Legnava Sources under the Muszynianka brand would mislead consumers and thus
breach EU, Slovak and Polish law.®9

With respect to EU law, it would violate Articles 8(1) and 9(1)(a) of the Mineral Water
Directive.5®° Article 8(1) allows for a trade description to incorporate a specific location,
“provided that it is not misleading as regards the place of exploitation of the spring”.®" In
this vein, the “relevant and decisive” factor for a trade description is “the place where
natural mineral water is extracted”, not where it is bottled.5s? The Claimant is thus wrong
when asserting that the “place of exploitation of the spring” in Article 8(1) encompasses
both the place of the water in Legnava, and the place of the rest of the production process

in Muszyna.53

As to Article 9(1)(a), it makes it illegal to package, label, or advertise natural mineral
water in a manner that suggests a characteristic that the water does not possess, “in
particular as regards its origin”.5°* By selling the water extracted from the Legnava
Sources under the Muszynianka brand, the Claimant would mislead consumers by
indicating that Muszyna is the place of origin, when the water actually came from
Legnava.%° According to the Respondent, that misrepresentation could not be cured by
the Claimant’s suggestion of combined branding under a label such as for instance
“Muszynianka-Legnava”.5° Such a combination would contradict the Claimant's intent to
avoid using another trade name.” It would also be “inherently unclear’, making it
“impossible” for consumers to know the actual origin of the water.58

With reference to the Claimant's reliance on Article 7(2)(b) of the Mineral Water Directive,
the Slovak Republic notes that the latter requires that labels specify both the name of

the spring and the place of its exploitation.5° While the combined brand name
Muszynianka-Legnava may comply with that provision, the same could not be said of
Articles 8(1) and 9(1), which constitute independent requirements.

The Respondent further disputes the Claimant's argument that the Mineral Water
Directive only binds EU Member States and is thus not directly applicable to private
parties." The Directive has been implemented through legislation in the Slovak
Republic and in Poland, which the Claimant would have breached by misleading
consumers.%2

Specifically, the Respondent invokes Articles 6(1)®% and 11(2)(a)(1)®* of the Slovak
Food Code, Articles 7(1)5°5 and 8(1)® of the Slovak Act on Consumer Protection, and
Articles 7(1)(2)®’ and 8(1)®8 of the Polish Mineral Water Regulation:®9

i. Slovak law governs the labelling and marketing of natural mineral water
extracted from the Legnava Sources although the bottling occurs in Poland.
Pursuant to the “state of origin” principle embedded in the Mineral Water
Directive, which “allows for no derogation in this regard”, the “Member State
in which natural mineral water is extracted must be responsible for controlling
every stage of its production”.*'° This includes the recognition as natural
mineral water, extraction, bottling, marketing and branding®"' and does not
foresee divided or shared responsibilities between Member States.*'2

ii. Pursuant to Article 11(2)(a)(1) of the Slovak Food Code, water from the
Legnava Sources cannot be “correctly described” as water from the Muszyna

region, on the ground that they broadly belong to the same “geological and
hydrogeological structure”. The decisive factor is that both sources belong to
the same “underground water deposit” or “accumulation area”, which is not
the case here.*'? Notably, Slovak authorities never agreed that the branding
of Muszynianka’s product be governed by anything but Slovak law.®"4

It is true that Article 7(1)(1) of the Polish Mineral Water Regulation allows the
use of a location as a tradename when the water is not only extracted from
that location, but also from a “neighboring region”.6® However, Article 7(1)(2)
requires that the use of a location “not mislead as to the place of water
extraction”.®"6 In this case, the water would be extracted in Legnava, not
Muszyna, yet “the use of the brand ‘Muszynianka Water’ would suggest that
the natural mineral water was extracted in Muszyna, when it was not”.*"7 This
would be misleading, particularly to Polish consumers, who according to the
Claimant’s own evidence show a strong preference for Polish products.®'8

Respondent contends that GFT Slovakia never disclosed to the State Spa
that it “would sell the water to its mother company to brand it under the

existing ‘Muszynianka’ brand recognized in Poland”.%'? In its Exploitation Permit

application,

GFT Slovakia did state that the water would be sold under the name “Skarb

Muszyny”, also a Polish name.®° However, while the State Spa Committee “never

reached the point” of commenting on that name, Ms. Bozikova made a handwritten note

2. The Claimant’s Position

a. GFT Slovakia would not necessarily have sold or transferred the
water to Muszynianka prior to bottling

Muszynianka submits that the Respondent “incorrectly assumes” that GFT Slovakia
would have sold or otherwise transferred the water extracted from the Legnava Sources
to Muszynianka (or another entity) prior to bottling.*? It insists that the “technical details”
of the production had not yet been devised.*° Thus, GFT Slovakia could have bottled
the water itself.6* Indeed, Muszynianka would not have risked “losing” GFT Slovakia’s
Exploitation Permit by “adopting a method of cooperation [...] that would not be compliant
with the permit or with Polish or Slovak law [...]’.8° For instance, as a common
arrangement in the consumer-packaged-goods industry, Muszynianka could have
“leased” a “production line” to GFT Slovakia in its Muszyna plant. This would have
allowed GFT Slovakia to bottle the water under its ownership and to then sell the final
product to Muszynianka. °°

In general, the Respondent's arguments on the alleged illegality of the investment are
“based solely on speculations as to the Claimant's future decisions and actions”.®” It is
Muszynianka’s submission that the Project cannot be deemed illegal for the mere fact
that it considered “various business options with respect to the mixing, branding or
labelling of the mineral water from the Legnava Sources”.°°

For the Claimant, it never took any final decision on how to market the water from the
Legnava Sources as the Project did not reach that stage.°° Notably, Ms. Bozikova
confirmed at the Hearing that there were no “final arrangements made by the Slovak
authorities with respect to the details of the Project which the Respondent now considers
illegal’.®°° At most, Ms. Bozikova stated that the “specifics of the Project” could have
been dealt with through conditions incorporated in an Exploitation Permit.®°' That being

so, the Respondent cannot question “a priori’ the Claimant's ability to adjust its plans
and follow any requirements imposed by the relevant authorities. °°?

b. There is no bottle-at-source requirement in the Mineral Water
Directive

346. According to the Claimant’s expert, Prof. Miller-Graff, neither the Mineral Water Directive
nor its Annex II contain a bottle-at-source requirement or any wording stating that mineral
water must be bottled before it can be exported. The alleged bottle-at-source principle
is taken from the CUEU’s German Packaging case.®* However, this decision dealt with
a factual pattern entirely distinguishable from the particulars of the Project.S°5 Moreover,
the Mineral Water Directive aims at ensuring that the production process guarantees the
quality of the water and the health of prospective consumers. The cross-border

infrastructure at issue in this case is compatible with those goals.®*

347. In any event, the Claimant stresses that the starting point of the interpretation of the

Mineral Water Directive in a way that “prohibits” the “trans-border production of mineral
water [...] manifestly violates the primary internal market law”.°*"

c. Muszynianka would have complied with all relevant laws on
mixing

It is the Claimant's argument that, contrary to the Inspectorate’s letter of 30 March
2010, the Mineral Water Directive does not prohibit the mixing of mineral water. In
fact, the Mineral Water Directive “does not touch upon the mixing of mineral water” at all,
as Prof. Miller-Graff confirmed. Given the Directive’s silence in this respect, ‘it is
necessary to analyse this question in the light of EU primary law and the directive’s
purpose”.5 In particular, Recital 5 of the Mineral Water Directive states that “[t]he
primary purposes of any rules on natural mineral waters should be to protect the health
of consumers, to prevent consumers from being misled and to ensure fair trading”. It
follows that if Muszynianka’s process of mixing preserves the characteristics of the
Legnava Sources, “there is no reason to prohibit the mixing” under EU law.®4” Since the
Legnava and Polish Sources share the same underground origin and chemical
composition, the Claimant is of the view that mixing would not be inconsistent with the
Mineral Water Directive.

With respect to Slovak law, the Claimant submits that its plan to mix would have also
complied with Article 9(2) of the Slovak Food Code. First, the Legnava and Polish
Sources are “part of the same geological and hydrogeological structure” (i.e., the aquifier
of the Piwniczna Sandstones formed in the geological unit of the Krynica Flysh),°° which
means that there is no justification for a division of this area.®' In particular, boreholes

LH-2A, LH-3, LH-4, and LH-5 all belong to the same natural output area of “Legnava —
Na Rovne’”,® a fact explicitly confirmed by the Respondent®? and Dr. Marcin.°*

As to the second requirement in Article 9(2) of the Slovak Food Code, the Claimant
asserts that the mineral waters from the Legnava and Polish Sources are of the same
chemical type. Prof. ZeniSova’s and Dr. Marcin’s findings to the contrary are premised
on the application of the Gazda Classification. In reality, the applicable test is the
Predominant lon Classification test, as it arises from Slovak regulation, according to
which natural mineral waters are classified by, inter alia, the “volume of predominating
ions”.© If that test is resorted to, all experts on record confirm that the Legnava Sources
and the majority of the Polish Sources are of the same hydro-geochemical type.®©” In
any event, even if the Gazda Classification were nevertheless deemed applicable, “all
the documents prepared prior to this arbitration”, particularly the 2008 Final Report and
the LH-2A to LH-5 Maximum Quantities Decision,®* state that the mineral water of the
Legnava Sources are of the same chemical type for purposes of the Gazda test.%9
Moreover, Dr. Marcin acknowledged at the Hearing that the majority of the Polish
Sources also had the same chemical type as the Legnava Sources, even according to
the Gazda test.%°

Regarding the third requirement under Article 9(2) of the Slovak Food Code (total
mineralization), the Claimant argues that “Prof. ZeniSova did not provide the results of
her own ionic balance calculations and assessed the hydrogeochemical type of the water
from the Legnava Sources incorrectly”.°' Therefore, any mineralization evaluations
made by Prof. ZeniSova are unreliable.®? What is more, she confirmed that she did not
study the allowable differences in the total mineralization of the Polish and Legnava

Sources.® In short, the Respondent has not established that the Claimant's business
concept would have violated any provision of Slovak law on mixing, branding, and
labelling of natural mineral water.®©4

352. With respect to Polish law, the Claimant asserts that its plan to mix the Legnava sourced

water with the Polish Muszynianka Water, and “to sell the water under the ‘Muszynianka’
brand, was in line with Polish law on mixing, branding, labelling, and marketing of mineral
water. Alternatively, under Polish law the Claimant was entitled to mix Legnava Sources
among themselves and to sell that mixed water under the ‘Muszynianka’ brand”.6®

353. Indeed, Article 20(3) of the Polish Mineral Water Regulation allowed Muszynianka to

“combine natural mineral waters originating from various boreholes” and to sell them
using a “single trade name”, if the waters met the “same requirements for chemical
qualification”.®° In this respect, the Claimant refers to its position under Slovak law and
argues that all of the Legnava and Polish Sources “originate from the same groundwater
resources” and contain natural mineral water of the “same hydrogeochemical type”.®7
Notably, the PNIPH had confirmed these facts in November 2010, concluding on the
basis of data submitted by Goldfruct at the time, that the Legnava Sources (i.e., LH-1 to
LH-5) produced water of the same chemical type.** As such, the extracted water could
be “combined” under Polish law “to obtain raw material for the production of bottled
natural mineral water”, subject to “the exploitation capacity of each borehole”.

354. Lastly, the Claimant argues that the Respondent misrepresents the meaning of Article

34 of the Polish Act on Nutrition Safety.°”° This provision concerns the “trading” in Poland
of the mineral water “extracted and bottled” in Poland or in another country.®”' Neither
that provision nor the Act more generally govern the recognition of natural mineral water
extracted in one EU Member State and bottled in another.

d. Muszynianka would have complied with all relevant laws on
branding, labelling and packaging

Regarding Article 8(1) of the Mineral Water Directive, the Claimant submits that the
legality of a trade description which refers to a location (e.g. “Muszynianka’ referring to
Muszyna) depends on the location of the “exploitation of the spring”, and not on the
location of the spring itself.67? Further, the term “exploitation” must not be construed
strictly to mean the place of the water's extraction.°”? For instance, Article 8(3) of the
Mineral Water Directive distinguishes “the name of the spring” from “the place of its
exploitation”.®4 Therefore, in an integrated cross-border production, such as the present
one, which the Mineral Water Directive does not envisage, the notion of “exploitation”
can well be viewed as the place of the last action in the production chain, here
Muszyna.°75

As to Article 9(1)(a) of the Mineral Water Directive, “the indication of the location of the
last substantive action in the chain of production before putting the bottled natural mineral
water on the market does not suggest a characteristic which the water does not
possess”. However, if the term “origin” in Article 9(1)(a) is read to mean only the
location of the spring, then branding the final product to indicate both the places of
extraction and bottling would serve the purpose of this provision, which is to avoid
misleading consumers. Accordingly, the water could, for instance, be sold as
“Muszynianka-Legnava’ water.s”’ While the Claimant had not yet defined these
modalities, it would have been willing to do so.6”@ Moreover, pursuant to Article 7 of the
Mineral Water Directive, the label would have further specified the name of the Legnava
Sources, their location, and the place where the water was bottled (just as Muszynianka
does with all its products).°”° This would have avoided any possible misrepresentations
to consumers.

357. Turning to the laws implementing the Mineral Water Directive or otherwise governing the
water's production process on the national level, the Claimant submits that its investment
and business plan would have complied with all the requirements set out in the Polish
Mineral Water Regulation. Referring specifically to Article 7(1)(1) of the Regulation, it
argues that using the Muszynianka Water brand would not have been misleading
because the Legnava Sources are in Muszyna’s “neighboring region”.®*' Indeed, not only
are the Legnava Sources in the vicinity of Muszyna, but the entire region constitutes one
“geographically and geologically homogenous area” divided only by the Poprad river.®2
For the same reason, the Claimant argues, the business plan would have met the “origin”
requirement in Article 11(2)(a)(1) of the Slovak Food Code (applicable quod non).*83

3. Analysis

358. The Tribunal will review the Respondent's illegality contentions in the order in which they
were raised, namely sale prior to bottling (a), bottling other than at source (b), and mixing
and branding (c).

a. The sale of the water from the Legnava Sources prior to bottling

359. An Exploitation Permit allows the permit holder, that is the “source user”, to extract,
treat, and bottle mineral water into consumer packaging.®® Article 13(2) of the Act on
Mineral Waters states that the “[rlights resulting from [a] mineral water exploitation permit
cannot be transferred to [others]”.°°° Accordingly, the source user must be the one
carrying out all production stages up to the bottling of the mineral water. It follows that
the source user cannot sell or otherwise transfer the extracted and treated water prior to
bottling. The Inspectorate made this clear to GFT Slovakia in its communication of
30 March 2010.%”

Turning to the facts, the Tribunal finds that the record does not establish that GFT
Slovakia would have sold the water to a third party prior to bottling. In response to an
invitation of the State Soa Committee to amend its Exploitation Permit application in light
of the Constitutional Amendment,®° GFT Slovakia expressly confirmed in December
2014 that the water from the Legnava Sources to be bottled in Muszyna would “fully
remain’ in its “ownership”.

In support of this assertion, the Claimant has given plausible explanations as to how GFT
Slovakia could have retained ownership over the water and still have bottled it in
Muszyna. Muszynianka could have leased a production line of its bottling plant to GFT
Slovakia, which would have sold the water to Muszynianka once it was bottled.®° As
noted by Mr. Mosur, this model is common in the consumer-packaged-goods industry®*"
and is used to produce “Muszynianka Plus’, one of the Claimant's star products.

The Respondent points out that the Claimant instructed its damages experts to base
their calculations on transfer pricing, and that this implies a transfer of ownership prior to
bottling.®°* This is the only evidence put forward by the Respondent to argue that the
Claimant would have breached the prohibition in Article 13(2) of the Act on Mineral
Waters. While the use of transfer pricing in the damage computations entails a transfer
of ownership, it says nothing about the timing of that transfer. Indeed, the transfer could
well take place after bottling. Damage calculations are in any event no substitute for
contemporaneous evidence and thus are insufficient to put into question GFT Slovakia’s
affirmation of December 2014 that the water would not be sold prior to bottling.

Hence, the Tribunal concludes that no illegality is established as far as the sale of the
water from the Legnava Sources is concerned.

b. Bottling other than at source

There is no question that it was a key aspect of the Project that the water from the
Legnava Sources be exported to Muszyna prior to bottling. Yet, the Respondent submits
that the “bottle-at-source” principle enshrined in the Mineral Water Directive prevents the

export of mineral water unless it has been packaged for the consumer. For the Slovak
Republic, this is because “the Directive requires the Member State in which mineral water
is extracted—the State of origin—to control every stage of its production, up to and
including bottling”.® In support, the Respondent refers to Article 1(1) and (5), Annex II
(2), (3), (4)(b), and Article 11 of the Mineral Water Directive.

The Tribunal has difficulty accepting that the bottle-at-source principle has the
significance which the Respondent seeks to assign to it. While the Directive does employ
the term “bottled at source”, it only does so with respect to spring water,®% not to mineral
water. Nowhere else does it refer to a bottle-at-source requirement.

As stressed by the Claimant’s EU law expert, Prof. Muller-Graff, the bottle-at-source
principle does not stem from the Mineral Water Directive but from the CJUEU in German
Packaging.®* It is correct that in that case the CJEU held that Article 3 of Directive
80/777/EEC, the predecessor of the Mineral Water Directive, in conjunction with its
Annex Il, indicated that natural mineral water must be bottled at source.®” Yet, in
German Packaging, the CJEU decided on the narrow issue of the (in)compatibility
between a system implemented by Germany seeking the re-use of packaged products
covered by Directive 80/777/EEC and Directive 94/62/EC (on packaging and packaging
waste). Notably, it dealt with the distinct (and in the present case irrelevant) question of
the trade hindrance resulting from the costs associated with transporting the mineral
water's packaging back to the original bottling location for it to be reused.

It is thus doubtful that the CUEU purported to set an unqualified bottle-at-source rule with
respect to mineral water as it is currently regulated by the Mineral Water Directive (as
opposed to Directive 80/777/EEC). As Prof. Miller-Graff opined, it is unlikely that
German Packaging pre-judges “the question of the passage of mineral water within an
integrated production process from extraction to bottling [...]’.5°8 It is even more unlikely
if one considers that many years after that decision and the adoption of the Mineral Water
Directive cross-border production of mineral water remains a “new phenomenon’ in the

industry.®°° The Parties have not pointed to any venture similar to the Project currently
being carried out within the EU or elsewhere for that matter. In those circumstances, the
Tribunal agrees with Prof. Muller-Graff that it is “very difficult to assume that the
European legislator [...] considered [...] the trans-border production” of water when
passing the Mineral Water Directive.”°°

That said, even if the Mineral Water Directive were to preclude cross-border exploitation
of mineral water, that preclusion could not be held against the Claimant. The Mineral
Water Directive is not a source of obligations that can be applied directly to the Claimant.
Rather, the Claimant's investment must be assessed on the basis of the implementing
legislation of the relevant EU Member States,” i.e., the Slovak Act on Mineral Waters
and Food Code and the Polish Mineral Water Regulation and Act on Nutrition Safety.

Prior to the Constitutional Amendment, there was no provision in the Act on Mineral
Waters, the Food Code, or elsewhere in Slovak law, prohibiting the export of unbottled
mineral water. At no time before this arbitration did the Slovak authorities oppose the
Project’s cross-border nature. To the contrary, in March 2010, the Inspectorate, which
already was under the direction of Ms. Bozikova, stated its having “no objections” to GFT
Slovakia’s plan to bottle the water from the Legnava Sources in Poland.” Ms. Bozikova
confirmed this absence of objections when she testified that, before the Constitutional
Amendment, the State Soa Committee considered giving “permission” to the Project,’°
a consideration given after receiving legal advice.” It follows that, prior to the
Constitutional Amendment, Slovak administrative authorities did not see Slovak law (or
the Mineral Water Directive) as being prohibitive of the Project’s cross-border nature.

An important debate surrounding the changes to the Act on Waters and the
Constitutional Amendment was whether the export of unbottled water was admissible
considering that underground water was the property of the State until extracted,”°° and
that State authorities may act only if authorized by the Constitution and legislation.” On

this basis, some MPs argued that the existing regulatory framework at the time already
prohibited the export of unbottled water.’°” This view was not shared by the Government.
As the Legislative Department of the Ministry of Health wrote to Ms. Bozikova in July
2014, the legislation then in force “did not prohibit cross-border transfers” of water but
rather that such activity was “unregulated”.’”°°

371. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent has not established that the cross-
border nature of the Project was per se illegal.

c. Mixing and branding

372. To simplify the analysis, the Tribunal will address the alleged illegalities linked to mixing
and branding together. Specifically, it will set out the content of the Claimant’s plans on
mixing and branding (i), determine which law governs these activities (ii), and assess
the legality of the Claimant’s mixing (iii) and branding (iv) plans.

i. The content of the Claimant’s plans on mixing and
branding

373. According to the Claimant, Muszynianka “never made any, not to mention binding,
decisions on the detailed aspects of introducing the mineral water from the Legnava
Sources to the market as a final product”.”°° In particular, the Claimant submits that the
“Project [never reached] a stage in which [it] would have to take final decisions on such
detailed aspects of the Project as the mixing of mineral water from the Legnava Sources
or bottling it separately from each source, or the branding [...] of the final product”.”"° On
this footing, the Claimant argues that the Respondent's illegality accusations with respect
to Muszynianka’s alleged plan to mix and brand the water from the Legnava Sources
should be dismissed as speculative.

(a) Branding

375. The production and marketing of underground natural mineral water in the EU is highly
regulated and subject to taxing technical requirements. The reason for such strict
regulation is to protect the health of consumers and to prevent consumers from being
misled.’'' These two objectives go hand-in-hand. As noted by Ms. Bozikova, “[t]he
composition of natural mineral water can have physiological influence on consumers”, ”!
which may be both positive and negative.’'* It is thus paramount “to ensure that
consumers buying natural mineral waters know exactly what mineral water they are
buying and drinking and what effect this mineral water may have on their physiological
condition”.’"

376. As a successful producer of natural mineral water in Poland, the Claimant has always
been aware of the challenges underlying the stringent regulation applicable to the
production of natural mineral water. In the words of Mr. Mosur, President of the
Management Board of Muszynianka:

Because of the product we offer, we are limited by the availability of the raw material
we can use. Being a natural mineral water, Muszynianka Water is subject to strict
monitoring of the composition, the origin of the water used for production, as well as
the method of production. Therefore, it would be unacceptable, and unthinkable, to
mix Muszynianka Water with spring water, e.g. extracted directly from the Poprad
River. We have a responsibility to maintain a relatively constant mineral content in
‘Muszynianka’ and ‘Muszynianka Plus’, which is only possible using boreholes with
a particular chemical specification. [...] [E]ven the waters produced by our neighbors
in the region [and] extracted from the neighboring areas, despite their good taste,
differ significantly from Muszynianka Water. This is because waters from two
neighboring boreholes, sometimes located only a few dozen meters from each other,
can have a different chemical composition[...]. Due to [these] circumstances, the
production of bottled natural mineral water is limited by the available quantity of water
with strictly defined parameters. In the case of Muszynianka Water, we have not
been able to meet the demand for several years. [...] Any further expansion of
Muszynianka, which is inseparable from an increase in production, will only be
possible when we obtain access to sources of mineral water with the composition
required to produce Muszynianka Water. 715

Mr. Cydito, Vice-President of Muszynianka’s Management Board, echoed Mr. Mosur's
observations:

We were aware of the unusual characteristics of Muszynianka Water. We knew it to

be extraordinary water. On the one side Muszynianka Water is highly mineralized

water, with a large amount of magnesium, calcium and bicarbonates, which are

essential elements for the proper functioning of the human body. On the other side,

contrary to other highly mineralized waters with similar qualities, Muszynianka Water

had a pleasant and neutral flavor. [...] Paradoxically, we are a victim of our own

success. The demand for Muszynianka Water steadily grows and it surpassed the

supply of this water long time ago. [...] We simply lack[ed] the raw material.7'®
Mr. Mosur further testified that the purchase of GFT Slovakia was prompted by the
understanding that the Legnava Sources have “an almost identical chemical composition
to those used for the production of Muszynianka Water”,’’” and that marketing “water
from Legnava under the ‘Muszynianka’ brand” would not be misleading, given that the
Legnava Sources are just “a few hundred meters away from Muszyna and that the entire
region is a geologically and geographically homogeneous area”.”® In short,
Muszynianka saw the purchase of GFT Slovakia and the exploitation of the Legnava
Sources as an opportunity to gain access to the raw material necessary to expand its
business in Poland.”'?

The record shows that Muszynianka did have fairly defined plans in terms of branding
the water from the Legnava Sources. Mr. Mosur’s first witness statement is unambiguous
in this respect. The water extracted from the Legnava Sources would be used to increase
the production of Muszynianka’s existing products “Muszynianka” and “Muszynianka
Plus”, in order to avoid launching a competing product;

Therefore, it was an increase in the production of Muszynianka Water [7°], a leading
Polish brand promoted over many years, rather than the launch of a completely new,
unknown brand to the market, which was economically justified. Producing water
under another trade name would be an entirely different investment objective which
we did not take into consideration. It is all the more true since such product would
compete with our ‘Muszynianka’ and ‘Muszynianka Plus’.72'

‘Muszynianka’. The connection of the boreholes in Legnava to those existing ones on the Polish side would precisely

make it possible to increase the production of Muszynianka Water. Otherwise, a new trade name would have to be
marketed”).

718 Mosur WS Il, CWS-5, 8.

720 The Tribunal notes that Mr. Mosur's first witness statement defines the trade description/names “Muszynianka"
and “Muszynianka Plus’, collectively, as “Muszynianka Water” (see Mosur WS I, CWS-1, 4 16).

Mr. Cydito again echoed Mr. Mosur’s evidence, emphasizing that the acquisition of GFT
Slovakia was intended to keep the supply of “Muszynianka” and “Muszynianka Plus” at
a high level and that promoting a new brand would be “madness”. ’22

These clear views on branding, which make perfect business sense, were substantially
attenuated in the second round of the Claimant’s submissions in this arbitration. In his
second witness statement, Mr. Mosur no longer referred only to the objective of
increasing the production of existing products. Rather, he referred to the broader
objective of increasing the production of water sold under Muszynianka’s “trademark”.
To that effect, he mentioned for the first time the possibility of introducing a third product
that, so long as it bore the trademark “Muszynianka”, could be distinguished from
“Muszynianka’” and “Muszynianka Plus”:

The most important thing was, and still is, to launch the Project that would allow us

to increase the production of water under the “Muszynianka” trademark. 723

Also, the name of the product itself could include an indication distinguishing the
product from existing products, i.e. “Muszynianka” and “Muszynianka Plus”, with a
further division into various assortments and carbonization levels. The most
important thing, however, was to market the water under the trademark
‘Muszynianka’, because it is this brand that consumers associate with the high
quality of our products. 724

Mr. Mosur similarly adjusted his earlier position at the Hearing, where he affirmed:

We didn't go as far as stating the exact name [the final product] would have. The

main part of the name would definitely be Muszynianka, but as to the second part,

whether it would be Muszynianka Plus, Muszynianka Legnava, Muszynianka GFT, |

can't say that yet. But | confirm that the main word "Muszynianka" would be part of

the name of the water coming from Slovakia.725
In the Tribunal’s view, the fact that the Claimant reformulated its branding plans after the
initiation of these proceedings is not accidental. Rather, it appears to be the result of the
Respondent’s submissions in its Statement of Defense that marketing water from the
Legnava Sources under the “Muszynianka” or “Muszynianka Plus’ trade
descriptions/names would be misleading under either EU, Slovak or Polish law. The
potential use of a trade description/name entailing a combined approach (such as
“Muszynianka-Legnava”) was mentioned only after it was flagged by Prof. Muller-Graff
(not by the Claimant or its top executives in either the contemporaneous documents or
in their prior testimonies) as a branding option that in his view, would not mislead

consumers.’ Indeed, as already seen, Mr. Mosur had earlier acknowledged that
marketing a new competing product was “an entirely different investment objective” that
Muszynianka “did not take into consideration” when acquiring GFT Slovakia.’2”

It is thus clear that the Claimant did have a clear strategy and plan for the branding of
the water from the Legnava Sources. That said, the Act on Mineral Waters does not list
the branding of the final product as an item to be specified in an application for the
issuance of an Exploitation Permit.’° Accordingly, Muszynianka was under no explicit
obligation to inform the State Spa Committee of any trade description/name to obtain the
Exploitation Permit. Ms. Bozikova confirmed this position at the Hearing, when she
stated that the brand name information included in GFT Slovakia’s application (i.e.,
“Skarb Muszyny”)’”° had been included by mistake, as the requirement was to indicate
the name of the source, not the brand.’*° Therefore, while the Ministry of Health would
at some point have to approve the branding of the final product,’*' the State Spa
Committee was to decide on GFT Slovakia’s Exploitation Permit even in the absence of
information on branding.”? In these circumstances, it makes sense that Muszynianka,
as a rational commercial actor, would have adapted its original branding plans at the
pertinent stage (i.e., post-Exploitation Permit), if necessary. Accordingly, the Tribunal will
assess the legality of both the Claimant's original and alternative branding plans.

(b) Mixing

The Claimant’s submissions refer to its “plan to mix water from the Legnava Sources
with the Polish sources of Muszynianka Water”’* or alternatively to “combine water from
the Legnava Sources only”.’*4 Mr. Mosur confirmed these plans on different occasions.
For instance, in his second witness statement:

Muszynianka [...] planned to extract water from the boreholes in Legnava in the
quantities approved by the Slovak authorities, transport the water to a treatment plant
and then transport it via separate pipelines to the plant in Poland. It is only in this
plant that the water [from the Legnava Sources] would be mixed [among
themselves].”°5

And at the Hearing:

MR ALEXANDER: [...] Mr Mosur, has it been your plan from the outset of your
acquisition of the shares in GFT Slovakia to send water in bulk via pipeline to Poland
and in Poland, to mix the waters, the source of which was Legnava, Slovakia, with
waters from Poland? Has that been the plan from the outset?

MR MOSUR: Yes [...]”°° Our presumption was that the water would be mixed, and |
still uphold that, that the water would be mixed.797

It is true that Mr. Mosur also testified that it was unclear “who” would mix the water, “how”
it would be mixed, and exactly “what” water would be mixed.”*° However, these
uncertainties do not change the fact that Muszynianka intended to produce a mixed
product. Indeed, the Claimant’s primary business objective was, consistent with its
commercial interests in both advancing and protecting its “Muszynianka” brand, to
market the water from the Legnava Sources as Muszynianka Water,’? which
necessitated mixing.”° In other words, mixing was an essential aspect of the Project.

ii. Law governing mixing and branding

The Claimant submits that Slovak law would govern the stages of production occurring
in Slovakia, i.e., the extraction and treatment of the water, and Polish law would govern
the remaining production steps taking place on Polish territory, i.e., mixing, bottling, and
branding. It also argues that the Respondent was in agreement. By contrast, the Slovak
Republic disputes having agreed to this division of applicable laws as it was unaware of
the specificities of the Project occurring in Poland. It also claims that the Slovak
authorities had in any event to ensure compliance with Slovak law throughout the entire
production process.

740 As to Slovak law, see at infra, 4 400. As to Polish law, see Polish Mineral Water Regulation, R-144, Article 20(3)
(‘{iJt is allowed to combine natural mineral waters originating from various holes and to name them using single
trade name if the water drawn from these holes meets the same requirements for chemical qualification”)(emphasis
added).

126

389. In support of its argument that the Respondent consented to Polish law applying to the
production steps occurring in Poland, the Claimant refers only to one contemporaneous
document: the Inspectorate’s letter to GFT Slovakia of 16 December 2010," which in
pertinent part reads as follows:

[Wle announce that the natural mineral springs in Legnava have been recognized
under the existing legislation as well as proceedings for an authorization for the use
and treatment of water from sources as well as the consequent inspection of
resources and the inspection of compliance with statutory conditions and conditions
arising from decisions on resource use and treatment of water from resources will
be carried out under the legislation of the Slovak Republic.

Since the natural mineral water will be filled into consumer packages in the bottling
plant located in the territory of the Republic of Poland, the process of inspection and
checking of compliance of the consumer packaging of the natural mineral waters
shall be subject to the legislative regulations in force in the Republic of Poland and
will be carried out by the competent authorities of the Republic of Poland.742
390. The Inspectorate’s letter was an answer to the following request that Mr. Kacvinsky,
managing director of GFT Slovakia, had filed in November 2010:74%

[Wle kindly ask you to provide your opinion on the inspection of our sources in
Slovakia. | understand that in the Slovak Republic you will inspect the quality of water

in the sources and after its treatment, its quantity and compliance with other
applicable legislation.

We have received an opinion from the Polish National Institute of Public Health that
the sources have been designated in compliance with the applicable regulations and
the analyses have been conducted in the required extent, and the Institute requests
a confirmation that in Slovakia the inspections will be carried out according to the
applicable EU directives and Slovak law.744
391. As can be seen from the quotation above, the Inspectorate’s letter indicates that the
“inspection and checking of compliance of the consumer packaging” was expected to be
performed by the Polish authorities pursuant to Polish law. That statement is in and of
itself of little assistance here. It seems obvious that Polish authorities acting in Poland
will apply Polish administrative law. It is a different question, however, one that the
Inspectorate’s letter leaves unanswered, whether GFT Slovakia, as holder of an
Exploitation Permit for water extracted from Slovak soil, would be required to comply with
Slovak law for the entire production process, including production activities taking place
outside of the Slovak Republic. After all, in its letter of 24 March 2010, GFT Slovakia
itself represented to the Inspectorate that it being a company registered in the Slovak

Republic, “the water will be supplied for bottling in line with the applicable Slovak
regulations”.745

392. The implementing legislations of the two member States involved are unhelpful to answer
the question posed here. Although at the Hearing Prof. Miller-Graff opined in favor of
shared responsibilities between States participating in a cross-border exploitation of
mineral water,’ implementing legislations must be interpreted in light of the Mineral
Water Directive.’4” For its part, the Directive is clear in assigning a dominant (if not
exclusive) role to the State of extraction and its regulations. That role does not
accommodate shared responsibilities:

i. Article 1(1) of the Directive empowers the “responsible authority” of the
Member State where the water is extracted to "recogni[ze]” the water as
mineral water.”*® Upon the initiation of the bottling process,”° that Member
State must inform the EU Commission that the recognized mineral water can
be added to the “list of natural mineral waters [...] published in the Official
Journal of the European Union”.’°° This means that had GFT Slovakia ever
gotten to the stage of finalizing its extraction, processing, and production
plan, the water that it would extract from the Slovak Republic would have had
to be recognized as natural mineral water and added to the EU's list of natural
mineral waters at the instance of the Slovak Republic. The notification to the
EU would require that the trade description, the source, and the place of
exploitation, would have to be identified by the Slovak authorities. ’5

ii. Moving forward into the production process, Article 3 states that “[nJatural
mineral water springs may be exploited and their waters bottled only in

(‘The Inspectorate carries out the following within the supervision: [...] maintains a list and informs the relevant

accordance with Annex II”.’5* Moreover, according to Section 1 of Annex II,
the “exploitation of a natural mineral water spring shall be subject to
permission from the responsible authority of the country where the water has
been extracted”.’°° Thus, the Slovak Republic had responsibility for ensuring
compliance with Annex II.

iii. | Section 4 of Annex II provides that “[t]he responsible authority in the country
of origin’, that is the country where the water is extracted,” “shall carry out
periodic checks to see whether’, inter alia, the “provisions” set out in Sections
2 and 3 of Annex II “are applied by the person exploiting the spring”.”©° This
makes clear that the Slovak Republic was responsible for the carrying out of
periodic checks in relation to water production.

iv. Section 2 of Annex II stipulates that the “[e]quipment for exploiting the water
shall be so installed as to avoid any possibility of contamination and to
preserve the properties, corresponding to those ascribed to it, which the
water possesses at source”.’° To that effect, “the conditions of exploitation,
particularly the washing and bottling equipment, shall meet hygiene
requirements; in particular, the containers shall be so treated or
manufactured as to avoid adverse effects on the microbiological and
chemical characteristics of the natural mineral water”.’” This makes clear
that the Slovak Republic was made responsible for the carrying out of
periodic checks in relation to hygiene requirements.

v. Finally, Section 3 of Annex Il states that “[w]here it is found during
exploitation that the natural mineral water is polluted and no longer presents
the microbiological characteristics laid down in Article 5, the person exploiting
the spring shall forthwith suspend all exploitation, particularly the bottling
process, until the cause of pollution is eradicated and the water complies with
the provisions of Article 5".”° Again, it was the Slovak Republic which was
made responsible for ensuring that the exploiting person suspended all

extraction and bottling activities in the event of pollution or of the fact that the
water no longer presented the same microbiological characteristics.

393. It follows from these provisions, that one state, the State of extraction, viz. the Slovak
Republic in this case, is responsible for the recognition of a determined natural mineral
water, ensuring the application of the Directive’s provisions to the production process
from extraction to bottling, and protecting the safety of the water so extracted from its
territory.

394. The State of extraction which recognizes the water has still further reaching
responsibilities. At the latest upon being bottled, mineral water becomes a commodity
that enjoys freedom of movement across the European internal market.’°° That freedom,
however, can be curtailed. A Member State which considers that a particular mineral
water “does not comply with the provisions” of the Mineral Water Directive, or “endangers
public health”, “may temporarily restrict” or even “suspend” the “trade [of] that product
within its territory”.’©° In that event, the State of extraction must “provide all relevant
information concerning [the] recognition of that water”,”*' which entails an approval of
the mineral water’s trade name/description, the “name of [its] source”, and the “place of
[its] exploitation’.”*? The same State must also provide “the results of the regular
checks”’® into the water’s “original purity”, “mineral content”, “trace elements” and “other
constituents” from extraction to bottling.’®

395. It is thus self-evident from the structure and explicit wording of the Mineral Water
Directive that the regulatory authorities of the Republic of Poland could take no step in
relation to all of the foregoing activities, with the exception of whatever Polish regulations
might also apply to the limited acts of bottling and marketing the mineral water.

396. Now, in a cross-border exploitation scenario such as that envisaged by Muszynianka in
the present case, the question arises how the authorities of the Member State where the
water is extracted could effectively discharge their functions given the territorial limits on

their regulatory powers. According to the Slovak Act on Mineral Waters, a mineral source
must be exploited in accordance with the Exploitation Permit,”°° which sets forth the
“method and conditions of exploitation”. The permit also provides for the monitoring of
the “hydrogeological, chemical, physical, microbiological and biological” content of the
water throughout the production process.”°” Moreover, a permit holder is required to
submit the results of the monitoring to the Inspectorate.’° Otherwise, the Exploitation
Permit may be revoked.’® The Inspectorate can monitor compliance through “remote
supervision”.’”° Ms. Bozikova explained at the Hearing that GFT Slovakia would have
been under an obligation to provide samples at various points of the production process,
including of water in bottles for assessment under the relevant Slovak decree.’”' That
process would have enabled the Inspectorate to inform the EU Commission about the
final product from the Legnava Sources, as required by the Act on Mineral Waters.’

397. The Tribunal further notes that, contrary to the interpretation offered by Prof. Miller-
Graff,’ the Polish Act on Nutrition Safety is consistent with its Slovak counterpart and
the EU Directive. Indeed, it provides that the decision to recognize mineral water, which
must cover its properties, trade name, label, and results of tests conducted throughout
production,’ can be taken either by the Polish “Chief Sanitary Inspector, if the water

has been extracted from a hole located in the Republic of Poland,’” or by the “competent
body of a different European Union Member State, if the water has been extracted from
a hole located in that state”.’”°

On the basis of the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Slovak law and where
pertinent EU law would have governed the entire production process of the water from
the Legnava Sources, and that the Slovak authorities had the responsibility of ensuring
compliance with the requirements set by EU and national law, an allocation of
responsibility which the Polish State recognized. As a result, Slovak law would have
applied to the mixing and branding of the water from the Legnava Sources. The Tribunal
observes further that, as a company incorporated under the law of the Slovak Republic,
GFT Slovakia would be fully subject to the regulatory control of the competent Slovak
authorities to whom it would be reporting.

In an attempt to avoid this conclusion, the Claimant argues that the Polish Act on Nutrition
Safety concerns only the trading in Poland of mineral water “extracted and bottled” in
Poland or in another country,’”’ and “does not regulate the situation of recognition of the
water as a natural mineral water extracted in one EU Member State, i.e., the Slovak
Republic, and then bottled in another Member State, i.e., the Republic of Poland”.’”®
According to the Claimant, it would “be for the Polish authorities to decide which
institutions are competent to recognize the mixed product that Muszynianka considered
producing”.’”° The Tribunal finds this argument unconvincing. It fails to reconcile such
purported exclusive application of Polish law with the clear language of the Mineral Water
Directive.

iii. Legality of the Claimant’s plans on mixing

According to Articles 8(1)(c) and 9(2) of the Slovak Food Code, mineral waters from

total “mineralization” of the individual sources does not differ more than the “natural
fluctuation of the total mineralization of the main source of mineral water”.”2

401. The Tribunal will review these three requirements for the two scenarios envisaged by the
Claimant, namely mixing the water from the Legnava Sources among themselves (a) or
with water from Polish sources exploited by Muszynianka (b).7°°

(a) Mixing the Legnava Sources among themselves
(aa) Output area

402. The term “output area” refers to an “area where water outflows to the earth surface”
whether naturally or through artificial boreholes.’®* The CJEU has held that mineral water
comes from the same “output area” (or, in the Mineral Water Directive, the same
“spring”),”®° if it “is drawn from one or more natural or bore exits”, and “originates in one
and the same underground water table or in one and the same underground deposit”.”°°
In hydrogeology, the term “underground water table” corresponds to the term “aquifer”
or “hydrogeological collector””®” and the term “underground deposit” corresponds to the
term “accumulation area”.”®

403. The Claimant only intended to exploit the Legnava Sources LH-2A to LH-5.”® It is now
common ground that these boreholes (i) share the same output area (i.e., the output
area of Legnava—Na Rovne);’°° (ii) originate in the same underground water table
(i.e., the same aquifer or hydrogeological collector),’°' referred to as the Piwniczna
Sandstones, the Krynica Flysh, or the Magura Nappe; and (iii) form in the same

underground deposit (i.e., the same accumulation area).’* It follows that this first
condition is fulfilled.

(bb) Chemical composition

Article 6 of Decree 100 provides that natural mineral waters are classified based on the
Predominant lon Classification (“PIC”).’°° Article 11 of Decree 100 further stipulates that
a basic analysis of mineral waters must contain the water's chemical indicators, which
are subject, inter alia, to “Gazda’s classification indices” (“Gazda”).”% It results from
these provisions that the determination of the chemical composition of natural mineral
water in the Slovak Republic involves the use of both the PIC and Gazda indices.’°

The Parties’ hydrogeology experts agree that, pursuant to the PIC, the water from
boreholes LH-2A and LH-5 have the same chemical composition, namely,
HCO3- Ca- Mg.”°° As to the Gazda classification, the Respondent's experts, Dr. Marcin
and Prof. Zenigova, opine that boreholes LH-3 and LH-4 have a different chemical type
of HCO3-Ca,”%” while their counterparts, Profs. Szczepariska-Plewa and Szczepaniski,
express no opinion as they conducted no analysis.

The documentation prior to this arbitration indicates that, pursuant to Gazda, the waters
from the Legnava Sources all share the same chemical composition of HCO3-Ca-Mg.
This is in particular true of the 2008 Final Report which GFT Slovakia commissioned
upon the discovery of boreholes LH-2A, LH-3, LH-4 and LH-5.’% The Ministry of
Environment approved the 2008 Final Report in May 2009 through the Maximum
Quantities Decision for these boreholes.”°° Nothing in the Maximum Quantities Decision
suggests that the Ministry of Environment did not properly scrutinize the 2008 Final
Report before approving its content and findings.

The Respondent criticizes the Maximum Quantities Decision for not conducting “its own
investigation to verify whether the findings of the [2008 Final Report] were accurate”.®°
At the same time, its experts who challenged these findings did not carry out their own
investigation either. They based their opinion merely on the data underlying the 2008
Final Report.®*' Yet, as the Respondent itself emphasizes, it is the “rea/ factual situation”
that is “decisive”, something that could only be “revealed” with certainty “during [an]
inspection of the waters”.°°2

. In conclusion, while it is uncontroversial that the Legnava Sources are of the same

chemical type under the PIC methodology, it is doubtful that they are pursuant to Gazda.
Under the circumstances and bearing in mind the burden of proof, the Tribunal finds that
it is not established that the Legnava Sources have a different chemical composition.

For the above reasons, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent has been unable to
establish satisfactorily that mixing Legnava Sources among themselves would fail to
meet the chemical composition requirement in the Slovak Food Code.

(cc) Fluctuation of mineralization

The Respondent's expert, Prof. ZeniSova, opined that this condition was not satisfied,
concluding that no combination of the Legnava Sources shows permissible differences
in terms of mineralization with respect to the “main source” as required by Article 9(2) of
the Slovak Food Code.* She explained that it was necessary to assess “two variants
for each combination [of boreholes], depending on which source is considered as the
main one”, yielding four scenarios: LH-2A and LH-5, LH-5 and LH-2A, LH-3 and LH-4,
and LH-4 and LH-3.°%*

Neither the Claimant nor its experts offered an assessment on this condition.
Nevertheless, the Claimant submits that Prof. ZeniSova’s mineralization fluctuation
analysis is unreliable because she “did not provide the results of her own ionic balance
calculations and assessed the hydrogeochemical type of the water from the Legnava
Sources incorrectly [by applying the Gazda test]”.®°>

The Tribunal understands that Prof. ZeniSova’s pairings are correlated to her conclusion
that, pursuant to the Gazda test, boreholes LH-2A and LH-5 are of the chemical type
HCO3-Ca-Mg, while boreholes LH-3 and LH-4 are of the chemical type HCO3-Ca. In
other words, Prof. Zenigova’'s analysis on mineralization is contingent on her
determination on chemical composition. However, the Tribunal has found above that the
latter was inconclusive. As a result, it cannot hold that the former is established.

. It follows that there is no clear evidence that mixing the Legnava Sources would have

shown impermissible fluctuation in terms of the water’s mineralization. Consequently, as
the Party bearing the onus of proving illegality,®°° the Respondent has not discharged its
burden to establish that the third condition would not be fulfilled. Hence, the Tribunal
must consider that the Claimant's plan to mix the water from the Legnava Sources among
themselves would not be illegal.

(b) Mixing the Legnava and the Polish Sources

The Tribunal notes that the Claimant’s plans to mix Legnava Sources with Polish sources
or to mix the Legnava Sources among themselves were alternative to each other. It also
notes that it appears reasonable to consider that, as rational economic actors, GFT
Slovakia and its owners would have opted for a lawful solution. As it was just established
that mixing the Legnava Sources among themselves was lawful, GFT Slovakia had in
any event a lawful option available and whether its other alternative was legal or not thus
loses its relevance. If it was illegal, it would simply have been abandoned (assuming it
was pursued at all) in favor of the first option.

On this basis, the Tribunal considers that it can dispense with the analysis of the
lawfulness of the plan to mix the Legnava and the Polish sources.

iv. The legality of the Claimant’s branding plans

As was discussed earlier, the Claimant had plans to market the water from the Legnava
Sources under its existing trade descriptions/names “Muszynianka” and “Muszynianka

806 See Gavrilovic and Gavrilovic d.o.o. v. Republic of Croatia, \CSID Case No. ARB/12/39, Award, 26 July 2018,

Jurisdiction, 21 December 2012, CLA-98, § 324 (“Respondent has failed to demonstrate that Claimants, as a factual
matter, committed illegalities in the process of acquiring their investment in the Argentine Airlines. In this respect,

No. 2012-2, Award, 15 March 2016, 5.59.

136

Plus”.®°7 Alternatively, it could have envisaged to market the water as “Muzynianka-
Legnava”.6°°

417. In its relevant part, Article 6(1) of the Slovak Food Code provides that the name of the
source or of its location can be added to the trade name or description, adding that the
consumer should not be misled about the “place of exploitation” of the water:

The trade description of mineral water [...] may be supplemented by the name of
source of mineral water or [...] by name of locality. municipality or place where the
source of mineral water or spring water is located, while the source is used in the
place determined by this labelling and secures that the labelling is not misleading
with respect to the place of exploitation of the mineral water [...]. °°°

418. The provision just quoted implements Article 8(1) of the Mineral Water Directive, the
language of which is worth quoting because it is clearer:

“The name of a locality, hamlet or place may occur in the wording of a trade
description provided that it refers to a natural mineral water the spring of which is
exploited at the place indicated by that description and provided that it is not
misleading as regards the place of exploitation of the spring”.°'°

419. Further, in line with Article (9)(1)(a) of the Mineral Water Directive,®" Article 11(2)(a)(1)
of the Slovak Food Code prohibits the use of indications that do not reflect reality,
especially in respect of the water’s origin:

It is forbidden [...] to use on the packaging, the label or in whatsoever form of
advertising such indications, names, trademarks, brand names, pictures or other
visual or other signs which in case of [...] mineral water suggest the characteristic
which the water does not possess, particularly regarding its origin, the date of
approving to exploit it, analyses results or any information to guarantees of
authenticity.®'2

 

420. It is clear from these provisions that the legislation seeks to avoid any possibility that
consumers be misled about the origin, source, or spring of the water.®"$ Or in the words

807 Supra, § 384.

808 Supra, { 384.

809 Slovak Food Code, R-60, Art. 6(1) (emphasis added).

810 Mineral Water Directive, R-40, Art. 8(1) (emphasis added).

811 Mineral Water Directive, R-40, Art. 9(1)(a) (“It shall be prohibited, both on packaging or labels and in advertising
in any form whatsoever, to use indications, designations, trademarks, brand names, pictures or other signs, whether
figurative or not, which (a) in the case of a natural mineral water, suggest a characteristic which the water does not
possess, in particular as regards its origin, the date of the authorisation to exploit it, the results of analyses or any
similar references to guarantees of authenticity”) (emphasis added).

812 Slovak Food Code, R-60, Art. 11(2)(a)(1) (emphasis added).

813 The Claimant specifies that it would indicate the actual source of the water on the label, together with the
chemical composition as required (Reply, §§ 154-155). Hence this is not the dispute here. It rather hinges upon the
use of a potentially misleading trade name, such as “Muszynianka” or “Muszynianka Plus” for water sourced in
Legnava.

of the CJEU, the purpose “is to ensure that, in each case, the [...] indication of the place
of exploitation of a natural mineral water enables consumers, when making a purchase,
to unequivocally identify the provenance of the water in question [...]”.°"4

This rationale is evident from Articles 11(2)(a)(1) of the Food Code and 9(1)(a) of the
Directive and may be also seen from Article 6(1) of the Slovak Food Code and the
corresponding Article 8(1) of the Directive and. Indeed, the latter provisions emphasize
the concept of exploitation, which is not equivalent to “extraction”. Article 8 of the Mineral
Water Directive distinguishes between “the name of the spring” and the “place of its
exploitation’,®'> and Annex II of the Directive indicates that the terms “extraction” and
“exploitation” are distinct, albeit related, as it confirms that exploitation includes all
production stages up to bottling.®"°

In a project where the production would have been spread over two locations in two
countries, i.e., Legnava and Muszyna, a trade name such as “Muszynianka” or
“Muszynianka Plus” that alludes to only one of these locations may be regarded as
misleading.

In this context, the Tribunal cannot accept Prof. Miller-Graff’s suggestion that a trade
description showing only “the location of the last substantive action and responsibility in
the chain of the production’, namely bottling in Muszyna, would not mislead
consumers.®” Precisely because the Project entailed a cross-border exploitation of the
Legnava Sources, all of which would have originated in the Slovak Republic, the water's
“provenance” cannot be circumscribed to Polish territory alone.

This conclusion arises even more clearly from the application of Articles 11(2)(a)(1) of
the Slovak Food Code and 9(1)(a) of the Mineral Water Directive, which prohibit
indications on the origin of the water that are not consistent with reality. How could a
consumer know that the water's origin is Legnava in Slovakia when the trade name refers
to Muszyna in Poland? To ask the question is to answer it: branding the water from the

815 Mineral Water Directive, R-40, Art. 8(3) (‘When the labels or inscriptions on the containers in which the natural
mineral waters are offered for sale include a trade description different from the name of the spring or the place of
its exploitation, that place of exploitation or the name of the spring shall be indicated in letters at least one and a
half times the height and width of the largest of the letters used for that trade description”).

816 Mineral Water Directive, R-40, Annex II, § 1 (“Exploitation of a natural mineral water spring shall be subject to
permission from the responsible authority of the country where the water has been extracted” [...]) (emphasis
added), § 2 (“the conditions of exploitation, particularly the washing and bottling equipment, shall meet hygiene
requirements [...]. However, point (d) need not be applied to mineral waters extracted, exploited and marketed in
the territory of a Member State [...]”)(emphasis added).

Legnava Sources as “Muszynianka” or “Muszynianka Plus” would be misleading and,
hence, contrary to the law. The same cannot be said with respect to a trade name such
as “Muszynianka-Legnava”. Such name would cover the two locations involved in the
production and thus conform to reality. Hence, it would not be misleading and would not
breach the law. Since the Claimant could lawfully have adopted such brand at the
appropriate moment in the development of its business plan and of the regulatory
process, the Tribunal holds that this aspect of Muszynianka’s branding plans was legal
albeit late discovered, i.e., elaborated in the course of this arbitration.

In conclusion of this review of the Respondent's illegality objection, the Tribunal cannot
but dismiss that objection. This conclusion will also play a role in the assessment of the
FET claim which follows.

B. FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT
1. The Claimant’s Position

Muszynianka primarily claims that the Respondent breached the guarantee of fair and
equitable treatment prescribed in Article 3(2) of the BIT by violating its legitimate
expectations.

The Claimant submits that Article 3(2) constitutes an “unqualified FET standard
formulation”.®'® It makes no reference to the minimum standard of treatment under public
international law,®'? showing that the Contracting Parties did not intend to limit the
protection to a customary international law minimum standard.®° Rather, Article 3(2)
provides a broad scope of protection, which requires the State to preserve the investor's
legitimate expectations, and to act in good faith, in a transparent, consistent, and non-
discriminatory manner.®?"

With respect to legitimate expectations, the Claimant argues that they may arise both
from specific assurances and from the legal framework existing at the time of the

Claimant is entitled to rely as Goldfruct’s successor-in-interest:825

In July 2009, the State Spa Commission officially recognized the water from
boreholes LH-2A to LH-5 as springs of natural mineral water.®2

In March 2010, the Inspectorate expressly stated that it had “no objections
against [GFT Slovakia’s] plan of us[ing] the natural mineral sources in
Legnava’”,®3 which at the time “included the main premise of the Project”,
i.e., the cross-border transportation of the extracted water.®4

In December 2010, the Inspectorate confirmed that the inspection of the
Project would be conducted in both Slovakia and Poland, with a division of
competences,®°> according to which, inspection of the bottling process and
marketing of the water would be carried out in Poland by Polish authorities,
and all preceding stages would be assessed in Slovakia by Slovak
authorities. °°

In February 2012, the State Spa Commission “acknowledged that cross-
border pipelines [would] be built by GFT Slovakia in order to transport the
mineral water from the Slovak Republic to a bottling plant in Poland”. It voiced
no objection provided GFT Slovakia obtained a building permit. Immediately
thereafter, GFT Slovakia undertook the first steps to this effect.%97

In June 2012, the Municipality of Legnava granted the Zoning Permit,®* by
which the “Mayor of Legnava officially acknowledged the cross-border water
transport from Legnava to Muszyna as a part of the Project”.899

In July 2012, the Ministry of Environment confirmed the legality of the
construction of cross-border pipelines. It also confirmed that there were no
impediments against the exploitation of the prescribed amount of water from
the Legnava Sources. It explained that natural mineral water extracted from
the ground could not be deemed exclusive property of the Slovak Republic

and should be considered as “goods” subject to the EU rules on free
movement of goods, by which the Ministry of Environment confirmed the
legality of cross-border water transport.®*° Importantly, the Ministry's position
was prompted by an opinion of the EU Commission’s Internal Market
Problem Solving Network (“SOLVIT”) Centre for Slovakia, which had earlier
confirmed that unbottled water was a “commodity” under EU law and was
thus protected by the free movement of goods principle governing the EU
internal market.®*"

In September 2012, after receiving GFT Slovakia’s first supplement to its
Exploitation Permit application,* the State Spa Committee confirmed that
(i) the application was “satisfactory” and “me[t] the requirements under the
Act on Mineral Waters”; and (ii) the “only obstacle to issue the Exploitation
Permit” was the lack of the Building Permit.83 This gave GFT Slovakia
reason to believe that the Exploitation Permit would be issued upon
presenting the Building Permit.®4

429. The Claimant further states that the Slovak authorities gave “at least three clear and

specific assurances” after Muszynianka acquired GFT Slovakia,®> manifesting support

for the Project and its cross-border nature:

In October 2013, the State Spa Committee provided a “binding, positive
standpoint in the context of” the Building Permit proceedings.*° This was
significant because that permit would allow GFT Slovakia not only to build a
mineral water treatment plant, but also to lay the pipelines under the Poprad
river that were necessary for the cross-border production infrastructure.”

ii. In May 2014, the District Office in PreSov issued the Building Permit,®* which
referred to the numerous “binding” and “positive standpoints” issued by other
authorities, including but not limited to the Ministries of Justice and Health.
Moreover, the Building Permit was “issued specifically for the purposes of
filing it with the State Spa Commission in order to finally obtain the
Exploitation Permit for the Legnava Sources”.*49

ii. In July 2014, Minister Ziga publicly stated that the “then-existing legal
framework” did not prohibit the “transfer and transportation” of water abroad
“via pipelines and tanks” or otherwise.®°

The Claimant contends that the representations enumerated above establish its case for
legitimate expectations.**' Through the Constitutional Amendment and the denial of the
Exploitation Permit, the Respondent eradicated these expectations and, therefore,
breached the FET standard in Article 3(2) of the BIT.®52

Irrespective of any specific allowances, it is Muszynianka’s submission that the
regulatory framework existing prior to the Constitutional Amendment also gave rise to
legitimate expectations that the Project could be carried out as originally intended.®3 The
Claimant accepts that the FET standard does not imply that the legal framework remains
static. However, the host State should implement changes in “a reasonable and

of water exports was ambiguous”,®” Article 2(3) of the Constitution provides that
“[e]veryone may do what is not forbidden by a law and no one may be forced to do what
the law does not enjoin”.858 Hence, so says the Claimant, “despite being a novelty”, GFT
Slovakia’s operation could be “legally launched”.®° As confirmed by Ms. Bozikova at the
Hearing, at the time when GFT Slovakia submitted the Exploitation Permit application,
the State Spa Committee considered giving “permission” to the Project.*°

Prior to making the regimes changes, nothing suggested that the legal framework for the
export of natural mineral water “could change”.®*' Neither the SMER’s 2012 Programme
Declaration, nor the Water Resolution that followed, warned about forthcoming
restrictions or limitations as to the transportation of mineral water.®©2 Indeed, so says the
Claimant, the Water Resolution was “primarily aimed” at protecting drinking water (not
mineral water) in Zitny ostrov, located on the country’s southern border, hundreds of
kilometers away from Legnava in the north. Notably, unlike Legnava, Zitny ostrov had
been a “Protected Water Management Area” since 1978.%3

Furthermore, the Claimant reiterates that control over the sustainable exploitation of
natural mineral water already existed in Slovak regulation (hence, the Maximum
Quantities Decisions).*** Therefore, at the time, it could not be anticipated that cross-
border transport of water in bulk would be prohibited, especially considering that the
“method of transport has no influence on the sustainability” of the exploitation of a water
source,®° and that, according to the Water Report, 140 out of the 141 hydrogeological
regions in the country presented a “favorable [water] balance” and thus “the possibility
of further problem-free exploitation of groundwater resources”.®°°

In sum, Muszynianka argues, it could not have expected the disproportionate and
unreasonable content of the Constitutional Amendment.®”’ This is particularly so given

that, as late as 2 July 2014, the Slovak Government “simply” sought the introduction of

a “fee for water export”.°° The decision to ban the cross-border transport of water in

unbottled form was taken practically “overnight”,®°° when on 8 July 2014 the approach
changed “dramatically”,®”° aligning with “nationalistic sentiments” that targeted the

Claimant.®7!

In respect of the general legal framework, the Claimant also argues that GFT Slovakia

had a “legal right’®”? to the issuance of the Exploitation Permit:875

By supplementing its Exploitation Permit application on 1 August 2012,874
GFT Slovakia met all the positive conditions required by the Act on Mineral
Waters for the issuance of that permit.2"5 The declaration of the Legnava
Sources as natural mineral water had been given years before,*’° and the
State Spa Committee itself stated that the application was complete.®7”
Moreover, at the time, none of the three negative conditions set out in the
Act on Mineral Waters calling for the denial of the Exploitation Permit could
have been established.®7*

Accordingly, as all the conditions were met on 1 August 2012,879 the State
Spa Committee was under an obligation to issue the permit within 60 days
pursuant to Article 49(2) of the Administrative Procedure Code.%°
Approximately 40 days had already passed between the initial application in
December 2011 and the stay of the proceedings in February 2012.2!
Consequently, 20 days remained for the administrative proceedings to end,
with the result that the Exploitation Permit should have been issued on 21

August 2012.82 Had the 60-day time limit been respected, GFT Slovakia
would have been entitled to exercise its rights under the Exploitation Permit
at least until 15 March 2018, even if the Constitutional Amendment had then
entered into force.®° Indeed, it could have secured the other permits (the
occupancy and water treatment permits) before the entry into force of the
Constitutional Amendment on 1 December 2014.84

437. By contrast, the Slovak Republic took steps contrary to its own domestic law and the
Claimant's legitimate expectations:

882 Reply, fn. 230.

The State Spa Committee unlawfully stayed the Exploitation Permit
proceedings in February 2012 “due to the need to first resolve the preliminary
issue” of the Building Permit; and maintained that stay in September
2012.86 Yet, a building permit is not a requirement to secure an Exploitation
Permit,°”7 and thus the State Spa Committee had no basis to stay the
proceedings.®

The State Spa Committee never requested an extension of the 60-day time
period to issue the Exploitation Permit pursuant to Article 49(2) of the
Administrative Procedure Code.®° This provision foresees the possibility of
an extension “when an administrative authority is not able to decide within
the statutory time-limits due to the need to properly establish the facts”.®%°
Rather than availing itself of that provision,®*' the Committee remained
inactive for months and “simply waited for the Constitutional Amendment to
come into force” in order to deny the Exploitation Permit on that basis
alone.®2

438. Lastly, the Claimant argues that the Respondent independently breached the FET
standard by targeting the Claimant through the Constitutional Amendment. In
response to the Respondent’s argument that it should have expected the introduction of
the Constitutional Amendment,®% Muszynianka stresses that awareness of coming legal
changes “does not exculpate the State’s willful targeting”.®°

2. The Respondent's Position

439. The Respondent argues that the FET standard of the BIT is “substantially identical to the
current minimum standard of treatment in customary international law’.®%° Relying on
Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT, which provides that tribunals must take into account the
relevant rule of international law applicable to the relations between the treaty parties, it
argues that the customary minimum standard of treatment “constitutes such a rule” and
should guide the interpretation of the FET standard in the BIT.” Accordingly, the
Respondent argues, a breach of FET is “subject to a high threshold and requires a
balanced analysis of the State’s conduct and that of the investor, including the level of
the investor's due diligence and its assessment of risk associated with entering into a
particular business environment”.®8

440. Expectations, so says the Respondent, are only protected if they are based on
“assurances” given by the host State “at the time the investment was made and relied
on” by the investor.8° These assurances must be “specific”. Similarly, legitimate
expectations with respect to the stability of the legal framework can only arise if the host

investment,%°? and the changes were not foreseeable at the time of the investment.°°

Against this backdrop, the Respondent contends that the FET claim must fail, even if the
Tribunal were to hold that the Constitutional Amendment was not an appropriate exercise
of Slovakia’s police powers quod non.%4

Regarding the general legal framework,°°> the Respondent argues that the Claimant's
reliance on Article 2(3) of the Constitution is inapposite®* and ignores Article 2(2) which
allows state authorities to “act only on the basis of the Constitution, within its limits, and
to the extent and in a manner defined by law”.°°” Moreover, the Respondent submits that
Muszynianka knew or should have known about the impeding changes to the Slovak
legal framework on waters.%8 Contrary to the Claimant's allegations,%® the March 2012
Programme Declaration was not limited to control and protection over access to water
by the local population.*'° When it came to environmental protection and to the regulation
of water resources, “everything was on the table”.°"' In fact, the Claimant itself concedes
that the “main area of concern” for the Slovak Republic “was the alleged threat of
uncontrolled exploitation and export of water from the Southern Slovakia”.9"? There was
no reason to believe that the Government's focus would be exclusively on Zitny ostrov.2"°

As the Programme Declaration shows, the SMER intended to protect all water

sources.°"4

Furthermore, for the Respondent, the Water Report should have alerted the Claimant. It
similarly concluded that water was a “strategic raw material” and called for regulation.°'5
In particular, it provided that the Government “reserve[d] the right to make decisions on
the disposal, transport and transfers of groundwater resources outside the territory of the
[Slovak Republic] in accordance [with] the public interest of the state”.°'® To that effect,
it further recommended the implementation of measures “requir[ing] consent of the
Government of the [Slovak Republic] or under Resolution of the Government of the
[Slovak Republic] for the given specific transfer or transport across the state borders”.9'7
This shows that the Government was publicly considering a “major overhaul” of the legal
framework on waters, with “specific focus” on cross-border transport.%"8

Moreover, so says the Slovak Republic, the Water Resolution that followed shortly
thereafter made it clear that stricter regulation was coming and that projects concerning
water export would require approval,?!° meaning that “some water export projects would
not meet the criteria and would be banned”.°?° A cross-border ban of Muszynianka’s
Project was thus a “possibility”, just as a denial of its Exploitation Permit when the
amendment announced in the Water Resolution would eventually come into force.%?!

The Respondent insists that Muszynianka chose to invest notwithstanding these facts,
which were amply publicized and discussed. In this context, the Claimant's argument
that the measures under discussion in 2012 were narrower in scope than those ultimately
introduced through the Constitutional Amendment is irrelevant.%”? Given that the Slovak
framework on waters was not created to attract foreign investment and that no
assurances were given that it would remain unchanged,° the Slovak Republic was not
“hamstrung” by the matters addressed in 2012 when considering the Constitutional

446. Regarding the legal framework,*”° the Respondent argues that the Claimant was not
entitled to the issuance of the Exploitation Permit before the Constitutional Amendment.
It puts forward six main arguments in support.

447. First, the positive conditions listed in the Act on Mineral Waters set out the “minimum
requirements” to be considered by the State Spa Committee.%*° Nothing prevented the
State Spa Committee from considering other “lawful prerequisites”, such as compliance
with the Slovak rules on water mixing, branding, and bottling,°*' which the Claimant's
plan failed to do.

448. Second, the negative conditions provided in the Act on Mineral Waters allow the State
Spa Committee to deny an Exploitation Permit on public interest grounds, %*? embodying
an overriding duty of administrative bodies that goes beyond conformity with the law. 3
The notion of public interest entails an element of discretion®** and encompasses “the
majority of facts that GFT Slovakia and Muszynianka withheld from the Spa
Committee”,°* especially the Claimant's intention to mix and to sell the water from the
Legnava Sources as Muszynianka Water. Having failed to disclose such material

aspects of the Project, the Claimant could have no legitimate expectations to obtain the
Exploitation Permit.°°

Contrary to the Claimant's allegations,%°’ the State Soa Committee never declared that
the Project was in conformity with public interest during the Building Permit proceedings.
It expressed no opinion about the legality or the public interest associated with the overall
Project.938

Third, the Claimant could not have expected the Exploitation Permit by 21 August 2012
in any event, °° as the application was only complete on 11 July 2014 with the submission
of the Building Permit that the State Spa Committee had required in February 2012.94°
Notably, GFT Slovakia never challenged the State Spa Committee’s decision to stay the
proceedings due to the lack of the Building Permit, which it could have done if it believed
that the decision was improper.%*'

Fourth, any delay in the State Spa Committee’s decision over the Exploitation Permit
had no effect on the validity of such decision. The time limits provided in the
Administrative Procedure Code are “disciplinary procedural deadlines”.%*? Their non-
compliance “cannot by itself cause unlawfulness of the decision of the administrative
authority and the participant may not derive any rights from these time limits in relation
to the substantive decision”.%?

Fifth, even if the Exploitation Permit had been issued before the Constitutional
Amendment, quod non, the Claimant could not have expected to exercise its rights under

officio to bring it into conformity with the Constitution as amended.%6 Such a modification
would have been “perfectly lawful” under the “untrue retroactivity” rule in Slovak law.%7

Sixth and last, the Claimant could not have expected to obtain the occupancy permits
before the adoption of the Constitutional Amendment as these permits could only been
issue upon completion of the relevant works, i.e., of the water treatment plant and the
related pipelines.%**

In connection with the “specific assurances” which it allegedly gave, the Slovak Republic
submits that the Claimant’s argument fails for “two independent reasons”.°9 First, the
Slovak Republic could not have approved the Project, because neither GFT Slovakia nor
Muszynianka ever disclosed all of the details of the Project.%° The Claimant never
disclosed that it would mix the Legnava Sources, nor that it would transfer the water to
another entity for bottling, nor that the mixed water would be sold under the Muszynianka
brand.°5' Had the Claimant done so, the Slovak authorities would not have granted the
Exploitation Permit, irrespective of the Constitutional Amendment.%52

Second, while the Slovak authorities may have approved discrete parts of the Project, it
did not grant all the applications necessary to carry out the Project. Each of the individual
permitting authorities only makes findings on the matters assigned to it and it expresses
no views on the Project as a whole.%3 In any event, the Claimant's allegations with
respect to the specific assurances purportedly given before and after its purchase of GFT
Slovakia are misleading.°°+

The Respondent therefore submits that Muszynianka had no legitimate expectations to
exploit the Legnava Sources pursuant to the Project. Accordingly, the claim with respect
to Article 3(2) of the BIT must be dismissed.°5

3. Analysis

457. The Tribunal will start by setting out the content of the FET standard in so far as relevant
(a). It will then review whether the Claimant had legitimate expectations arising from
specific assurances and, if so, whether these expectations were breached (b).
Thereafter, it will examine the alleged FET breaches related to Slovakia’s legal
framework, including the claimed entitlement to the issuance of the Exploitation Permit
(c), the adoption of the Constitutional Amendment (d), and the State Spa Committee’s
conduct during the Exploitation Permit proceedings (e).

a. Content of FET standard

458. Article 3(2) of the BIT reads as follows:

Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment within its territory
of the investments of the investors of the other Contracting Party. [...]

459. A first question is whether this language reflects the customary international law
minimum standard of treatment, as the Respondent argues, or whether it embodies a
broader autonomous standard, as the Claimant submits. Unlike some other treaties, the
BIT does not refer to the “international minimum standard” or similar wording.°° Rather,
the Treaty speaks of “fair and equitable treatment”. The question thus becomes what
these words mean.

460. In light of the rules for treaty interpretation as codified in Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT
and, in particular, the primacy of the Treaty’s text,°°” the “ordinary meaning” of the terms
“fair and equitable” is of little assistance in this inquiry.°% These notions can “only be

defined by terms of almost equal vagueness”, such as ‘just’, “even-handed”,
“unbiased”, and “legitimate”. Although vague, these terms “are susceptible of
specification through judicial practice and do in fact have sufficient legal content to allow
the case to be decided on the basis of law”.%°

461. Irrespective of the difficulty of capturing the elusive essence of FET, and of the nuances
in the formulation of the standard by each tribunal, there is a common understanding of
the core elements of FET among investment treaty tribunals. Autonomous FET
provisions, such as Article 3(2) of the BIT, have been deemed to protect against State
conduct that frustrates an investor's reasonable and legitimate expectations, ®" or that is
otherwise contrary to the minimum standard of treatment, unreasonable, discriminatory,
disproportionate, or overall lacking in good faith, due process, transparency and
consistency.® The Tribunal shares this understanding.

462. In line with the standard set out above, a State fails to accord FET if it does not respect
the legitimate expectations which the investor held at the time of the making of the
investment. This raises the question of the scope of protection of the investor's legitimate
expectations. The Tribunal finds that the main components of the doctrine of FET and
legitimate expectations are helpfully summarized by the tribunal in Antaris v. Czech
Republic.°** To qualify as legitimate, the investor's expectations must be based on
assurances (i) given by the State in order to encourage the making of the investment; (ii)
addressed specifically to the investor; and (iii) that are sufficiently specific in content. In
addition, an investor must establish that it placed reliance upon the assurance. While

some arbitral decisions may have chosen a broader definition of legitimate expectations,

the cumulative three-pronged test just referred to well respects the essence of FET in

this Tribunal's opinion, which is confirmed by numerous investment treaty awards.° In

keeping with this test, the Tribunal will examine the assurances allegedly given by

Slovakia to the Respondent, both before and after its acquisition (b).

The Claimant also invokes legitimate expectations arising from Slovakia’s general legal

framework, specifically expectations that:

The Respondent would comply with its own substantive administrative law
and issue the Exploitation Permit, to which GFT Slovakia had a “legal right”
before the Constitutional Amendment.

The Respondent would not dismantle the legal framework existing at the time
of making the investment, which allowed for the cross-border exploitation of
underground mineral water,%’ through unforeseeable, unreasonable,
discriminatory, disproportionate and inconsistent measures such as the
Constitutional Amendment.°®

The Respondent would comply with its own procedural law and decide on
the Exploitation Permit in a timely manner, instead of delaying the
administrative proceedings in order to deny the Exploitation Permit pursuant
to the Constitutional Amendment.

464. In the Tribunal’s view, these allegations cannot be properly characterized as claims

based on legitimate expectations under FET.

465. First, whether GFT Slovakia had an entitlement to the issuance of the Exploitation Permit
under Slovak law concerns the interpretation and application of the Respondent's
domestic law as part of the applicable law pursuant to Article 7(3) of the BIT.°”° If the
Tribunal were to establish that GFT Slovakia indeed held a right to the Exploitation Permit
under Slovak law, the question that ensues is whether the failure to recognize that right
through the denial of the Exploitation Permit was arbitrary or otherwise contrary to FET.
This inquiry, however, is required irrespective of legitimate expectations.

466. Second, absent specific assurances, FET does not protect expectations in relation to the
stability of a State’s legal framework,°”' at least when the legal framework was not
adopted to attract foreign investments. %”* The Claimant does not identify any specific
assurances that the Respondent would maintain its laws on water exploitation. Nor did
the Claimant rely on any Slovak legislation or regulation adopted to encourage
investments. Hence, the Claimant's submission that it had legitimate expectations that
the Respondent would not dismantle the legal framework applicable at the time of the
investment through the Constitutional Amendment is ill-conceived. States are free to
modify the legal regime applicable at the time of the investment to the extent they do so
within the limits prescribed by FET.°”° Accordingly, regardless of the investor's
expectations, FET bars unreasonable, discriminatory, or disproportionate reforms,
adopted contrary to due process.°”*

Award, 19 December 2013, § 629.

972 For cases recognizing upholding legitimate expectations regarding legal frameworks deemed to (i) have
contained specific guarantees; and/or (ii) have been adopted precisely to attract foreign investors and encourage
their investments, see e.g. LG&E Energy Corp, LG&E Capital Corp and LG&E International Inc v Argentine

873 Contrary to the Claimant's submissions, the foreseeability or predictability of a State measure is not a yardstick
to determine whether a legislative or regulatory change is FET-compliant. While the Tribunal is familiar with the
often-repeated formula that predictability is central to FET, it also notes that this assertion is rarely, if at all,
substantiated. The Tribunal is unaware of a generally accepted principle requiring changes in the legal framework
of a State to be predictable or foreseeable, and the Claimant has pointed to none. Moreover, the inaptness of
predictability as a self-standing component of FET is underscored by the fact that even a foreseeable measure can
be in breach of FET. An investor may foresee that the host State is likely to adopt arbitrary, unreasonable,
discriminatory, disproportionate or other measures contrary to FET. Yet, that would not preclude the host State’s
international responsibility for a breach of FET (see e.g. ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management
Limited v. Republic of Hungary, |CSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award, 2 October 2006, CLA-40, § 424).

Third, FET implies that State authorities are under an obligation to act in good faith in
accordance with the law that governs them.®’ The non-compliance with domestic laws
by State authorities may form the basis of a successful FET claim, if (i) there is proof of
arbitrary conduct in the application of the laws in question; or (ii) there is some form of
abuse of power.°”6

Consequently, the Tribunal will examine the foregoing allegations under the components
of FET not linked to the protection of expectations, in sections (c) to (e) below

b. | Muszynianka’s expectations based on specific assurances

The Claimant submits that, upon the purchase of GFT Slovakia, it legitimately expected
that (i) “the Exploitation Permit for the Legnava sources would be issued and that it would
be allowed to transport the extracted water from the Slovak Republic to Poland in the
way it intended from the very beginning”;9’’ and (ii) that ultimately it would be able to
“capitalize from its investment” through the increased production of Muszynianka
Water.°’8 It claims that such expectations were based on specific assurances given by
the Respondent before and after its acquisition of GFT Slovakia in December 2012.°”°

Pre-investment, the Claimant alleges specific assurances contained in the following: (i)
the Exploration Permits issued by the Ministry of Environment in May and November
2002 and February 2006; (ii) the recognition of the Legnava Sources as springs of
natural mineral water by the Ministry of Health and the State Spa Committee in March

Post-investment, the Claimant alleges specific assurances contained in the following: (i)
the State Spa Committee’s positive standpoint in the context of the Building Permit
proceedings of October 2013;%*” (ii) the Building Permit issued by the District Office in
Pregov in May 2014; and (iii) some statements made by Minister Ziga in July 2014

It is well established that the “relevant point in time for the assessment of legitimate and
reasonable expectations [refers] to the time at which the investment is made”.°°°
Investors cannot base their legitimate expectations on assurances on which they could
not have relied when making their investment.®" As a result, the Claimant cannot invoke
the post-investment assurances as basis for its expectations.

It true that some investments are effected in several consecutive steps over time. In
those cases, “legitimate expectations must be examined for each stage at which a
decisive step is taken towards the creation, expansion, development, or reorganization
of the investment”. In similar terms, the tribunal in AES considered the claimants’
alleged legitimate expectations both at the time they first invested in Hungary, and when
they made additional investments in order to advance the activities of the locally
incorporated company that they had previously acquired.°°? However, this is not the

situation here, where the only relevant investment is Muszynianka’s acquisition of GFT
Slovakia in December 2012.°%

As to the alleged representations made prior to the acquisition of GFT Slovakia, the
Claimant argues that it is entitled to rely on the statements made by Slovak authorities
to Goldfruct as its predecessor in interest.°° These statements all concerned GFT
Slovakia or the Project and they were made available to the Claimant before it bought
the shares in GFT Slovakia.2° Hence, the Tribunal sees no reason of principle why the
Claimant could not invoke these assurances.

Turning now to the different acts on which Muszynianka relies, the Tribunal finds that the
Claimant cannot invoke the Exploration Permits, the recognition of the Legnava Sources
as springs of natural mineral water, or the Maximum Quantities Decisions.°°” These three
sets of administrative acts, which the Claimant characterizes as “specific assurances”
that “manifested general support for the Project”,9°° were taken between May 2002 and
July 2009. At that time, Goldfruct and GFT Slovakia still purported to build a bottling plant
in Slovakia and thus exploit the Legnava Sources exclusively on Slovak territory.°% Yet,
this was not the production model contemplated when Muszynianka purchased GFT
Slovakia. At that time, the Claimant “considered only one production model” for the
Project, ‘°° namely “the construction of a water treatment plant in Legnava, [transporting
the] treated water with pipelines under [the Poprad river] to Muszyna, and bottling [the]
water in Muszyna”. 101

While Goldfruct started considering the possibility of a bottling plant in Poland in the
second half of 2009, °° it is only in March 2010 that GFT Slovakia voiced that intention

°°4 The Tribunal recalls that in 2013 Muszynianka increased its share capital in GFT Slovakia (supra, § 291)—which
the Respondent does not dispute—and that these funds “were used by GFT Slovakia to carry out its activity in
Legnava” (Reply { 600), which includes the procurement of the Building Permit in May 2014 (supra, 4 54). In this
context, the Claimant argues that the Building Permit also qualifies as a protected investment (supra, § 280.iii). Be
this as it may, Muszynianka’s additional allocation of funds preceded the alleged assurances now invoked by the
Claimant. Therefore, the chronology is such that the Claimant could not have relied on these assurances upon
making its 2013 additional contribution.

with the Slovak authorities. '° It follows that any statements by Slovak authorities about
the Project prior to March 2010 concerned a business model that the Claimant did not
consider when making its investment.

In conclusion, only the alleged representations from March 2010 through Muszynianka’s
acquisition of GFT Slovakia on 31 December 2012 are prima facie capable of creating
legitimate expectations. These statements can be divided into those emanating from the
Inspectorate and the State Soa Committee (i) and those from the Municipality of Legnava
and the Ministry of Environment in the context of the Zoning Permit (ii).

i. | Statements/acts by the Inspectorate and the State Spa
Committee

The Claimant argues that the Inspectorate’s communications of 30 March (a) and 16
December 2010 (b), and the State Spa Committee’s decisions of 8 February and 19
September 2012 (c), constitute assurances that the Exploitation Permit would be issued
and that the Project would unfold as intended. 1°

(a) _Inspectorate’s communication of 30 March
2010

On 24 March 2010, GFT Slovakia requested a “preliminary opinion” from the
Inspectorate regarding its intention to exploit the Legnava Sources. According to GFT
Slovakia, it would build a water treatment plant in Slovakia and transport the treated
water under the Poprad river into Poland, where it would be bottled. GFT Slovakia
described the Project as follows:

—on plot 966/1 we will build a hall with water tanks and a water treatment plant. The
hall will feature the technology of water accumulation and treatment as well as
source monitoring. The outlet will be equipped with sample collection points for water
quality monitoring.

—The source water will be supplied to the hall through state and municipal plots, and
plots owned by the company.

— The service itself will be provided across the Poprad river in the territory of the
Republic of Poland. /Site plan attached/. Water would be supplied to the bottling
plant beneath the Poprad river. 19°

The Inspectorate answered on 30 March 2010 declaring that it had no objections to the
Project. However, in its answer, the Inspectorate expressly warned GFT Slovakia that
the mixing of Legnava Sources was prohibited:

The Ministry of Health of the Slovak Republic — Inspectorate of Spas and Water

Springs has no objections against your plan of use of the natural mineral sources in
Legnava. However, we would like to draw your attention to the following facts:

1. We suggest shortening the pipeline for transport of water to the Republic of
Poland (enclosed);

2. In accordance with EU laws, the water from respective sources may not be

combined and bottled in consumer packs and thus it is necessary to take this fact

into account in the designed water storage, treatment and transport [...].'°°%
Even a cursory reading of the language just quoted shows that the Inspectorate’s
communication cannot be the source of the alleged expectations. Even if the Tribunal
were to accept that this preliminary opinion,'°°’ which did not emanate from the entity
competent to issue exploitation permits, °° constituted an assurance that an Exploitation
Permit would be granted, quod non, that permit would not have been aligned with the
Claimant’s key Project assumptions. It would only have covered the Project described in
GFT Slovakia’s letter of 24 March 2010, namely a cross-border exploitation without
mixing. Yet, that was not the Claimant’s Project. The Claimant intended to mix the waters

from the Legnava Sources. '0°°

(b) Inspectorate’s communication of
16 December 2010

The Claimant relies on the Inspectorate’s letter of 16 December 2010'"” as basis for the
expectation that the Inspectorate agreed that the production stages taking place in
Poland, including mixing and bottling, would be “governed by Polish law and carried out
by competent authorities of the Republic of Poland’,'°"' and that, consequently, there
was “no need [...] to seek a corresponding declaration on the possibility of mixing the
water from the particular Legnava Sources under Slovak law”. 1°12

It is recalled that, as was already established, '°'? the Inspectorate’s communication did
not address whether Polish law excluded the application of Slovak law to the production
stages occurring in Poland. More importantly, the Inspectorate’s communication makes
no mention of mixing. This is indeed unsurprising when one takes into account that,
before this arbitration, GFT Slovakia at no point notified the Slovak authorities of its intent
to market a mixed product.'°'* Absent such disclosure, the Inspectorate’s communication
could not be read as opining on the possibility to mix the Legnava Sources.

(c) State Spa Committee’s decision of
8 February and communication of
19 September 2012

The State Spa Committee’s decision of 8 February 2012 and communication of
19 September 2012 were issued in the context of the Exploitation Permit proceedings.
The February 2012 decision stayed the proceedings due to GFT Slovakia’s failure to
adduce information required by the Act on Mineral Waters.'°'® It also requested the
provision of a Building Permit as a “preliminary issue”.'°® The September 2012
communication stated that, following the supplementation of the application on 1 August
2012,''7 the required information was complete. It maintained the stay, however,
because the Building Permit was still outstanding. 1°"8

. According to the Claimant, through its decision of February 2012, the State Spa

in the Claimant’s view, the State Spa Committee gave GFT Slovakia “every reason to
believe” that the Exploitation Permit would be issued upon the submission of the Building
Permit. 1021

486. The Tribunal does not share the Claimant’s understanding of the facts. The latter invokes
the February 2012 decision merely to show that the State Spa Committee did not object
to the transportation of the water from Legnava to Muszyna.'°”? In other words, the
Committee did not object to the cross-border nature of the Project.'°° Yet, that
observation in and of itself gives no assurance about the issuance of the Exploitation
Permit.

487. The September 2012 communication does not support the Claimant’s argument either.
For the State Spa Committee to state that the Exploitation Permit application was
“completed” can hardly be construed as an assurance that the Exploitation Permit would
be granted. The September 2012 communication simply followed procedure. It
confirmed that GFT Slovakia’s previously deficient application met the content stated in
Article 11 of the Act on Mineral Waters,'°*4 which is but one of the conditions for the
issuance of an Exploitation Permit. 1

488. Additionally, when asked to provide information on production, specifically “adding
information [on] where and how the water is to be filled/bottled/ after being treated” and
on the “proposed exploitation and method of exploiting [the] resources”, '°°° GFT Slovakia
did not disclose that the water would be mixed. Rather, it gave the following clarifications:

The business plan of GFT Slovakia [...] is to extract natural mineral water from
sources LH-2A, LH-3, LH-4 and LH-5 into a mineral water treatment plant to be
located [in Slovakia]. After treatment (removal of iron and manganese), natural
mineral water from each source will be stored in separate accumulation reservoir
and then transported under the Poprad river to the existing mineral water bottling
plant in the cadastral territory of the town of Muzsyna in Poland [...].

The method of exploiting mineral water from wells LH-2A, LH-3, LH-4 and LH-5 will
be extraction using immersion pumps installed above the top level of perforation at
each well.

Natural mineral water will be transported by designed distribution pipes and will be

used in the existing bottling premises to bottle natural mineral water. '°”
The facts just referred to show that the State Soa Committee did inquire on the specifics
of the production stages occurring in Poland. This stands in contrast to the Claimant’s
submission, further to Mr. Kacvinsky’s testimony,'°° that the Slovak authorities never
required such information. °° On the other hand, these facts also demonstrate that GFT
Slovakia omitted information regarding the potential mixing of the Legnava Sources in
Poland at a time when Goldfruct, the then shareholder, did envisage mixing. In 2010,
Goldfruct had asked the Polish PNIPH whether the water from the Legnava Sources
could be mixed in Poland.'° Moreover, through the Information Memorandum,
Goldfruct marketed the possibility of producing a mixed product from the Legnava
Sources as one of GFT Slovakia’s selling points. 1°

. Upon its acquisition of GFT Slovakia in December 2012, the Claimant did not prompt the

correction of the Exploitation Permit application in order to reflect its intention to mix the
Legnava Sources. The Parties’ Slovak law experts essentially agree that Slovak
administrative law imposes on an applicant the duty to amend an application that is
inaccurate or otherwise misleading. '°°?

More significantly, both under Goldfruct and Muszynianka’s control, GFT Slovakia
actively suggested to the Slovak authorities that the waters from the Legnava Sources
would not be mixed. GFT Slovakia applied for and obtained a Zoning and a Building
Permit that planned a water treatment plant with reservoirs and pipelines allowing to treat
and store the water from each Legnava Source independently, and to transport it
separately from Legnava to Muszyna. In particular, the water treatment plant would have

That drawing implied that the water from the Legnava Sources would be transported into
Poland without mixing. It led Ms. Bozikova to assume that GFT Slovakia intended to
comply with the State Spa Committee’s communication of 30 March 2010,'°% according
to which mixing was prohibited.'°°° Mr. Mosur actually confirmed at the Hearing that,
based on the State Spa Committee’s warning of March 2010, the Project was designed
so that water would not be mixed, in Slovakia at least:

[W]e analysed [the State Spa Committee’s communication of 30 March 2010]. In
Poland the regulation of the Ministry of Health that | mentioned allows for mixing
waters. We didn't plan to mix waters in Slovakia. The project envisaged that four
intakes and four pipes of water are going to reach Poland. | confirm that, and that's
in the Project. Four pipes to Poland, and in Slovakia it is not allowed to mix waters.
[...] | didn't see any concerns about not being able to [mix] the water imported to
Poland. 107

. In the Tribunal’s view, the fact that GFT Slovakia omitted information on one of the key

aspects of the Project when specifically asked, rules out the creation of any legitimate
expectation under the BIT’s FET standard. Although not decisive for purposes of the
assessment under international law, it warrants noting that the Claimant's Slovak law
expert, Dr. Jakab, gave evidence that applications filed before State authorities
containing “untruthful” information could not give rise to legitimate expectations under

national law either. 10°

It is true that the Respondent has not established that the Claimant’s mixing plan would
have been unlawful under Slovak law.'°°° However, that does not change the
determination reached in terms of legitimate expectations. The Inspectorate’s 30 March
2010 letter had already stated that mixing of the Legnava waters was not permitted and
a plan to comply with that position so long as the waters were in Slovak territory and then
mix them in Poland could, at a minimum, be expected to raise issues of the Slovak
Republic’s compliance with the EU Directive for the State Soa Committee. Moreover, the
concealment of the Claimant’s mixing plans prevented the State Spa Committee from
discussing with GFT Slovakia the permissibility of such plans and ascertaining the actual

GFT Slovakia submitted documents to support its application for the zoning permit. Those documents included also
construction plans based on which GFT Slovakia asked for approval for constructing six separate pipelines under
the Poprad river, one for each of the Legnava Sources, with two reserve pipelines. Therefore, our understanding
based on these documents was that GFT Slovakia had planned such design to comply with our preliminary opinion
regarding the impossibility to mix water from different sources. We were never informed of a change in that design”).

chemical composition of the Legnava Sources.'°*° The non-disclosure thus not only
precluded the State Spa Committee from properly apprehending GFT Slovakia’s full
production process, but also prevented it from investigating the possible health impact
of the final product. These matters almost certainly could have played a significant role
in the State Spa Committee’s assessment of the public interest of the exploitation of the
Legnava Sources. '' Indeed, under the Act on Mineral Waters, the presence of a public
interest requires ensuring the “qualitative and quantitative properties” of the natural
mineral, as well as its “sanitary flawlessness”. 1°42

ii. Statements/acts by the Municipality of Legnava and the
Ministry of Environment

. The Claimant refers to the Zoning Permit issued by the Municipality of Legnava'™? and

to the communication which the Ministry of Environment sent on 26 July 2012 regarding
the Zoning Permit,'* as evidence that the Respondent never objected to the cross-
border nature of the Project.'°4 It is clear that prior to the Constitutional Amendment, the
transport of the water from Legnava to Muszyna was not prohibited or otherwise
unlawful.'°4° The Zoning Permit and the communication by the Ministry of Environment
support that finding. At the same time, they do not speak to the issuance of the
Exploitation Permit, which depends on a number of other considerations.

. Moreover, an investor can only reasonably trust assurances and thus derive legitimate

expectations from them if these assurances emanate from the governmental entities
which, by law, have competence over the subject matter of the assurance.'™” This is not
the case of the Municipality of Legnava and the Ministry of Environment. Moreover, the

Zoning Permit only dealt with the “placement” of the water treatment plant in Legnava, '*
which was just one component out of many involved in the Project.

c. Entitlement to the issuance of the Exploitation Permit

The Act on Mineral Waters sets out both positive and negative conditions for the
issuance of an Exploitation Permit.

Regarding the positive conditions, Article 12(6) of the Act states that the State Spa
Committee “shall issue” an Exploitation Permit application “only if’: (i) the sources at
issue have been recognized as natural mineral water; and (ii) the application meets the
“formalities” listed in Article 11 involving a detailed and documented description of the
project. 104°

As to the negative conditions, Article 12(7) of the Act provides that the State Spa
Committee “shall reject” an exploitation permit application if: (i) “it is in the public interest”
that the natural mineral water source “is not exploited”; (ii) the plan for the exploitation of
the natural mineral water source “is not suitable in relation to the exploitable quantity of
water in it’; and (iii) the requested Exploitation Permit has already been granted to
another applicant. 1°

The term “public interest” used in Article 12(7) is defined in Article 39:

Public interest for the purposes of this act shall mean interest in [the] search[,]
exploitation[,] and protection of [...] natural mineral sources in order to preserve their
qualitative and quantitative properties and their sanitary flawlessness. '°5'

The Respondent argues that the words “only if” used in Article 12(6), just referred to,
suggest that the positive conditions are minimum requirements, with the result that the
State Spa Committee may consider additional elements, such as ensuring compliance
with Slovakia’s regulations on mixing and branding. '°°? Be that as it may, the Respondent
has been unable to establish that GFT Slovakia’s business plan was per se unlawful.
Moreover, the Respondent does not challenge that, before the Constitutional
Amendment, GFT Slovakia’s application met the positive conditions. Nor is it disputed
that the Exploitation Permit had not been granted to another applicant and that, pursuant

to the LH-2A to LH-5 Maximum Quantities Decision, '®* the plan for exploitation of the
Legnava Sources appeared suitable for the quantity of mineral water available.

This being so, the Parties’ disagree on the negative condition requiring a determination
linked to “public interest”.

According to the Claimant, prior to the Constitutional Amendment, there were no grounds
for the State Spa Committee to find the Project contrary to public interest. '°°* Moreover,
by providing a binding positive opinion during the Building Permit proceedings, ‘°° the
State Spa Committee affirmed the Project’s compatibility with public interest.'%6
Therefore, as all other requirements set in the Act on Mineral Waters were also met, GFT
Slovakia had a “legal right” to the issuance of the Exploitation Permit. '°5”

The Respondent opposes the idea that the State Soa Committee’s binding opinion given
in the course of the Building Permit proceedings affirmed the existence of a public
interest. '°® Consequently, for the Respondent, Muszynianka merely had a completed
application for an Exploitation Permit. That application started the proceedings, !°° and
gave the Claimant the right to obtain a decision on the application but not to receive a
positive outcome. 196°

As a first observation, the binding opinion provided by State Spa Committee on
13 October 2013 in the context of the Building Permit proceedings does not prejudge the
existence of a public interest as defined in Article 39 of the Act on Mineral Waters. In that
opinion, the State Spa Committee simply “agree[d] with the [issuance] of a building and
water permit” for the construction of the water treatment plant envisaged by GFT
Slovakia.'°*' It did so subject to various requirements with which GFT Slovakia was to
comply in terms of the protection of the Legnava Sources through the construction and
operation of the plant.'°® Differently put, that opinion did not assess the public interest

involved in the overall exploitation of the Legnava Sources and other elements of the
Project.

Having clarified this point, the Tribunal turns to Muszynianka’s claim that it had an
acquired right or entitlement to the issuance of an Exploitation Permit. Laws usually
afford discretion to the State in exercising its decision-making functions aimed at
implementing the laws. In the words of the Crystallex tribunal, the provisions of a law are
“rarely unconditional” with the result that private actors “have difficulty founding an actual
expectation akin to a vested right” on legislation. '° The provisions of the Act on Mineral
Waters are no exception.

Article 12 of that Act requires the State Spa Committee to review an application’s
compliance with the law and with public interest. When assessing the existence of a
public interest, the State has a level of discretion to determine whether or not the planned
activity is in the public interest. Dr. Potasch, the Respondent's Slovak law expert,
confirmed that the test is linked to public interest and that the discretionary power
associated with it means that an applicant can have no entitlement or acquired right to a
favorable decision from the State Spa Committee as a result of filing a complete
Exploitation Permit application. 1°

Contrary to the Claimant's submissions, '® the existence of discretion on the part of the
State Spa Committee which allows the latter to deny an Exploitation Permit in light of
public interest considerations, and the consequential preclusion of acquired rights, do
not amount to arbitrary treatment per se. As Dr. Potasch testified, conduct would only be
arbitrary if the State Spa Committee failed to derive sufficiently cogent grounds justifying
a denial of the Exploitation Permit on the basis of public interest. '°© In the present case,
the State Spa Committee never reached that stage.

The Tribunal’s views are in conformity with those expressed by the Slovak judiciary. In
its decision on GFT Slovakia’s motion to revoke the State Soa Committee’s denial of the

applicant can never have legitimate expectations that the permit would be issued because the applicant cannot
anticipate how the public authority will assess public interest”); see also Potasch ER |, RER-2, 4 126.

Exploitation Permit, the Regional Court in Bratislava stated that there was no legal
certainty that the permit would be issued:

Another fact that cannot be omitted in this matter is also the fact that the decision-
making competence stipulated in [the Act on Mineral Waters], which governs the
proceedings on issuance of the permit to exploit natural mineral sources, does not
guarantee [a] legal entitlement to the issuance of a positive decision even if the
applicant's application [is complete]. The provision of Article 12(7) [the Act on Mineral
Waters] authorizes the [State Spa Committee] also to reject the application for
issuance of the permit to exploit a source, if that is in [the] public interest. Therefore,
applicant could not have had any legally certain expectations that its application
would be granted [...].1067
Strangely enough, the Claimant and its Slovak law expert, Dr. Jakab, do not address
such decision. Neither does the Claimant argue that this judgment breaches the BIT. In
fact, neither the Claimant nor Dr. Jakab refer to any other authority of Slovak law
asserting that a complete Exploitation Permit application vests upon an applicant an
acquired right to that permit. Rather, Dr. Jakab reviews the administrative file of GFT
Slovakia’s application, '®* and, based on that review, posits that “the need to protect the
public interest in relation to the mineral water exploitation [of the Legnava Sources] did
not exist until the adoption of the [Constitutional Amendment]’.'°° Therefore, in the
expert's opinion, “there was no reason [for the State Spa Committee] to reject GFT
Slovakia’s application due to the alleged incompliance of the exploitation of the [Legnava
Sources] with the public interest”.'°”° It is on this basis that, the other conditions being
met, Muszynianka claims that GFT Slovakia “was legally entitled to receive the
Exploitation Permit and the State Soa Commission was legally obliged to issue one”. 1°”!

The Tribunal cannot follow that approach. It cannot substitute its judgment for the State
Spa Committee’s discretionary assessment of public interest and thus assume that the
permit would have been granted and that the applicant had a right to it.

For these reasons, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that the Claimant has not
established having a legal entitlement to the issuance of the Exploitation Permit prior to
the Constitutional Amendment.

d. Enactment of the Constitutional Amendment

513. The Constitutional Amendment reads in relevant part as follows:

[...] The transport of water taken from water bodies located in the territory of the
Slovak Republic across the borders of the Slovak Republic by means of transport or
by pipelines is banned; the ban shall not apply to water for personal consumption,
drinking water packaged in consumer packaging in the territory of the Slovak
Republic and natural mineral water packaged in consumer packaging in the territory
of the Slovak Republic, and to provision of humanitarian aid and help in emergency
situations. Details of conditions of transport of water for personal consumption and
water to provide humanitarian aid and help in emergency situations shall be laid
down by law. 1072

514. This section assesses whether, irrespective of legitimate expectations, the Constitutional
Amendment breaches the FET standard for being discriminatory (i), unreasonable (ii),
disproportionate (iii), or inconsistent (iv).

i. Discrimination

515. Itis well established that State conduct is discriminatory if investors in like circumstances
are subjected to different treatment without a reasonable justification. '°’° Discriminatory
treatment may occur either de jure (a) or de facto (b).'°’* A measure may further be
discriminatory if it willfully targets a foreign investor (c).'°”

(a) De jure discrimination

516. The Constitutional Amendment applies to all types of water, be it drinking, healing,
spring, or mineral water, and does not distinguish between Slovak and foreign water
producers. There is thus no need for further analysis to determine that it entails no de
jure differential treatment.

(b) De facto discrimination

Discriminatory treatment, including de facto differential treatment, occurs if cases in like
circumstances, that is identical or materially similar cases, are treated differently without
a reasonable justification. 1°76

As noted in Parkerings, in reference to Pope & Talbot, to establish whether a foreign
investor finds itself in like circumstances with other operators, one must determine the
relevant business or economic sector.'°”” In the Statement of Claim, the Claimant noted
that it was in like circumstances with “all water producers”. 1°” In the Reply, it changed
its position and limited the comparator to Slovak entities engaged in the production of
natural mineral water.'°’? The Respondent for its part advocates in favor of a comparison
with all water producers, in line with the Claimant's initial argument. 1°

This being so, the Parties have barely substantiated their proposed comparators, if at all.
The Respondent provides no justification for its position. The Claimant does state that
water producers currently operating in the Slovak Republic, including producers of
mineral water, either already have bottling plants in the Slovak Republic, or do not
produce bottled water, and/or did not intend to operate a cross-border water
exploitation.'°°' Yet, even assuming that they are correct, these observations do not
explain why only mineral water producers are in like circumstances with GFT Slovakia
or Muszynianka. If anything, the Claimant’s assertions rather seem to militate against
using Slovak mineral water producers as the comparator.

Taking into consideration GFT Slovakia’s purported end consumers, it appears
appropriate to compare the treatment of its Project to that of other producers of drinking
water, including mineral water producers who use Slovak water as raw material.
Restricting the comparator to mineral water producers would ignore the fact that, like
mineral water, drinking water in the narrow sense is primarily intended for human
consumption and thus is arguably in competition with mineral water. By contrast,

broadening the comparator to any water producer would include water usages far from
being in competition with mineral water, such as water intended for irrigation or industrial
purposes. There remains the question whether transborder production should be part of
the comparator. The cross-border nature was an essential and very specific element of
the Claimant's plans. If it were not part of the test, one would end up comparing operators
that are not in like circumstances.

Between January and April 2014, Vychodoslovenska vodarenska spoloénost (“VVS’), a
Slovak company, and Zempléni Vizmii Kft (“ZVK”), a Hungarian company, discussed the
possibility of establishing and jointly operating a drinking water supply network (i.e., non-
mineral water) between the cities of Slovenské Nové Mesto in the Slovak Republic and
Satoraljatjhely in Hungary.‘ Similarly, in November 2016, three Slovak companies,
Stredoslovenska vodarenskaé spoloénost’ (“SVS”), Stredoslovenska vodarenska
prevadzkova spoloénost (“SVP”), and AQUA LC (“AQUA”), concluded a memorandum
of understanding setting out plans for mutual cooperation in order to supply drinking
water to Hungarians end users. 18

Neither these nor any other projects entailing the cross-border transport of unbottled
Slovak drinking or mineral water were allowed to proceed after the adoption of the
Constitutional Amendment, ' or before it for that matter. Hence, no de facto differential
treatment is made out between GFT Slovakia and other would-be operators in like
circumstances.

(c) Targeting

The question here is whether the Constitutional Amendment targeted the Claimant’s
Project. To answer this question, it is helpful to review the process that led to the adoption
of the Constitutional Amendment. As will be seen, that review does no show targeting. It
evidences that the change in the Constitution was driven by concerns over drinking (in
the sense of non-mineral) and underground water in an era of climate change, when the
Project was about mineral water. It also demonstrates that the Constitutional Amendment
aimed essentially at the protection of the Zitny ostrov reserves in the southwest of the
country close to the border with Hungary, when the Project was located in the north by
the Polish border. In addition, the Government was concerned that water resource

exploitation decisions were too de-centralized under the then-extant legal regime and
that regional and local authorities did not possess the necessary information about the
overall balance of water resources in Slovakia; hence there was an interest in allocating
water management competence to the central government level. 18

In 2012, the Water Report, issued by the Ministry of Environment further to the SMER’s
interest (namely the governing political party at the time) on water provision and
preservation, '°®* had warned about the water deficit in the northeast and east of the
Slovak Republic, 8” and stressed that Zitny ostrov deserved “special attention” for being
“one of the largest drinking water reserves in Central Europe”.'° It also spoke of the
risk of “plundering or uneconomic exploitation” of Slovak water sources, as well as of
“uncontrolled transfer” of groundwater outside of Slovak territory.'°® Essentially, it
cautioned about the heightened “interest of business groups in transferring via piping or
otherwise transporting mineral water or groundwater extracted in [Slovak] territory,
especially from the protected water management area of the Zitny ostrov outside the
borders of the [Slovak Republic] directly as a raw material”.1°°°

Resolution No. 583/2012, which was issued in October 2012, reaffirmed the
Government's commitment towards the protection of groundwater, especially drinking
water.'°%" It approved the Water Report;'° declared water a “raw material of the State”
subject to its national interests;!°% and instructed the Ministry of Environment to promote
legislative measures to “ensure a universal protection of groundwater in the protected
water management areas with an emphasis on the area of Zitny ostrov given its strategic
significance”. 1%

In June 2014, pursuant to Resolution No. 583/2012, the Slovak Cabinet introduced a

a first parliamentary debate, Prime Minister Fico and Minister Ziga announced that some
of the changes sought through the proposed amendment to the Act on Waters would
instead be pursued by way of the Constitutional Amendment. 1°

527. The Claimant concedes that, before 8 July 2014, '°°” the amendment to the Act on Waters
was primarily focused on Zitny ostrov.'°8 Yet, contrary to the Claimant's contention, 1°
this focus on drinking water and Zitny ostrov, amidst an overall concern over the export
of Slovak groundwater, continued after the Constitutional Amendment was announced.
For instance, on 9 July, Minister Ziga stated:

  

| waited for, you know, at least some credit from you, for you to give credit to the
inister, great move, we are protecting the waters of Rye Island [Zitny ostrov], the
largest body of freshwater in Slovakia. Nothing. [...] This is one of the other
measures provided for in the law, namely maintaining the quality of drinking water in
Slovakia. We recommend amending the article of the legislation in which we will ban
exports of drinking, mineral and geothermal waters abroad [...].110°

528. Even MPs highly critical of the Constitutional Amendment did not center their remarks
on the Project or otherwise on mineral water. Rather, they expressed concern over Zitny
ostrov; or the lack of data regarding the availability of drinking water and groundwater,
thus calling into question the appropriateness of any regulation on raw water export:

[MP Chren:] Lets take Zitny ostrov, as we are probably mainly talking about it [i.e..]
our biggest drinking water supplies, the one of the highest quality, [and] greatly
threatened nowadays. [T]he water from the Zitny ostrov is [not all] of the same
quality. If only the one of the highest quality, clean one, was extracted and sold
abroad, paradoxically, only the worse one would remain for Slovakia with the costly
treatment method applied. Paradoxically, the price of the drinking water for Slovakia
would be increased. '1°!

[MP Mezenska:] | consider proposing and approving this disputable Draft Act in the
situation, when the quantities of drinking water surplus sources are not known and
confirmed, to be inappropriate, absurd and irresponsible approach by the
Government. Export of estimated amount of drinking water up to 274 million m?
represents 80% of the annual water consumption in Slovakia. And | cannot imagine
what would happen if the water balance of Slovakia would deteriorate, if it would
decrease. 1

plan to proceed by way of a constitutional change and commenced its unlawful targeting (see Reply, {4 7, 20).

[MP Viskupié:] Many of pre-speakers dedicated exactly to the methodology and
compared figures. And | have to say that this data does not express what is the exact
situation with our water, or the drinking water situation or water in Slovakia
generally. 1193
The statements of other MPs, supportive of the Government's proposal, corroborate that
drinking water or water in general was indeed the main objective driving the
Constitutional Amendment. They also suggest that the risk of foreign investors exporting
Slovak water was not a crucial or pervasive consideration in the passing of the
Constitutional Amendment. For instance:

[MP Miéovsky:] Nobody among us knows exactly, what are the current drinking
water quantities available [or] what will happen with resources of both groundwater
and surface water [in the future].''°* [Because there is] no certainty [,] the best
solution is to submit a constitutional amendment, and to me it seems that it could be
the solution of all our hesitations presented in our debate.''® [Yet], if there is a
surplus of water and there would be a demand, and | do not know whether there is
somebody knocking the door, | have not heard about it till now, that somebody would
like to buy water from us, [then] such an alternative for sure cannot be refused in the
future [and] our descendants [...] may one day decide to unlock the Constitution [...].
They will however do so only when it is known [that] quantities available today, shall
be also available tomorrow, [and upon] being sure in the knowledge that [water is

not] not_only available in the Zitny ostrov region or the spring regions of the
Horehronie, but on a country-wide level [...].11°°

These statements indicate that the Constitutional Amendment sought to address a much
broader concern than just mineral water, which constitutes only a small portion of the
total water in the Slovak Republic, a fact that the Claimant does not dispute. '°7 In this
context, the Claimant’s submission that the Constitutional Amendment “falls squarely
into the definition of targeted legislation’''® appears unavailing. According to the
Claimant, the following constitutes evidence that the Constitutional Amendment targeted
the Project: Muszynianka was the only one affected by the Constitutional Amendment

by the Ministry of Health to stop GFT Slovakia’s Exploitation Permit proceedings until the

media coverage show that Muszynianka was vilified in order to pass the Constitutional
Amendment (cc).'""'

(aa) GFT Slovakia was not the only entity affected by
the Constitutional Amendment

As already established above,'''? Muszynianka and GFT Slovakia were not the only
companies affected by the Constitutional Amendment. The Claimant nevertheless puts
into doubt the “seriousness” of the plans by other companies and the impact of the
Constitutional Amendment on those plans. '"'?

At the Hearing, the Claimant argued that nothing in the documentation of the VVS-ZKV
venture, referred to earlier, “indicates even the basic parameters of the co-operation
between those two companies” or the “trans-boundary character of their initiative”.1""4 It
further submitted that that project was highly uncertain, as the conclusion of a water
supply agreement between VVS and ZKV was subject to numerous conditions, such as
the procurement of guarantees, approvals by Slovak State authorities, and an
assessment of the economic viability of the project.'''® Regarding the other venture
mentioned above, the SVS-SVP-AQUA venture, the Claimant contended that the
documentation in the record only suggests “two Slovak companies vaguely discussing a
project” that, while clearly involving cross-border transport of drinking water, remained
largely unknown in terms of “the fate of that initiative and whether it was real”.11®
Moreover, it submitted that, in any event, it seemed “unlikely that the Constitutional
Amendment was of any concern for those two companies, both of them [being]
Slovak”.117

In the Tribunal’s view, the Claimant’s submissions are misguided. First, the VVS-ZKV
venture was a cross-border project. It was meant to establish a drinking water supply
network between the Slovak Republic and Hungary through the “potential joint use of the
transboundary Rojiava basin water source”.''!® Notably, the representatives of VVS and

ZKV met in March 2014 to “discuss drinking water and its supply for the population of
both sides of the border”, after which they sought to examine inter alia the “technical,
economic, legal conditions for the joint sale of drinking water”.''!?

Second, all of the Claimant’s remaining objections in connection with the VVS-ZKV
venture are incorrectly premised on the documentation adduced by the Respondent in
relation to the SVS-SVP-AQUA venture. It is the memorandum of understanding
pertaining to the SVS-SVP-AQUA venture project (which concerned three and not two
Slovak companies as argued by the Claimant) that lists the conditions for the conclusion
of a supply agreement of drinking water.''?° This being so, the existence of conditions
precedent to the conclusion of a contract is standard practice and does not take away
the “seriousness” of the undertaking. Neither is there any element in the record
substantiating the Claimant’s allegation that this venture was not real.

Third, the fact that only Slovak companies executed the SVS-SVP-AQUA memorandum
is irrelevant here. The purpose of the project was to supply drinking water to users in
Hungary.'!?" Hence, it was a cross-border venture which fell squarely within the ambit of
the Constitutional Amendment.

(bb) Ms. Bozikova’s admission at the Hearing does
not inform the motives behind the Constitutional
Amendment

It is true that Ms. Bozikova admitted that the Minister of Health requested the State Spa
Committee to delay the Exploitation Permit:

MS DURCHOWSKA: [...] Is there any? Can you point out any other activity that's
recorded concerning GFT Slovakia's application?

MS BOZIKOVA: | communicated with the head of the Ministry [of Health], with the
minister. There's one more record where she told us to wait [...]. The only reason
was to see whether the Constitutional Amendment would be adopted or not because
if it is adopted, it would be a new situation for us. If we were to issue a decision and
then the conditions were changed, we would have to deal with it again. 112?

However, in and of itself, that statement is not evidence of targeting. It may put into
question the treatment afforded to GFT Slovakia during the Exploitation Permit

proceedings, but that is another matter, which is addressed below.''?> This being so,
neither the Ministry of Health’s request, nor Ms. Bozikova’s compliance, inform about the
motivation behind the Constitutional Amendment. In reality, the prolongation of the
Exploitation Permit proceedings at the instance of the Minister of Health appears more
to be the result of a genuine concern over the legal status of the cross-border exploitation
of water.

Article 2(2) of the Slovak Constitution provides that “State authorities may act solely [...]
within the scope and manner laid down by law’.'!4 Still, before the Constitutional
Amendment, there was no rule in Slovak law on the export of water prior to bottling. ''7°
Hence, there was considerable uncertainty within the Ministry of Health on how to
address GFT Slovakia’s application.''° The uncertainty was exacerbated by the then
looming Constitutional Amendment. A July 2014 exchange between Ms. Bozikova and
Mr. Mario Frafo, Director of the Legislative Department of the Ministry of Health, is clear
in this respect:

[Ms. Bozikova’s inquiry]

| would like to ask after all whether you have given any thought to the legal
interpretation of my question—should the Constitution stipulate—the transportation
and transfer of water [...] is prohibited. Should this also apply to any and all decisions
issued in the capacity of constitutional laws? If so, how should we address the
pertinent situations [(i.e., GFT Slovakia’s request)]?

[Mr. Frafio’s reply]

| have quite a problem with the possibility of requiring applicants to comply with
unspecified methods and conditions of use being stipulated in a broad fashion and
lacking the legal basis in the relevant provision of the applicable law. [...].

The present legislation does not prohibit cross-border transfers. Should the permit
explicitly state that such use is allowed that constitutes a cross-border transfer, that
would mean [...] that they have been granted a right which is unregulated under the
applicable law, such decision exceeding [the State Spa Committee's] competence.
[Would] it be possible under the decision issued to omit taking into consideration the
fact that the pertinent transfer would be of a cross-border nature[?] [I]n this case,
nobody could claim that we have directly (and exceeding the extent of the applicable
law) allowed a cross-border transfer. '!?”

539. Therefore, the Tribunal cannot see the Minister of Justice’s request to delay the
Exploitation Permit proceedings as a manifestation of targeting through the
Constitutional Amendment. It is clear that the State Spa Committee (and by extension
the Ministry of Health) did not know how to address GFT Slovakia’ application, which
indisputably raised a novel issue. The Constitutional Amendment presented itself as a
solution to the authorities’ dilemma.

(cc) The references to the Project does not suggest
targeting

540. The Claimant invokes the following main references by Minister Ziga or Prime Minister
Fico as evidence of the Constitutional Amendment's alleged targeting:

i. On 2 July 2014:

[Minister Ziga:] In accordance with the current laws [...] there is currently no
legislative or formal tool that would prohibit water exports. As soon as [one]
decides to export water abroad, [one can] have it exported. [...] We already
have one specific experience. Although it concerns mineral rather than
drinking water, the principle remains the same. A major warning for Slovakia
and the Ministry of the Environment was the Legnava case, where the
company attempted to build an underground pipeline under the Poprad
riverbed into Poland for the collection of mineral water and its subsequent
bottling and distribution outside Slovakia. The Slovak authorities had no basis
in legislation to prohibit such activity and could not support their stance with
any specific regulation. 1128

Our priority is to conserve water to cover the needs of the people. You are
being misleading and dishonest by claiming that you are protecting water
resources from being taken out of the country. You are lying because that’s
not what the truth is, we have specific examples. | was talking about Legnava.
No national regulation currently prohibits or regulates water exports.
Therefore, in that case, | would like to reiterate that there is a rule in place that
states that if something is not forbidden or otherwise regulated, it is
allowed. "129

ii. On 8 July 2014:

[Prime Minister Fico:] We received information that the transport of mineral
water via a pipeline to Poland was planned. We also have information about
the planned transport of drinking water to Hungary. [...] It will not be possible
to export drinking, geothermal or mineral water using pipelines or tankers.
There will be one exception—humanitarian situations when it will be
necessary to help. We will protect the producers of Slovak mineral and table
waters. We cannot prevent them from exporting packaged water from
Slovakia. 19°

1130 "Water could be spirited out of Slovakia to Poland and Hungary, the Prime Minister stated. Its export will be
banned’, Aktuality, 8 July 2014, C-123, p. 2.

181

iii, On 9 July 2014:

[Minister Ziga:] We want this law to protect water for future generations. We
have enough of it, but [we want to make sure that] there will be sufficient water
for the future generations, as if we do not protect water, nothing will be left.
[...] If mineral water is exported in a tanker or via a pipeline, those who will
be extracting it directly from the spring will be charged 200 euros per cubic
metre. When the [...] draft legislation is passed, there will no longer be such
an alternative because mineral water will not be exported in tanks or via
pipelines, and only bottled water, only bottled mineral or table water will be
exported. We had a very clear example. It concerns precisely this type of
mineral water and | describe it in detail here. The company found, from
Poland, found a spring in the village of Legnava [and] and asked for a permit
[...] in order to be able to extract the water and transport it to Poland via a
pipeline [...]. [U]nfortunately, the law does not regulate such action or solution
in situations like these, which means that there exists a loophole and the
legislation should be fixed. [...] You have to fix the legislation because [...]
essentially [...] water can be transported out of Slovakia, [...] so that, even if
the government doesn’t want to, it can be exported to Poland and it is not
regulated by the law. 1131

 

iv. On 23 February 2016:

[Prime Minister Fico:] The protection of drinking water is a priority for the
government; therefore, as of December 2014, the Constitution of the Slovak
Republic has stipulated a constitutional ban on the export of water as a raw
material by means of transport, e.g. by a tanker or pipeline. At that time we
repeatedly warned that if there were no rules on the handling of drinking and
mineral water, there might be uncontrolled exports of water to abroad. We had
information about some attempts to do so already then, and that we were not
making things up is confirmed by the fact that a complaint was filed with the
European Commission by a Polish company, which tried to export mineral
water from Slovakia using a pipeline and to bottle this mineral water in Poland
and then sell it. We also knew about similar attempts concerning drinking
water. This time, however, in southern Slovakia and in eastern Slovakia
towards Hungary. 1192
541. Against this background, it may well be that Legnava was an important concern of the
Slovak Government in relation to raw water export. After all, GFT Slovakia was the first
entity to raise the issue concretely by formally requesting authorization to engage in the
cross-border exploitation of Slovak water. Yet, in the overall assessment, one should not
lose sight of the fact that the constitutional change was primarily concerned with non-
mineral water reserves in regions other than that of the Project. Prime Minister Fico
himself stated that, if the Constitutional Amendment were to be repealed, it would
“primarily [affect] the unprecedented drinking water reserves that [the Slovak Republic
has in] Zitny ostrov’.'8° Moreover, for his part, Minister Ziga pointed out during his

testimony that, as Minister of Environment, mineral water fell outside of his competence

and that, to the extent that he referred to the Project, he was using it as an example to
illustrate his point that under the then-applicable legal situation no national regulation
prohibited or regulated water exports. ''* Thus, placed in context, the Tribunal considers
that the Ministers’ references to the Project do not signal targeting. Rather, they appear
to denote an attempt to raise awareness and illustrate the reality of the risk of water
export with an example, ''® which appeared necessary to the extent that some MPs
challenged''®° or were unaware"? of the existence of such risk.

In any event, the Project was not the only cross-border undertaking in the Government's
forethought. Prime Minister Fico also alluded to “similar attempts” to export raw drinking
water to Hungary,''®® presumably the VVS-ZKV venture"? and/or the other initiatives
seeking to export water from Zitny ostrov (as described in the Water Report).'"“°

Moreover, the Slovak legislators appeared to have deemed the Project and the interest
by foreign investors in Slovak water, particularly mineral water, as a secondary
consideration. The record as a whole does not support the conclusion that Legnava was
a central concern in the passing of the Constitutional Amendment. Nor does it suggest
that the Project drove the Parliament to adopt the Constitutional Amendment.

For these reasons, the Tribunal determines that the Constitutional Amendment neither
discriminated against nor targeted the Claimant or its investment in Slovakia.

ii. Reasonability

The reasonableness of a State measure depends on whether it pursues a rational policy
bearing a reasonable relationship with a legitimate public purpose.''*’ The Parties
generally agree on this description of the standard.'"42

(a) Public purpose

Investment treaty arbitration tribunals owe deference to States in determining what
serves as a legitimate public purpose. Indeed, the “precise contours of public purpose
[...] lie within the internal constitutional and legal order of the State in question”.'? As
recognized by the LIAMCO tribunal, under international law, States are free to judge for
themselves what they consider “useful or necessary for the public good”.'"“* Hence, the
presumption is that State conduct seeks to attain a legitimate common good. '"°

According to the Respondent, the Constitutional Amendment falls within its powers to
“regulate matters in the public interest through the protection of its natural resources, the
environment, and the health of its people”.''° In particular, the Slovak Republic asserts
that the Constitutional Amendment sought to achieve the legitimate policy objectives of:
(i) “ensur[ing] that Slovakia’s finite water resources are adequately protected and
preserved for the betterment of its people”;'"” (ii) “protecting and ensuring” the “safe”,
“appropriate”, and “rational use” of Slovak water;''® and (iii) “preserv[ing] water
resources in Slovakia against the effects of climate change”. '™*°

By contrast, Muszynianka submits that the Respondent has failed to “invoke a consistent
defense” to justify the Constitutional Amendment, as it “struggles to specify the public
purpose” behind it.'®° For the Claimant, there is a disconnect between the public

purpose invoked during the Constitutional Amendment's legislative process (which
focused on preventing excessive extraction and uncontrollable export of water) and the
Respondent's submissions in this arbitration. "5"

The “Rationale Report”, prepared by the Slovak Government to explain the content of
the draft Constitutional Amendment and to justify its introduction to Parliament in August
2014, confirms that the objectives invoked by the Respondent in this arbitration for
passing the Constitutional Amendment have remained consistent:

Given its sensitive predisposition to vulnerability, as well as an increasing impact of
the climate change and its expected negative impacts on the environment, waters
included, it is necessary that the State protects, sustains and maintains its water
resources as a valuable and irreplaceable raw material. [...] Special attention will be
paid to the protection and rational utilization of mineral, healing and geothermal
groundwater and an emphasis will be placed on ensuring sufficient quantity and
quality of waters for welfare and environmental services and business activities. [...]
There are applied principles of protection of health and life of people and animals,
and the public safety — due to the fact that water, as a life-important element of the
environment, is an irreplaceable raw material and natural wealth, which has strategic
significance for the security of the State, the lack of which can endanger life and
health of the citizens or put at risk fulfillment of basic functions of the State. [...] In
the interest of ensuring the protection of lives and health of people, of national
security and in the interest of development of the society and of the State, the State
must ensure sufficient quantity of good quality water for the citizens, industry,
agriculture and other utilization, not only for present but for the future generations. 115%

Environmental preservation, public health, and seeking to regulate the use of natural
resources in an informed and optimal fashion all represent core State functions and thus
legitimate policy objectives. Contrary to the Claimant's submissions, ''* the record does
not indicate that the Constitutional Amendment was discriminatory or was otherwise
adopted in bad faith.'™ Nor is the legitimacy of the public interest and the rationale
underlying the Constitutional Amendment called into question, as argued by the
Claimant,''> by the fact that Slovakia currently has “ample and sufficient water
sources”. 1156

First, environmental protection is not the only public interest invoked. The regulation of
the use of natural resources is a self-standing sovereign prerogative that is not
necessarily correlated with the level of availability of the natural resource at issue. The

same can be said of the protection of public health, which constitutes an independent
State function. The Tribunal notes in this regard the Government's objective in seeking
to situate the competence over water resource decisions within the central government,
thereby taking it away from the local and regional levels of government. ''5”

552. Second, the sufficiency of water resources in Slovakia is contentious. As seen, during
the debate of the Constitutional Amendment certain MPs questioned the availability of
data in support of the “generally accepted and received truth” that “Slovakia is rich in
groundwater sources”."'® In any event, in the words of Minister Ziga, the fact that
Slovakia may at present have sufficient reserves “does not mean that these sources are
inexhaustible or invulnerable”.''8® Slovakia’s groundwater resources are unevenly
distributed throughout its territory," with one region presenting a “tight” water balance
status already in 2011.''®' As to surface waters, an overwhelming majority of the regions
present either medium or high vulnerability in terms of water yield.'®* According to Prof.
Milan Lapin, the Respondent's climatology expert, ''® these adverse effects will worsen
due to the lower precipitation rates and temperature increases (leading to excessive
evapotranspiration) resulting from climate change. ''®

553. Third, in any event States need not wait for their natural resources to be at risk or
depleted to take action. Precautionary measures are more than appropriate with respect
to vital resources such as water, which are likely to become scarcer with time. This
should be particularly uncontroversial in the present case, as even before the

debate with the Respondent as to the existence and global consequences of climate change. Whilst, in general, the
Claimant recognizes the importance of such discussions, it finds them to be of a negligible importance in the present
case. For this reason, the Claimant chose not to address any climate-change based arguments in its submissions,
and not to call to the Hearing the Respondent's expert witness on the issue, Professor Lapin” (C-PHB, § 183; see

Constitutional Amendment, underground, natural, spring and healing waters were
already subject to a “privileged regime of regulation”. 11°

554. This being said, it is true that some of Minister Ziga’s remarks insist more on the
protection of the local economy. Both before and after the Constitutional Amendment,
Minister Ziga stated:

[T]he draft amendment to the Constitution, stipulates two exceptions from the ban
on water transportation, transporting water bottled in the Republic of Slovakia, which
is an exception in favour of the Slovak [water manufacturer?] industry, and of citizens
in terms of their cross-border travels; as well as an exception for water as a material
that is a humanitarian aid measure."

The Slovak authorities had no basis in legislation to prohibit [an] activity [such as the
Project] and could not support their stance with any specific regulation. As a result,
the added value and jobs will be created in a different country, and in our country we
will only pay for the abstraction [sic] of mineral water. [T]hose who will be bringing
back and creating new jobs, and creating added value in Slovakia, will not be paying
200 euros per cubic metre. In fact, those who would like to take the water from that
spring into a tank or install a pipeline there and transport it across the border, will be
paying 200 euros per cubic metre of water. 116”

We want to protect water as a strategic raw material for the people of Slovakia and
we want to prevent its export[.] [...] They would have pumped water from us and the
added value, employment and profit would have been created outside Slovakia. And
this is precisely the kind of case we want to prevent[.]'1©°

We do not ban the exports in consumer packaging. It means that if a company wants
to build a factory, business, bottling plant in the Slovak Republic, employ our people,
produce added value here and to pay tax on such added value, we will even support
such a company in its business activities. But, we are strictly against such a company
coming here, drilling a well, building a pipeline from it and exporting water as a
strategic raw material beneath the Poprad river or across the border and conducting
commercial activities with such water there. So, basically, this is the fundamental
position of the Slovak Republic and of the Ministry of Environment. "6°

555. However, looking at the record as a whole, these statements do not appear to the
Tribunal to be representative of the Constitutional Amendment's purposes. State intent
is often the product of a mix of factors, including political compromises, partisan
considerations, and competing interests. Accordingly, when a particular actor voices a
distinct and perhaps arguably improper purpose, it does not mean that such motive is

subsequently abandoned for the Constitutional Amendment.

reflective of the State’s intention,” nor does it indicate per se a breach of the
international obligation at issue. This is particularly true in the present circumstances
where, while adopted on an initiative of the Slovak Government, the challenged measure
was not taken by the executive power, but was the product of a democratically elected
legislature.

556. In this context, the Tribunal finds that, aside from Minister Ziga’s statements, ''”' which
he defended as being intended to illustrate the legal lacuna that concerned the
Government (i.e., that, contrary to the view of some MPs that Slovak law already
prohibited water exports, the Project showed that this was not the case), nothing else
during the legislative process indicates that the creation of jobs or wealth in the country,
or the generation of tax revenues, were central to the Constitutional Amendment's
rationale or its objectives. Therefore, while an intent of developing the local economy
may well have been involved, it is not such as to undermine the Constitutional
Amendment's declared policy objectives of protection of the environment, public health,
and water resources.''”? In any event, the Claimant does not challenge the creation of
jobs and wealth retention within Slovakia as unlawful, and rightly so. There is no question
that value creation within its territory is a legitimate State policy. In and of itself, such a
policy cannot constitute a breach of the BIT.117°

1171 Similar statements were not made by Prime Minister Fico.

1172 Indeed, the Rationale Report does not refer to economic development as one of the Constitutional Amendment's
policy objectives.

173 The Tribunal considers in this respect that the evidence as a whole must be examined to identify the main
objective(s) being pursued in relation to a particular measure. As such, it is not convinced by the dissenting opinion’s
reasoning which would impugn a measure which was driven by a set of accepted public policy and legislative
motivations because one argument in support thereof is arguably inappropriate. The Tribunal notes in this regard
that other international dispute settlement bodies have likewise had to wrestle with measures actuated by multiple
motivations and have opted to focus on the principal objective of the measure. For instance, see United States —
Certain Country of Origin Labelling (COOL) Requirements, WT/DS384/R / WT/DS386/R, Panel Report, 11
November 2012, 9§ 7.686, 7.691. In this case, the Panel examined the statements of individual legislators and
found them unhelpful. The Panel considered that different constituencies and legislators may have different
objectives, which nonetheless lead to the adoption of a measure. The Appellate Body upheld the Panel's approach
(See United States - Certain Country of Origin Labelling (COOL) Requirements, WT/DS384/AB/R /
WT/DS386/AB/R, Appelate Body Report, 29 June 2012 (adopted 23 July 2012), §{| 430-431, 453).

(b) Reasonable connection with a public purpose,
interest or objective

The next issue is whether the Constitutional Amendment was adopted “for” or bears a
“reasonable relationship” with the legitimate public policy objectives of environmental
(water) preservation, public health, and regulation of the use of natural resources.''”4 In
answering this question, to use the words of Paushok, it is not the role of an arbitral
tribunal to “weigh the wisdom of legislation”.''”® Hence, it is not dispositive whether the
State measure at issue is a “poor instrument” to achieve the public objectives sought, or
if there is “no evidence to the effect that they were in fact achieved”.''”° Instead, the
relevant criterion for the reasonable connection test is whether the State measure
represents a “potentially effective mean” to address the declared public purpose, ''”” or
whether it is “at least capable of furthering” such purpose. ''78

In other words, arbitral tribunals must pay deference to the choices States make when
deciding how to implement policy objectives. Such deference or margin of appreciation
makes sense because arbitral tribunals are not embedded within the host State and
State authorities are better placed to assess national the conditions, needs, sensitivities,
priorities, technical specificities and interests of the stakeholders. ''79

In the present case, there are a number of elements indicating that the Constitutional
Amendment was reasonable.

First, the Constitutional Amendment discourages water exports given the logistical and
economic constraints of bottling the water in Slovakia. The costs of constructing and
managing a bottling plant, and of bottling and transporting bottled water, appear higher
than those associated with bulk water exports through pipelines or tankers to a location
where bottling operations can benefit from synergies driving down total costs. The higher
costs may in term have a bearing on the volume of water retained in Slovak territory.

This establishes a reasonable connection between the Constitutional Amendment and
the policy objective of water preservation. '®

561. In this respect, one may ask whether a stronger and thus more reasonable connection
would exist if the Constitutional Amendment had prohibited the export of water entirely,
i.e., if it had not carved out inter alia bottled water from its application.''*' Yet, to the
extent that, latest upon being bottled, mineral water becomes a good which is subject to
the freedom of movement across the European internal market, not exempting it from
the scope of the Constitutional Amendment may have resulted in a violation of EU

law, 1182

562. The Claimant objects that favoring the export of bottled water “has no impact on the
volume of water extracted from sources”.''® It submits that, as the “determination
concerning the maximum exploitable amount of water from a given source is part of the
permitting process and the matter in which the extracted water will be further transported
has no bearing on this determination”.''** However, as noted by the Respondent, '®> a
decision as to the maximum amount of exploitable water was only required with respect
to mineral water, thus not covering the majority of Slovakia’s water reserves (i.e., non-
mineral water).

563. Second, by allowing exports in bottles only, the Constitutional Amendment prevents that
underground water, which according to the Act on Waters is “primarily designated” for
human consumption and drinking purposes, ''®* be exported for industrial purposes. As
noted by Minister Ziga, in the Parliamentary debates, “it's hard to imagine for
[underground] water to be used for something else than drinking” if bottled prior to
export.''8” The Claimant does not challenge that the Slovak Republic could determine
the purpose for which water could be exported, and rightly so. Prior to the Constitutional

1180 Supra, 4 547.

1181 The Constituti It also the border transportation of water for personal
consumption up to a certain point (i.e., 20 litres per person) and for humanitarian aid or emergency assistance. The
reasonability of these exemptions is self-explanatory and in any event is not subject to dispute.

1182 |t is currently disputed before the competent EU institutions whether unbottled water is a good under EU law
and, therefore, whether the Constitutional Amendment denotes a trade hindrance contrary to EU law. This Tribunal
does not need to determine this issue to decide whether the Slovak Republic breached its obligations under the BIT
(see infra, J] 580 et seq) and is in any event not constituted to resolve disputes pertaining to EU institutions alone.

Amendment, the Slovak Republic lacked mechanisms to control how water would be
used after export.''8® The Constitutional Amendment remedies this lack of control. By
directing that water can only be exported in bottles and thus indirectly determining that
exports are for drinking purposes alone, it reasonably advances the legitimate policy
objective of regulating the rational use of Slovak water. At the same time, the
Constitutional Amendment appears to rule out exports for industrial purposes. Contrary
to the Claimant’s submissions,''®® this could have an impact on the total amount of
Slovak underground water, thereby furthering the public purpose of water preservation.

564. Third, the Constitutional Amendment ensures that Slovak authorities are able to carry
out all required safety and hygienic compliance tests in relation to the production of
mineral water. The Tribunal has established that being the State from where the mineral
water would be extracted, the Slovak Republic is the only one accountable under the EU
Mineral Water Directive for the content and production of Slovak water vis-a-vis other
Member States." To this effect, Slovakia must control that the mineral water's “original
purity”, “mineral content’, “trace elements”, and “other constituents”, are preserved from
extraction to bottling.’ These requirements seek, inter alia, to “protect the health of
consumers”.''? Requiring that mineral water be bottled prior to export enables the
Inspectorate to guarantee, not only through remote supervision, ''®° but by way of on-site
supervision, ''™ the “hydrogeological, chemical, physical, microbiological and biological”
content of the water throughout the production process.''®> Thereby, the Constitutional
Amendment promotes the legitimate policy objective of public health. Notably, the
protection of public health, particularly in the context of water transport, was a
consideration cited in the Constitutional Amendment's Rationale Report.'1%°

568.

For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the Constitutional Amendment bears a
reasonable relationship with the legitimate public policy objectives of water preservation,
public health, and regulation of the use of natural resources, and, as a consequence,
that it meets the reasonableness test under the FET standard.

iii. Proportionality

In order to satisfy the principle of proportionality, a State measure must be suitable to
achieve a legitimate public purpose (a); necessary to achieve the objective pursued in
that no less burdensome or intrusive, yet feasible and equally effective measures exist
(b); and not excessive in consideration of the relative weigh of the interests at issue (i.e.,
proportionality strictu sensu) (c).''8” The Tribunal notes that neither Party has made
submissions on the third step of the proportionality test, namely, proportionality stricto
sensu. Nevertheless, to the extent that proportionality stricto sensu is indeed part of the
standard, the Tribunal cannot forego its analysis.

(a) Suitability

A State measure is deemed suitable if it is rationally connected to the objective it pursues
by being capable of advancing or having a causal relationship with that objective. ''® The
suitability test is thus materially indistinguishable from the reasonableness test, which
the Tribunal has conducted above. The Claimant itself acknowledges that proportionality
is “interconnected” with reasonableness"? Having affirmed that the Constitutional
Amendment was reasonable, the Tribunal also accepts its suitability.

(b) Necessity

The Claimant only challenges the necessity of the Constitutional Amendment on the
basis that Slovak law already incorporated a mechanism controlling the extraction of

the Slovak Republic. In water transport it is necessary to preserve its preferential designation for use in the public
interest, public safety and protection of health and life of people and animals in the territory of the Slovak Republic”.).

underground water, i.e., the Maximum Quantities Decisions.'?° That is correct, but it
only applied to mineral water, not water in general, '?°' thus leaving the majority of the
Slovak Republic’s water resources unprotected. Moreover, as stressed by the
Respondent, the decision on the maximum exploitable amount of mineral water “only
ensures that a particular hydrogeological unit of water remains naturally renewable and
does not take into account the overall water situation in the Slovak Republic”. 10

Therefore, the Claimant has identified no less restrictive (yet available and equally
effective) measures that the Respondent could have adopted as an alternative to the
Constitutional Amendment. That burden lies on the investor. Host States cannot be
expected to ex officio demonstrate, within a universe of options, that the measure at
issue was the least restrictive and viable to achieve the intended public purpose.

This being so, given that mineral water represents only a small portion of Slovak water,
the Tribunal has asked itself whether the Respondent should have carved out mineral
water from the scope of the Constitutional Amendment or improved its maximum
quantities decisions system to monitor the overall yield of Slovak water. At some point,
the Respondent indeed considered such an arrangement. The Water Report (approved
by Resolution No. 583/2012) envisaged conditioning the cross-border exploitation of
Slovak water to a case-by-case approval process, which would in turn be subject to
establishing that the water remaining within the Slovak Republic would be sufficient to
satisfy national demand. 123

In the past, some investment tribunals have held that the necessity requirement was not
fulfilled as soon as they had identified a possible alternative measure. '*°* The necessity
test, however also demands that alternative measure to be available and equally
effective. Without any empirical evidence proving that these conditions are satisfied,
engaging in such a scrutiny would exceed the Tribunal’s institutional capacity. It would
blur the line between adjudication and policy-making, the latter being reserved to the
State’s legislative and regulatory organs. Thereby, it would fail to grant the deference
owed to States on how to implement their policies. In any event, water preservation was

not the only public purpose pursued by the Constitutional Amendment. Accordingly, a
potential alternative in terms of control over water extraction would not be dispositive of
necessity in relation to the other public purposes involved.

For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that, on the record before it, the Constitutional
Amendment meets the necessity test.

(c) Proportionality stricto sensu

Proportionality stricto sensu requires weighing the effects of a State measure on an
investor's rights or interests and the significance of the purpose pursued by the measure.
According to some, this third step “is apposite because an analysis that stops at the
necessity-stage would allow restricting a right severely in order to protect a negligible
public interest”.'?°5 Others sustain that it is questionable whether tribunals should at all
engage in this form of analysis “due to arbitrators’ lack of embeddedness in the state or
region, the ad hoc nature of investment arbitration and the absence of an appellate
facility”. 12°

On this backdrop, the Tribunal considers that it cannot forego this review, but in
performing it, the Tribunal must exercise restraint. Consequently, proportionality stricto
sensu would be lacking when a measure imposes an excessive burden on an investor's
rights in relation to the aim of the measure. '2°”

Whatever the standard, the present case is clear-cut. The public purposes that prompted
and were reasonably connected with the Constitutional Amendment, namely,
environmental conservation, public health, and the regulation of natural resources, are
far from negligible, as are the specific objectives they advanced: the protection and
rational use of water. The vital importance of this non-renewable resource cannot be
overstated, especially in an era of alarming climate change. By contrast, while the
Claimant may have had a commercial interest in the (cross-border) exploitation of the
Legnava Sources, it held no right or even a legitimate expectation to that effect. No

relevant private interest at issue therefore seems remotely capable of outweighing the
public interests involved in the adoption of the Constitutional Amendment.

576. On this basis, the Tribunal finds that the Constitutional Amendment meets the
proportionality test under the FET standard.

iv. Consistency

577. The Claimant submits that the Constitutional Amendment implied inconsistent treatment
on two main accounts. On the one hand, it argues that the political process that led to
the adoption of the Constitutional Amendment was not linear, given that as of the “critical
date” of 8 July 2014, the Respondent targeted the Claimant. '°° The Tribunal has already
established that the primary and overarching concern behind the Constitutional
Amendment, that is, the preservation of drinking water and underground water in
general, remained the same both before and after the so-called “critical date”. °° It has
also held that the Constitutional Amendment did not discriminate against or target the
Claimant. 121°

578. On the other hand, the Claimant submits that, prior to this arbitration, the Slovak
authorities (i.e., the Ministry of Environment, the Ministry of Finance, and the Direction
of Government Legislation), as well as the Slovak SOLVIT Centre,'#'' had concluded
that unbottled mineral water was a commodity under EU primary law.'?'? Consequently,
pursuant to Article 35 of the TFEU, that water cannot now be the subject of quantitative

export measures or measures with equivalent effect between Member States, such as
the Constitutional Amendment. '2'3

579. The Respondent and its expert on EU food regulation Mr. O’Rourke strongly contest that
unbottled water constitutes a commodity subject to EU rules on free movement of
goods. '2"* Still, during the arbitration, the Respondent has paid little attention to the
statements of the Slovak authorities and SOLVIT Centre invoked by the Claimant. '215

580. The CJEU has long stated that, under EU law, any item with an “intrinsic commercial
value” constitutes a “good” for the purposes of the EU Treaties.'2'® Still, the intrinsic
commercial value of an item is contingent on it being able to be “valued in money” and
“capable, as such, of forming the subject of commercial transactions”. '2'’ As for mineral
water as such, Slovak law precludes private parties from purchasing or selling mineral
water prior to bottling. '?'° Under the Act on Mineral Waters, the Slovak Republic transfers
the ownership of the water to an enterprise upon extraction pursuant to an exploitation
permit and payment. '?'9 To the extent that this transfer may be regarded as a commercial
transaction, it would follow that Slovak natural mineral water acquires the status of “good”
under EU law, at the earliest upon being extracted further to an exploitation permit and
payment and latest upon being bottled.

581. In this context, it is noted that the relevance of national law in the determination of the
commerciality of water is not disputed, '?° and rightly so. Although the EU Water
Framework Directive defines water generally speaking as a “commercial product”, it
immediately adds that water is not a product “like any other but, rather, a heritage which
must be protected, defended and treated as such”.'?*’ In this regard, the EU

Commissioner for the Environment confirmed that, while the EU Water Framework
Directive “cannot be interpreted as a limitation to the perception of water as a
commodity”, |? it “falls within the powers of a member state to decide whether to treat
water as a commercial product, however, under non-discriminatory terms for third parties
and in accordance with the rules of the internal market”. "5

On this basis, the Constitutional Amendment cannot constitute inconsistent treatment
towards the Claimant. Lacking the Exploitation Permit, the water of the Legnava Sources
remained underground and thus in Slovakia’s full ownership. It can hardly be inconsistent
for the Slovak Republic to dispose of a natural resource it fully owns and to allow its
extraction and exploitation only for projects providing for bottling prior to export. While it
might have been inconsistent to impose such a condition at a time when GFT Slovakia
would already have an Exploitation Permit or held a legitimate expectation to receive
one, that is not the situation here.

Having reached this conclusion, the Tribunal need not make a final determination as to
whether and when natural mineral water is a good for the purposes of the EU Treaties
prior to bottling, as the statements by the Slovak authorities and the SOLVIT Centre
which Muszynianka invokes coincide with the analysis above. '?*

For instance, on 26 July 2012, further to an earlier opinion rendered by the Slovak
SOLVIT Centre,'25 the Ministry of Environment informed GFT Slovakia that:

[A]ny [natural] mineral water pumped out from the groundwater body cannot be
considered to be an exclusive property of the Slovak Republic any further and the
disposal rights of state administration bodies to such water cannot be regulated as
the state, having granted the permit, transferred its rights to the holder of the permit
subject to specified terms and conditions including payment and the natural mineral
water has become goods that is subject to fundamental principles of free circulation
of goods in the EU internal market. 1226

In this regard, the Ministry of Environment concluded that it would be inappropriate to
impose post-Exploitation Permit requirements to the exploitation of the Legnava

Sources, such as the conclusion of an inter-governmental agreement between the
Slovak Republic and Poland. ‘727

586. Similarly, on 14 November 2013, the Slovak Direction of Government Legislation
observed that the EU Commission consider[ed] “water as a good”.'?8 This statement,
unknown to GFT Slovakia at the time, was made in relation to cross-border trading and
possible taxation of water exports, and thus assumed a post-permit extraction. The same
view was shared by the Ministry of Finance, also unknown to GFT Slovakia
contemporaneously. '7°

587. The importance of first securing an Exploitation Permit under Slovak law for the water to
qualify as a commodity under EU law was underscored in two reports issued in the
context of the draft amendment to the Act on Waters. The first one, dated 26 July 2013,
stated that “[t]he entity that owns or obtains a water exploitation permit (irrespective of
the purpose of use) has, under the European legislation in force, the right to export water
to the European Union countries”.'?°° The second one, dated 28 April 2014, stated that
“in accordance with the current provisions of national and European legislation”, “water
taken from a water source and supplied to the consumer (under an exploitation permit)
for a fee is according to the [TFEU] (Art. 34 and Art. 35 of the Treaty), [a] good[] - a
subject of commercial transactions”. It went further to state that, “[t]herefore, a
fundamental distinction should be made between the relation to water at its source [and
the] relation to the abstracted water which becomes a commodity”. 125!

588. None of these statements could have suggested to GFT Slovakia or Muszynianka that
the regulatory void on cross-border exploitation of water that existed before the
Constitutional Amendment would remain unchanged. Nor could they have indicated that

the Slovak Republic would forego its right to dispose of its own untapped natural
resources in a legitimate manner by imposing pre-Exploitation Permit conditions.

Consequently, the Tribunal concludes that the Constitutional Amendment does not entail
inconsistent treatment in breach of the FET standard.

e. The Exploitation Permit proceedings

The Claimant alleges that the State Spa Committee (i) failed to notify GFT Slovakia about
the commencement of the proceedings; (ii) failed to give GFT Slovakia the possibility to
comment on the evidence gathered prior to deciding on the Exploitation Permit; (iii)
stayed the proceedings due to the lack of a Building Permit that was not necessary; and
(iv) ignored the time limits of the Administrative Procedure Code so as to decide on the
Exploitation Permit after the Constitutional Amendment and deny the Exploitation Permit
on that basis.'?? According to the Claimant, such conduct represents “significant
violations” of Slovak administrative law. 1293

The Tribunal has already established that a State’s violation of its law can constitute a
breach of the FET standard to the extent the conduct complained of is abusive or
arbitrary.'2°4 Indeed, the mere violation of domestic law does not necessarily entail a
breach of international law'> and vice-versa the lawfulness of a measure under
domestic law does not imply its lawfulness under international law.'7°° The Tribunal will
therefore assess whether the measures impugned, be they compliant with Slovak
administrative law or not, denote abusive or arbitrary treatment contrary to FET.

i. Notification of the commencement of the proceedings

Article 18 of the APC addresses the commencement of administrative proceedings and
requires the authority to give notice to the parties of such commencement:
(1) Proceedings shall commence based on the proposal of a party to the
proceedings or the initiative of an administrative authority.

(2) | Proceedings shall commence on the day on which a party to the proceedings
delivered their proposal to the relevant administrative authority. If a

proceeding commences based on the initiative of an administrative authority,
the proceeding shall commence on the day on which this authority took the
first step against a party to the proceeding.

(3) The authority shall notify all known parties to the proceedings of the
commencement of a proceeding. If parties to the proceedings or their place of
residence are not known, or if stipulated by a special regulation, the parties
shall be notified of the commencement of the proceedings by a public
notice. 1287

The Claimant submits that the State Spa Committee failed to comply with Article 18(3)
of the APC, as it never notified GFT Slovakia, the authorities affected by the Exploitation
Permit application, and other unknown parties, about the commencement of the
Exploitation Permit proceedings, thereby preventing them from raising any facts or
objections with respect to such proceedings. '?°* The Respondent does not dispute that
the State Spa Committee never served a notice pursuant to Article 18(3) of the APC. '7°°

As noted by Dr. Potasch, the purpose of Article 18(3) is to ensure that a party is aware
of the existence of administrative proceedings so that it may exercise its procedural
rights. 174° Under Article 18(2) of the APC, when proceedings are initiated by a private
party, they are deemed commenced upon the filing of the application. Here GFT Slovakia
filed an application for an exploitation permit in December 2011.'' Hence, even without
receiving the notice of the commencement, it knew of the proceedings and was thus in
a position to exercise its rights. As a result, the purpose of Article 18(3) was met. 1242

As a consequence, the State Spa Committee’s failure to notify GFT Slovakia in
accordance with Article 18(3) of the APC lacks the significance required to qualify as a
FET breach. While still technically being an omission by the State Spa Committee, the
Tribunal finds no evidence of arbitrary or abusive treatment.

1242 In addition, to the extent a private party voluntarily takes part of an administrative proceeding, the notification
requirement in Article 18(3) of the APC is not essential even if said proceeding is initiated by a public entity (see
Judgment of the Supreme Administrative Court of the Czech Republic, 16 March 2004, File No. 7 A 163/2002 — 53,
R-263). In this respect, the Tribunal notes that the Parties’ Slovak law experts refer to Czech administrative law to
interpret Slovak administrative law due to the similarities of both legal systems (see Jakab ER, CER-2, 496; Potasch
ER Il, RER-6, {9 74, 179, fn. 44).

200

ii. Opportunity to comment on the evidence gathered

596. Article 33(2) of the APC requires State authorities to give applicants the opportunity to
comment prior to a final decision:

The administrative authority is obliged to provide the parties to the proceedings and
participating persons with the opportunity to comment on the grounds used to reach
its decision and on how it was ascertained, or to propose the supplementation of the
same, before the decision is issued. 1243

597. According to the Claimant, GFT Slovakia was never given such an opportunity before
the State Spa Committee denied the Exploitation Permit.'*“* Yet, as noted by the
Respondent, ‘75 the Claimant's allegation is simply at odds with the record.

598. The State Spa Committee based its rejection of the Exploitation Permit application
exclusively on the Constitutional Amendment. In relevant part, the State Spa
Committee's decision reads as follows:

The request of GFT Slovakia [...] to use [the Legnava Sources] is rejected because,
pursuant to Art. 4(2) of the Constitution of the Slovak Republic [...] effective as of 1
December 2014, the transport of [unbottled] water taken from water bodies located
in the territory of the Slovak Republic across the borders of the Slovak Republic by
means of transport or via pipeline is prohibited. 1246

599. Before reaching this determination, on 9 December 2014, the State Spa Committee
elicited GFT Slovakia’s comments pursuant to Article 33(2) of the APC in the following
terms:

At its meeting on 8 December 2014 the Commission discussed the completed
documentation for the above requirements, and reviewed the applicant's
[Exploitation Permit] request [...] with the reference to the fact that Article 4 (2) of the
[Slovak Constitution] has changed with effect from 1 December 2014. The current
wording is as follows: “The transport of water withdrawn from water bodies located
in the territory of the Slovak Republic across the border of the Slovak Republic by
means of transportation or pipeline shall be prohibited; the prohibition does not apply
to water for personal consumption, drinking water packed into consumer packages
in the Slovak Republic and natural mineral water bottled in consumer packaging in
the territory of the Slovak Republic and for the provision of the humanitarian aid and
assistance in emergencies. Details about the conditions of transport of the water for
human consumption and water to provide humanitarian aid and assistance in
emergencies are determined by law’.

Considering the above, the [State Spa Committee], in accordance with § 33 (2) of
the [Administrative Procedure Code], calls on the on the applicant to express within
30 days from the receipt of this call whether he insists on the submitted application

in full or wishes to modify the application, because—due to the above reasons—it
will not be possible to satisfy his initial application. 1247

On 18 December 2014, GFT Slovakia confirmed that it insisted on the original terms of
its application. 1248

In other words, GFT Slovakia was afforded the opportunity to comment on the ground
invoked by the State Spa Committee to deny the Exploitation Permit before the final
decision and GFT Slovakia made use of it. Consequently, there can be no question of a
breach of FET.

iii. The stay of the proceedings and Building Permit

On 8 February 2012, the State Spa Committee stayed the Exploitation Permit
proceedings because GFT Slovakia’s application did not meet the formal requirements
of Article 11 of the Act on Mineral Water, and because of the “need to resolve” a
“preliminary issue”, namely, the possibility of viably constructing the water treatment
plant and pipelines needed to transport the water from the Legnava Sources to the
bottling plant in Poland. The State Spa Committee therefore requested GFT Slovakia to
bring its application in conformity with Article 11 of the Act on Mineral Waters and to
submit a Building Permit for the facilities necessary for the exploitation of the Legnava
Sources. 1749

On 1 August 2012, GFT Slovakia corrected and completed its Exploitation Permit
application pursuant to Article 11 of the Act on Mineral Waters. On 19 September 2012,
the State Spa Committee deemed GFT Slovakia’s application complete with respect to
the requirements of Article 11 of the Act on Mineral Waters. However, it continued the
stay of the proceedings as the Building Permit was still outstanding. '°° On 11 July 2014,
GFT Slovakia submitted the Building Permit to the State Spa Committee. '25'

It is not disputed that the State Spa Committee was right in staying the proceedings
under Article 11 of the Act on Mineral Waters. Nor is it disputed that the State Spa
Committee is empowered to stay the proceedings if a preliminary issue must be resolved
before a decision can be taken over an application. The dispute is rather whether the

State Spa Committee was correct in characterizing the need for a Building Permit as a
preliminary issue to the issuance of the Exploitation Permit.

While Slovak law does not define the notion of “preliminary issue”, #5? administrative law
doctrine suggests that a preliminary issue is a condition to the decision of a State
authority over which condition that authority has no decision-making power. '25>

Article 15 of the Act on Mineral Waters specifically allows the issuance of an Exploitation
Permit before an applicant obtains a building permit.'%* In particular, Article 15(1)
addresses the situation where an Exploitation Permit holder (i.e., “source user”) lacks
the “relevant equipment to exploit” the sources. A source user in such situation must
submit, the “project documentation for the construction of [the relevant] facility” within a
year. '755 On the basis of the project documentation, pursuant to Article 15(2), the State
Spa Committee must issue a binding opinion regarding the “conditions of the facility
location, construction, and operation [...] in order to ensure that [the] natural mineral
water sources [in question] are exploited in a permitted way”.'?5° In accordance with
Article 15(4), the binding opinion of the State Spa Committee is a “precondition for the
issuance” of a Building Permit.'25” It follows that a Building Permit is not a strictly
necessary condition for the issuance of an Exploitation Permit.

Bearing this in mind, the question is whether the State Spa Committee’s choice to
nevertheless stay the proceedings pending the issuance of the Building Permit
constituted a breach of FET. In the Tribunal’s opinion, the answer is negative. Not only
was the Building Permit in any event indispensable to execute the Project, '?°* but the
Exploitation Permit application presented unprecedented legal and factual issues.

608. Indeed, the State Soa Committee did not only need to assess, pursuant to Article 15(2)
of the Act on Mineral Waters, whether the documentation for the location and
construction of the mineral water treatment and connecting pipelines allowed the
Legnava Sources to be “exploited in a permitted way”. '75° It was also to determine
whether the construction of the facilities was viable from a technical and legal
perspective. '2° For instance, as noted by Dr. Potasch, the Project warranted the State
Spa Committee “to wonder what building authorities would be competent to issue the
construction permit(s), whether the Slovak and the Polish authorities would have a
shared competence relating to the parts of the construction in their respective territories,
[and] whether the Slovak or the Polish authority have priority when permitting the
construction as a whole”.'6' Given the circumstances, including the State Spa
Committee’s duties to ensure the hygienic conditions of exploitation and of the final
product under the Mineral Water Directive, the Tribunal finds that the State Spa
Committee’s requirement for a Building Permit as a “preliminary issue” and the
consequent stay of the Exploitation Permit proceedings was at the very least reasonable;
it was certainly not arbitrary, abusive, or otherwise contrary to FET.

609. In fact, before this arbitration, GFT Slovakia never questioned the stay of the Exploitation
Permit proceedings due to the lack of a Building Permit. Although it had standing to do
so, GFT Slovakia did not challenge the State Spa Committee’s decisions of 8 February
or 19 September 2012. '?° To the contrary, before the Slovak courts, it insisted that its
application met “all formal and material conditions” for an Exploitation Permit at the time
when it submitted the Building Permit, impliedly accepting that it did not before. 126° That
position is an additional reason not to consider the State Soa Committee’s request for a
Building Permit as arbitrary or abusive.

iv. The non-compliance with the Administrative Procedural
Code time limits

Article 49 of the APC sets out the time limits and rules under which Slovak administrative
authorities must issue their decisions:
(1) In simple matters, especially if it is possible to make a decision based on

documentation submitted by a party to proceedings, the administrative
authority shall decide without delay.

(2) In other cases, unless otherwise provided for by a special law, the
administrative authority shall be obliged to make a decision within 30 days of
the commencement of a proceeding. In particularly difficult cases, it shall
decide within 60 days. If given the nature of the matter, a decision cannot be
made within this period, an appellate body (a body competent to decide about
an appeal) may extend it for a reasonable period. If the administrative authority
cannot make a decision within 30 or 60 days, it shall be obliged to notify the
party to the proceedings thereof, and state the grounds. '?64
It is common ground that GFT Slovakia’s Exploitation Permit application constituted a
“particularly difficult case” falling under Article 49(2) of the APC. Therefore, save for an
extension by its “appellate body”, namely the Ministry of Health, the State Spa Committee
was required to decide GFT Slovakia’s application by 22 December 2011. It is equally
undisputed that the duration of a stay is not counted against the time limits set in

Article 49 of the APC.

The Claimant challenges the legality of the State Spa Committee’s decision of
19 September 2012 maintaining the stay of the Exploitation Proceedings for lack of a
Building Permit.'65 It argues that the running of the time-limit for the decision resumed
as of 1 August 2012, i.e., the date when GFT Slovakia brought its application in
conformity with Article 11 of the Act on Mineral Waters.'7°° As approximately 40 days
had already elapsed between the filing of the application and the start of the stay, '7” the
State Spa Committee, so says Muszynianka, should have rendered its decision by
21 August 2012.16 Yet, in breach of Article 49 of the APC, the State Spa Committee
withheld its decision until after the Constitutional Amendment.'° As the Constitutional
Amendment was the only basis invoked to deny the Exploitation Permit, the Claimant

submits that, before the Constitutional Amendment the State Spa Committee should
have issued the Exploitation Permit. '2”°

The Tribunal has difficulty accepting the Claimant's submission that the State Spa
Committee should have decided GFT Slovakia’s Exploitation Permit application by
21 August 2012, when GFT Slovakia argued in court that its application met “all formal
and material conditions” for the issuance of the Exploitation Permit as of 11 July 2014. '271
That said, it is clear that the State Spa Committee failed to meet the deadline set in
Article 49 of the APC. It also failed to seek an extension from the Ministry of Health. If
one accepts that the application was complete by 11 July 2014, the State Spa Committee
had to issue its decision by either 31 July 2014 (if one counts the days elapsed before
the stay) or 9 September 2014 (if one uses a full 60-day period). This is how the Regional
Court in Bratislava assessed the situation in its decision on GFT Slovakia’s motion to
revoke the Exploitation Permit’s denial:

[T]he court cannot agree with the objection that the [State Spa Committee] failed to

issue a decision within the legal 30 days deadline because the provision of Article

49(2) also specifies a 60 days deadline; the court, however, needs to agree with the

objection that the [State Spa Committee] has failed to meet this and other duties as

the content of the administrative file does not prove it had requested deadline

extension to issue its decision nor has it notified the Claimant accordingly. If it failed

to do so, then period of time since the very latest 60 days deadline had lapsed after

the Claimant's application was completed in full, ie. after 11 July 2014, may be

judged as failure to act[.]'?7*
According to the Respondent, under Slovak law the failure to comply with the APC’s time
limits does not affect the validity of the State Soa Committee’s denial of the Exploitation
Permit.'?”° Be that as it may, the evidence shows that the State Soa Committee sat on
GFT Slovakia’s application waiting for the precise formulation of the Constitutional
Amendment to be decided. Between July 2014 and the denial of the Exploitation Permit
in January 2015, the State Soa Committee only requested the District Office in Presov
to provide a copy of the opinion rendered by the Ministry of Environment in the
proceedings leading to the issuance of the Building Permit.'?74 The District Office in

PreSov provided that opinion the following day.'?”5 Other than that, the State Spa

Committee undertook no fact-finding activities or otherwise considered GFT Slovakia’s
application in any of its monthly sessions held on 11 August 2014, 22 September 2014,
13 October 2014, and 24 November 2014. 1276

The State Spa Committee’s delay and passivity was not accidental. Ms. Bozikova was
very straight forward in stating at the Hearing that the Ministry of Health ordered the State
Spa Committee to halt the proceedings for GFT Slovakia’ Exploitation Permit until the
adoption of the Constitutional Amendment.'2’” Yet, at no point was GFT Slovakia
informed of the Ministry of Health’s order or of the State Soa Committee’s willingness to
comply. In fact, as of 11 July 2014, GFT Slovakia received no news at all from the State
Spa Committee, which prompted it to file a complaint before the Supreme Court on the
ground of the State Spa Committee's inactivity. 17°

It is therefore evident that the Exploitation Permit proceedings were conducted in willful
disregard of Slovak administrative law and the transparency expected from State
authorities. No extension of time was sought pursuant to Article 49(2) of the APC, the
Ministry of Health itself ordered that the decisional process be stopped, and the
Respondent deliberately opted to keep GFT Slovakia entirely in the dark. In the
Tribunal’s view, such treatment was in breach of the FET standard.

The Tribunal having found a breach, questions arise regarding the consequences of the
breach. In other words, the Tribunal must inquire into the element of causation, which is
a requirement for damages to be payable. The Parties do not dispute that causation must
be positively established. '?”° Causation is addressed in the present context rather than
in a separate section later because of the close link with the facts discussed here.

Causation is conveniently assessed by looking at a counterfactual or but-for scenario,
i.e., by removing from the facts the violative conduct. In this regard, had the State Spa
Committee complied with the APC’s time period prescriptions, it would have sought an
extension under Article 49(2) of the APC and would most likely have received it until after
the adoption of the Constitutional Amendment when it would have denied the Exploitation
Permit.

Assuming a slightly different counterfactual where the State Spa Committee would not
have sought or would not have been granted the extension, or the extension itself would
somehow be objectionable, this would still not mean that the Project would have unfolded
as intended. Irrespective of the State Spa Committee’s reproachable conduct, GFT
Slovakia was required to obtain the occupancy and water treatment permits to operate
the water treatment plant and thus actually exploit the Legnava Sources. It could only
have procured these two sets of permits upon the completion of the water treatment plant
and connecting pipelines, '7°° which would have taken approximately eight months'?*' as
of the Building Permit’s effective date of 10 July 2014, '2° that is until March 2015 (i.e.,
after the Constitutional Amendment entered into force). In this context, it is common
ground between the Parties’ Slovak law experts that the authorities competent to issue
the occupancy and water treatment permits would have been compelled to deny them in
light of the Constitutional Amendment, '° thereby precluding the Project as envisaged
by Muszynianka.

Finally, and irrespective of the legality of the Constitutional Amendment, the Tribunal has
already established that GFT Slovakia had no entitlement nor legitimate expectation to
the Exploitation Permit.

In consequence, the Respondent has committed a breach of FET by the manner in which
it conducted the latter part of the Exploitation Permit proceedings. However, this breach
was inconsequential in the sense that it was not causal of any subsequent loss suffered
by GFT Slovakia and the Claimant. Indeed, the Claimant’s entire damage calculations
are premised on the assumption that the Project would have proceeded as intended, '7
which, as was seen, has not been established.

c. EXPROPRIATION

1. The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant argues that its business plan, consisting of treating the extracted water in
Slovakia and transporting it under the Poprad river for bottling in Poland, “was the only
viable option” and “possible method to commercially benefit from” the Legnava

Sources”. '28 Building a bottling plant in the Slovak Republic in compliance with the
Constitutional Amendment, would be impossible for two reasons." First, the Legnava
region lacks the necessary road infrastructure allowing for the “daily transport of large
amounts of bottled mineral water by heavy trucks as required by the Project”. '287 Second,
the Legnava region is a “flood risk area” affected by “severe floods” in the past,
particularly in 2010. 128

623. With respect to the infrastructure, the Claimant stresses that:

i. It is irrelevant whether other water producers are able to operate in the north
of Slovakia. Their operations concern the Slovak domestic market only.
Consequently, their transportation needs are less consequential than
Muszynianka’s. Moreover, it follows from the photographs presented by the
Respondent that these producers make use of roads in dramatically better
conditions than State Road 3138 and other secondary roads available to
GFT Slovakia. 1789

ii. | Mr. Kundrat himself, Mayor of Legnava, confirmed in November 2011 that
Legnava’s road infrastructure could not support heavy vehicles. ‘29° Jointly
with Legnava’s former Mayor, Mr. Jan Kicura, he stated in April 2012 that
there was “no infrastructure [in Legnava] and therefore, [GFT Slovakia’s]
undertaking can be realized in no other way but the proposed one — by
sharing the production between two countries”.'?°' These statements stand

Consequently, it cannot seek protection against expropriation on the basis of non-

632. Second, in any event, given that the Claimant’s business plan is not the “one-and-only-
one” to make economic use of the Legnava Sources, the Respondent did not
substantially deprive or impair the Claimant’s alleged investment.'%°° A contrario, the
Claimant structured its investment as it now claims it “purely for commercial reasons”. 133!
The Information Memorandum confirms this fact;'%*2 it advised GFT Slovakia’s potential
purchasers that locating a water treatment plant in Slovakia and a bottling plant in Poland
would make it “possible to [...] reduce investment outlays” while using “favourable and
formal legal conditions applicable in each country”.'%83 It follows that the Claimant's
allegations in relation to Legnava’s lack of infrastructure and flood risk are “fiction”. 134
Rather, if it so chooses, the Claimant can still exploit the Legnava Sources in a manner
consistent with Slovakia’s current laws. 1935

633. In respect of the allegedly deficient road infrastructure, the Respondent submits that:

i. At no point did the Slovak authorities make promises regarding the
renovation of Legnava’s infrastructure and/or the construction of a bridge
over the Poprad river, '33° which is shown by the Claimant's inability to provide
documentary evidence of the alleged promises or assurances. 15”

required in December 2010)'%*' would have taken 37 months and cost

634. As regards flood risk, the Respondent contends that Muszynianka’s concern is a “made-
for-arbitration story”, '%*° and especially highlights the following aspects:

i. All of Muszynianka’s evidence and submissions prior to its Reply framed the
alleged risk of floods only in the context of the June 2010 flood.'3®° Still, the
Claimant’s current reliance on the 2001 and 2004 floods is self-defeating: it
fails to explain why GFT Slovakia later considered building the bottling plant
in proximity to boreholes LH-1 or LH-2A through LH-5. 135"

ii. Be this as it may, the 2010 flood was not a consideration behind placing the
bottling plant in Muszyna. The Information Memorandum, on which
Muszynianka based its decision to acquire GFT Slovakia and so heavily

relies in this arbitration, makes no mention of flood risk in Legnava. '952

iii. In any event, Legnava is not a flood-risk area, nor was it among the
municipalities severely damaged by the June 2010 floods; it appears
nowhere in the official reports on the floods.'25° The letter by Mr. Kundrat
relied upon by the Claimant does not say the contrary.'9% First, it refers to
“partial flooding”, which does not equate to the devastation Muszynianka
suggests took place in Legnava.'5 Second, the image attached to Mr.
Kundrat’s letter does not reflect the alleged partial flooding of GFT Slovakia’s
property.'25° Rather, it is a document prepared on GFT Slovakia’s request
that was included in the drawings “submitted for the water treatment
plant”. 1997

On this basis, the Respondent argues that it did not expropriate the Claimant's alleged
investment. 35 Further, it reiterates its position that the Constitutional Amendment is not
discriminatory nor did it target the Claimant. 1359

Last, with respect to the alleged due process violation, '%° the Respondent states that
the Claimant “appears to confuse the principles of due process in the implementation of
a legislative measure with a denial of justice under international law’.'%*' In this regard,
it submits that, considering that the Claimant pursued its claims before the Slovak courts,
and that the “permitting process was entirely fair”,'2°* no denial of justice has occurred. '96

3. Analysis

Article 4(1) of the BIT reads as follows:

Neither of the Contracting Parties shall take, either directly or indirectly, measures of

expropriation, nationalization or any other measure having the same nature or an

equivalent effect against investments belonging to investors of the other Contracting

Party, unless the measures are taken in the public interest, on a nondiscriminatory

basis and under due process of law and provided that provisions be made for

effective and adequate compensation. [...]
The Claimant submits that the Respondent indirectly expropriated its investment in the
Slovak Republic by adopting the Constitutional Amendment and subsequently denying
the Exploitation Permit. As is expressly recognized in Article 4(1) of the BIT, measures
other than actual takings or formal transfers of property titles may be tantamount to
expropriation. It is generally accepted that an indirect expropriation giving rise to a State’s
duty to compensate arises when the investor has been substantially deprived of its
investment. '3%

The Claimant’s investment in the Slovak Republic lies in its shareholding in GFT
Slovakia. It is common ground that the Claimant retains ownership of its shares in GFT
Slovakia which still owns the land in Legnava and the know-how relating to the

exploration, identification, and assessment of the Legnava Sources. These assets have
value and can still be used and disposed of by the Claimant.

There is no doubt in the Tribunal’s mind that the value of GFT Slovakia, if the Project
could have been carried out as planned by the Claimant in terms of mixing and branding
(a dubious assumption given the Tribunals prior determinations), is considerably less as
a consequence of the fact that Muszynianka’s business plan cannot be carried out on a
cross-border basis at all. It is also clear that, if Muszynianka were to decide to
nevertheless exploit the Legnava Sources, it would have to do so in conformity with the
Constitutional Amendment at significantly higher costs than it contemplated originally.
However, these findings show no substantial permanent deprivation of the investment.
The ownership of an asset does not per se confer the right to use that asset in the most
profitable manner or any other particular way. ‘5° This would have been different if GFT
Slovakia had indeed acquired the right to use its assets in such a particular way, that is,
if it had been authorized to exploit the Legnava Sources in accordance with the Project's
initial design. In that case, an argument could have been made that passing the
Constitutional Amendment without providing a transitory regime for holders of existing
exploitation permits was constitutive of an expropriation. Be it as it may, this is not the
situation here. The Claimant held no Exploitation Permit and, as was discussed earlier,
had no entitlement or even a legitimate expectation to the issuance of that permit and
there remains value in GFT Slovakia.

For these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent has not expropriated the
Claimant’s investment. Consequently, it dispenses with the analysis of the legality of the
expropriation.
D. IMPAIRMENT THROUGH UNREASONABLE OR DISCRIMINATORY MEASURES
1. The Parties’ positions

The Claimant submits that the Respondent has breached the non-impairment standard
in Article 3(1) of the BIT,'9° as the Constitutional Amendment and the denial of the

1365 See Glamis Gold, Ltd. v. United States of America, UNCITRAL, Final Award, 8 June 2009, RLA-75, § 357
(“Several NAFTA tribunals agree on the extent of interference that must occur for the finding of an expropriation,
phrasing the test in one instance as, “the affected property must be impaired to such an extent that it must be seen
as ‘taken’” and in another instance as, “the test is whether that interference is sufficiently restrictive to support a
conclusion that the property has been ‘taken’ from the owner”).

1366 BIT, C-1, Art. 3(1) (“Each Contracting Party shall protect within its territory investments made in accordance
with its laws and regulations by investors of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair by unreasonable or
discriminatory measures the management maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension, sale and should it so happen,
liquidation of such investments”.).

Exploitation Permit “impaired” its investment through “unreasonable” and
“discriminatory” measures. "67 With respect to the existence of an impairment, it refers to
its allegations on substantial deprivation and destruction of its investment in the context
of expropriation.'° Similarly, in relation to reasonableness and discrimination, it relies
on the position put forward under its other claims, including FET and expropriation. 9%

The Respondent mirrors the Claimant’s approach. It argues that the Constitutional
Amendment did not impair Muszynianka’s alleged investment, as the Claimant itself
admits that the shareholding in GFT Slovakia and associated rights remain
untouched.'3’° It further submits that the Constitutional Amendment was neither
discriminatory nor unreasonable.'*’”' Moreover, it argues that the denial of the
Exploitation Permit was appropriate and reasonable, citing its position on the other
claims and as confirmed by the Regional Court in Bratislava. 972

2. Analysis

Article 3(1) of the BIT reads as follows:

Each Contracting Party shall protect within its territory investments made in

accordance with its laws and regulations by investors of the other Contracting Party

and shall not impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management,

maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension, sale and should it so happen, liquidation

of such investments.
Arbitral tribunals have discussed the relationship between the non-impairment standard
and the FET standard. For instance, the tribunal in Impregilo determined that the non-
impairment standard was a “specification” of the “general requirement” to accord
investors fair and equitable treatment. °”° Similarly, the Sa/uka tribunal observed that the
notions of “reasonableness” and “non-discrimination” are the same in the context of both
the FET and non-impairment standards. ‘9’ In this regard, it determined that, “insofar as
the standard of conduct is concerned”, a violation of the non-impairment standard does

not “differ substantially” from a violation of the FET standard. '°”5 It added that the non-
impairment standard “merely identifies more specific effects of such violation, namely,
with regard to the operation, management, maintenance, use enjoyment or disposal of
the investment by the investor”. "97°

646. The Tribunal concurs that reasonableness and non-discrimination imply the same
obligations on behalf of the host State under the FET and non-impairment standards.
This being so, while a FET breach exists irrespective of the harm it may have caused,
the non-impairment standard, as its name indicates, implies the existence of an
impairment, i.e., of harm.'S’” If there was no impairment then it serves no purpose to
inquire into the reasonable and non-discriminatory nature of a measure. 8”

647. A determination that the Slovak Republic has breached Article 3(1) of the BIT
presupposes an impairment in the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment,
extension, sale or liquidation of the investment. Contrary to the Respondent's
submissions, the Treaty does not require that the impairment be substantial. The term to
“impair” can be understood as to “hinder” or “harm”. Accordingly, a mere “detrimental
impact” on the investment is sufficient to satisfy the standard. '°”°

648. On this basis, the Tribunal has little doubt that the measures have impaired the use and
enjoyment of the Claimant's investment in the Slovak Republic. Moreover, while the
Tribunal has established that the Constitutional Amendment was neither unreasonable
nor discriminatory,'%®° it has found that the Exploitation Permit proceedings were
conducted in an arbitrary manner. '%*' As noted by the tribunal in Glencore, “all measures
which are arbitrary are also unreasonable”. '*°? The Tribunal is of the same view and
therefore holds that the Respondent's behavior during the Exploitation Permit
proceedings constitutes a breach of the non-impairment standard. However, for the

reasons provided in the context of FET, that breach is not causal and thus cannot give
rise to compensation. '

E. CONCLUSION

The Tribunal thus reaches the conclusion that the manner in which the Slovak Republic
conducted the administrative proceedings on GFT’s Slovakia’s application for the
Exploitation Permit breached the FET and non-impairment standards in Articles 3(2) and
3(1) of the BIT. By contrast, the other violations alleged are not made out.

In this context, the Tribunal recalls that the Respondent invokes the police powers
doctrine to preclude its responsibility under the Treaty. However, it only does so with
respect to the Constitutional Amendment itself,’ for which no_ international
responsibility has been established. It does not raise the police powers exception in
relation to the conduct of the Exploitation Permit proceedings, for which the Tribunal has
found breaches. As a result, the Tribunal will dispense with the analysis of the Parties’
contentions on police powers.

Similarly, it will dispense with addressing quantum, since it has denied causation above
in relation to the Treaty violations that have been admitted. Hence, such violations cannot
give rise to damages.

COSTS
A. THE CLAIMANT’S POSITION

The Claimant submits that, pursuant to Articles 38 and 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules,
the Tribunal must allocate all costs in accordance with the “cost follow the event” rule. 885
Hence, should the Claimant prevail “both on jurisdiction and the merits”, the Respondent
must bear all arbitration, legal representation, assistance and other costs incurred by the
Claimant regarding the “main” and “incidental proceedings”.'*°° Alternatively, the
Claimant submits that, should the Tribunal decide any differently on either jurisdiction or
the merits, the Respondent should bear its own costs in any event. This is so, says the

Claimant, to the extent that its claims met the standard of “not being frivolous”, ‘°°’ and
the arguments it advanced were “reasonable and justified by the circumstances”. 1%

As to the “main proceedings”, the Claimant stresses that the Respondent's “entirely
speculative” allegations on illegality caused unwarranted costs and prevented the
arbitration from unfolding in an efficient and cost-effective manner.'%° As to the
“incidental proceedings”, the Claimant recalls that the Respondent aggresivelly pursued
a meritless challenge against Mr. Alexandrov (the Claimant's initial appointee), and did
not prevail in its untimely requests for bifurcation and for the production of the Deloitte
Report.'59° According to the Claimant, these unfounded procedural spats resulted in the
arbitration being considerably delayed and entailing important additional costs for which
the Respondent must be held accountable. '°°"

The Claimant further submits that the costs claimed by the Respondent are
unreasonable for three main reasons. First, the Respondent's legal fees are three times
higher than those of the Claimant and, irrespective of the outcome of this arbitration, the
Claimant should not be responsible for the Respondent’s choice to engage a vast legal
team. '5%? Second, the Respondent engaged a number of experts dealing with various
issues, from climate change to civil engineering, whose expert opinions were often of
questionable evidentiary value if any.'5%° Third, the Respondent impermissibly seeks
reimbursement for legal and other expert opinions never submitted in this arbitration. '°%*

Lastly, the Claimant argues that it did not generate unnecessary costs notwithstanding
the Respondent's allegations to the contrary:

i. The Claimant was not responsible for the fact that the first procedural hearing
held on 12 May 2017 did not take place in-person at the Peace Palace, and

ii. The Claimant's conduct during the document production phase was
reasonable and in good faith.'®°° By contrast, out of the ten documents
contained in the Respondent's privilege and confidentiality log, seven were
not protected by privilege and their production was ordered with damaging
consequences for the Respondent's case. '°”

iii. |The Claimant's engagement of Dr. Kucharski was reasonable given his
professional experience and the Respondent has failed to identify a single
inconsistency, calculation error or methodological flaw in his expert
report. 1998

iv. The Claimant was entitled to modify the amount of damages sought in this
arbitration. That is common practice in international arbitration, more so to
the extent that the heads damages remained unchanged. '99

B. THE RESPONDENT'S POSITION

657. The Respondent concurs with the Claimant that, pursuant to Articles 40(1) and 38 of the
UNCITRAL Rules, “the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful
party”, "4° including the legal costs.'*% It further submits that, while the Tribunal can
apportion the costs between the Parties if reasonable in light of all circumstances, '°5 no
such apportionment is warranted in the present case and the Claimant must bear all of
the costs of this arbitration.'*°° This is so, says the Respondent, to the extent that its
costs are reasonable in view of the complexity of the case, '*°” its conduct did not cause
excessive costs or delay,'*°® and by contrast, the Claimant's conduct generated
additional and unnecessary costs. '4°°

658. In particular, the Respondent submits that the Claimant:

Slovak, and Polish law. ‘41°

moreover failed to produce a substantial number of documents ordered in a
timely manner. "41?

Consistently mischaracterized the evidence before the Tribunal regarding
the alleged flood risk and insufficient road infrastructure in Legnava. "41

Engaged Dr. Kucharski to provide an expert opinion of Muszynianka’s sales
forecasts, notwithstanding the fact that Dr. Kucharski lacked relevant training
in economics and demand forecasting. ‘414

Made damage calculations that were a moving target throughout the
proceedings. "16

659. In response to the Claimant’s allegations on the reasonability of its costs, the

Respondent submits that:

It was entitled to raise the illegality objection and to retain an expert to that
end. 1416

The presentation of expert evidence, such as that of Prof. Lapin, was justified
to underpin the rational policy behind the Constitutional Amendment.'*'”
Moreover, while the opinion of some experts who had been retained were
not filed in the form of an expert report, they served as a basis for the
preparation of the Slovak Republic’s briefs. '"°

c. ANALYSIS

661. Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides as follows:
The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its award. The term ‘costs’
includes only:

(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator
and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 39;

(b) The travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;

(c) The costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral
tribunal;

(d) The travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses
are approved by the arbitral tribunal;

(e) The costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party if
such costs were claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and only to the extent
that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is
reasonable;

(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the expenses
of the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.

662. Article 38 recognizes broadly three categories of costs and expenses: (i) Tribunal costs,
comprising the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the Secretary; (ii) Party costs,
comprising the legal and witness/expert related costs incurred by the Parties; and (iii)
administrative costs, comprising the fees and expenses of the PCA, including with regard
to hearing and other expenses.

663. In the course of the arbitration, each Party made cost advances to the PCA in an amount
of EUR 540,000.00.

664. During the arbitration the members of the Tribunal spent a total of 1,383.8 hours as
follows: Prof. Robert G. Volterra 425.4 hours; Mr. J. Christopher Thomas QC 322.4
hours; and Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler 636 hours. The Parties agreed in the Terms
of Appointment that the Tribunal’s time would be compensated at an hourly rate of
EUR 600, exclusive of VAT where applicable. ‘4 Because of a shortfall in available funds

668.

following the last advance payment, the members of the Tribunal reduced their fees
proportionately to each one’s total fees. As a result, the arbitrators’ fees are as follows:
Prof. Robert G. Volterra EUR 237,116.88; Mr. J. Christopher Thomas QC
EUR 179,703.21; and Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler EUR 354,503.75.

The Secretary of the Tribunal spent a total of 522.5 hours, which corresponds to fees of
EUR 130,625.00 at the hourly rate of EUR 250 agreed in the Terms of Appointment. 425

The Tribunal and the Secretary have incurred expenses in the amount of EUR 27,235.86.
The PCA’s fees for the administration of the case amount to EUR 37,114.50. Other costs,
relating in particular to the hearing expenses, catering, court reporting services, etc.,
amount to EUR 113,700.80. Therefore, the total costs of the proceedings amount to
EUR 1,138,959.16, reduced to EUR 1,080,000.00. The PCA will provide the Parties with
the case statement of account in due course.

Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules sets out the standard on the basis of which the
Tribunal must determine the allocation of the above categories of costs:

“1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be
borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each
of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable,
taking into account the circumstances of the case.

2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in

article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances

of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may

apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is

reasonable. [...]”
Pursuant to the first sentence of Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the unsuccessful
party shall in principle bear the costs of the arbitration. The Claimant has prevailed on
jurisdiction; admissibility; the lawfulness of the Project’s cross-border nature, of mixing
the Legnava Sources among themselves, and of selling a product under the
“Muszynianka-Legnava” trade name/description; and on its FET and non-impairment
claims regarding the State Spa Committee’s conduct during the Exploitation Permit
proceedings. Yet, the Claimant was unable to establish causation and thus is not entitled
to compensation for the Respondent's breaches of the Treaty. The Respondent has
prevailed on the content of Muszynianka’s mixing and branding plans; the law governing
those plans; and the illegality of trading a product under the “Muszynianka’ and
“Muszynianka Plus” trade names/descriptions. The Respondent has also prevailed on
expropriation and on the FET and non-impairment claims regarding legitimate

1425 ToA, Art. 13, 4 56.

228

expectations, the entitlement to the Exploitation Permit, and the Constitutional

Amendment.

665. Considering the outcome of the case, the complexity of the legal and regulatory issues

involved, which could legitimately give rise to disagreements, and the fact that both

Parties have conducted these proceedings in a professional and cost-effective manner,

the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that it is most appropriate for each party to bear

half of the costs of the proceedings (Tribunal, Secretary and PCA fees and expenses)

and its own legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration.

XI. OPERATIVE PART

666. On the basis of the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal renders the following decision:

vi.

The Tribunal has jurisdiction over this dispute;
The claims before it are admissible;

The Slovak Republic has breached Articles 3(2) and 3(1) of the BIT by the
manner in which it conducted the administrative proceedings on GFT
Slovakia’s application for the Exploitation Permit;

Each party shall bear half of the costs of the proceedings.

Each Party shall bear the legal fees and other expenses which it incurred in
connection with the arbitration.

All other claims are dismissed.
