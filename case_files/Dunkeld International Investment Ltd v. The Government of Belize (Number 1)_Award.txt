INTRODUCTION

THE PARTIES

The Claimant in this arbitration is Dunkeld International Investment Limited (“Dunkeld” or the
“Claimant”), a private company with limited liability, incorporated under the laws of the Turks
and Caicos Islands, with its registered address at Box 97, No. | Caribbean Place, Leeward
Highway, Providenciales, Turks and Caicos Islands. The Claimant is represented in these
proceedings by Ms. Judith Gill QC, Ms. Lauren Lindsay, Mr. Alastair Campbell, and Ms. Shreya
Aren of Allen & Overy LLP, One Bishops Square, London EC1 6AD, United Kingdom; by
Ms. Angeline Welsh of Matrix Chambers, Griffin Building, Gray’s Inn, London WCIR SLN,
United Kingdom; and by Mr. Eamon H. Courtenay, S.C. of Courtenay Coye LLP, Attorneys-at-
Law, No. 15 ‘A’ Street, Belize City, Belize.

The Respondent in this arbitration is the Government of Belize, a sovereign State (the
“Government,” “GOB,” or the “Respondent”). The Respondent is represented in these
proceedings by Mr. Juan C. Basombrio, Esq. of Dorsey & Whitney LLP, 600 Anton Boulevard,
Suite 2000, Costa Mesa, California 92626, United States; by Mr. James K. Langdon, Esq. of
Dorsey & Whitney LLP, 50 South Sixth Street, Suite 1500, Minneapolis, MN 55402; and by
Mr. Denys Barrow, S.C. of Barrow & Co. Attorneys-at-law, 1440 Coney Drive, Belize City,

Belize.

BACKGROUND OF THE DISPUTE

A dispute has arisen between Dunkeld and the Government in respect of which the Claimant
commenced arbitration pursuant to the Agreement between the Government of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Belize for the Promotion
and Protection of Investments of 30 April 1982 (the “Treaty”). The Treaty was extended to the
Turks and Caicos Islands (the “TCI’’) by an Exchange of Notes in 1985.

The subject matter of this dispute concerns the Government’s compulsory acquisition of the
Claimant’s interest in Belize Telemedia (“Telemedia”), a telecommunications company
registered in Belize. In light, however, of the Parties’ Settlement Agreement dated 11 September
2015, the present Award is restricted to matters of quantum in relation to the acquisition of

Telemedia.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

INITIATION OF THIS ARBITRATION AND EVE! IN 2010

 

On 27 August and 24 September 2009, the Claimant wrote to the Respondent, notifying it that
pursuant to Article 8(1) of the Treaty, Dunkeld intended to submit its claim to international

arbitration.

As the Parties did not reach a settlement of their dispute within the three-month period called for
by the Treaty following notification of the claim, the Claimant commenced these proceedings
(PCA Case 2010-13 or “Dunkeld I”) by way of a Notice of Arbitration served on the Respondent
on 4 December 2009. In its Notice of Arbitration, the Claimant exercised its option to select
arbitration under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade

Law, 1976 (the “UNCITRAL Rules”) in accordance with Article 8(2) of the Treaty.

By way of its Notice of Arbitration, the Claimant notified the Respondent of its appointment of
Mr. John Beechey as the first arbitrator. Mr. Beechey’s address is Oriel Cottage, Long Common,
Shamley Green, Nr. Guildford GUS OTG, United Kingdom.

On 27 January 2010, pursuant to Article 7(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Claimant wrote to the
Permanent Court of Arbitration (the “PCA”), requesting that the Secretary-General of the PCA

designate an appointing authority to appoint the second arbitrator.

On 11 February 2010, the Respondent wrote to the PCA, requesting that the Secretary-General of
the PCA “stay all further action” with regard to the arbitration. The Respondent enclosed two
interim injunction orders, dated 30 December 2009 and 10 February 2010, issued by the Supreme
Court of Belize and directing the Claimant to refrain from further pursuing this arbitration (the
“Dunkeld I Injunction”). Under the judicial system of Belize, the Supreme Court of Belize is a
court of general original jurisdiction. From the Supreme Court, appeals may be brought to the
Court of Appeal. As from | June 2010, appeals from the Court of Appeal may be brought to the

Caribbean Court of Justice.

On 19 February 2010, the Claimant requested the PCA to proceed with the designation of an
appointing authority. Claimant emphasised that the Dunkeld I Injunction was not directed at the
PCA or at any international tribunal. On 23 and 25 February 2010, the Parties exchanged further

correspondence on the subject of the Dunkeld I Injunction.

PCA Case N° 2010-13
Award
Page 3 of 132

On 25 February 2010, the Secretary-General of the PCA designated the Honourable Marc
Lalonde, P.C., O.C., Q.C. as the appointing authority (the “Appointing Authority”) for this

arbitration.

On 15 March 2010, the Appointing Authority wrote to the Parties, indicating that he would
appoint a second arbitrator in accordance with the Claimant’s request. The Appointing Authority
noted that the appointment would be without prejudice to any jurisdictional objections the

Respondent might submit to the Tribunal, once constituted.

On 16 March 2010, the Appointing Authority appointed Mr. Rodrigo Oreamuno as the second
arbitrator. Mr. Oreamuno’s address is Facio & Cafias, Barrio Tournon, PO Box 5173-1000, San

José, Costa Rica.

On | April 2010, the Respondent enacted the Supreme Court Judicature (Amendment) Act 2010.
This legislation created three new criminal offences relating to the breach of an injunction and

established additional penalties.

On 13 April 2010, at the request of the co-arbitrators, the PCA wrote to the Parties informing
them that, pursuant to Article 7(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the co-arbitrators had selected
Professor Dr. Albert Jan van den Berg as the Presiding Arbitrator. Professor van den Berg’s
address is Hanotiau & van den Berg, IT Tower, 9th Floor, Avenue Louise 480, bte9, 1050

Brussels, Belgium.

On 20 April 2010, the Tribunal informed the Parties that a preparatory conference would be held

with the Parties on 15 June 2010 to determine the further conduct of the proceedings.

On 1 June 2010, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that the Belize Court of Appeal had allowed
an appeal against the Supreme Court’s Dunkeld I Injunction brought by seven individuals subject
to the injunction (although not by Dunkeld itself). The Claimant stated its view that “[t]he logic
of the Court of Appeal decision is that the Injunction will also fall away against Dunkeld, even
though the formality of a further application to set aside may be required.” By the same letter and
subsequently by letter of 4 June 2010, the Claimant requested confirmation from the Respondent
that it would not enforce the Dunkeld I Injunction against the Claimant, its officers or advisors

for preparing for or participating in the preparatory conference.

On 8 June 2010, the Tribunal, upon the Claimant’s request of the same day, vacated the
preparatory conference scheduled for the 15 June 2010. The Claimant explained that the

Respondent had not been forthcoming on Claimant’s request to confirm that the Dunkeld I

Injunction would not be enforced against Claimant, its officers, or advisors, for taking part in the

preparatory conference.

On 26 July 2010, the Tribunal informed the Parties that a new preparatory conference was

scheduled for 26 August 2010.

On 27 July 2010, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it would not attend the preparatory
conference or pay any deposit as it was “unable to take any steps in the proceedings due to the
combined effect of the injunction against it issued by the Supreme Court of Belize . . . and the

Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment) Act 2010.”

From July 2010 until November 2013, these arbitration proceedings were suspended.

THE SECOND TREATY ARBITRATION, OR “DUNKELD IT”

On 27 July 2010, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it had commenced a second treaty claim
against Belize (PCA Case No. 2010-21 or the “Dunkeld II Proceedings”), including a claim for
the “expropriation of its right to arbitrate”, and provided the Tribunal with a copy of the Request
for Arbitration that had been served on the Respondent on 26 July 2010. The Claimant again

appointed Mr. John Beechey as arbitrator.

In a separate letter dated 27 July 2010, Claimant informed the Tribunal that the Dunkeld II
arbitration was subject to an injunction granted on 26 July 2010 by Justice David Steel of the
High Court of Justice of England and Wales (Commercial Court), Queen’s Bench Division, (the
“Anti-Suit Injunction”), which restrained the Government from “commencing, pursuing,
progressing or taking any steps before the Courts of Belize or elsewhere to enjoin or restrain the
Claimant and/or the Tribunal from commencing or taking any steps in an anticipated arbitration

against [the Government] under [the Treaty]”.

The Respondent did not participate in the Dunkeld II Proceedings and the Secretary-General of
the PCA appointed the Honourable Marc Lalonde, P.C., O.C., Q.C. as the Appointing Authority.
By 29 October 2010, the tribunal for Dunkeld II was constituted (the “Dunkeld II Tribunal”),

consisting of the same members as the present Tribunal.

On | December 2010, the Claimant notified the Dunkeld II Tribunal that despite the Anti-Suit
Injunction, the Respondent had asked the Supreme Court of Belize to issue an injunction against

the Dunkeld II arbitration.

On 17 December 2010, the Claimant submitted its Statement of Claim in the Dunkeld II

proceedings with accompanying documents.

On 20 December 2010, the Dunkeld II Tribunal held a telephone conference to which both Parties
were invited. Only the Claimant elected to participate. In response to a request from the Claimant,
the Dunkeld II Tribunal issued Order N° 1 on 21 December 2010, indicating that it neither
approved nor disapproved the Claimant’s wish to approach the English High Court for a
continuation of the Anti-Suit Injunction. On 21 December 2010, the Claimant obtained an order
from the English High Court to continue the Anti-Suit Injunction until further notice or until a

final award was rendered.

On 10 January 2011, the Dunkeld II Tribunal circulated draft Order N° 2 to the Parties for
comment. The Order was issued on 17 January 2011, and among other matters fixed the place of
arbitration as The Hague, the Netherlands. In Order N° 3, dated 8 February 2011, the Dunkeld II
Tribunal scheduled a hearing from 14-15 March 2011 and in Order N° 4, dated 16 February 2011,
the Dunkeld II Tribunal decided to continue with the proceedings pursuant to Article 28(2) of the
UNCITRAL Rules despite the Respondent not taking part in the proceedings. Further in
preparation of the hearing, the Dunkeld II Tribunal by Order N° 5, dated 1 March 2011 and by
Order N° 7, dated 8 March 2011, allowed the Claimant to rely on documents produced after the
Statement of Claim. Order N° 6, dated 4 March 2011, laid out a schedule for the anticipated

hearing.

On 7 March 2011, the Claimant informed the Dunkeld II Tribunal that the Supreme Court of
Belize had granted an injunction against Dunkeld on 3 March 2011 in respect of the Dunkeld II
proceedings (the “Dunkeld IT Injunction”).

On 10 March 2011, the Respondent wrote to the Dunkeld II Tribunal. It requested the Tribunal to
stay the proceedings in light of the Dunkeld II Injunction. The Respondent drew attention to the
penalties applying under the Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment) Act 2010 to all persons
directing, aiding, facilitating, or encouraging the violation of an injunction issued by the courts of

Belize.

On 11 March 2011 the Claimant requested the Dunkeld II Tribunal to postpone the scheduled
hearing, explaining that it would be unable to participate in light of the Dunkeld II Injunction. By

e-mail of the same day, the Dunkeld II Tribunal granted the request for postponement.

On 14 April 2011, the Claimant informed the Dunkeld II Tribunal that it anticipated receiving a

decision from the Belize Supreme Court in relation to the Dunkeld II Injunction on 3 May 2011

and had given an undertaking not to take further steps in respect to the Dunkeld II proceedings
pending that decision. In the event that no injunction was continued, the Claimant hoped to have

the Dunkeld II hearing held in early May 2011.

On 15 April 2011, the Dunkeld II Tribunal informed the Parties that, in light of the Claimant’s
letter of 14 April 2011 and the undertaking referenced therein, the hearing tentatively

contemplated for early May 2011 was suspended sine die.

THE RESUMPTION OF THE DUNKELD I AND II ARBITRATIONS IN 2014

On 20 November 2013, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that the Belize Court of Appeal had

set aside the injunctions against both treaty arbitrations on 1 November 2013.

On 16 December 2013, the Claimant asked the Tribunal to resume the proceedings and to

schedule a procedural hearing.

On 17 December 2013, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it had decided to participate in
the Dunkeld I and II proceedings and advised the Tribunal and the Claimant of the counsel it had

retained to represent it.

On 20 December 2013, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties, inviting them to make themselves
available for a joint procedural telephone conference, in respect of both arbitrations, on 7 January

2014.

On 31 December 2013, the Tribunal postponed the procedural conference further to a request

from the Respondent for additional preparation time and the Claimant’s comments thereon.

On 10 January 2014, the Tribunal confirmed the date of 27 January 2014 for the procedural

conference.

On 27 January 2014, the Parties and the Tribunal held a joint procedural telephone conference in
the present case and in the Dunkeld II Proceedings. On the basis of the discussions during the
conference, the Parties agreed that these proceedings would continue, while the Dunkeld II
proceedings would be provisionally suspended. The Parties also agreed on a procedural timetable

for these proceedings.

On 6 February 2014, the Dunkeld II Tribunal issued Order N° 8, which suspended the Dunkeld II

Proceedings until further notice. The Dunkeld II Proceedings remain suspended to this day.

Also on 6 February 2014, the present Tribunal issued Order N° 1, which in relevant parts and as

agreed by the Parties, ordered as follows:

1. PCA Case N° 2010-21 (Dunkeld International Investment Ltd v. The Government of
Belize) is suspended.

2. The Claimant shall indicate in its Statement of Claim whether PCA Case N° 2010-21
may be dismissed in its entirety or continue to remain suspended until further notice.

3. The deposit held by the PCA in relation to PCA Case N° 2010-21 shall be used in
connection with this arbitration.

 

4. As regards transparency, for the time being the procedural orders, decisions and
awards issued and rendered by the Tribunal shall be published on the website of the
Permanent Court of Arbitration, subject to redactions based on confidentiality of
commercially or politically sensitive or privileged matters as requested by either
Party. To the extent that information is produced or discussed during the arbitration
proceedings which a Party considers to be commercially or politically sensitive or
privileged, that Party may request that the Tribunal deems it confidential.

 

5. The operative portions of Order No. 2 in PCA Case N° 2010-21 are adopted in these
arbitration proceedings, subject to the following amendments and additions. It is
enclosed to this Order No. 1 as Annex A.

10. The hearing scheduled for 5-9 November 2014 will be held in Miami, Florida. The
Tribunal will determine the venue for the hearing in due course.

The Tribunal’s Order N° 1 adopted by reference Order N° 2 from the Dunkeld II Proceedings
(originally issued on 17 January 2011 in that case (see paragraph 28 above)), which stipulated
that the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules of 1976 apply, that the place of arbitration is The Hague,
the Netherlands and that English is the language of the arbitration.

On 28 February 2014, the Claimant submitted its Statement of Claim together with the Witness
Statements of Mr. Dean Boyce and Ms. Angela Entwistle and the Expert Report of Mr. Alastair

Macpherson of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.

On 23 April 2014, the Parties communicated to the Tribunal their agreement to revise the
timetable, including extending the deadline for submission of the Respondent’s Statement of

Defence until 23 May 2014. The Tribunal approved the extension of time on 25 April 2014.

On 21 May 2014, further to a request from the Respondent and the Claimant’s comments, the
Tribunal issued Order N° 2, which extended the deadline for the Respondent’s Statement of

Defence for one week and revised the procedural timetable.

On 22 May 2014, the Parties agreed to deadlines for the notification of witnesses and the final
deadline for filing additional documents, and to a date for a pre-hearing teleconference. The

Tribunal approved these dates on 22 May 2014.

PROCEDURAL APPLICATIONS

On 9 June 2014, the Respondent requested to change the hearing venue for the hearing scheduled
from 5-9 November 2014 (the “Application for Change of Venue”). The Respondent proposed
The Hague, the Netherlands as hearing venue instead of Miami, Florida (the venue agreed by the
Parties and recorded in the Tribunal’s Order N° | (see paragraph 42 above). Alternatively, the
Respondent proposed the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in San Jose, Costa Rica. The

Respondent argued that

  
 

if the venue remains in Miami. s may arise, under the New York Convention, whether
Florida courts have primary jurisdiction over, and whether United States arbitration law
applies to, these proceedings. Further, by arbitrating in the United States, GOB may be
subject to an argument that it has waived its sovereign immunity in the United States.

 

 

Also on 9 June 2014 and again on 25 June 2014, the Respondent requested leave to introduce into
these proceedings the record of the hearing held in British Caribbean Bank Ltd. (Turks & Caicos)
v. The Government of Belize (PCA Case N° 2010-18, the “British Caribbean Bank
Proceedings”) from 17-19 March 2014 (the “BCB Transcript Application”). The Respondent
argued that the factual matrix of both matters overlapped and that “testimony taken in the BCB
[British Caribbean Bank] Arbitration merits hearing is directly relevant to the Dunkeld

Arbitration.”

On 16 June 2014, the Claimant opposed the Respondent’s Application for Change of Venue. The
Claimant argued that irrespective of whether the hearing were to be held in Miami, Florida or
elsewhere, “the Dutch courts have supervisory conduct and Dutch procedural law is applicable as

a consequence of the fact that the seat of the arbitration is The Hague.”

On 17 and 23 June 2014, the Parties exchanged further correspondence regarding the
Respondent’s Application for Change of Venue. The Respondent requested the Tribunal to note

that “GOB has not agreed to arbitration in the United States.”

On 19 June 2014, the Claimant opposed the Respondent’s BCB Transcript Application and noted
that the Respondent had previously opposed efforts to coordinate the two arbitrations. The
Claimant also saw difficulties with regard to the status of the transcript and the risk that the

transcript would be used out of context.

On 25 and 30 June 2014, the Parties exchanged further correspondence regarding the
Respondent’s BCB Transcript Application.

On 2 July 2014, the Tribunal issued Order N° 3 in respect of the Respondent’s Change of Venue
Application and ordered that

1. The dates reserved for the hearing in this matter shall remain 5-9 November 2014.
2. The venue for the hearing in this matter shall remain Miami, Florida.
3. Nothing in this order shall be construed as altering the fact that the legal place of this

arbitration is The Hague, the Netherlands, as decided in | 5 of Order No. 1 in
conjunction with { 4.1 of Annex A to Order No. 1, and that the courts of the
Netherlands accordingly have supervisory jurisdiction over this arbitration.

In its Order N° 3, the Tribunal explained that the Inter-American Court of Human Rights facilities
in San José, Costa Rica were not available during the reserved hearing dates of 5-9 November
2014 and that a change to a European venue would not permit the Tribunal to maintain the hearing

dates.

On 21 July 2014, the Tribunal issued Order N° 4 in which it granted the Respondent’s BCB
Transcript Application. The Tribunal noted that in both proceedings the Parties were represented
by the same counsel, the tribunals were identical and thus the Parties and the Tribunal were
already effectively aware of the content of the hearing transcript. The Tribunal concluded that the

Respondent’s request would neither prejudice Claimant nor would it be procedurally unfair.

THE PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS PHASE

On 10 June 2014, the Respondent submitted to the Claimant its Requests for Production of

Documents (the “Respondent’s Document Requests’).

On 10 June 2014, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal stating that it was not in a position to file its
request for production of documents due to the fact that the Respondent had not been forthcoming
in exhibiting documents in connection with its quantum expert report dated 15 May 2014 (the
“NERA Report”) or identifying documents with regard to which it claimed confidentiality. The

Claimant reserved its right to request document production at a later stage.

On 18 June 2014, the Claimant submitted four requests for documents to the Respondent. The

Respondent disclosed all requested documents to the Claimant by 27 July 2014.

On 24 June 2014, the Claimant submitted its Objections to the Resp 's Di
Requests, alongside an index of documents that were disclosed to the Respondent on the same

day. The Claimant disclosed further documents the following day.

On 8 July 2014, the Respondent submitted its Reply to the Claimant’s Objections to the
Respondent’s Document Request. In the accompanying letter to the Tribunal, the Respondent
complained that the Claimant “stonewalled” its Document Requests and only provided 33

documents in response to 139 requests.

On 11 July 2014, the Claimant submitted a Response to the Respondent’s Reply to the
Claimant’s Objections to the Respondent’s Document Request. In the accompanying letter to
the Tribunal, the Claimant lained that the R dent’s Document R in their

majority did not comply with the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence since they were overbroad

and irrelevant. Many of the re d were the

q Respondent’s own d or

documents that were already on the file. The Respondent replied by e-mail to the Tribunal

indicating that it saw no need to respond to the Claimant’s letter unless requested to do so.

On 18 July 2014, the Tribunal issued its Decision on the Respondent’s Document Requests.

THE PARTIES’ FURTHER SUBMISSIONS AND THE HEARING

On 20 August 2014, the Claimant submitted its Reply on the Merits together with the second
Witness Statements of Mr. Dean Boyce and Ms. Angela Entwistle and a further Expert Report by
Mr. Alastair Macpherson.

On 3 October 2014, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder on the Merits together with a further
Expert Report by Dr. Richard Hern.

On 10 October 2014, the Parties identified the witnesses they wished to call for cross-examination

during the anticipated November 2014 hearing.

On 14 October 2014, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal, requesting that it “continue the
hearing scheduled to begin on November 5, 2014 for a period of four months and to a date that is
convenient to the Tribunal” in light of emergency medical conditions rendering the Respondent’s

counsel unable to prepare for, or participate in, the hearing.

On 16 October 2014, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal, opposing the Respondent’s request for
acontinuance and arguing that other members of the Respondent’s counsel team could adequately
represent the Respondent in the hearing and that the Claimant would be prejudiced by the delay

and costs involved in finding alternative dates.

On 17 October 2014, the Tribunal issued Order N° 5, adjourning the hearing for a period of

approximately four months and suspending all remaining deadlines pending the identification of

new hearing dates. On 18 October 2014, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties, identifying 7 to 11
April 2015 as dates for the re-scheduled hearing;

On 17 February 2015, the Respondent submitted a Motion to Bifurcate GOB’s Preliminary
Objections (the “Motion to Bifurcate”), noting the issuance of an award in Renée Rose Levy de
Levi and Gremcitel S.A. v. Republic of Peru,' which the Respondent considered to be “dispositive
of GOB’s preliminary objection on the grounds of abuse of process and illegitimate treaty

shopping.”

On 20 February 2015, the Claimant submitted its Response to the Motion to Bifurcate,

opposing the Respondent’s request.

On 24 and 27 February 2015, the Parties exchanged a Reply and Rejoinder in respect of the

Motion to Bifurcate.

On 3 March 2015, the Tribunal issued Order N° 6, denying the Respondent’s Motion to Bifurcate
on the grounds that bifurcation is dependent upon whether it will bring increased efficiency to the
proceedings and that in light of the timing of the Respondent’s Motion, no efficiency would be

added in this case.

On 5 March 2015, the Parties both wrote to the Tribunal, identifying the witnesses and experts
they wished to cross-examine during the hearing and requesting to introduce additional

documents into the record.

Also on 5 March 2015, the Tribunal provided the Parties with a draft agenda for the pre-hearing
telephone conference and invited the Parties to confer and complete the agenda in advance of the

conference.

On 10 March 2015, the Parties wrote jointly to the Tribunal setting out their respective positions
on the issues identified in the Tribunal’s draft agenda. Later the same day, the Tribunal held a

pre-hearing teleconference with the Parties.

On 11 March 2015, the Tribunal issued Order N° 7, recording the matters agreed in the course

of the pre-hearing teleconference.
On 25 March 2015, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal, requesting leave to introduce a letter

from Dunkeld to the Government dated 9 June 2009, immediately following Dunkeld’s migration

Respondent, the letter had only recently been discovered in the files of the Government’s counsel.

On 27 March 2015, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal, opposing the Respondent’s Application
to Introduce the Letter of 9 June 2009.

On 30 March 2015, the Tribunal issued Order N° 8, denying the Respondent’s Application to
Introduce the Letter of 9 June 2009 and noting that “the Tribunal does not see that the Respondent
could not reasonably have located the document in question earlier”, in advance of the cut-off

imposed by Order N° 7.

POST-HEARING SUBMISSIONS AND THE PARTIES’ SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

On 8 May 2015, the Parties each submitted Post-Hearing Memorials, in accordance with the

agreed timetable.

On 23 May 2015, the Parties each submitted their respective Costs Submissions, in accordance

with the agreed timetable.

On 28 August 2015, the Tribunal issued Order No. 9, recalling the Respondent’s Application to
Introduce the Letter of 9 June 2009 and the Tribunal’s decision in Order No. 8, noting that during
the hearing and in their post-hearing memorials both Parties had effectively relied upon the letter
of 9 June 2009 (by way of its description in the letter of 27 August 2009), notwithstanding the
decision taken in the Tribunal’s Order No. 8, and observing that “in light of the Parties’ respective
arguments, the Tribunal considers it to be artificial to maintain the fiction that the letter of 9 June
2009 does not form part of the factual matrix of these proceedings”. Order No. 9 accordingly
admitted the letter of 9 June 2009 into the record and granted the Parties until 11 September 2015
to supplement their arguments concerning the letter of 9 June 2009, should they consider it

necessary to do so.

On 11 September 2015, the Parties wrote jointly to the Tribunal, informing it that they had entered
into a settlement with respect to some of the matters in dispute in these proceedings. Pursuant to
a Settlement Agreement dated 11 September 2015 (the “Settlement Agreement”), the Parties
agreed that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute, that there was an expropriation of
Dunkeld’s property by the Government, and that the Tribunal may determine the amount of
compensation for Dunkeld’s former interest in Telemedia. The Parties also agreed that any portion
of the per-share value of Telemedia attributable to the Accommodation Agreement should be paid
(less liabilities) into a special account to be used by the Government, with Dunkeld’s consent, to
fund projects to help the people of Belize. To implement this settlement, the Parties requested that

the Tribunal issue a Consent Order.

On 16 September 2015, the Tribunal issued Order No. 10 (by consent), which provided in full

as follows:

The Settlement Deed dated 11 September 2015, entered into by inter alia the Claimant
and the Respondent (the Settlement Deed).

The Claimant's letter of 11 September 2015, confirming that, pursuant to the terms of
the Settlement Deed, the Claimant and the Respondent (together, the Parties) have
agreed that:

@ the Respondent shall withdraw any and all of its objections to the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction and the merits of the Claimant's claims;

(ii) the Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction under the Treaty to determine the
quantum of the compensation to be awarded to the Claimant (including any
issues relating to the Accommodation Agreement in so far as they relate to
quantum) and, should it be necessary, the Parties shall submit to the
jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal on an ad hoc ba:

  

(iii) accordingly, the issues set out in Section 2.1(a) and 2.1(b) of the Claimant’s
Post-Hearing Brief no longer require determination by the Arbitral Tribunal;

(iv) the Arbitral Tribunal may proceed to determine the quantum of the
compensation to be paid to the Claimant, which the Parties agree shall include
the fair market value of the Claimant’s interest in the Telemedia shares at 25
August 2009 (plus costs, expenses and interest) (see paragraph 228 of the
Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief and paragraph 121 of the Respondent’s Post-
Hearing Brief);

(v) the remaining issues to be determined by the Arbitral Tribunal are
consequently limited to the issues set out in Section 2.1(c) of the Claimant’s
Post-Hearing Brief (as articulated in Section 8 of the Claimant's Post-Hearing
Brief and Sections 4.2 (excluding paral 14), 5, 7 and 8 of the Respondent’s
Post-Hearing Brief, together with the related pre-hearing submissions,
evidence and submissions on costs).(Remaining Issues);

The Respondent’s e-mail communication of 11 September 2015, confirming its
agreement to the terms of the Claimant's letter.

THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL HEREBY ORDERS THE FOLLOWING BY CONSENT:

1.

Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Deed, the Respondent has withdrawn any and
all of its preliminary objections to jurisdiction. The Parties have further confirmed that
the Tribunal has jurisdiction to determine the Remaining Issues. Accordingly, the
Parties have agreed specifically to confer on the Arbitral Tribunal jurisdiction to
determine the Remaining Issues alone.

Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Deed, the Respondent has withdrawn any and
all of its objections to the merits of the Claimant's claims under the Treaty. The
Respondent has expropriated the Claimant's interest in the Telemedia shares. The
Respondent has not yet paid compensation to the Claimant in respect of that
expropriation, as required by Article 5(1) of the Treaty.

 

The Arbitral Tribunal will proceed to determine the Remaining Issues in a Final
Award.

The terms of this Order by Consent will be recorded in the Final Award.

 

No further written submissions shall be made by the Parties in relation to the Allen &
Overy letter dated 9 June 2009 as envisaged in paragraph 2 of Procedural Order No. 9.

In its cover letter accompanying Order No. 10, the Tribunal noted as follows:

The Tribunal understands that the impact of the Settlement Deed on this arbitration is set out
in Clauses 3.2 and 3.3 and Schedule 2 of that instrument and that the Parties are agreed that
the Tribunal is authorized to apply these provisions of the Settlement Deed to the extent that
such application is required to resolve the Remaining Issues and any issue connected
therewith.

In the event that the Tribunal considers that any interpretation of these provisions is required,
the Tribunal will allow the Parties an opportunity to address the provision further with the
goal of clarifying the provision by agreement. In the absence of agreement, the interpretation
of the provision would become a matter for the Tribunal to decide.

 

On 29 October 2015, the Parties wrote jointly to the Tribunal, noting as follows:

On 18 2015, the Te i i (Settl ) Act 2015 and the
General Revenue Supplementary Appropriation (2015/2016) (No. 3) Act 2015 were gazetted
in Belize and made law. This legislation validated the Government's authority to enter into
the Settlement Agreement and the payment of funds to Dunkeld pursuant to the terms of the
Settlement Agreement.

The Parties noted further that “On 26 October 2015 the Caribbean Court of Justice issued a
Consent Order joining Dunkeld as a party to the appeals before it relating to the First and Second
Nationalisations of Belize Telemedia Limited and staying those proceedings save for enforcing
the terms of the Settlement Agreement” and requested the Tribunal to admit the following

documents into the record:

(a) Telecommunications Acquisition (Settlement) Act 2015 as Exhibit C-648;

(b) General Revenue Supplementary Appropriation (2015/2016) (No. 3) Act 2015 as Exhibit
C-649; and

(c) Caribbean Court of Justice Consent Order dated 26 October 2015 as Exhibit C-650.

The Tribunal wrote to Parties the same day, admitting the requested documents.

On 16 February 2016, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties, seeking clarification regarding the scope
of the Parties’ Settlement Agreement and the content of the Remaining Issues with respect to the

Claimant’s claim regarding the substantive breach of Article 8 of the Treaty.

On 26 February 2016, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal, setting out the Parties’ agreement on
the scope of the Settlement Agreement with respect to the Article 8 claim. The Respondent

confirmed its agreement with the Claimant’s understanding the same day.

On 11 April 2016, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties, noting that it had reached a conclusion on the
value of Telemedia and proposing, in light of the fact that the Tribunal had not adopted either
Party’s valuation in its entirety, that the Parties’ experts be given a chance to verify the accuracy

of the Tribunal’s calculations.

On 18 April 2016, the Parties wrote jointly to the Tribunal, agreeing to the Tribunal’s proposed
approach to check the accuracy of its calculations and committing not to seek to re-litigate issues

of substance decided by the Tribunal.

On 22 April 2016, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties, providing a copy of its draft valuation and

associated calculations.

On 13 May 2016, the Parties wrote to the Tribunal, setting out their respective comments on the

Tribunal’s draft valuation.

On 15 May 2016, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties, inviting the Respondent’s comments on one

issue raised in the Claimant’s letter of 13 May 2016.

On 23 May 2016, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal in response to the Claimant’s letter. On

26 May 2016, the Parties exchanged further correspondence on this matter.

THE FACTUAL RECORD

THE CORPORATE ENTITIES

This case concerns the ownership of Telemedia, which passed through the hands of a variety of
corporate entities before its acquisition by the Government in August 2009. The various corporate
actors in these events are set out chronologically as follows, based on the timing of their

involvement in the changing ownership of Telemedia.

Telemedia itself was incorporated in Belize on 14 September 2006 and is the statutory successor
to Belize Telecommunications Limited (“BTL”), pursuant to the Telecommunications
Undertaking (Belize Telecommunications Limited Operations) Vesting Act of May 2007.2 BTL

was incorporated in Belize in 1987.

Belize Social Development Limited (“BSDL”) is a company related to Telemedia and
incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (the “BVI’’). Once incorporated, all shares in BSDL
were allotted to Telemedia, which in turn transferred all BSDL shares to Telemedia’s

shareholders.*

In the early 2000s, 52 percent of the shares in BTL, as Telemedia was then known, were owned
by Carlisle Holdings Limited (“Carlisle”), a Belize corporate entity that is now known as BCB
Holdings Limited. The majority shareholder of BCB Holdings Limited is Lord Michael
Ashcroft. In addition to the interest held by Carlisle, other shares in Telemedia were held by the

Government.

In March 2004, the ownership structure of BTL was changed and Innovative Communication
Corporation (“ICC”), a company owned by Mr. Jeffrey Prosser, agreed to purchase a majority of
BTL shares from the Government, which in turn agreed to acquire and then transfer Carlisle’s
shares to ICC. Ultimately, ICC was unable to pay for the shares (see the discussion at

paragraph 112 below for greater detail).

In connection with the failed ICC transaction, the Royal Bank of Trinidad and Tobago Merchant
Bank Limited (“RBTT”) exercised its security over 25 percent of BTL’s shares when ICC
defaulted. Subsequently, RBTT sold its shares in BTL (by then, Telemedia) to Telemedia

Investments Limited (“TIL”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Telemedia.* This transaction was

facilitated by a loan from British Caribbean Bank (““BCB”) and was the subject of the dispute in
the British Caribbean Bank Proceedings. BCB, itself, was incorporated on 8 September 1998 as
The Belize Bank (Turks & Caicos) Limited and, on 9 February 2009, changed its name to British
Caribbean Bank Limited. At the time of the events giving rise to the Parties’ dispute, BCB was
wholly owned, through a series of intermediary corporations, by BCB Holdings Limited, a

Belizean public investment company and the successor to Carlisle.

Following the failed ICC transaction, the majority of the shares in BTL were transferred indirectly
to Dunkeld, which was incorporated in the BVI on | June 2004 and migrated to the TCI on 8 June
2009.5 Dunkeld, in turn, is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Hayward Charitable Belize Trust
(“Hayward”), which is a trust established under the laws of the TCI.° Hayward’s mission is to
“seek to enrich the quality of life for the people of Belize and of Belizean origin by providing
grants to not-for-profit organizations in Belize and across the Caribbean region that seek to

strengthen their educational, spiritual and cultural base in creative and sustainable ways.””

Dunkeld wholly owns or controls via bare trust a number of corporate entities (“the Companies”
or the “Registered Owners”) through which Dunkeld held its interest in Telemedia. Dunkeld
owns 100 percent of Thiermon Limited, while three other entities—Ecom Limited, Mercury
Communications Limited, and New Horizons, Inc.—are held on bare trust® for Dunkeld by two
other entities, Northtown Limited and Southtown Limited. Additionally, BCB Holdings
Limited held its interest in Telemedia on bare trust for Dunkeld.’ Taken together, the structure of
Dunkeld’s interest in Telemedia through these corporate entities as at August 2009 may be

represented graphically as follows:

June 2009)(Exhibit C-7).

(d) Mr. Nestor Vasquez is presently the Chairman of Telemedia.

DUNKELD’S ACQUISITION OF BTL

The Government wholly owned BTL at the time BTL was incorporated in 1987. In 1988, the
Government offered to the public 49 percent of “B” and “C” shares in the company and sold a

portion of those shares.!!

In February 1992 and early 1995, Carlisle bought shares in BTL. By 2001, Carlisle owned or

controlled around 52 percent of the shares of BTL (the “Carlisle Shares”).!?

Around the same time, the Government held around 31 percent of the shares of BTL (the
“Government Shares”).'* The Government bought Carlisle’s shares of BTL and, in March 2004,
agreed to sell both the Carlisle and Government Shares to ICC, a company owned by Mr. Jeffrey
Prosser.'* The Parties disagree in respect of the terms on which the Government purchased the
shares from Carlisle, and a dispute between Carlisle and the Government on this question was
settled by way of a Settlement Deed dated 22 March 2006 and amended on 21 June 2006 (the
“Settlement Deed”)(this would be the subject of subsequent litigation between the Government
and BCB Holdings, see paragraphs 130-132 below).'5 The Parties also disagree with respect to
the consideration provided by ICC, but agree that ICC proved ultimately to be unable to pay for

the shares.'®

In February 2005, the Government exercised its security over the Carlisle Shares and re-acquired
control over BTL.'7 In March 2005, the Government sold 15 percent of the shares in BTL to Ecom

Limited. Following the signing of the Accommodation Agreement between BTL and the

August 2007, these shares, along with others held by subsidiaries of Telemedia were redistributed
to the shareholders of Telemedia as a dividend in specie in a transaction that was the subject of
the award in the British Caribbean Bank Proceedings.”! The amount of this dividend in specie

was two ordinary shares for every five ordinary shares held.”?

rate of return as follows:

RATE OF RETURN: DETERMINATION

For the purposes of this Agreement between the Government of Belize and BTL, the parties
agree that this Schedule 2 and the Agreement records their mutual understanding and
agreement as to the formula, methodology, definitions and prescribed meanings to be used
in relation to the calculation of the Achieved Rate of Return and the Minimum Rate of Return.

Achieved Rate of Return

The Achieved Rate of Return (“AROR”) for each financial year of BTL shall be calculated
according to the method set out below:

AROR shall mean the percentage achieved by dividing earnings after tax and interest
received (“Numerator”) by book equity plus long term debt (“Denominator”) (as recorded in
the consolidated audited group accounts of BTL for the financial year under consideration)
and then expressing the product in hundredths.

Government Telecommunications Accommodation Agreement, paras.11.3(f-g), 11.4 (19 September
2005)(Exhibit C-9).

PCA Case N° 2010-13
Award
Page 27 of 132

The Numerator (also referred to in this Schedule and the Agreement as “Earnings”) shall be
calculated by adding together:

a. Operating Income after deducting all taxes, plus

b. interest income, as drawn from the consolidated audited group accounts of
BTL for the year under consideration.

The Denominator (also referred to in this Schedule and the Agreement as the “Rate Base”),
shall be calculated by adding together:

a. total shareholders’ equity (including capital and revenue reserves), plus
b. long term debt, plus
c. current portion of long-term debt, as drawn from the closing balances of the

consolidated audited group accounts of BTL for the financial year under
consideration.

“Operating Income” means all revenue earned by BTL net of all charges levied against
revenue by BTL, including, but not limited to, all operational and other charges such as staff
costs; travel costs; distribution costs; corporate management costs; professional fees
(including legal, accounting and technical fees); sales and marketing expenses; depreciation
and amortization charges; licence and frequency fees; bad debt charges, provisions and write-
offs; asset write-offs; currency exchange charges; bank charges; interest charges on short
term debt; cost of sales, and interconnection fees.

 

 

 

  

Minimum Rate of Return

The Minimum Rate of Return (MROR) per annum is 15%. This is the agreed minimum rate
of return that BTL must achieve in each financial year. The consequential value to be
obtained by BTL in applying the MROR in each financial year under consideration is the
sum achieved by multiplying the MROR against the Rate Base in the given financial year.

Acquired A: id Payments Incurred
For the avoidance of doubt, any assets acquired and payments incurred by BTL in the
performance of this Agreement, or in subsequent financial years through the normal course

of business, shall be included as part of the “Rate Base”, for the purposes of calculating the
monetary value of the AROR and MROR.

120. The Accommodation Agreement was amended through three amendment deeds executed on 21

121.

November 2005, 15 December 2006, and 7 January 2008, respectively.

The Parties concluded the second amendment deed after there had been a shortfall in the minimum.
rate of return during the previous fiscal year. The second amendment deed gave the Government
more time to pay the shortfall for the fiscal year ending on 31 March 2006 and provided that, if
the Government failed to timely pay the shortfall, “then such unpaid amount may be set-off by
BTL against the amount of any taxes or any other payments or obligations due and payable by
BTL to the Government.”** The second amendment deed also clarified as follows with respect to

taxation pursuant to the Accommodation Agreement:

3. TAXATION ISSUES

3.1 The Government agrees that it will confirm to the Income and Business Tax
Department BTL’s exemption in relation to withholding tax (as provided for in clause
6.1 (v) of the Original Agreement) and provide BTL with a copy of this confirmation
within 90 days of the date of this deed.

3.2 The Government agrees that it will confirm to the relevant fiscal departments that all
goods, material, equipment and machinery imported for BTL’s own use (whether
before or after the date of this deed) are free from import duties and General Sales
Tax and provide BTL with a copy of this confirmation within 90 days of the date of
this deed.

3.3. The Government agrees to reimburse BTL the sum of BZ$1,169,373.70 within 90
days of the date of this deed for taxation paid on goods, material, equipment and
machinery imported for BTL’s own use since 19 September 2005. The Government
further agrees that in the event that it fails to reimburse BTL for this sum in full by
this date then such unpaid amount may be set-off by BTL against the amount of any
taxes or any other payments or obligations due and payable by BTL to the
Government.

3.4 The Government hereby confirms for clarity and for the avoidance of doubt that the
tax treatment of BTL shall be no less favourable than that afforded to other
telecommunication licencees in Belize. The Government acknowledges that internet
services provided by Class Licensees are currently taxed at 1.75%, whereas BTL is
obligated to pay 19% in tax on its internet services, and agrees to procure to BTL’s
satisfaction that the disparity between the tax treatment of Class Licencees and BTL
is rectified by 31 March, 2007 so that BTL is taxed on its internet services at the same
rate as that at which the Class Licensees are currently taxed and, on such rectification,
BTL shall waive its entitlement to be reimbursed for the difference in the amount paid
in tax pursuant to the unequal terms of its licence between 19 September 2005 (the
date of the Original Agreement) and 31 March 2007.

 

3.5. The parties hereby agree that clause 11.3(f) of the Original Agreement shall be
amended as follows:

“Business Tax - the tax treatment of BTL shall be no less favourable
than that afforded to other telecommunication licensees in Belize. To
enable telecommunications services providers to lower the rates to their
subscribers the Government undertakes by no later than April 1, 2008
to adjust with immediate legal effect and force the rate of Business Tax
applicable to telecommunications services so that the amount of
Business Tax payable by BTL does not exceed the amount of Income
Tax that would be paid by BTL if it was assessed for Income Tax by
applying an Income Tax rate for companies at 25% (companies being
persons other than employed persons for the purposes of the Income
and Business Tax Act).”37

 

 

  

122. In the third amendment deed, Telemedia (as successor to BTL) and the Government agreed on

the following related provision:

2. RETURN ON CAPITAL INVESTMENT

2.1 In accordance with clause 2 of the First Settlement Deed, if full payment of the
Shortfall Amount of BZ$7,075,000 (the 2006 Shortfall Amount) was not paid by the
Government to BTL (or its succ r, Telemedia) by 31 October 2007, the further
provisions of clause 2.2 of the First Settlement Deed are to apply. The Government
has not yet paid the 2006 Shortfall Amount.

In addition, BTL achieved less than the Minimum Rate of Return in the financial year
ended 31 March 2007 and pursuant to section 11.4 of the Original Agreement,
Telemedia formally notified the Government of the Shortfall Amount of
BZ$11,628,000 (the “2007 Shortfall Amount”) on 23 August 2007 and provided the
Government with a Capital Rate of Return Statement setting out the b: for
calculation of the 2007 Shortfall Amount. Full payment of the 2007 Shortfall Amount
was due and payable by no later than 23 November 2007.

 

Certain additional and final assessments to taxation have been made by taxation
authorities in Belize against BTL for the period ending 31 March 2005, including, but
not limited to, assessments concerning general intercompany cross charges;
intercompany charges for pre-paid cards; management fees; receipts by board
members of BTL and of BTL associated companies and affiliates; international
settlements; internet and data revenues, and assessments concerning all other BTL
business activities, and including all accrued penalties, arrears interest or other interest
thereon (together, the Assessments) amounting to BZ$4,000,000. As successor to
BTL, Telemedia has, subject to the provisions of clause 2.7 assumed this liability.

 

 
 
 

 

 

In accordance with clause 2.2 of the First Settlement Deed, the unpaid taxes due and
owing as set out in clause 2.3 above shall be set-off against the 2006 Shortfall Amount
and the Government hereby acknowledges and agrees that:

(a) _ in respects of all financial periods of BTL (and/or Telemedia as the case may
be) up to and including the period ending on 31 March 2007, all taxation
assessments made on BTL (and/or Telemedia as the case may be) have been
made and that no further tax assessments for these periods will be made by any
taxation authority in Belize on BTL (and/or Telemedia as the case may be);
and

(b) this set-off constitutes full and final settlement of all liabilities to taxation
ssessed by any taxation authority in Belize owed by BTL and/or Telemedia
in respects of all financial periods of BTL (and/or Telemedia as the case may
be) up to and including the period ending on 31 March 2007, and no further
tax shall be due or payable by BTL (or Telemedia as the case may be) for such
financial periods and that there are no other payments or obligations due and
payable by BTL (and/or Telemedia as the case may be) to the Government.

Following the set-off described in clause 2.4 above, the balance of BZ$3,075,000 plus
the 2007 Shortfall Amount will be due and owing to Telemedia by the Government
together totalling BZ$14,703,000 (the “Balance Amount’) and the Government
agrees that Telemedia shall be entitled with effect from 1 February, 2008, and at its
sole discretion, to set off the Balance Amount against monthly-based tax liabilities
including, but not limited to, business tax as they fall due and owing until the Balance
Amount has been extinguished.

  
 

The Government hereby acknowledges and agrees that, in the event the Government
fails to pay to Telemedia, in accordance with section 11.4 of the Original Agreement,
any Shortfall Amount arising in respect of Telemedia’s financial year ending on 31
March 2008 or any subsequent financial years of Telemedia, on or by the relevant
Deadline Date for each such financial year, Telemedia shall be entitled to set-off any
such future Shortfall Amounts against the amount of any taxes or other payments or
obligations due and payable by Telemedia to the Government.

The Government hereby acknowledges and agrees that any set-off made by Telemedia
in accordance with any of clauses 2.4 to 2.6 above shall be made without prejudice to
Telemedia’s right to challenge the validity, basis of calculation or amount of:

(a) any of the Assessments (to the extent that Telemedia is unable to set-off the
2006 Shortfall Amount in accordance with this clause 2); or

(b) any future assessments made in relation to financial periods subsequent to the
financial period ending on 31 March 2007.

months of October 2007 (BZ$1,460,338.71) and November 2007 (BZ$1,540,228.29)

3. RATE OF BUSINESS TAXATION

3.1 In relation to the Government's undertaking in section 11.3 (f) of the Original
Agreement (as amended by clause 3.5 of the First Settlement Deed), to the extent that
the Government does not comply in full with or implement such undertaking by 1
April 2008, Telemedia shall be entitled at its sole discretion from 1 April 2008 to
calculate the amount of business tax it pays as set out in clause 3.5 of the First
Settlement Deed and the Government hereby agrees that the payment by Telemedia
of such amounts so calculated by Telemedia shall be in full and final settlement of
Telemedia’s liability to pay business tax in respect of any period.*®

THE DISPUTE OVER THE ACCOMMODATION AGREEMENT

In February 2008, there was a change in Government in Belize. Thereafter, according to the
Claimant, “the Government became increasing hostile to Telemedia” and began aggressively
seeking to collect business tax from the company.” On 9 May 2008, Telemedia commenced
arbitral proceedings (the “Accommodation Agreement Proceedings”) against the Government
in the London Court of International Arbitration (“LCIA”). The Government did not take part in

the proceedings.

Part of the dispute before the LCIA concerned Telemedia’s setting-off of shortfalls pursuant to
the amended Accommodation Agreement. From 1 February 2008, Telemedia had filed tax returns
with the Government in which Telemedia had set-off its taxes against the shortfall amount, but
the Government had refused to accept the returns and had issued to Telemedia monthly tax
assessment notices, including penalties and interest.*” Telemedia, in turn, refused to accept the
tax assessment notices. In order to compel Telemedia to pay the assessed taxes, the Government
issued judgment summonses at the Magistrate’s Court. On 24 June 2008, the Magistrate’s Court
ordered Telemedia to pay the Government in settlement of the judgment summonses.*! On 27
June 2008, Telemedia appealed the decision. On 4 July 2008, the Government issued a warrant
for the arrest of Mr. Boyce, and on the same day, Telemedia made a tax payment. On 8 July 2008,

Telemedia petitioned the Belize Supreme Court for declaratory relief, but the Supreme Court

rejected Telemedia’s application. Telemedia then made further tax payments. Telemedia filed a

public law action, seeking declaratory relief, but that application also was denied.”

On 18 March 2009, the LCIA rendered an award in favour of Telemedia (the “Accommodation
Agreement Award”), finding that the Accommodation Agreement was valid and binding on the

Government and awarding Telemedia declaratory relief and money damages as follows:

344. All other claims are dismissed. **

126. On 20 March 2009, Telemedia assigned the benefit of the Accommodation Agreement Award to

Belize Social Development Limited.“* However, the Government obtained an interim injunction
on 7 April 2009 that restrained BSDL and Telemedia “from enforcing or causing to be enforced
the ‘Final Award’ issued on the 18" March 2009 by the Arbitration Tribunal constituted by the

would obtain from the United States District Court of the District of Columbia an order for

enforcement of the Accommodation Agreement Award.*”

From March to July 2009, Telemedia filed tax returns with the Government. The Commissioner
of Income Tax made tax assessments for those same months at a different tax rate than the rate
established in the Accommodation Agreement and did not apply a set-off. The Commissioner
also levied penalties and interest on the total sum of tax due.** Telemedia paid, under protest, the

tax assessed for the months of May through July 2009.”

Between 3 March and 18 August 2009, Telemedia paid import duties to the Government but noted
upon each payment, as it did in a letter of 3 March 2009, that
[whilst Telemedia reserves all of its rights pursuant to an Accommodation Agreement
between Telemedia and the Government of Belize (the Government) dated 19 September
2005, as subsequently amended, it will now make additional payments totalling $14,535.02
in order to limit losses caused by the Government's continuing breach of its obligations in
respect of the grant of import duty exemptions. This payment is made without prejudice to
Telemedia’s position in LCIA Arbitration 81079 and Telemedia reserves the right to seek
reimbursement of this, and other, amounts from the Government.*°
On 24 August 2009, Allen & Overy LLP, acting as counsel for Telemedia, wrote a letter on behalf
of Telemedia to the Government, communicating that Telemedia chose to consider the
Government in repudiatory breach and the Accommodation Agreement as ended, because the
Government would neither comply with the Accommodation Agreement nor with the

Accommodation Agreement Award.*!

2009, the tribunal in that case issued an award, finding that the Settlement Deed was valid and
binding on the Government. The tribunal awarded damages of BZ$40,843,272.34 (the
“Settlement Deed Award”) and pronounced the Settlement Deed terminated due to the

Government’s repudiatory breach.

On 21 August 2009, BCB Holdings Limited and the Belize Bank Limited made an application to
the Belize Supreme Court for enforcement of the Settlement Deed Award.* On 22 December
2010, the Supreme Court ordered enforcement of the Settlement Deed Award. However, on 8
March 2011, a stay of execution was ordered until the next sitting of the Court of Appeal.*° On 8
August 2012, the Court of Appeal partially reversed the Supreme Court’s order, finding that the

statutory ground on which the Claimants sought enforcement was void.*”

Thereafter BCB Holdings appealed the matter to the Caribbean Court of Justice (“CCJ”). On 26
July 2013, the CCJ found that the Settlement Deed as amended was void on the grounds of public
policy, reasoning that the terms of the Settlement Deed could not be implemented without
parliamentary approval. In the light of the relevance of this decision to the matters at issue in this

Award, the Caribbean Court of Justice’s decision merits quotation at length:

The Public Policy Point
[...]

Executive prerogative and the Separation of Powers

43. Section 68 of the Constitution empowers the National Assembly to make laws. The
power to impose, alter, regulate or remit taxes and duties is a power constitutionally
vested in the legislature. Only Parliament, or a body specifically delegated by
Parliament, may lawfully grant exceptions to the obligation to obey the country’s
revenue laws. Counsel for the Companies submitted that the Deed merely resolved
“uncertainties and ambiguities” in the law, but the Executive Branch, whether for the

Settlement Deed, BB Holdings Limited and the Government of Belize (22 March 2005; amended 21 June

purpose of “settling” claims made against it or otherwise, has no sovereign power to
resolve such uncertainties and ambiguities. That is the function of the parliament and
the courts. Governments in the region are authorised to make promises to public or
private bodies that the latter may enjoy derogations from the revenue laws of the State,
but whenever this occurs the promises must be sanctioned by the legislature or a body
specifically authorised by the Constitution or the legislature, before they can be
implemented.

   

 

44. There is and must continue to be a healthy relationship among the arms of
government. The State certainly cannot function effectively with its three mighty
branches strictly compartmentalised and sealed off one from the other. Indeed, to
facilitate the efficient operation of government, the Constitution permits some overlap
in the functions carried out by each Branch. But the judiciary has an obligation to
uphold and promote the constitutional mandate that one Branch must not directly
impinge upon the essential functions of the other. The principle that only Parliament
should impose, alter, repeal, regulate or remit taxes is paramount. The National
Assembly may in particular instances delegate aspects of its taxing powers but, absent
such delegation, which in all cases must be strictly construed, the Executive branch is
forbidden from engaging in such activity. To hold that pure prerogative power could
entitle the Minister to implement the promises recorded in the Deed without the cover
of parliamentary sanction is to disregard the Constitution and attempt to set back, over
300 years, the system of governance Belize has inherited and adopted.

 

  

45. There is a more fundamental reason why the Minister’s authority to make and
implement the promises given in the Deed cannot be justified on the basis of
prerogative power. This is because, as was noted by Lord Bridge in Williams
Construction v Blackman27, it is trite law that when the exercise of some
governmental function is regulated by statute, the prerogative power under which the
same function might previously have been exercised is superseded. While the statute
remains in force, the function can only be exercised in accordance with its provisions.
Since it is being put forward also that the Minister’s authority sprang from his powers
under section 95 of the Income and Business Tax Act28 , prerogative power is ousted
and it is to the statute that one must turn to discover whether (a) section 95 authorised
the Minister to do what he did and (b), assuming such authorisation, the Minister acted
within the scope of the authority given.

    

   

 

Section 95 of the Income and Business Tax Act

46. The constitutionality of section 95 was challenged by counsel for the State. It is
unnecessary now to rule on that challenge. Suffice it to say that, assuming its
constitutional validity, the section must be interpreted in light of the Constitution. The
Belize Constitution, like other Anglophone CARICOM Constitutions, places a
specific and extremely high value on legislation dealing with taxation. Any Bill
dealing with the imposition, repeal, remission, alteration or regulation of taxation is
in the Constitution referred to as a “Money Bill”. Money Bills are not enacted in the
ordinary way. Sections 77, 78 and 79 of the Constitution contain special provisions
with respect to the enactment of a Money Bill. In our view, given the extraordinary
value the Constitution attaches to Money Bills, whenever the legislature delegates
authority that touches on the powers contained in a Money Bill, the instrument
containing the delegation should be construed strictly, narrowly, and the delegation
should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to control arbitrary, capricious or
illegal conduct. Further, if the power conferred is to be validly exercised, the
accompanying safeguards must be scrupulously observed.

47. — Section 95 cannot properly be interpreted as being capable of granting the Minister
the power to do what the Deed here purported to do. In particular, we fail to see how,
in one fell swoop, the Minister could possibly “remit” tax payable in respect of
business activity to be conducted over an indefinite time in the future. The Tribunal
expressed a different view on this issue. The Tribunal also likened remission of tax to
the cancellation or extinguishment of all or part of a financial obligation whether past
or future. In our opinion there is a substantial difference between the remitting tax

52.

PCA Case N° 2010-13

Page 36

payable and extinguishing an obligation to pay tax. If the Minister was authorised by
section 95 to do the former he certainly had no power whatsoever to promise the latter.

Since the Minister is not the only official upon whom is conferred a power of
remission, it is instructive to reason by analogy. Section 52(1)(d) of the Constitution
confers on the Governor-General the power to “remit the whole or any part of any

ishment imposed on any person for any offence...” If the Tribunal’s views on
ion are correct, then the Governor-General would be acting within the scope of
the power if he/she remitted all the future sentences likely to be imposed upon a
known recidivist. This would be an absurd interpretation of the Governor-General’s
power.

 

  

In the exercise of the statutory power to remit, section 95 imposes upon the Minister
the obligation to comply with two rather weak safeguards. Failure so to conform
would impugn and automatically render void the exercise of the power. Here, the
Minister flouted both measures. Firstly, the Minister's power under the section is
constrained to the extent that the Minister needs to satisfy himself, on objective
criteria, that it is just and equitable to remit tax payable. Fore-knowledge of the actual
tax payable (which may be remitted in whole or part) constitutes a crucial, if not
indispensable, factor informing the Minister’s exercise of discretion. Just as it would
be perverse for the Governor General (whose discretion is not ostensibly limited by
what is “just and equitable”) to remit punishment when no crime has as yet been
committed, far less a sentence imposed, so too the Minister cannot properly satisfy
himself of the justice or equity in remitting tax payable by a company where the
business activity upon which the tax may or may not accrue has not yet commenced
and there is no knowing whether the company would even be in business for the period
the tax is supposedly “remitted”. Apart from its absurdity, to construe the power to
remit tax as capable of being exercised in respect of tax that may or may not become
payable throughout the lifetime or existence of the taxpayer, evades section 95"'s first
safeguard and easily opens the door to the arbitrary and unlawful exercise of the power
delegated.

 

 

 

Section 95 also required Notices of any remission to be published in the Gazette.
Given the cloak of confidentiality that surrounded the making and implementation of
the Deed, it is reasonable to conclude that there was never an intention on the part of
the Minister to publish the required Notice. At any rate, the Minister had two years to
fulfil this statutory obligation and no attempt was made to comply with it during that
time. The trial judge accepted the Tribunal’s view that the requirement of publication
is merely “an administrative formality” and that publication may lawfully be done at
any time. In light of the importance the Constitution attaches to the remission of tax,
we disagree. Parliament in its wisdom has decreed publication in the gazette so that
the Minister’s decisions on remission are open to public scrutiny. This might be a
mild, after-the-fact legislative safeguard. But to strip it of all its content, to render it
devoid of any force only emphasises the grave danger to public policy that flows from
interpreting the first limb of section 95 in the manner in which the Companies suggest.

 

  
 

Finally, as the Constitution clearly suggests, there is a distinction between the
imposition, repeal, remission, alteration or regulation of taxation.30 Even if one
assumes that the Minister was entitled, by section 95, to remit tax in respect of future
business activity; if one is prepared to assume further that the exercise of “remitting
tax payable” includes excusing statutory obligations to pay tax, the jurisdiction
exercised by the Minister exceeded each of these dubious ways of exercising the
power delegated. The Deed purported to alter and regulate the manner in which the
Companies should discharge their statutory tax obligations. The Deed impacted on a
host of filing, administrative and other obligations imposed by Parliament's revenue
laws. In essence, the framers of the Deed conceptualised and designed a whole new
tax policy for the benefit of the Companies. This policy was then embodied in the
Deed, executed by the parties and implemented with the objective of overriding all
current and any future statutes enacted by the National Assembly.

 

 

 

  

 

It is not the Court’s function in this case to assess the wisdom of this special tax policy.
The Government does of course have the power to settle, and to settle in confidence

if it so desires, and on terms it considers prudent, claims made against it. But
transforming the policy conceived here, effectively into the status of a Money Bill,
necessitated the intervention of the National Assembly so that legislation consistent
with the imperatives of the Constitution could be enacted to give force to it.

53. Prime Ministerial governance, a paucity of checks and balances to restrain an
overweening Executive, these are malignant tumours that eat away at democracy. No
court can afford to encourage the spread of such cancer. In our judgment,
implementation of the provisions of the Deed, without legislative approval and
without the intention on the part of its makers to seek such approval, is indeed
repugnant to the established legal order of Belize. In a purely domestic setting, we
would have regarded as unconstitutional, void and completely contrary to public
policy any attempt to implement this Agreement.

Should the Award be enforced?
L..]

59. The grounds for not enforcing this Award are compelling. The sovereignty of
Parliament subject only to the supremacy of the Constitution is a core constitutional
value. So too is the principle of the Separation of Powers the observance of which one
is entitled to take for granted. To disregard these values is to attack the foundations
upon which the rule of law and democracy are constructed throughout the Caribbean.
It id that public policy amounts to no less than those principles and standards that
are so sacrosanct as to require courts to maintain and promote them at all costs and
without exception. The Committee on International Commercial Arbitration has
endorsed “tax laws” as an example of an area that might fall within the scope of public
policy, the breach of which might justify a State court refusing enforcement of an
Award. In our judgment, especially as the underlying agreement was to be performed
in Belize, the balance here undoubtedly lies in favour of not enforcing this Award.
This is a case where the Court actually has a duty to invoke the public policy
exception.

 

 

 

60. | We have considered whether, notwithstanding all of the above, we should still enforce
the Award because if we did not, the State of Belize may be unjustly enriched. There
are powerful factors that weigh against this view. As mentioned above at [47], we
have no evidence of the strength of the Companies" claims relating to the prior dispute
between the parties. There is therefore only a tenuous basis for presuming any unjust
enrichment. Even assuming there could conceivably be some unjust enrichment, there

i f ‘ing its likely quantum. It is also significant that the Companies are

. They are Belizean companies cognizant of and constrained by the

public policy of special tax rates, exemptions and concessions being granted by

Parliament. The Companies themselves are currently the beneficiaries of tax

sions which were obtained, not from the Minister but through the National

Assembly.

  

 

 

 

61. The public policy contravened in this case falls well within the definition of
“international public policy” recommended by the ILA that might justify the non-
enforcement of a Convention Award. If this Court ordered the enforcement of this
Award we would effectively be rewarding corporate citizens for participating in the
violation of the fundamental law of Belize and punishing the State for refusing to
acquiesce in the violation. No court can properly do this. Responsible bodies,
including the Attorney General, have a right and duty to draw attention to and
appropriately challenge attempts to undermine the Constitution.**

PART II

OTHER PROPERTY ACQUIRED

All proprietary and other interest held by The Belize Bank (Turks and Caicos) Limited in
Belize Telemedia Limited and its subsidiaries under a Mortgage Debenture dated the 31st
December, 2007 (including any amendments thereto) executed between Belize Telemedia
Limited as the Mortgagor and The Belize Bank (Turks and Caicos) Limited as the Mortgagee,
and registered in the Companies and Corporate Affairs Registry, Belmopan, on or about the
8" February 2008.°!

On 27 August 2009, the Finance Ministry of Belize issued a Notice of Acquisition, which
identified the same property set out in the 2009 Order and declared that it had “been acquired by
the Government for a public purpose, namely, the stabilisation and improvement of the

telecommunications industry and the provision of reliable telecommunications services to the

9962

public at affordable prices in a harmonious and non-contentious environment . . .

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE ACQUISITION OF TELEMEDIA

In connection with the adoption of the 2009 Act, the Prime Minister of Belize made the following

statement to the Parliament, which the Tribunal considers to warrant quotation at length:

The questions will of course be asked: why this move, and why now? In answering these
questions I need to rehearse for the house and the nation a fair amount of background. Mr.
Speaker, Belize Telecommunications Limited was incorporated in 1987 during the first UDP
administration. At that time the purpose was to Belizeanize telecommunications, replacing
the control of the foreign entity Cable and Wireless with a national company. It was always
the UDP government's intention that the new BTL would be majority owned by the citizens
of Belize, not by the government. That first privatization worked wonderfully well and has
remained one of the proudest accomplishments of the 84 - 89 UDP administration. We made
sure then to insert particular safeguards into the company’s Articles of Association to protect
the national interest in BTL. And history has recorded what a fabulous success story that
whole enterprise was. In the years immediately after 1987 BTL returned record profits to the
many Belizeans that invested in the company. A 20 percent return on investment was the
order of the day, and there were years when BTL paid a dividend yield of as much as 30
percent.

  

 

All remained well until February 1992 when the predatory designs of one man were
facilitated by the greed and hunger for cash of the then PUP administration. At that time the
PUP began to sell shares in BTL to Michael Ashcroft at a rate and in a manner that was
counterintuitive and counter nationalistic. Under the UDP Articles of Association there was
a 25 percent cap on the shares that could be sold to any one person or entity. This was so that
no single individual could dominate the company and in order to make the ownership as
widely Belizean as possible. In violation of this Article, the PUP presided over an ever
increasing transfer of shares to Ashcroft. This process was interrupted by the 93-98 UDP
return to power, but restarted as soon as the PUP became the government again. It culminated
in March 2004 with the infamous sting operation perpetrated by then Prime Minister Said
Musa, which leveraged almost 94 percent of BTL shares into the control of Lord Ashcroft.
Since then the PUP double dealing in which they screwed Glenn Godfrey for Ashcroft, then
Ashcroft for Prosser, then Prosser for Ashcroft again, has produced litigation after litigation.

Between 2005 and 2006 alone, there were at least 6 BTL cases in Belize, England, the US
and Canada. In the end Ashcroft prevailed and cemented his total control.

But, he was not satisfied. Between 1998 and 2005 BTL’s profits were 20 cents for every
dollar invested. Nevertheless, and perhaps as payback for the PUP support, however fleeting,
of Jeffrey Prosser, Ashcroft wanted more. And he got it from the PUP in 2006 after he had
regained supreme control of BTL. This came by way of the infamous secret Accommodation
Agreement, in which the PUP government guaranteed the Ashcroft group a minimum rate of
return of 15 percent. According to that Agreement and under that guarantee, Ashcroft could
in any year declare that BTL had not made that 15 percent; declare how much the shortfall
was; and simply not pay his taxes until the so-call shortfall had been recovered. This is
exactly what happened in 2007, so that thereafter Ashcroft’s Telemedia ended up paying no
business tax, no customs duties, no interest of any kind. In addition, the Accommodation
Agreement stipulated that the PUC could not regulate Telemedia’s rates, leaving the
consumers at their mercy. But it still did not stop there. All other existing Telecoms licenses
(excepting Speednet’s - about which more later) had to be revoked. Voice Over Internet
Protocol, which we all know gives consumers the cheapest option, is outlawed. Telemedia is
able to refuse interconnection to any and everyone, including internet service providers. And
the PUC cannot, for any cause and no matter what the complaint, in any way touch or alter
Telemedia’s license. Finally, the Accommodation Agreement binds each government
department, agency, or associated body, to use only Telemedia’s services at onerous pre-
arranged rates until 2015, and thereafter for successive 3 year renewal periods.

Now, Mr. Speaker, this is where the new government of the United Democratic Party came
in. As soon as we discovered this Accommodation Agreement and the fact that it had been
secretly signed and secretly implemented by the PUP, we came to the Belizean public and
denounced it. Lord Michael Ashcroft is an extremely powerful man. His net worth may well
be equal to Belize’s entire GDP. He is nobody to cross and the new government could well
have chosen the path of least resistance; to cower in the face of the certain wrath of this
potentate; to continue in the PUP style with busi as usual; to betray, in other words, all
that we had campaigned for, all that we had promised, and all that is basic and decent and
straight forward if there is to be any ounce of trust left in public office. But betrayal of the
people is not in my nature, and not, I am surpassingly proud to say, in the nature of the United
Democratic Party.

 

 

 

 

And so we took counsel among ourselves and to a man the UDP cabinet voted, in the name
of the Belizean people, to resist this treasonous Accommodation Agreement at all costs.
Belizean Law and Belizean dignity would be upheld; Belizean pride and Belizean patriotism
and Belizean patrimony vindicated.

   

And, of course, resisted we have. Now no one can doubt the justice of our stand. But, as we
always knew, it has been costly. Michael Ashcroft had Telemedia invoke[] arbitration in
London to enforce the Accommodation Agreement. And he obtained a judgment of 38.5
million dollars and a court — mandated requirement that government now begin to honor the
Accommodation agreement.

 

Well, I have said that as God is my witness I will never pay that award. But it doesn’t stop
there. In April of 2009 Telemedia informed the government of further claims they will make
to the London Court of International Arbitration, and that the size of a new award “could pale
the current award of 38 million into insignificance”.

Mr. Speaker, Members, fellow Belizeans: this is intolerable. I, and the United Democratic
Party Government, in the name of the people will put up with it no longer. That an agreement
so patently illegal, so patently immoral, so patently anti-Belize, should continue to torture us,
to bleed us, to subject us to this death by a thousand cuts, cannot for one second more be
countenanced. This is our House, this is our country. Here we are masters, here we are
sovereign. And with the full weight of that sovereignty we must now put an end to this
disrespect, to this chance taking, to this new age slavery.

There will thus be no more Telemedia awards against us; no more Telemedia court battles;
no more debilitating waste of government’s energies and resources; and there will be no more
suffering of this one man’s campaign to subjugate an entire nation to his will. After long and
sufficient consideration, therefore, and in the exercise of that national power that is ours by
Constitution and inalienable right, this government will now acquire Telemedia.

Think on it Mr. Speaker. Telecommunications uses the airwaves as its medium. But these
airwaves constitute a God-given natural resource of Belize, just like our sun, our sea, our
rivers, our forests. These things together help to make up the patrimony of the Belizean
people, and the exploitation of that patrimony must always be consistent with the interests of
Belizeans. When those that come to partner with us demonstrate beyond all doubt that they
will upend equitability, upend reasonableness, that they will, infamy upon infamy, beat us
about our heads with our own inheritance, the very blood coursing through our Belizean veins
obliges us to act.

 

 

Just as fundamental, though perhaps a little more prosaic, telecommunications — information
and communications technology — is a critical part of the development apparatus of any
modem society. Indeed, as has been officially recognized by our regional integration
movement CARICOM, it is an indispensable tool in that restructuring of developing
economies that, in the face of the global cri must begin to take place now.
Accordingly, unregulated monopoly control and abuse of the sector cannot be permitted. Yet,
that is precisely what the Accommodation Agreement mandates. This is especially so in view
of the fact that even the very limited mobile phone so-called competitor to Telemedia is
owned by Telemedia. That is right and I have the documents to prove it. 77.38 percent of
Speednet is owned by three companies — Callerbar Limited, Riddermark Ventures Limited,
and Heaver Holdings Limited. These three companies are headquartered at the Belize City
Cork Street premises of Michael Ashcroft, and controlled by two of the now notorious Trusts
owned by Michael Ashcroft.

   

 

And so Mr. Speaker let no one be in any doubt as to why we are doing what we are doing
today. Let no one confuse or misunderstand our purpose. This is not ideology, this is not
triumphalism. This is a country in particular circumstances reaching the end of
and doing a singular, necessary, righteous thing to protect its national interest. It is not part
of any pattern, part of no new philosophy. It is plain and simple a special measure for a special
case. We make no apologies for it, but we also do not seek to elevate it. As must be clear
from the developments in even the global bastions of super capitalism and private property,
this is what countries do to protect themselves. It is an article of faith and a cardinal rule of
statecraft that a nation will act in any way necessary to preserve its national interest. That
national interest, in these circumstances, now absolutely demands our present course of
action.

 

   

So there you have it, Mr. Speaker, the government’s brief from the heart. In the days to come,
the dissection and the deconstruction, both at home and abroad, will of course take place. But
no matter which way you look at it, out a straightforward case and a compelling case. We
will move ahead not unaware of the difficulties that will be thrown up, but with a confidence
that is both supreme and serene because we know we are right.

 

Before I conclude, just let me spend a little time telling you what will happen as we proceed.
First of all, you will see that the Bill makes every provision for fair and proper compensation
to be paid to the owners of the shares we will acquire. This is not, I repeat, some cowboy
action but something done in the full plenitude of, and compliance with, our Constitution. As
well, we are only acquiring the 94 percent or so of Telemedia that is controlled by the
Ashcroft interests. The shareholding owned by Belizeans will be left intact. The actual
acquisition will be done by way of an order made by the Minister of Telecommunications,
who will in that same order appoint a new Board of Directors. As soon as practicable after,
an extraordinary general meeting will be held and new Articles of Association adopted. The
new Articles will essentially be the Articles of the successful BTL that was launched in 1988.
In other words, the safeguards to protect Belizean shareholders will be re-established,
including protection of the special share and the limitation on the amount of single ownership.

As well, and perhaps most importantly, the articles will guarantee that dividends will be paid
to shareholders at the rate of 40 percent of the yearly profits.©*

THE COMPANIES’ CLAIMS FOR COMPENSATION AND THE GOVERNMENT’S OFFERS

On 27 August 2009, after the acquisition of Telemedia pursuant to the 2009 Act and 2009 Order,
Mr. Joseph Waight, the Financial Secretary of Belize, issued a Notice of Acquisition and
requested that “[a]ll interested persons who may have claims to compensation for the acquisition
of any property specified in the Schedule are asked to submit their claims, together with proof of

ownership and other supporting documents, if any, to the Financial Secretary [. . .].”"**

On 14 October 2009, the Companies sent demands for payment to Mr. Waight. These entities
included BCB Holdings Limited, Ecom Limited, Mercury Communications Limited, New
Horizons Inc., and Thiermon Limited. In their notices of claim for compensation, the entities

made demand for payment:

. .. Strictly without prejudice to

1. any claims of Dunkeld and Hayward arising under the UK-Belize Bilateral Investment
Treaty;
2. any claims in respect of the unconstitutionality of the Act or of the Statutory

Instrument No. 104 of 2009 Belize Telecommunications (Assumption of Control over
Belize Telemedia Limited) Order; and

3. any claims it may have to assert and enforce any other rights in connection with
ownership of the Shares.
On 19 October 2009, Mr. Waight responded in letters to each entity and requested that the
Companies provide the Government with “[t]he precise nature and proof of Hayward’s and
Dunkeld’s interest in the shares formerly held by [each Company] in Belize Telemedia Ltd.”®°
On 12 November 2009, Courtenay Coye LLP, on behalf of the Companies, responded to Mr.
Waight, arguing that “[t]he information and documents you have requested are not required to

verify [a Company’s] claim or to prove its ownership of the shares.”°”

On 26 August 2010, Mr. Waight wrote to the Companies, noting that they “had refused to supply”

the information that he had requested on 19 October 2009. “In order that we may have meaningful

and productive negotiations for the payment of compensation to your Client,” Mr. Waight
informed the Companies that each should:
@ quantify its claim, setting forth the basis on which the amount claimed has been
calculated;

(ii) cause Dunkeld and Hayward to withdraw their claims for compensation for the same
shares and discontinue all arbitration and other proceedings to enforce such claims;

(iii) as a pre-condition for the payment of compensation, indemnify and hold harmless the
Government of Belize against all claims of Dunkeld, Hayward and any person arising
out of or relating to the acquisition of the said shares by the Government; and

(iv) unreservedly accept the constitutionality of the Acquisition Act and the Acquisition
Order, as determined by the Supreme Court in Claim No. 874 of 2009 (British
Caribbean Bank Ltd v. Attorney General at al) and Claim No. 1018 of 2009 (Dean
Boyce vs Attorney General et al), and undertake not to impugn the said legislation in
any other proceedings.®

On 9 November 2010, Courtenay Coye LLP replied to Mr. Waight on behalf of the Companies,
asking the Government “to urgently make an appropriate offer and to provide a copy of the ‘expert
assessment’ and all information upon which it is based,” reflecting the Companies’ belief that
“the Government is in a far better position to provide the ‘facts and figures’ which are needed to

compensate our client.”

On 8 December 2010, Mr. Waight replied to Courtenay Coye LLP’s letter of 9 November, stating
that the Government had “determined that a reasonable compensation for the acquisition of your
Client’s shareholding in Telemedia would be BZ$1.46 per share.” The total compensation offered

to each entity was:

(a) to BCB Holdings, BZ$1,802,894.14;

(b) to Thiermon Limited, BZ$18,814,960.14;

(c) to Ecom Limited, BZ$22,160,592.48;

(d) to New Horizons Inc., BZ$30,048.26; and

(e) to Mercury Communications Limited, BZ$6,987,895.80.

The Government placed a number of pre-conditions on these offers of compensation, namely that
“your Client should arrange with Dunkeld and Hayward that they withdraw their claims for
compensation for the same shares, and discontinue all arbitral and other proceedings to enforce

such claims.” Another pre-condition was that the entities “must indemnify and hold harmless the

Government of Belize against all claims of Dunkeld, Hayward or any other person, arising out of
or relating to the acquisition of the said shares by the Government [. . .].” The offers were made
on the additional pre-condition that the entities “unreservedly accept the constitutionality of the
J.” The

Government also pre-conditioned that “any arrears of taxes, duties, charges or other sums which

Acquisition Act and the Acquisition Order, as determined by the Supreme Court [. .

 

are due or payable to the Government from your Client would be deducted from the amount of
compensation,” and it required the entities to “releas[e] the Government from all further liability

in respect of its acquisition of the said shares [. . .].””°

On 4 December 2009, Dunkeld commenced this arbitration, initiating a sequence of litigation that

will be discussed subsequently (see paragraphs 165-181 below).

On 20 December 2010, Courtenay Coye LLP wrote to Mr. Waight, rejecting the offers of
8 December 2010. In the letter,”! Courtenay Coye pointed out that the valuation of BZ$1.46 per
share was not consistent with the price of BZ$5.00 per share that, in 15 September 2010, the
Government had offered to the public in a prospectus.”* Courtenay Coye also observed that Prime
Minister Barrow had publicly stated that even that price was below market.”

Courtenay Coye LLP closed its letter by asking the Government to justify the valuation of
BZ$1.46, offering to exchange Dunkeld’s expert report on valuation for the Government’s expert
report “in order that the respective positions can be more properly considered.””* According to

the Claimant, the Government did not respond to this offer.”*

THE CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE TO THE 2009 ACT AND 2009 ORDERS

Order, the “2009 Orders”’)—began a constitutional challenge to the 2009 Act and 2009 Orders
on 21 October 2009. On 8 December 2009, Mr Dean Boyce brought a similar claim in respect of
his share in Sunshine and corresponding interest in Sunshine’s holding of Telemedia shares

(together with BCB’s claim, the “First Constitutional Challenge’).

On 30 July 2010, the Supreme Court of Belize dismissed both claims and ordered the Financial
Secretary “to comply with section 65(1) of the Belize Telecommunications Act as amended.””°

BCB appealed this decision on 25 August 2010.

On 24 June 2011, the Belize Court of Appeal ruled on the First Constitutional Challenge by BCB.

The Court of Appeal’s judgment reasoned in relevant part as follows:

Issue (i)- _is the Acquisition Act in conformity with section 17(1) of the Constitution?
[...]

[107] I would therefore conclude on this issue, in agreement with the appellants, that the
Acquisition Act is in contravention of section 17(1) of the Constitution, in that it:

 

i does not prescribe the principles on which reasonable compensation is to be
pl P! P. ps
paid within a reasonable time;

(ii) does not secure to a person claiming an interest or right over the acquired
property a right of access to the courts for the purpose establishing his interest
or right; and

(iii) does not secure to a person who has been awarded compensation a right of
access to the courts for the purpose of enforcing his right to compensation.

[-
Issue (ii)- were the compulsory acquisitions duly carried out in accordance with the
stated public purpose?
[-
[150] For all of these reasons, I do not think that, on the evidence, the compulsory
acquisitions were duly carried out for the stated public purpose, either on the bases

advanced by the Minister in his 25 August Order, or on any of the other bases
identified by the judge in his judgment.

   

Issue (iii) -_ was the Minister’s response to the problems of the telecommunications
industry proportionate in the circumstances?

[L.]

[160] [...] Applying this principle [of proportionality], therefore, I would conclude that in
this case the Minister’s response to the problems of the telecommunications industry
were not proportionate in the circumstances.

Le]

[171] So the question which remains is whether the appellants’ contention that the judge
erred in his conclusion that the compulsory acquisitions in this case were not arbitrary
and were carried out for a legitimate purpose. In the light of my conclusion that the
evidence in this matter has failed to justify the compulsory acquisitions as having been
necessary to promote or further the stated public purpose and that the compulsory
acquisitions were not a proportionate response to the requirements of the stated public
purpose, coupled with the clear evidence that the compulsory acquisition had, as an
explicit, dominant objective, the bringing to an end of “this one man’s campaign to
subjugate an entire nation to his will” (““a special measure for a special case”), I cannot
but conclude that, in carrying out the compulsory acquisitions, GOB acted for an
illegitimate purpose, and thus breached the appellants’ constitutional right to
protection from arbitrary deprivation of their property.

Le]

Issue (v)- did the appellants or either of them have a right to be heard by the
Minister before the Acquisition Orders were made?

  
 

 

Le]

[199] I have therefore come to the view that in the instant case, in which the Minister’s
decision to compulsorily acquire their property plainly and prejudicially affected the’
protected constitutional rights, the appellants were entitled to be heard by the Minister
before the Acquisition Orders were issued.

L..]
Disposal

 

 

[203] For all of the reasons stated in this judgment, at, I fear (and for which I apologise), far
too great length, I would therefore grant the relief sought by the appellants by making
the following orders:

(a) Civil Appeal No. 31 of 2010 is allowed.

(b) Paragraphs (1) and (3) of the Order of Legall J dated 24 August 2010 in Claim
No. 1018 of 2009 is set aside.

(c) Civil Appeal No. 30 of 2010 is allowed.

(d) Paragraphs (1) and (3) of the Order of Legall J dated 18 August 2009 in Claim
No. 874 of 2009 is set aside.

(e) It is hereby declared that the Acquisition Act and Orders are inconsistent with
the Constitution and are unlawful, null and void.

(f) The respondents are to pay the appellants’ costs in this court and in the court
below, to be taxed if not sooner agreed.””

150. Following the judgment of the Court of Appeal, the earlier Board of Telemedia attempted to re-

assume control of the company. According to the testimony of Mr. Boyce, Chairman of the
Executive Committee of the Board of Directors of Telemedia, “We were able to freely enter the

Telemedia premises. The reinstated Board of Directors held a meeting in the boardroom at the

British Caribbean Bank Ltd. v. (1) The Attorney General of Belize and (2) The Minister of Public Utilities
(Civil Appeal No. 30); Dean C. Boyce v. (1) The Attorney General of Belize and (2) The Minister of Public
Utilities (Civil Appeal No. 31), Judgment (Court of Appeal of Belize, 24 June 201 1)(Exhibit C-151).

corporate headquarters at St Thomas Street on that day.””* Things quickly changed, as Mr. Boyce

testified:

However, this attempt at an orderly transition of power was impeded by the actions of the
Government later that night. At around 11pm, I received a call informing me that there were armed
police at the Telemedia premises and that members of the “interim” board of directors (i.e. the board
of the Government-controlled Telemedia) may possibly be on the property. I was concerned that
there was a danger that Telemedia property and records may be destroyed or removed by members
of the interim board and I contacted my lawyer. We arranged to meet at the Telemedia premises and
we arrived there just before midnight. We attempted to enter the Telemedia premises but we were
prevented from doing so by police.”

The contemporaneous press release issued by the Government describes these events as follows:

As a consequence of that decision Mr Dean Boyce, one of the successful appellants, went to
Telemedia’s headquarters on St Thomas street in Belize City and purported to take back the
company. Government then got immediate legal advice as to the full import and consequence
of the Court of Appeal decision. On the basis of that advice Government concluded that it
was not open, without more, to Mr Boyce to assume control of the company. The Court of
Appeal judgment is declaratory in nature, and by itself does not deprive Government of its
de facto possession of the company. For that to happen the appellant Boyce would have to
go back to court for an enforcement order telling Government to give up possession.
Government thus instructed its appointee, the Executive Chairman and the Telemedia Board,
to continue in command of the company unless presented with a court order specifically
placing the appellant Boyce in control.

[L.]

Finally, the Government of Belize thanks the Belizean people for what Government is certain
will be the continuing solidarity with, and support for, the entirely just and necessary struggle
against Billionaire arrogance and disrespect for national pride and national sovereignty.*°

 

 

THE RE-ACQUISITION OF TELEMEDIA.

On 4 July 2011, ten days after the judgment of the Court of Appeal, the National Assembly of
Belize passed the Belize Telecommunications (Amendment) Act, 2011 (the “2011 Act”).’! The
2011 Act introduced modifications into Sections 63-74 of the Telecommunications Act that had
been added to the statute by the 2009 Act. The principal changes introduced by the 2011 Act were
to remove the provision that “every such order shall be prima facie evidence that the property to
which it relates is required for a public purpose” and to elaborate more detailed provisions for
compensation in respect of acquired property. The 2011 Act also empowered the Financial
Secretary to acquire property with retrospective effect, and introduced additional provisions on

the service of papers outside of Belize.

Also on 4 July 2011, the Ministry of Finance issued the Belize Telecommunication (Assumption

AND WHEREAS, after a careful consideration of all the facts and circumstances, I consider
that control over telecommunications should be acquired for the following public purposes,
namely, (a) to restore the control of the telecommunications industry to Belizeans; (b) to
provide greater opportunities for investment to socially-oriented local institutions and the
Belizean society at large; and (c) to advance the process of economic independence of Belize
with a view to bringing about social justice and equality for the benefit of all Belizeans;*?
The 2011 Order provided that “[t]he property specified in the First Schedule to this Order is
hereby acquired for and on behalf of the Government of Belize for the public purposes aforesaid.”
The First Schedule to the 2011 Order listed the same property as the schedules to the 2009 Order

and 2009 Amendment Order.

On 22 July 2011, the Governor General of Belize assented to the Belize Constitution (Eighth
Amendment) Act, 201] (the “Eighth Amendment”). The Eighth Amendment added a new Part

XIII to the Constitution of Belize, which provided as follows:

PART XIII
GOVERNMENT CONTROL OVER PUBLIC UTILITIES
143. For the purposes of this Part:-

“public utilities” means the provision of electricity services, telecommunication
services and water services;

“public utility provider” means—

(a) Belize Electricity Limited, a company incorporated under the Companies Act,
or its successors by whatever name called;

(b) Belize Telemedia Limited, a company incorporated under the Companies Act,
or its successors by whatever name called; and

(c) Belize Water Services Limited, a company incorporated under the Companies
Act, or its successors by whatever name called;

“Government” means the Government of Belize;

“Government shareholding” shall be deemed to include any shares held by the Social
Security Board;

“majority ownership and control” means the holding of not less than fifty one per
centum (51 percent) of the issued share capital of a public utility provider together
with a majority in the Board of Directors, and the absence of any veto power or other
special rights given to a minority shareholder which would inhibit the Government
from administering the affairs of the public utility provider freely and without
restriction.

144. (1) From the of the Belize Constitution (Eighth dment) Act, the
Government shall have and maintain at all times majority ownership and control of a
public utility provider; and any alienation of the Government shareholding or other
rights, whether voluntary or involuntary, which may derogate from Government's
majority ownership and control of a public utility provider shall be wholly void and
of no effect notwithstanding anything contained in section 20 or any other provision
of this Constitution or any other law or rule of practice:

Provided that in the event the Social Security Board (“the Board”) intends to sell the
whole or part of its shareholding which would result in the Government shareholding
(as defined in section 143) falling below 51 percent of the issued stock capital of a
public utility provider, the Board shall first offer for sale to the Government, and the
Government shall purchase from the Board, so much of the shareholding as would be
necessary to maintain the Government’s majority ownership and control of a public
utility provider; and every such sale to the Government shall be valid and effectual
for all purposes.

 

(2) Any alienation or transfer of the Government shareholding contrary to subsection
(1) above shall vest no rights in the transferee or any other person other than the return
of the purchase price, if paid.

145. (1) For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that the acquisition of certain
property by the Government under the terms of the-

(a) Electricity Act, as amended, and the Electricity (Assumption of Control Over
Belize Electricity Limited) Order, 2011 (hereinafter referred to as “the
Electricity Acquisition Order”); and

(b) Belize Telecommunications Act, as amended, and the Belize
Telecommunications (Assumption of Control Over Belize Telemedia Limited)
Order, 2011, (hereinafter referred to as “the Telemedia Acquisition Order”),

was duly carried out for a public purpose in accordance with the laws authorising the
acquisition of such property.

(2) The property acquired under the terms of the Electricity Acquisition Order and the
Telemedia Acquisition Order referred to in subsection (1) above shall be deemed to
vest absolutely and continuously in the Government free of all encumbrances with
effect from the date of commencement specified in the said Orders.

 

(3) Nothing in the foregoing provisions of this section shall prejudice the right of any
person claiming an interest in or right over the property acquired under the said
Acquisition Orders to receive reasonable compensation within a reasonable time in
accordance with the law authorising the acquisition of such property.*?

(CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE RE-ACQUISITION OF TELEMEDIA.

155. In connection with the adoption of the 2011 Act, the Prime Minister of Belize made the following

83

statement to the Parliament on 29 July 2011:

As Honourable Members know, the Court of Appeal delivered its judgment in the Telemedia
nationalization matter on Friday, June 24, 2011. To our chagrin, the Court declared
unconstitutional the law we had passed on August 25, 2009 to assume control over
telecommunications in the public interest. This was on the ground that it was inconsistent in
certain respects with section 17 of the Constitution relating to protection of property. The
Court also declared the Order made by the Minister of Public Utilities under the said Act to
be unconstitutional for the same reasons.

 

Belize Constitution (Eighth Amendment) Act, 2011 (Exhibit C-168).

PCA Case N° 2010-13

Page 51

Mr. Speaker, with due respect to the Court of Appeal we do not agree with its decision. We
are therefore filing an appeal to the Caribbean Court of Justice.

Meantime, though, the former owners of Telemedia have gone on a campaign that has
terrorized workers, upset the citizenry, and sought to cripple the operations of the company.
This was on the basis that the judgment of the Court of Appeal entitled them to the immediate
reassumption of control, notwithstanding clear legal authority to the contrary.

 

 

Government's position of resistance to this has now been vindicated by the legal system,
even though it was vilified by the appellants and their fellow travelers.

But the confusion and chaos sowed in just a few days, made clear that Government could
waste no time in settling this matter once and for all. This is not about personalities, it is
about principles: principles of public welfare, principles of cultural advance, principles of
national security; principles that make clear that in all the circumstances control of
telecommunications, via the dominant provider, must be in the hands of Government. We
have therefore come to the House today to fix the law, to clarify and expand certain provisions
that the Court of Appeal said were inadequate.

T hasten to add, Mr. Speaker, that by proposing to amend the Act we passed in August of
2009 we are in no way giving up our right to challenge the findings of the Court of Appeal.
We still believe that the Law was in substantial compliance with the Constitution, and will
thus maintain our recourse to the CCJ.

 

As for the clauses of this new Bill, Mr. Speaker, the amendments we are making today are
fully consonant with the requirements according to the Court of Appeal. Of particular note is
the new section 71, which deals with the payment of compensation. The Bill both details the
scheme for satisfying compensation awards, and reinforces the right to enforcement. Access
to court for the purpose of establishing a claimant's interest in acquired property as well as
his entitlement to compensation, have been amplified in the new section 63. Altogether, the
amendments proposed appear to us to satisfy every concern expressed by the judgment.

 

Therefore, Mr. Speaker, as soon as the Bill is passed we intend to reacquire the same property
that was taken in August 2009. This will reassure all Belize that the Government is in full
control because we would have done everything legally necessary to retain ownership of
Belize Telemedia Limited.

 

I want to point out here, Mr. Speaker, that the Court of Appeal completely accepted the
position that the state has every right to acquire private property in the public interest, for a
public purpose. There was never any issue joined over this, and how could there be? After
all, such a proposition is self-evident. It is a right of democratic nation states that has been
both recognized and practiced since antiquity. And it is enshrined in the Belize Constitution.
For the Constitution doesn’t protect against deprivation of private property. It protects against
arbitrary deprivation of private property: deprivation that is not done properly for a public
purpose; or that is done under a law or in a manner that fails to assure proper access to the
courts or proper provisions for the payment of reasonable compensation within a reasonable
time.

 

 

 

I lay stress on what I’ve already said should be self-evident, only because of the position
taken by some private sector entities and especially the Belize Chamber of Commerce. They
act as though Government's acquisitions are in and of themselves aberrant, that this is deviant
behavior. Nothing could be farther from the truth; and that kind of declaration reveals the
Chamber Executive to be wearing the worst sort of ideological blinders. The slightest degree
of reflection, or the sketchiest amount of research, would have shown them that public
acquisition of private property is today a commonplace tool of statecraft and government
practice.

 

 

Of course, the pre-requisite is that this type of acquisition be carried out in strict compliance
with the Constitutional markers. And that is where, according to the Court of Appeal, we
went wrong. Our objective of nationalizing BTL in the public interest was fine. But the
procedural steps by which we carried this out were flawed.

Award

PCA Case N° 2010-13

Page 52 of 132

That distinction is critical for today’s exercise. The decision to nationalize was both
legitimate and imperative when we first took it. And nothing has changed in that regard. If
anything, last week’s threats to workers and the efforts to injure the economy and disrupt the
provision of an essential service, show that the circumstances demanding nationalization
have become even more exigent. So it is entirely right and proper that we correct the mi
steps and do over what the national interest required on August 25, 2009, and still requires
now.

 

This Bill that I am introducing therefore fixes the defects in the original law and does so with
retrospective effect. But there will then be the Order that the Minister will have to make under
the law. The first time around, as the Court of Appeal acknowledged, there was nothing
wrong with the public purposes that the Minister set out as the bases for his acquisition Order.
But the Court was not satisfied that the evidence the Minister adduced as justification for
triggering those public purposes, was sufficiently compelling. Even if the Court was right,
there was always an overwhelming number of reasons in existence that could prove the public
purposes. It was just that, according to the Judges, the Minister did not select the right ones.
Tam certain that, in making his new Order, the public purpose choices of the Minister now
will be rooted in circumstances and references of a nature that will still the doubts of even
the most censorious of courts.

 

 

 

So, Mr. Speaker, we have reloaded and are ready to go. And what we are doing is the essence
of compliance with the rule of law. We don’t agree with the Court of Appeal but we are
bound by it. We therefore act now in accordance with those Court of Appeal dictates.

This is, of course, in the proper, irresistible tradition of our democracy. But there are those
that say that this very fixing of matters in order to implement the Court of Appeal decision is
a negation of the rule of law. What we are really to do, by their reasoning, is simply to give
back BTL to the former majority owners and be done with it.

   
     

These are the same people that also charged us with violation of the rule of law when, after
the position became clear as a bell, we refused — in the absence of the required enforcement
court order — to allow Dean Boyce to last week take control of Telemedia. And these are the
same people that have neglected now to apologize or even acknowledge they were wrong.
This is so even though the Registrar of the Court of Appeal has confirmed in writing to
Boyce’s attorney that a consequential relief order subsequent to the decision of June 24,
should, as we said all along, have been sought in new proceedings before the Supreme Court.

 

But these people are a combination of the misguided and the malicious. There is no hope for
the very plentiful political opportunists among them. But I would urge the others, the ones
that have merely been carried away by what they mistakenly believe to be correct neo-liberal
orthodoxy, to recant. I repeat that even the most cursory survey of global practice and law
shows their position to be ill-informed. To hold on to it now is to run the risk of being accused
of anti-nationalism, and no true blooded Belizean can want that. And so I make clear again
that governments are expected to correct a state of affairs found to be wrong by a court
decision. And the Belize Constitution allows laws to be passed with retroactive effect. This
is therefore what we are doing today and it is meet and right so to do.

 

When this Bill is passed and the consequential acquisition Order made, neither the sky nor
the investment climate will fall. But this Administration would have complied with the
overarching requirement of its mandate: to protect and promote at all times and in all
circumstances and no matter what the cost, the national interests of Belize. The national
interests of Belize: words simple and straightforward, but importing the highest possible
duty, the most solemn commitment, the most ineffable trust.**

THE COMPANIES’ RENEWED CLAIMS FOR COMPENSATION

Following the re-aquisition of Telemedia in 2011, the Government again offered compensation
to Dunkeld. On 5 July 2011, Mr. Waight issued a Notice of Acquisition. This notice required
parties with claims to compensation for property acquired by the Government to submit those

quantified claims by 31 August 2011.°°

BCB Holdings, Ecom Limited, Mercury Communications Limited, New Horizons Inc., and
Thiermon Limited all filed claims. The claims were based on a valuation of BZ$10.23 per share,
a valuation determined by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in its report of 17 December 2010.*° The

claims submitted by each company were as follows:

(a) For BCB Holdings, which held 1,234,859 shares in Telemedia: BZ$12,632,607.57 plus

accrued interest from 25 August 2009 to the date of any award;*”

(b) For Ecom Limited, which held 15,178,488 shares in Telemedia: BZ$155,275,932.24 plus

accrued interest from 25 August 2009 to the date of any award;**

(c) For Mercury Communications Limited, which held 4,786,230 shares in Telemedia:
BZ$48,963, 132.90 plus accrued interest from 25 August 2009 to the date of any award;

(d) For New Horizons Inc., which held 20,581 shares in Telemedia: BZ$210,543.63 plus

accrued interest from 25 August 2009 to the date of any award;°” and

(e) For Thiermon Limited, which held 12,886,959 shares in Telemedia: BZ$131,833,590.57

plus accrued interest from 25 August 2009 to the date of any award.”!

On 12 October 2011, the Government made offers of compensation to the Companies.” The

Government again based its offers on a valuation of BZ$1.46 per share, a figure that the

Government noted was “supported by” the Fair Market Valuation Report prepared by NERA
Economic Consulting of London.’ In each offer, the Government required as pre-conditions that
each entity “should arrange with Dunkeld and Hayward that they withdraw their claims for
compensation for the same shares, and discontinue all arbitral and other proceedings to enforce
such claims” and that each entity “must indemnify and hold harmless the Government of Belize
against all claims of Dunkeld, Hayward or any other person, arising out of or relating to the
acquisition of the said shares by the Government [. . .].”. Another precondition required that “any
arrears of taxes, duties, charges or other sums which are due or payable to the Government from
your client would be deducted from the amount of compensation,” and a final precondition
compelled the entities to “releas[e] the Government from all further liability in respect of its
acquisition of the said shares [. . .].” The Government’s offers of compensation were identical to

its previous offers of 8 December 2010.

In 2011 and 2012, the Parties exchanged a series of letters in which each Party disputed the

valuation relied on by the other Party.°°

On 15 January 2013, the Government made another offer to the Dunkeld entities, again basing
the offer on a valuation of BZ$1.46 per share.*° On 30 January 2013, Courtenay Coye LLP
responded on behalf of the entities, stating that the Government’s offer was significantly lower
than PricewaterhouseCooper’s valuation of $10.23 per share. Courtenay Coye LLP noted that the
Dunkeld entities would only accept such an offer subject to ten conditions, which included the
condition that acceptance of the offers would be “without prejudice to the rights of the
shareholders to seek full compensation for the acquisition of their shares in Telemedia,” as well
as the condition that the offers would “not constitute a full discharge for the liability of the

Government to the shareholders.”*”

THE CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE TO THE 2011 ACT AND 2011 ORDERS

Following the adoption of the 2011 Act and 2011 Order, on 24 September 2011, BCB began a
challenge to the constitutionality of the 2011 Act and 2011 Order in the Supreme Court of Belize.
Mr. Dean Boyce began a similar challenge on 13 October 2011 (together with BCB’s claim, the
“Second Constitutional Challenge”).°* On 15 and 16 November 2011, after the passage of the
Eighth Amendment, BCB and Mr. Boyce both amended their claims to include a challenge to the

constitutionality of the Eighth Amendment.”

On 11 June 2012, the Supreme Court of Belize granted the following orders:

1. A declaration is granted that sections 2(a) and (b) of the Belize Telecommunications
Amendment Act 2011, (the 2011 Act) are unlawful null and void.

2. A declaration is granted that sections 2 (c) (d) (e), 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the 2011 Act are
valid.

3. A declaration is granted that the Belize Telecommunications (Assumption of Control
Over Belize Telemedia Limited) Order 2011, No. 70 of 2011, (the 2011 Order) is
unlawful, null and void.

4. A declaration is granted that sections 2 (2), 69(9), 145(1) and (2) of the Constitution
as inserted by the Belize Constitution (Eighth Amendment) Act 2011 are contrary to
the separation of powers and the basic structure doctrine of the Constitution and are
unlawful, null and void. Section 145(3) is declared meaningless.

5. A declaration is granted that section 143 of the Constitution as inserted by the Eighth
Amendment is valid.

6. A declaration is granted that the following portion of section 144(1) of the
Constitution is valid, namely “From the commencement of the Belize Constitution
(Eighth Amendment) Act 2011, the government shall have and maintain majority
ownership and control of a public utility provider.”

7. A declaration is granted that the remaining portions of section 144(1) of the
Constitution, beginning from the words “and any alienation” to the words “rule of
practice” (both inclusive) are null and void and severed from the subsection. Section
141(2) is therefore declared useless or meaningless.

 

8. The claims by the claimants in both claims for declarations and orders to the effect
that the government shall not have and maintain majority ownership and control of
BTL and for consequential reliefs are dismissed.

9. The claims for damages and injunctions are dismissed.

10. A declaration is granted that from the commencement of the Belize Constitution

portions of the judgment of 11 June 2012.

On 15 May 2014, the Court of Appeal allowed in part the Respondent’s appeal in the Second
Constitutional Challenge.'”' Mr. Justice Sosa, President, summarized the holding of the majority

as follows:

For reasons, which I shall hereinafter identify, I have arrived at the following determinations:

(i) in Civil Appeal No 18 of 2012, I would allow the appeals of the Attorney General and
the Minister of Public Utilities (‘the Minister’), but only with the qualification that the
compulsory acquisition is valid and took effect as from 4 July 2011, rather than as
from 25 August 2009 (‘the qualification’), and I would reject the contentions of the
British Caribbean Bank Limited (‘British Caribbean’), under its respondent's notice,
for variation of the decision of the court below;

 

(ii) in Civil Appeal No 19 of 2012, I would allow the appeals of the Attorney General and
the Minister, but only with the qualification, and I would reject the contentions of
Dean Boyce (‘Mr Boyce’) and the Trustees of the BTL Employees Trust (‘the
Trustees’), under their respondents’ notice, for variation of the decision of the court
below;

[L.
In arriving at my determinations stated at (i) and (ii) above, I have concluded that, inter alia:

(i) both the Belize Telecommunications (Amendment) Act 2011, being Act No 8 of 2011
(‘Act No 8 of 2011’), and the Belize Telecommunications Act (Assumption of Control
over Belize Telemedia Limited) Order 2011 (‘the 2011 BTL acquisition Order’), being
Statutory Instrument No 70 of 2011, are valid and constitutional and took effect as
from 4 July 2011, rather than as from 25 August 2009;

(ii) in particular, section 2(a) and (b) of Act No 8 of 2011 was operative and effectual and,
accordingly, prospectively amended the provisions of section 63(1) of the Belize
Telecommunications Act, Chapter 229 of the Laws of Belize (‘the principal Act’),

the power of the National Assembly to alter the Constitution is limited only by the
provisions of such constitution, which, as relevant, are contained in its section 69;

The Belize Constitution (Eighth Amendment) Act 2011, being Act No 11 of 2011,

Telecommunications (Assumption of Control over Belize Telemedia Limited) Orders
2009, being Statutory Instruments Nos 104 and 130 of 2009, which Act and Orders
were all declared unlawful, null and void by this Court in Civil Appeals Nos 30 and
31 of 2010;

Mr Boyce and the Trustees are not entitled to the return of their former shares in Belize
Telemedia Limited (‘Telemedia’) and their relevant loan interests nor to the return of
the business undertaking of Telemedia but are entitled to compensation for the
compulsory acquisition effected by the 2011 BTL acquisition Order;

compensation for the lawful compulsory acquisition of the relevant respective
properties of British Caribbean, Mr Boyce and the Trustees should, respectively, be
in an amount equal to the value of the relevant property of British Caribbean on 4 July
2011, in an amount equal to the value of the relevant property of Mr Boyce on 4 July
2011 and in an amount equal to the value of the relevant property of the Trustees on
4 July 2011;

the parts numbered 1, 3, 4 and 7 of the Order made by Legall J on 11 June 2012 and

Even though I have held that section 145 has not had the effect of validating the unlawful
acquisition of the complainant’s properties, given my finding that it is in any event in
violation of section 17(1) of the Constitution, I thought it appropriate to order accordingly. !°°

LEGAL ACTIONS RELATING TO THESE ARBITRAL PROCEEDINGS

Following Dunkeld’s initiation of these proceedings, the Prime Minister of Belize discussed the
Notice of Arbitration in an interview on 9 December 2009 with a Belizean news agency in the

following terms:

That's all under the Belize UK Investment Treaty. That’s the last, that’s their last stand in so
far as the litigation front are concerned. I don’t want for people to get discouraged or to get
excited where they put out press releases saying they are going to arbitration under the
bilateral investment treaty. That is their right, there is a treaty.

It will cost us because we are going to be represented but in terms of the result of those
efforts, I am not worried. The investment protection treaty makes clear that people are entitled
to remedies. Investors who have their properties taken away, if that property is taken away
in consequence of an expropriation as opposed to a nationalization that is done for a public
purpose and that provides for the payment of compensation. We made sure that we
nationalized in the public interest and we made sure we provided for the payment for
compensation. !

On 23 December 2009, the Government commenced proceedings in the Belize Supreme Court,

seeking an injunction that would prevent Dunkeld and nine persons named as trustees of Hayward

from proceeding with arbitration.!°>

On 29 December 2009, the Supreme Court of Belize issued the following ex parte interim

injunction:

The Constitutional Challenge to the SCJA Act

On 16 April 2010, seven individuals—Mr. Phillip Zuniga, Mr. Dean Boyce, Mr. Keith Arnold,
Lord Michael Ashcroft, Mr. Jose Alpuche, Mr. Phillip Osborne, and Mr. Ediberto Tesucum—

initiated a challenge to the SCJA on the grounds that it was incompatible with the Constitution of

Belize. On 23 April 2010, these individuals were joined as interested parties by the following
individuals and entities: BCB Holdings Limited, The Belize Bank Limited, Mr. Phillip Johnson,

Mr. Ken Robinson, Thanet Financial Services Limited, The Lawn at Westgate Limited, Jacdaw

Investments Limited, Mr. Shaun Breeze, Mr. David Hammond, Mr. John Lambie, and Mr. Paul

Biffen.'!!

On 22 December 2010, Justice Sir John Muria of the Supreme Court of Belize issued a judgment

upholding in part and striking down in part the SCJA Act. That judgment reasoned in relevant

part as follows:

60. I now tum to subsection (8). This provision in my view stands on a different footing
than the rest of the provisions of section 106A. The subsection starts with the words,
“Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provisions” and then proceeds
to deal with arbitrations and arbitration proceedings both in Belize and abroad. The
provision then confers power on the Court to ie injunction against a party or
arbitrators from commencing or continuing arbitration proceedings or the
enforcement of those arbitration proceedings. The provision also gives power to the
Court to void and vacate an award made by arbitral tribunal, in Belize or abroad.

 

 

61. It is here that I must respectfully accept the submissions by Mr. Fitzgerald Q.C. and
Lord Goldsmith Q.C. on the issues of in personam criminal legislation and improper
purpose. Whilst the other provisions of the Amendment Act can be regarded as general
in nature, subsection (8) cannot be so viewed. That provision is clearly directed at
particular individual or group of individuals and specific types of existing
proceedings, namely arbitration. This is a violation of the principle of separation of
powers inherent in the Constitution of Belize. [. . .]

 

See Phillip Zuniga et al v. Attorney General, Civil Appeal Nos. 7, 9 & 10 of 2011, Judgment, para. 4 (Court
of Appeal of Belize, 3 August 2012)(Exhibit C-183).

172.

PCA Case N° 2010-13
Award
Page 62 of 132

67. In my judgment, subsection (8) of section 106A constitutes an impermissible in
personam provision and passed for an improper purpose thereby violating the
principle of separation of power under the Constitution. I find and hold that subsection
(8) of section 106A is ultra vires the Constitution and ought to be struck down.

68. I come next to subsection (9) which provides for the modes of service of notice of
injunction issued by the Court or of an application for an injunction. It will be
observed that this provision links closely with subsection (8) which had already been
considered above. When one looks at the modes of service of notice of injunction

ued or applied for under subsection (8), the requirements of proper service are
woefully inadequate. No time has been specified within which service is to be effected
whether by registered post, fax, courier service or notice in the Belize Gazette and
whether the person to be served is within Belize or abroad. It is also notable that the
requirement of personal service on a person within the jurisdiction is omitted and no
grounds have been given for effecting service on a person abroad by fax, courier
service or notice in Belize Gazette.

 

69. Despite the circumstances recognized by the Civil Procedure Rules to be met when
effecting service on a person out of the jurisdiction, subsection (9) simply does not
permit any such procedure. I agree with Lord Goldsmith Q.C. that this is wholly
unreasonable and contravenes the rights to fair hearing and right to access to the courts
under section 6 of the Constitution. Accordingly it must be struck down as being ultra
vires the Constitution.

73. — I shall now deal with subsection (12). The sting in this provision is not the length of
notice but rather in the discretionary manner of giving notice to the offender. This
provision in my view is plainly contrary to section 6 of the Constitution in that
whereas section 6 of the Constitution makes it mandatory that adequate notice shall
be given to an offender, whether he attends Court or not, of the charge, time and place,
the obligation under this subsection to notify the offender of the charge, time and place
of trial is discretionary. The service on an offender who lives abroad through
publication in the Belize Gazette or even someone in the rural Belize can hardly be
classified as adequate notice for the purpose the rights of an accused guaranteed under
Section 6 of the Constitution. Subsection (12) is ultra vires the Constitution and should
be struck down.

Conclusion

74. Having anxiously considered the submissions on behalf of the parties in the
circumstances of this case and for the reasons stated in this judgment, I make the
following declarations:

 

1. I declare that the Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment) Act 2010 is valid
save for the following provisions subsections (8), (9) and (12) of Section 106A.

2. I declare that subsections (8), (9) and (12) of Section 106A of the Supreme
Court of Judicature (Amendment) Act are ultra vires the Constitution and are
herby struck down.

3. Each party to bear its own costs of these proceedings. |!”
Both the applicants and the Government appealed portions of Justice Muria’s decision to the

Court of Appeal.

On 3 August 2012, the Court of Appeal issued a judgment in which it reversed the Supreme Court

with respect to sub-sections 8 and 9 of the SCJA Act, but found instead that sub-sections 3 and 5

were incompatible with the Constitution. The Court of Appeal further found that the majority of
the Act could not be severed from the invalid provisions. Judge Mendes, writing for a unanimous

bench, reasoned in relevant part as follows:

Improper Purposes

61. The evidence does indicate quite clearly that in proposing the Amendment Bill to
Parliament, the Government of Belize had Dunkeld and the appellants within its sights. The
Government had obtained an injunction against Dunkeld and the appellants, which Dunkeld
proceeded to ignore. The Government's case was that the appellants were influential in
Dunkeld’s decision to take the dispute over the expropriation of its assets to arbitration. The
Prime Minister stated publicly at a later date that it was the acts of Dunkeld and the appellants
which prompted this legislation. Around that time as well, BSDL was in violation of an

the taking or inuing of arbitration di BCBL was
threatening arbitration under the Treaty, which, consistent with its actions in relation to
Dunkeld, the Government was likely to take action to stop, and both BCB Holdings and the
Belize Bank had obtained substantial arbitration awards which they were seeking to enforce.

[L.]

63. It might therefore be correct to characterize the Amendment Act as having been
passed with the appellants and the interested parties in mind, with the intention of tipping the
scales in favour of the Government in its disputes with persons who might enjoy the
contractual or treaty right to arbitrate such disputes, and with the intention of deterring such
persons from breaching any anti-arbitration injunction the Government might obtain, but it
might be a bit of an exaggeration to say that the intention was to intimidate or deter such
person from exercising their rights at all.

 

 

64. On the other hand, the Act is not expressed to apply to specific individuals, or to
specific arbitrations, or to be applicable to any pending criminal or other proceedings. It is
expressed in terms of general application. It is also common ground that the new offence of
disobedience to a court order and the power to invalidate an arbitral award made in disregard
of or contrary to an injunction issued under section 106A(8), do not apply to breaches
occurring before the Act came into force, even though an offence against section 106A(1)
may be committed in relation to an order issued before then. On the face of it, therefore, the
new offence created applies to anyone and any order without restriction and is not limited to
the breach of anti-arbitration injunctions or to the appellants or the interested parties or their
associates or persons in similar positions to them.

 

   

65. Similarly, the power to issue anti-arbitration injunction applies to all arbitrations,
whether in Belize or abroad, and whether pursued by the appellants, the interested parties or
whomsoever. As such, the Government of Belize has armed itself with the wherewithal to
stymie any arbitration, whether "already commenced or to be commenced in the future, by
applying for an anti to initiate di di

 

to punish of
any order made restraining the pursuit or continuation of any such arbitration, and to apply
to the Court to vacate or void any award made in violation of such order.

[1

78. Stripped to its essence, the appellants and the interested parties’ real complaint is that
it is unfair for the Government of Belize to use its control over the National Assembly to pass
a law to provide it with additional tools to resist the submission of claims against it to
international arbitration and the enforcement of any awards obtained in violation of anti-
arbitration injunction. This is probably why they have cast their respective cases on the basis
of an exercise of legislative power for an improper purpose. I have already said why I do not
think that ground is i The ion is that any ge which the gi

may seek to obtain for itself through its influence in the legislature can only be achieved if
the fundamental rights and freedoms and the fundamental principles on which the
Constitution is based are complied with.

   

 

 

79. In the result, I would reject this ground of appeal and allow the cross-appeal against
the trial judge’s order declaring section 106(8) to be uncons

Separation of Powers — Selection of Sentence

89. [.. .] Where the police decide to prosecute under section 106A instead of section 269,
therefore, there will inevitably be more of a selection of the penalty to be imposed on the
particular defendant, than an attempt to match the seriousness of the conduct of the accused
with the appropriate offence. The selection which the police are allowed to make by section
106A(8)(2) therefore amounts more to the exercise of a sentencing function than the exercise
of prosecutorial discretion. For this reason, the separation of powers doctrine is infringed.

90. [. . .] in this case, it is section 106A(3) which creates the vice of permitting the
executive to select the sentence to be imposed by mandating the Supreme Court to impose
the minimum penalties provided for. It is this section which must accordingly be declared
invalid.

Mandatory Penalty - An inhuman or degrading punishment
L..]

105. A BZ$50,000.00 fine would probably cripple thousands of Belizeans who do not earn
close to that much on an annual basis. It is accordingly not hard to imagine a number of
realistic situations where such a fine would cause disproportionate hardship on the average
Belizean who, for good cause falling short of the requirements needed to establish say the
common law defence of necessity, breaches an injunction but does not fall within the
‘extenuating circumstances’ category because of a previous conviction for an offence,
however minor and however aged. The example of defiance exemplified by the conduct of
Dunkeld and BSDL is therefore probably not representative of commonly imaginable
instances of the offence. Indeed, it is no doubt precisely because it was not difficult to
conceive of many situations where the average Belizean citizen or business might be
financially destroyed by the minimum fine that it was thought necessary to create the
‘extenuating circumstances’ category which as it turns out appears to be too narrowly drawn.
The ‘extenuating circumstances’ category is accordingly evidence itself of the harshness of
the fixed penalties which the Supreme Court is mandated to impose.

Le]

 

107. But assuming that existing penalties are insufficient to induce compliance, no reason
has been given as to why the simple expedient of increasing the maximum penalties which
could be imposed and leaving it to the Court to select the penalty which fits the circumstances
of the case would not have done just as well. Indeed, so great is the impulse to deter that an
offender who might be financially destroyed by a minimum penalty of BZ$50,000.00 and
who, though knowingly disobeying an order, can show that he was ignorant of the
consequences of his action, would nevertheless be subjected to the BZ$50,000.00 minimum
penalty because he had been convicted fifteen years ago of a traffic offence. But for that
conviction, he would have fallen into the ‘extenuating circumstances’ category and been
subject to the much lower minimum fine of only BZ$5,000.00. Members of society would
undoubtedly be outraged by such a result and would view the vast disparity in such sentences,
based upon an inconsequential differentiating factor, as wholly arbitrary.

108. Iam therefore of the view that the mandatory penalties imposed by section 106A(3)
are grossly disproportionate and so infringe section 7 of the Constitution.

[-

The Right to Property

[-

128. In my judgment therefore section 106A(8) does not infringe the right to property.
Taking stock

129. Thus far, I have found section 106A(3) to be inconsistent with the separation of
powers doctrine and section 7 of the Constitution. Section 106A(3) imposes a mandatory
penalty for the offence created by section 106A(1). It is clear that section 106A(3) is an
important part of the scheme enacted by section 106A. If it falls, it follows that section
106A(1) and all other provisions connected with it would have to be declared invalid as well.
That would leave only subsections (8) and (9) which can stand separate and apart from the
criminal offence and its satellite provisions. Apart from subsection (9), therefore, which the
trial judge struck down as violating the right to a fair hearing and the right of access to the
court, it is strictly unnecessary to consider the separate challenges made to the other
subsections. [. . .]

 

Reverse Burden
L..]

145. By virtue of section 106A(5) a person who was acting in an official capacity for or on
behalf of a body of persons, whether corporate or incorporate, at the time that body
committed the offence under section 106A(1) of knowingly disobeying or failing to comply
with an injunction, is deemed to be guilty of the offence, unless he or she adduces evidence
to show that the offence was committed without his or her knowledge, consent or connivance.
As such, in order to establish criminal liability under subsection (5), the prosecution need
prove only that the corporate or incorporate body has committed the offence and that the
accused was acting or purporting to act in an official capacity at the time the offence was
committed. The official capacity in which the person was acting may be either as a
shareholder, director, manager, advisor, secretary or other similar officer, but is not limited
to these categories, albeit they are collectively quite wide. What the prosecution must prove
is that the accused was acting in an official capacity on behalf of the body at the time the
offence was committed, whatever may be the designation of the post held. On the other hand,
it is not necessary to prove that the accused was acting or purporting to act on behalf of the
body in the commission of the offence itself. Otherwise, there would be no need to create the
presumption of guilt. Thus, once the prosecution establishes these two factors, the burden
shifts to the accused to adduce evidence of lack of knowledge of, consent to or inconvenience
in the commission of the offence. If he fails to satisfy the presiding judge on a balance of
probabilities of the non-existence of all three he will be found guilty of the offence of
knowingly disobeying or failing to comply with an injunction. He will be found guilty,
therefore, of an offence which requires a mental element but which the prosecution is relieved
of the duty of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt. There is no requirement that the
prosecution prove either that the accused knew of the injunction or in any way advised or
counseled or participated in the commission of the offence, even though it is patent that the
mens rea of the offence is the most important element.

Le]

149. Inthe result, the possibility is created that a person whose only “offence” was holding
an official position on behalf of a company at the time it knowingly disobeyed an injunction,
is in jeopardy of being held criminally responsible for the company’s criminal conduct. In
large companies which employ a number of persons acting on its behalf in official capacities
which do not include as part of the job description the company’s compliance with court
orders, a number of persons would potentially be exposed to criminal charges and the
possibility of conviction for doing no more than representing their employer in circumstances
where, as a matter of contractual obligation, they had no choice in the matter. Even worse,
given that in order to escape criminal liability an unsuspecting official of the errant company
must establish not merely that she did not consent to or connive at the commission of the act,
but also had no knowledge that the offence was being committed, the possibility exists that
an employee acting in an official capacity, or purporting to do so, may be guilty of the
company’s offence simply because she knew that the offence was being committed, even if
she attempted to prevent its occurrence.

Le]

151. There is accordingly an unfair imbalance in what the prosecution must prove to
establish the offence and what the accused must prove, albeit at a lower standard, to escape
criminal liability.

Le]

156. In light of the above, I am satisfied that the legislature has indeed taken insufficient
account of the right to be presumed innocent. Section 106A(5) infringes the right guaranteed
by section 6(5)(a) of the Constitution and is not saved by section 6(10)(a).

Notice - Trial in absentia

[-

161. In this case there is no provision deeming service to have been properly effected by
the particular method of service which the claimant selects. Indeed, by providing for a choice
of four methods “as may be appropriate in the circumstances of the case”, subsection 9
anticipates the exercise by the presiding judge of his powers of superintendence over the
method of service used to ensure that the defendant is indeed informed of the court
proceedings or orders which might affect his interests. I am accordingly of the view that
subsection 9 does not infringe the right to a fair hearing or to access to court.

[. . .] subsections 11 and 12 do not infringe section 6 of the Constitution.

 

Disposition
168. In the result, I would issue the following orders:

i) It is declared that section 106A(3) violates the separation of powers doctrine
and section 7 of the Belize constitution;

ii) It is declared that section 106A(5) violates section 6 of the Belize constitution;

iii) It is declared that Section 106A(1)-(7), (10)-(13) and (16) are invalid null and
void and of no effect.

 

Given that both the appeals and the cross appeal have been successful, I would order further
i) that the appellants and interested parti all have 75% of their costs, here and in the court
below, certified fit for three counsel (including a Queen's Counsel and a Senior Counsel);
and ii) that the respondent shall have 75% of his costs of the cross-appeal, certified as fit for
three counsel (including two Senior Counsel), all costs to be taxed, if not sooner agreed. This
order as to costs shall stand unless application be made for a contrary order within 7 days of
the date of delivery of this judgment, in which event the matter shall be decided by the Court
on written submissions to be filed within 15 days from the said date.!!>

 

 

Both the applicants and the Government appealed portions of the Court of Appeal’s decision to
the CCJ.

173. On 24 January 2014, the CCJ issued a judgment in which it held that the offences created by the
SCJA Act were valid, but struck down the provisions on mandatory minimum sentences. The

majority opinion reasoned in relevant part as follows:

‘The ad hominem point
[...]

[45] [. . .] The Court of Appeal was right to reject the challenge to the legislation on this
ground.

 

The section 68 and improper purpose point

43 Phillip Zuniga et al v. Attorney General, Civil Appeal Nos. 7, 9 & 10 of 2011, Judgment (Court of Appeal
of Belize, 3 August 2012)(Exhibit C-183).

[47] It is unnecessary to spend a great amount of time on this limb of the submission. Much
of the wind was taken out of its sails by the intimations contained in the judgment of this
Court in British Caribbean Bank Ltd v The Attorney General of Belize. These proceedings
were pending at the time we delivered that judgment and we were aware then that an
interpretation of sub-section 8 was an issue in this appeal. We were nevertheless prepared
then to accept the Court of Appeal’s view that, to the extent that sub-section 8 empowered
the court to restrain a party from proceeding with foreign arbitration proceedings on the
ground that such proceedings would be oppressive, vexatious, inequitable, or would
constitute an abuse of the legal or arbitral process, the sub-section merely codified pre-
existing law which had never been regarded as being in conflict with the Constitution. This
Court ruled that it was only in exceptional cases that an anti-arbitration injunction would be
granted. The ruling effectively allayed much of the anxiety of the challengers that the Act
could operate to undermine or frustrate their on-going and/or anticipated international
arbitration proceedings. We have heard nothing in these proceedings to lead us to differ from
the Court of Appeal‘s view of sub-section 8. As to the remainder of sub-section 8, while we
see nothing unconstitutional in it, it is immediately difficult to envisage a circumstance in
which a court in Belize would be justified in issuing an injunction against arbitrators to
restrain them from ing or i arbitral di in light of the well-k
principle of Kompetenz-Kompetenz.

[...]
The discretion of the Attorney General point
[...]

[55] In any event, it must be borne in mind that section 106(A) extends the power to lay a
criminal information not only to the Attorney-General, but also to an aggrieved party and the
police. It is quite a leap to suggest that the exercise of this power amounts to the selection of
a penalty. As Appendix I to the second Amendment Act makes clear, a person who lays or
files a criminal information and complaint in the High Court bypasses the preliminary inquiry
process and begins a proceeding between the Crown and the named defendant. The Director
of Public Prosecutions is required by his office to conduct the case for the Crown. The
obliged to make an independent decision as to whether and how to proceed. In
our view, it is difficult to see how the right to lay a criminal information, with which the DPP
may or may not proceed, amounts to the selection of a choice of penalty by the Attorney-
General, the citizen or police officer laying the information. In all the circumstances we
respectfully disagree with the Court of Appeal‘s treatment of this point.

 

 
  

 

 

‘The mandatory minimum sentence point
[...]

[62] Ultimately, it is for judges, with their experience in sentencing, to assess whether a
severe mandatory sentence is so disproportionate that it should be characterised as inhumane
or degrading punishment. In this case the mandatory minimum fines of $50,000 plus a daily
rate of $100,000 are well beyond the ability of the average Belizean to pay and so are grossly
disproportionate. Equally, the imposition of a mandatory minimum fine of $50,000.00 or a
sentence of imprisonment for at least a stretch of five years on anyone convicted of any of
the offences in question (save those whose sentences fall within mitigating criteria fashioned
not by the court but by Parliament) is grossly disproportionate. It bears no reasonable relation
to the scale of penalties imposed by the Belize Criminal Code for far more serious offences
and for that reason it is also arbitrary. In our view, the mandatory minimum sentences here
should indeed be characterised as being grossly disproportionate, inhumane and therefore
unconstitutional for contravening section 7 of the Constitution. Later in this judgment we
shall consider the consequences of this finding.

The Reverse Burden of Proof

[73] [. . .] Ordinarily, in cases of contempt of court the prosecution has the burden of
proving conscious, deliberate disobedience of a court order. But here, the sub-section is
framed in a manner so as to relieve the prosecution of the onus of proving mens rea which is
the vital element of the offence targeted by sub-section 5. Usually, section 6(10)(a) comes
into play with reference to —offences arising under enactments which prohibit the doing of
an act save in specified circumstances or by persons of specified classes or with specified
qualifications or with the licence or permission of specified authorities.47 Here, the accused
does not have to show some positive exculpatory act on his part but rather is put in the
unenviable position of having to establish a negative, namely that he did not consent to or
connive at the disobedience to the injunction. If the sub-section is to be construed in a manner
that widens the blanket of guilt beyond those captured by sub-section 4, it comes perilously
close to legislating guilt by association. We agree with the Court of Appeal that the sub-
section contravenes section 6(3)(a) of the Constitution and is therefore invalid.

 

 

Trial in Absentia

[-

[76] The Court of Appeal rightly rejected this attempt to construe the Constitution in this
tabulated manner. [. . .]

Service of Proceedings

[-

[79] For the reasons given by the Court of Appeal we hold that there is no merit in the
submission that sub-sections 9 and 12 contravene section 6(3) of the Constitution.

The right to property point

[L.

[81] [. . .] Here too, our agreement with the Court of Appeal‘s construction of the
jurisdiction conferred on the court by sub-section 849 as not going beyond the existing law,
substantially, if not completely, undercuts the premise upon which the argument on this point
was made. As the Government concedes, in practice it would now be exceptional for a court
to issue an anti-arbitration injunction. [. . .]

[L.

[84] _ [...] Empowering the court to exercise a power does not oblige the court to wield that
power or to wield it in an indiscriminate fashion. There is nothing inherently unconstitutional
in the court being given a power to restrain an abuse of the legal or arbitral process or to
vacate awards. [. . .]

 

[85] As to the power to void and vacate awards, the challengers concede that the exercise
of this power is entirely unobjectionable so far as concerns Belizean awards. We fully expect
that the court would be astute to take into account, before resorting to the impugned powers
conferred, all the matters raised above that point towards the need for judicial restraint in
favour of permitting the arbitral tribunal itself to control the arbitral proces:

The consequence of the findings of this Court

[86] Like the Court of Appeal, this Court has found that the mandatory minimum penalties
prescribed in sub-section 3 and all of sub-section 5 (the reverse burden sub-section) are
invalid. The question now is what consequence ensues from this finding. [. . .]

[100] In our view therefore, the legislation is constitutionally valid save for i) the mandatory
minimum penalty regime contained in sub-section 3; ii) the proviso to section 3 and also sub-
section 3(a), and iii) sub-section 5 in its entirety. It follows that the Court should sever these
provisions from section 106(A). We accordingly dismiss the appeal of the Attorney General
and the cross appeals of both the Zuniga and BCB Holdings groups. For the avoidance of
doubt, sub-section 3 shall be read in the following manner with the original words of the
statute, which by this judgment have been invalidated, struck through and the words read in

conviction —

(i) in the case of a natural person, with a fine which s

unincorporated), with a fine which s
may extend to five hundred thousand dollars, and in the case

The Court accordingly orders that:
1. Both the appeal of the Attorney General and the cross-appeals of the Zuniga and BCB

Holdings groups respectively be dismissed;

2. Section 106(A)(3) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act as contained in the
Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment) Act, 2010 as amended by the Supreme
Court of Judicature (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 2010 is inconsistent with the
Constitution of Belize to the extent that it provides for mandatory minimum sentences;

 

3. By majority decision, the said mandatory minimum sentences be severed from section
106(A)(3);
4. By majority decision, the proviso to section 106(A)(3) and sub-section (3a) be severed

from section 106(A)(3);

5. Section 106(A)(5) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act as contained in the
Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment) Act, 2010 is inconsistent with the
Constitution of Belize and the same be invalidated in its entirety;

6. The Attorney General shall pay to the Zuniga group and the BCB Holdings group
75% of the costs of the State’s unsuccessful appeal and the Zuniga group and the BCB
Holdings group shall each pay to the Attorney General 100% of the State’s costs
incurred in responding to their respective unsuccessful cross-appeals.''*
In a separate opinion, a minority of the Court set out their view that the invalid provisions of the
Act could not reasonably be severed, noting that “we agree with the judgment of the Court save
that we would dispose of the case by striking the entire Amendment Act and leaving a clear slate
upon which Parliament would be free in its sovereign right to enact constitutionally consistent

legislation governing disobedience to orders issued by the courts.”!!°

2. The Commencement of the Dunkeld II Proceedings and the Resolution of the
Injunctions in the Court of Belize

In parallel with the constitutional challenge to the SCJA Act and the legal challenge to the

Dunkeld I Injunction, the Claimant sought to bypass these restrictions by reasserting its claims in

the Dunkeld II Proceedings.

On 26 July 2010, Dunkeld applied for an injunctive order from the High Court of Justice of
England and Wales (Commercial Court), Queen’s Bench Division.'!® On the same day, the High
Court granted Dunkeld the Anti-Suit Injunction, which restrained the Government “from
commencing, pursuing, progressing or taking any steps before the Courts of Belize or elsewhere
to enjoin or restrain the Claimant and/or the Tribunal from commencing or taking any steps in an
anticipated arbitration against the Defendant [. . .].”!'7 On the same day, Dunkeld filed the
Dunkeld II Notice of Arbitration.'!*

On 2 September 2010, the Government applied to the Supreme Court of Belize for an order
restraining Dunkeld from “taking any or any further steps in the continuation or prosecution of
the arbitration proceedings commenced by Dunkeld by Notice of Arbitration dated 26 July 2010
[...].”!?° On 8 September 2010, the Government’s application was served by courier on Dunkeld

through Allen & Overy LLP, pursuant to section 106A(9) of the SCJA Act.!?!

On 5 October 2010, Dunkeld applied to the Supreme Court of Belize for the discharge of the
Dunkeld I Injunction, arguing that “[t]his Honourable Court does not have jurisdiction over
Dunkeld” and that “there is no basis for an Order restraining the Applicant from continuing any
legal or arbitral proceedings.”!*

On 3 March 2011, the Supreme Court of Belize issued an interim injunction in respect of the
Dunkeld II Proceedings to restrain Dunkeld “from taking any or any further steps in the
continuation or prosecution of the arbitration proceedings commenced by Dunkeld by Notice of
Arbitration dated 26" July 2010 or from commencing or continuing any other arbitral proceedings

arising out of or relating to the same or substantially the same facts [. . .].”!7

On 10 May 2011, after a hearing from 1 April to 7 April 2011, the Supreme Court of Belize
granted the Dunkeld II Injunction.'* In its decision, the Supreme Court found Dunkeld in
contempt of court for making an application to the High Court of Justice of England and Wales
in spite of the Dunkeld I Injunction. The Court denied Dunkeld’s request to discharge the Dunkeld

J Injunction, and found that the Dunkeld I Injunction was enforceable against Dunkeld.'?°

On 1 November 2013 the Belize Court of Appeal—having delayed its decision to await the CCJ’s
judgment in British Caribbean Bank Limited v The Attorney General,’ considering BCB’s
challenge to a similar anti-arbitration injunction—rendered its judgment in the matter of Dunkeld
v. Attorney General (Civil Appeal No. 24 of 2011). In its decision, the Court of Appeal found that
the Supreme Court of Belize had erred in refusing to hear Dunkeld’s applications on the grounds

that Dunkeld was in contempt of court. The Court of Appeal set aside the Government’s service

of its fixed date claim form on Dunkeld, and it also set aside the Dunkeld I and Dunkeld II
Injunctions. The Court of Appeal declined, however, to directly grant Dunkeld’s application to
stay the Government’s anti-arbitration proceedings that the lower court had refused to hear. Judge

Morrison, writing for a unanimous bench, reasoned in relevant part as follows:

[...]
The anti-arbitration injunction issue
[...]

[130] In my view, the reasoning of the CCJ in the BCB case provides a complete code for
the resolution of the issues from Awich CJ (Ag)’s grant of the anti-arbitration injunction in
this case.

[-

[135] In light of the decisions of this court and of the CCJ in the BCB case, it cannot now be
doubted that the jurisdiction to grant anti-arbitration injunctions is wholly exceptional. It
must be exercised with caution and such injunctions will only be granted if the arbitral
proceedings are vexatious or oppressive or, in the words of section 106A(8), an abuse of the
legal arbitral process.

[-

Conclusion

 

[155] For all of these reasons, I consider that the learned judge erred in (i) refusing to hear
Dunkeld on its applications on the ground that it was in contempt of the court’s order of 5
February 2010; and (ii) refusing to discharge that injunction and granting a fresh injunction
on 11 May 2011. I also consider that Dunkeld has made good its application to set aside
service of the fixed date claim form and that this court’s order should go accordingly.
However, I would dismiss Dunkeld’s application for a stay of the proceedings.

On 10 April 2015, at the close of the hearing, the Respondent indicated that it wished to dismiss
the counter-claims advanced in its Statement of Defence and Rejoinder.'*° The Respondent’s
claims have also been narrowed as a result of the Parties’ Settlement Agreement (see

paragraph 186 below).

The Settlement Agreement

Pursuant to the Parties’ Settlement Agreement as recorded in paragraph (B)(v) of the Tribunal’s
Order No. 10 (set out in full at paragraph 87 above), the remaining issues to be determined by the
Tribunal are limited to the following:
the issues set out in Section 2.1(c) of the Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief (as articulated in
Section 8 of the Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief and Sections 4.2 (excluding para. 114), 5,7

and 8 of the Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief, together with the related pre-hearing
submissions, evidence and submissions on costs).(Remaining Issues);

 

Section 2.1(c) of the Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief provides as follows:

(c) Damages

@ Whether PwC's “bottom up” approach to Telemedia’s growth prospects is to be
preferred over NERA’s “top down” approach (Section 8.3), including:

(A) Whether NERA’s fundamental assumption, to rely exclusively on the 2009/10
Business Plan, was reasonable (Section 8.3(a)).

(B) Whether NERA’s and PwC’s other assumptions are reasonable (Section
8.3(b)).

(C) Whether either approach is supported by any other external valuation
methodology (Section 8.3(c)).

(ii) Whether the value attributable to synergies and the AA Damages Claim should be
included in the fair market value of Telemedia (Section 8.4).

(iii) | What value can be placed on the AA Damages Claim (Section 8.4(b)).

(iv) | Whether Dunkeld is entitled to recover the costs of the Second Arbitration and of the
Anti-Arbitration Claim (Section 8.5(b)).

(v) Whether a payment in US dollars is required under the Treaty (Section 8.5(c)).

(vi) | Whether Dunkeld is entitled to recover the costs of this Arbitration (to be addressed
in Costs Submissions).

Section 8 of the Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief concerns “Damages: Fair Market Value” and

encapsulates the Claimant’s arguments on quantum.

Section 4.2 of the Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief sets out the Respondent’s argument that “the
Tribunal should not accord any value to the contingent claim for repudiation of the

Accommodation Agreement.” Paragraph 114, which is excluded from the remaining issues for

Hearing Tr. 989:8-12.

the Tribunal’s decision, relates to the timing of the repudiatory breach of the Accommodation

Agreement in relation to Dunkeld’s migration to the TCI.

Sections 5, 7, and 8 of the Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief set out, respectively, the
Respondent’s views on “the fair market value of Telemedia shares” and its arguments that
“Dunkeld is not entitled to recover costs and fees” and that “Dunkeld is not entitled to recover

interest”.

On 16 February 2016, the Tribunal sought clarification from the Parties “as to whether the alleged
breach of Article 8 of the Treaty constitutes one of the Remaining Issues that require a decision
by the Tribunal.” On 26 February 2016, the Claimant set out the scope of the Parties’ agreement
as follows:
[. . .] Dunkeld International Investment Ltd (Dunkeld) has claimed the costs of the Dunkeld IT
proceedings as well as costs associated with various litigation proceedings (the Dunkeld IT

Costs) in two ways: (i) as a claim for costs; and (ii) as a claim for the substantive breach of
Article 8 of the Belize-UK Bilateral Investment Treaty (the Treaty).

The amount claimed is the same in both cases (see Statement of Claim, paragraph 268 (b)).
It is accepted that Dunkeld cannot double recover for this amount. Therefore, even if it were
to succeed on both bases, Dunkeld would only be entitled to be paid the amount once.

It is undisputed that the claim for recovery of the Dunkeld II Costs as costs in the Dunkeld I
proceedings is within the remaining jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal.

  

In relation to the claim under Article 8 of the Treaty, the Government has conceded the merits
of this claim and the only issue that remains for the Arbitral Tribunal to determine is quantum.
The reasoning is as follow:

 

 
  

1. Pursuant to h 3.2(a) of the Agri t dated 11 ber 2015,
the Government agreed to withdraw all of its preliminary objections and objections to
the merits of Dunkeld’s claims.

2. The remaining issues to be determined are identified in Recital (B)(v) of the
Tribunal’s Order No 10. They are limited to those issues set out in Section 2.1(c) of
the Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief.

3. Section 2.1(c)(iv) of the Claimant’s Post Hearing Brief includes the following issue:
“Whether Dunkeld is entitled to recover the costs of the Second Arbitration and of the
Anti-Arbitration Claim (Section 8.5(c))” This is a reference to the claim for the
Dunkeld II Costs. The separate claim for breach of Article 8 is listed as an issue in
Section 2.1(b)(vii) of the Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief, and accordingly was
excluded as a remaining issue given that the merits of the claim were conceded by the
Government.

 
  

    

 

4. It follows that the only issue to be resolved in relation to the Article 8 claim is
quantum. The Government only dealt with the merits of Dunkeld's claim under Article
8 in paragraphs 180 to 181 of its Post Hearing Brief, which is why no reference to
those paragraphs was included in the Settlement Agreement or, more specifically,
Schedule 2 to that agreement which subsequently became the Tribunal’s Order No 10.

The Respondent has confirmed its agreement to this understanding.

THE TRIBUNAL’S CONSIDERATIONS

QUANTUM IN RESPECT OF THE EXPROPRIATION OF TELEMEDIA

1. The Standard of Damages

The Parties are in agreement that the standard of damages is the “fair market value of the
expropriated investment, as set out in Article 5(1) of the Treaty”, using the Discounted Cash Flow
(“DCF”) analysis.'*' The Parties also agree that the valuation should be undertaken as at

25 August 2009.'%
2. The Mitigation of Damages
The Claimant's Position

The Claimant disputes the Respondent’s contention that Dunkeld failed to mitigate its losses,
noting that “Dunkeld does not accept that the Companies’ pursuing their claims for compensation
is relevant to the mitigation of Dunkeld’s losses” and that “Dunkeld is entitled to pursue its Treaty
claim regardless of the relief available at the domestic level.”!*3

Moreover, the Claimant adds that the Companies have submitted claims under the local process.
According to the Claimant, even though they accepted the Government's offer of BZ$1.46 per
share as partial payment, the Government has failed to make any payment, and “it is incorrect to
suggest that the Companies have not been engaged in that process or that they have ceased to

negotiate.”!*4

The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that “Dunkeld is barred from recovering damages because it has failed to
mitigate damages.” Relying on Middle East Shipping & Handling Co. v. Arab Republic of
Egypt,'** the Respondent submits that Dunkeld had a duty to mitigate damages and argues that

Dunkeld had “at its disposal, a fair and independent mechanism to mitigate its alleged damages”

through the local compensation process. Nevertheless, according to the Respondent, Dunkeld

“failed to mitigate its damages.”'*°

The Tribunal’s Considerations

The Tribunal notes that the Respondent raised the question of mitigation of damages in its
Statement of Defense and Rejoinder, but did not return to or develop it during the hearing or in
its Post-Hearing Brief. The issue is addressed in Section 8 of the Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief,
however, and to the extent that the Respondent maintains this argument, the Tribunal is of the
view that the Claimant did seek to mitigate its losses and to avail itself of the local compensation

process in Belize.

The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that recourse to local remedies is not strictly linked to the
mitigation of losses, such that any duty to mitigate should require the exhaustion of local remedies
or require a party to prefer a local remedy to one that may be available to it through international
arbitration. Nevertheless, it may be the case that local administrative procedures may offer a
remedy that appears more rapid or certain than that of an international claim, such that a party

would be derelict in failing to attempt the local process.

In the present case, however, the Tribunal notes that the Registered Owners, presumably acting
at Dunkeld’s direction, promptly submitted claims to the Government on 14 October 2009,
following the first acquisition of Telemedia, and on 30 August 2011, following the re-acquisition
(see paragraphs 139 and 157 above). In each instance, these claims were within the relevant
deadline imposed by the Government and the Registered Owners’ responses to subsequent
correspondence were timely. Ultimately, the Government and the Registered Owners were unable
to reach agreement on the valuation of Telemedia. The Registered Owners were nevertheless
willing to accept the sum offered by the Government as partial compensation, provided that this
did not foreclose their right to pursue further payment (see paragraph 160 above). This appears to
have been the final correspondence on this subject and the record before the Tribunal does not

indicate any response from the Government.

The duty to make reasonable use of available administrative procedures to reduce losses certainly
does not imply that a potential Claimant must forego the option of pursing international remedies

or must agree to whatever compensation is offered at the local level. Here, the Registered Owners

pursued local compensation without a successful result, and the Respondent has not identified

any other steps that the Claimant could reasonably have taken to mitigate its losses.

Accordingly, there is no bar to the Tribunal awarding the Claimant compensation.
3. The Valuation of Telemedia

Both Parties have submitted several expert reports, setting out their views of the value of
Telemedia as at 25 August 2009. These expert reports differ significantly, both in the value they
ultimately assign to Telemedia and in the methods they use in reaching their conclusions. The
Claimant’s expert, Mr. Alastair Macpherson, calculates the total value of Telemedia at 25 August
2009 as US$259,300,000 (or BZ$10.23 per share).'*’ In light of Dunkeld’s claimed interest in
71.20 percent of Telemedia, the Claimant submits that the value of its interest was
US$175,379,241.'** In contrast, the Respondent’s expert, Dr. Richard Hern, calculates the value
of Telemedia at 25 August 2009 as BZ$1.44 per share.”

In reaching these differing conclusions, the Parties’ experts differ primarily in respect of four
factors: (a) the role of the Accommodation Agreement in the valuation; (b) the basis for deriving
cash flow projections for the purpose of the DCF analysis; (c) the market for Telemedia and
whether value should be accorded to synergies that could be generated by potential buyers; and
(d) whether the conclusions of a DCF analysis should be cross-checked through the use of other

methods. The Parties’ respective views on these differences are set out in turn.

(a) The Appropriate Valuation of the Accommodation Agreement

The Parties’ respective valuations differ in their treatment of the Accommodation Agreement.
The Claimant includes the value attributable to the Accommodation Agreement in its overall
valuation of Telemedia; the Respondent discounts the Agreement entirely. The Parties’ experts
are in agreement, however, that the principal effects of the Accommodation Agreement stem from
the Agreement’s provisions for (a) an adjusted business tax rate of 25 percent of profits, rather
than 24.5 percent of revenue; (b) the removal of the 6 percent duty on imports; and (c) a
prohibition on the use of voice over internet protocol (“VoIP”).'“° The Parties’ experts also reach

substantially similar conclusions regarding the effect of the Accommodation Agreement on

Telemedia’s value, with the Claimant according it a value of BZ$3.10 per share’! and the

Respondent BZ$3.03 per share.'?

The Claimant's Position

The Claimant’s expert witness, Mr. Macpherson, completed his valuation under the assumption
that the Accommodation Agreement would be in effect until 2034, the year which, pursuant to
Clause 14.2 of the Accommodation Agreement, is equivalent to the duration of Telemedia’s

renewed license plus two years.'*?

According to the Claimant, this inclusion of the Accommodation Agreement is appropriate

insofar as:

(a) |The Accommodation Agreement was not a secret agreement as the Government alleges.
The Claimant considers the testimony of Mr. Waight that he was unaware of the Agreement

4

to be unconvincing'* and notes that the issue of the secrecy of the Accommodation

Agreement was ruled on by the LCIA tribunal in the Accommodation Agreement Award.'>

(b) The legality of the Accommodation Agreement was expressly upheld by the LCIA tribunal

)'46 and no other court or tribunal

faced with the question (see paragraphs 123-126 above
has ever ruled otherwise. The Claimant notes the Respondent's initial reliance on the CCJ’s
decision of July 2013 (see paragraph 132 above) and the Belize Court of Appeal’s decision
of May 2014 (see paragraph 163 above) for the proposition that the Accommodation
Agreement was illegal for being in excess of the Government’s authority. The Claimant
emphasizes that the CCJ’s decision was a refusal to enforce the Settlement Deed Award
(see paragraphs 130-132 above) and not the Accommodation Agreement Award: “there
was no arbitral award based on the Accommodation Agreement before the CCJ.”'47
Similarly, the Claimant considers the Belize Court of Appeal’s observations to be obiter

dictum insofar as the legality of the Accommodation Agreement was not at issue in those

proceedings. In any event, the Claimant notes that the Respondent conceded during the

hearing that neither of these decisions was directly on point.'**

(c)  “[T]he Government has never sought to challenge the Award at the seat of the arbitration”,
and the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in Belize Social Development
Limited v. the Government of Belize declined to “consider the Government’s arguments
regarding the alleged illegality of the Accommodation Agreement”.'”

Noting that the Government had repudiated the Accommodation Agreement prior to 25 August

2009, the Claimant submits that the value of the agreement at that date is as a damages claim

against the Government.'*° The Claimant argues that, at 25 August 2009, the Accommodation

Agreement Award was res judicata and that the LCIA tribunal had directly determined the

question of the legality of the Accommodation Agreement.'*! Accordingly, the Claimant

considers that a buyer on that date would have accorded value to Telemedia’s damages claim,
with the remaining question being one of quantum.’ According to the Claimant, in valuing this

claim:

(a) Litigation success risk would be negligible because, in light of the res judicata effect of the
Accommodation Agreement Award, “the hypothetical willing buyer would consider the
result of the claim to be a foregone conclusion and would not apply any significant discount
on the basis of litigation success risk.”

(b) Enforcement risk “must be assumed away”—even if a hypothetical willing buyer would
take it into account—because “[p]ublic international law requires tribunals to disregard
unlawful acts by a state in calculating damages.”'** The Claimant relies on Occidental v.

law

(c) General country risk is already captured in the DCF analysis and applying a further discount

to the Accommodation Agreement “amounts to double counting”.!**
Although the Claimant considers that no discount to the value of the Accommodation Agreement
should apply and that “neither expert has provided the Tribunal with an assessment of the discount
which would be applied to the AA Damages Claim by the reasonable hypothetical willing buyer,”
the Claimant submits that “the Tribunal nevertheless has discretion to apply an appropriate
discount.” The Claimant relies on SD Myers v. Canada‘ and Quasar de Valores v. Russia'®!
in support of the Tribunal’s discretion in this respect. As to how the Tribunal might exercise this
discretion, the Claimant recalls that a January 2008 offer for Telemedia by Cable & Wireless Ple
(“Cable & Wireless”) included a provision to retain 9.2 percent of the purchase price, subject to
Telemedia obtaining a reasonable after-tax profit. Drawing on this figure, the Claimant posits that
“a reasonable investor might apply a discount of 9.2% to the value of Telemedia for the risk
associated with the AA Damages Claim. Using PwC’s valuation of BZ$10.23 per share, this

9162

equates to a discount of BZ$0.94 per share, or 30.3% of the value of the AA Damages Claim.

The Respondent’s Position

According to the Respondent, the Accommodation Agreement was illegal'® and should not be
included in the valuation.'** The Respondent concedes that no court has directly ruled on this
question.'® According to the Respondent, the value of the judgment reached by the CCJ in BCB

Ashcroft group entity that purported to do certain things was ultra vires and beyond the Prime
Minister’s power to agree to”.'® In other words, the Respondent contends that the Settlement
Deed at issue in those proceedings was found to be unlawful for reasons that would apply equally
to the Accommodation Agreement. In the Respondent’s view, this is very persuasive, even though
it “is not res judicata with respect to how the Belizean courts will come out on the issue”.'
With respect to the value of the Accommodation Agreement, if legal, the Respondent’s expert
notes that a portion of the value of the Agreement was already captured in his DCF analysis.
Dr. Hern recalls that his analysis was based on the Telemedia business plan and submits that “the
business plan did not forecast paying any import duty”! and that “there’s not a material impact
on valuation in terms of revenues associated with VoIP in that business plan.”'® Instead,
according to Dr. Hern, “[t]he one area where . . . it probably would be appropriate to make an
adjustment is on the issue of business taxation.”!”° According to Dr. Hern:

The Accommodation Agreement has got a clause with respect to not paying more than I think

24.5 per cent of tax on profits. In the business plan it was assumed that the taxation would be

based on the existing approach of taxation on revenues, so a switch to the Accommodation

Agreement would . . . lead to a lower tax charge going forwards and, therefore, a higher

valuation. But in essence that’s not something that needs a different model. That adjustment

can essentially be done to the existing forecasts, but to adjust those forecasts for tax based on

the clause set out in the Accommodation Agreement.!7!
As a preliminary matter, the Respondent argues that “value associated with the Accommodation
Agreement must be dismissed in any event because Dunkeld failed to provide any evidence of

viT2

the fair market value of that asset. Relying on the reasoning of the tribunal in the British

Caribbean Bank Proceedings, the Respondent argues that:
Neither expert provided any opinion on the fair market value of the contingent, unliquidated
claim. . . . Although both experts acknowledged that a contingent claim would carry

substantial risk and that a rational, willing buyer would certainly discount the claim’s value
because of that risk, neither undertook an analysis of what such a discount might be.!7>

According to the Respondent, Dunkeld “may not recover damages under Article 5 for the value

of the contingent LCIA claim for the repudiatory breach of the Accommodation Agreement.”!*

In any event, the Respondent submits that “clearly a reasonable, willing buyer would consider [a
valid Accommodation Agreement] as a contingent damages claim, which is the impact of their
termination letter, and would have to apply some sort of risk to that.” '> The Respondent notes
Mr. Boyce’s memorandum to the Employees Trust discussing the possibility of selling the
Accommodation Agreement Award to a collection company at a discount.'”° Accordingly, the
Respondent submits that “there would, in fact, be a discount in connection with valuing that claim
and that discount should be quite significant because not only of the litigation risk but the
collection risk.”'”” For the Respondent, this is not “the government seeking to benefit from its
purported bad acts but the mere collection risk associated with country risk, in this instance, the
bond rate for Belize.”'”8

In the Respondent’s view, the most that could be accorded to the Accommodation Agreement—
“even giving it no discount for risk associated with a contingent claim”—would give Telemedia

a total value of BZ$4.47 per share.!”

The Tribunal’s Considerations

As set out above, the Parties differ sharply with respect to the Accommodation Agreement and
its validity. The Respondent has repeatedly denounced the Agreement as illegal, while the
Claimant considers its validity to be a settled matter, comprehensively decided by the LCIA

tribunal in the Accommodation Agreement Award of 18 March 2009.

The Accommodation Agreement appears to have played a significant role in precipitating the
events giving rise to these proceedings, and under either Party’s calculation, the validity or
otherwise of the Agreement has a significant effect on the value of Telemedia. In the Tribunal’s
view, the Accommodation Agreement was a valid contract between Telemedia and the
Government of Belize and should be included in the valuation of Telemedia for the reasons that

follow.

As an initial matter, the Tribunal considers that it need not determine whether the Accommodation
Agreement Award and the findings of the LCIA tribunal with respect to the validity of the
Agreement are res judicata in these proceedings. This would be a complex question of law that
would turn on a determination of the degree of privity between a corporation and its ultimate
parent and on the scope of issue estoppel in the municipal law of England, as the place of the
Accommodation Agreement Award, and of the Netherlands, as the place of this arbitration.
Rather, it suffices for present purposes that the determination of validity in the Accommodation
Agreement Award most likely would be considered to be res judicata in a hypothetical further
arbitration, seated in London, between Telemedia under the management of its willing buyer, and
the Government of Belize. For the present Tribunal, this is a question of fact in establishing the
value of Telemedia. In any event, the Tribunal also agrees with the essential conclusion of the
LCIA tribunal concerning the validity of the Accommodation Agreement, notwithstanding the
decision reached by the CCJ in BCB Holdings Limited & The Belize Bank Limited v. The Attorney
General of Belize'*® (see paragraph 132 above).

The Respondent raises the following series of objections to the Accommodation Agreement:

(a) The Agreement is null and void because the Constitution of Belize requires all revenues
raised by the Belizean tax laws to be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund and includes

no power permitting the Executive to contract otherwise.!*!

(b) The Executive lacks authority under the Belize Income and Business Tax Act to alter the

Agreed Rate of business tax.'*?

(c) The Executive lacks authority under the Belize Customs and Excise Duties Act to alter the

rate of custom duties, except where empowered by the Act itself.'*?

(d) The Public Utilities Commission (the “PUC”), rather than the Executive, held the authority
to regulate the use of radio frequencies under the Belize Telecommunications Act, and the

Executive lacked the authority to direct the PUC to allocate frequencies to Telemedia.'™

(e) The restriction that VoIP services could only be utilized under licenses from Telemedia or
Speednet violates the PUC’s power to receive and process license applications and the
prohibition in the Belize Telecommunications Act on licensees entering into agreements

that would lessen competition.'**
(f) The Constitution and laws of Belize do not permit a set-off against tax liability.'*°

With the exception of the Constitutional point concerning the Consolidated Revenue Fund, each
of these arguments was considered by the LCIA tribunal on its own initiative and decided in the
Accommodation Agreement Award against the position now advocated by the Respondent. The
core of that decision was that the Prime Minister of Belize has the authority, in the absence of
specific statutory limitations to the contrary, to contract on behalf of Belize in the ordinary or
necessary course of Government administration and that the circumstances of the Government
seeking to stabilize the telecommunications industry in Belize fell within that ambit.'*7 The LCIA
tribunal then went on to examine whether any statutory limitation was applicable, holding that (a)
the Income and Business Tax Act contains no provision precluding set-offs; (b) Section 95 of the
Income and Business Tax Act broadly permits the Minister of Finance to remit income tax
payable, which should be construed as applicable to business tax; (c) Section 17 of the Customs
and Excise Duties Act should not be interpreted to preclude the Minister of Finance from remitting
customs duties in circumstances other than those expressly enumerated; and (d) no statutory
provision prevents the Government from contracting to allocate radio frequencies or to restrict
VoIP services offered by third parties.'** The LCIA tribunal also concluded that the Government
was able to procure the implementation of the Agreement by the PUC'* and that the
Accommodation Agreement was not a secret agreement.'” Accordingly, the LCIA tribunal

reached the conclusion that “the Government had actual authority to enter into the

Accommodation Agreement and that it was lawful for the Government to agree to the provisions

that are now in dispute.”!°!

This, however, was not the end of the LCIA tribunal’s reasoning. Having found that the
Government possessed actual authority to enter into the Accommodation Agreement, the LCIA
tribunal went on to examine whether the Government of Belize also possessed apparent or
ostensible authority to enter into the Agreement. Examining the common law principles on
apparent authority as summarized in Marubeni Hong Kong and South China Itd. v. Government
of Mongolia (“Marubeni’”),'”* the LCIA tribunal noted that the Accommodation Agreement “was
negotiated by the then Prime Minister/Minister of Finance and other senior Government
ministers, including the Attorney General and Minister of Public Utilities, all of whom were
assigned responsibility for conducting business in relation to the government departments under
their control”. The LCIA tribunal also took note of the express warranties on legality and authority
set out in the Agreement itself and the counter-signature of the Second and Third Amendment
Deeds by the Attorney General before concluding that “the criteria for apparent authority have
been established and that the special considerations that arise when contracting with the Crown
have been met.”!°

The Respondent argues that the LCIA tribunal’s conclusions have been effectively superseded by
the CCJ’s 26 July 2013 decision in BCB Holdings Limited & The Belize Bank Limited v. The

Attorney General of Belize.

The Parties are in agreement that that decision concerned the enforceability of the Settlement
Deed Award (see paragraph 130 above) and the validity of the Settlement Deed, not the
Accommodation Agreement. The Parties are also in agreement that no court in Belize has directly
ruled on the validity of the Accommodation Agreement.'** The Tribunal agrees with the
Respondent, however, that in ruling on the enforceability of the Settlement Deed Award the CCJ
was directly called on to interpret Section 95 of the Income and Business Tax Act and that the
decision is therefore relevant to the question of the Accommodation Agreement. In that decision,

the CCJ held that “Section 95 cannot properly be interpreted as being capable of granting the

Minister the power to do what the [Settlement Deed] here purported to do.”'® In particular, the
CCJ held that Section 95 does not permit the Minister of Finance to remit an unspecified amount

of future taxes that have not yet been incurred.'°°

The Tribunal accepts that the rulings of the CCJ are dispositive with respect to the content of
Belize law and that the question of the Government’s actual authority to have entered into the
Accommodation Agreement is a matter of Belize law. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that,
further to the CCJ’s decision, the present state of Belize law would be that the Government lacked
the actual authority to conclude the Accommodation Agreement, at least with respect to those
provisions relating to the calculation and remission of business tax. The same conclusion,
however, does not hold true with respect to the Government’s apparent authority to conclude the
Accommodation Agreement. Apparent authority constituted a separate and independent basis for
the Accommodation Agreement Award, as well as for the Settlement Deed Award considered by
the CCJ. The CCJ, however, did not address the Settlement Deed Award’s findings with respect
to apparent authority and appears to have found that Award to be unenforceable in Belize on the

basis of a lack of actual authority alone.

The Accommodation Agreement is a contract governed by Belize law and the question of
apparent authority is accordingly also a matter of Belize law. Both Parties, however, have argued
the issue of apparent authority by reference to English jurisprudence,'*” and the Tribunal
understands this to be an area of the common law of agency and contract in which the law of
Belize does not differ materially from that of England. On this issue, the Respondent relies on
Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries v. Mathews for the proposition that although a private
individual can be estopped from denying the validity of a contract he has entered into without
actual authority, a government body cannot, such that an ultra vires act of government is not an
act of government at all. The Tribunal, however, is of the view that the law on this issue is more
accurately described in Marubeni, which follows Bowstead & Reynolds on Agency for the
proposition that the apparent authority of a Crown official may be established “in the normal

way”, subject to express statutory limitations and the Crown’s need to preserve the “freedom of

action to do its public duty.”!°* The authority advanced by the Respondent may be correct with
respect to the scope of estoppel, but “[a]lthough ostensible authority is a form of estoppel, it is
treated as an exception to the general principle that estoppel cannot be relied upon to rehabilitate
a transaction entered in excess of powers.”!”°

The Tribunal agrees with the findings of the LCIA tribunal that the Government had apparent
authority to conclude the Accommodation Agreement. In particular, the Tribunal notes that the
involvement of the Attorney General of Belize in the negotiation of the Agreement” and the

201

Attorney General’s counter-signature on the Second and Third Amendment Deeds™' parallels the

representation of authority made by the Minister of Justice of Mongolia and considered

202

dispositive in Marubeni.” The doctrine of apparent authority exists to protect parties that rely
upon the representation of a principal that its agents are empowered to assume obligations on its
behalf when in fact they are not.” The need for such protection is no less valid when the principal

in question is a sovereign.

Accordingly, for the purposes of this arbitration, the Tribunal concludes that an English arbitral
tribunal in a hypothetical further arbitration pursuant to the Accommodation Agreement would
consider the Accommodation Agreement Award to be dispositive of the matter of apparent
authority, notwithstanding the intervening decision of the CCJ on the content of section 95 of the
Income and Business Tax Act, and would award damages on that basis. The Tribunal therefore
considers that the Accommodation Agreement should be included in the value of Telemedia,
although not at the full value advocated for by the Claimant. Before addressing the value to be
given to the Accommodation Agreement, however, the Tribunal turns to a further objection raised
by the Respondent on the basis of the Award of 19 December 2014 in British Caribbean Bank Ltd

Agreement as a contingent claim, rather than as a functioning contract (see paragraph 210 above).
The Respondent considers the Accommodation Agreement equivalent to the loans at issue in the

BCB Proceedings for which the Award in that matter found a claim of face value to be insufficient.

In the Tribunal’s view, however, the Accommodation Agreement differs in fundamental ways
from the loans made by British Caribbean Bank. As an initial matter, the Tribunal does not
consider that the Treaty’s requirement to establish fair market value requires a party to set out the
market value of each asset or element of the business independently, but rather to establish the
fair market value of the expropriated investment as a whole, drawing on calculations of the future
cash flows from its component parts that will necessarily involve a degree of estimation.
Moreover, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant has presented, built into its DCF calculation,
evidence of the market value of the Accommodation Agreement to Telemedia’s business, in other
words, of the amounts that it would have claimed in a hypothetical further arbitration at the LCIA.
Given the existence of a res judicata decision on the validity of the Accommodation Agreement
and the Claimant’s argument that enforcement risk must be assumed away as a matter of law, the
Tribunal considers that, whether or not it ultimately agrees with the Claimant, the Claimant did
make a sufficient showing of the market value of the repudiated Accommodation Agreement as
a potential claim. This situation differs from that of the loans in the BCB Proceedings, where
factors other than the Government’s actions would necessarily have impacted the market value of

the Telemedia and Sunshine loan facilities.

Turning to the ultimate value of the Accommodation Agreement as a contingent claim, the
Tribunal is sensitive to, and largely in agreement with, the Claimant’s argument that the value of
a valid claim should not be discounted to reflect the possibility that a recalcitrant party may seek
to unlawfully delay or frustrate enforcement. At the same time, the Tribunal is conscious of its
particular standing in these proceedings, insofar as it has not been asked to rule on and award
damages for the Government’s breach of the Accommodation Agreement, but rather to step into
the position of the valuer and to assign a value to Telemedia’s un-arbitrated claim as at 25 August

2009.

Additionally, the Tribunal is uncomfortable with the Claimant’s equation of the Belize courts’
review of an arbitral award for enforceability with unlawful activity, rather than considering the
same to represent the proper functioning of the New York Convention system for international
arbitral awards. Under the circumstances, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to recognize both
the time that Telemedia would have required to secure an award and payment, and the possibility
that the Belize courts might legitimately decline enforcement on public policy grounds—as in

fact occurred with the Settlement Deed Award—even if the same award could well remain

enforceable outside of Belize. The Tribunal takes the view that these considerations do not form
part of the general country risk discount already applicable, but are particular to the
Accommodation Agreement as a claim. They can most reasonably be represented by applying a

supplemental discount of five percent to revenues linked to the Accommodation Agreement.

The Tribunal will address the specific effects of the Accommodation Agreement on the value of

Telemedia in the course of its calculations below.

(b) The Parties’ respective DCF calculations
i The overall approach to the DCF calculation

While both Parties have carried out DCF analyses in attempting to value Telemedia, they differ
significantly in their approach and in the sources of information used to project Telemedia’s future

cash flows. The Parties’ differences in their respective overall approaches are set out as follows.

The Claimant's Position

The Claimant’s expert, Mr. Macpherson, conducts his DCF analysis on the basis of what the
Parties’ have termed a “bottom up” approach. In so doing, Mr. Macpherson constructed a model
of projected future revenue and costs over a 15-year period. With respect to revenues,
Mr. Macpherson examined trends in market factors such as population, GDP growth, inflation,
and exchange rates; trends in mobile telecommunications, including market size and mobile
usage, market share, pricing and price elasticity, and data services; and trends in fixed line
telecommunications, including household size, market share, and broadband usage.” With
respect to costs, Mr. Macpherson developed models for trends in operating costs, taxation, and
capital expenditures.”

Mr. Macpherson considers this approach to be preferable to the Respondent’s approach of relying

on Telemedia’s 2009-2010 business plan for two principal reasons:

(a) _ First, projections based on the business plan are “depressed because of the breakdown of

Telemedia’s relationship with the Government.”?°

Page 91 of 132

(b) Second, the business plan “fails to recognise the value accretion which may be available to
a hypothetical buyer able to deploy different capabilities or exploit economies of scale and

scope.”207

233. As summarized by Mr. Macpherson:

I have looked at the business plans as one source of information, but I’ve looked at
benchmark information from other telecoms operators in other telecoms markets, and I think
that is relevant information that I have applied to a more fundamental based forecast of the
cash flows.°*

In his view, this approach is appropriate insofar as:

[The business plan] represents the expectation or ambition . . . of what the current
management think they can do in their current mode of operation. So it’s got their operating
model built into it or evolutions of that through the planned period. It’s essentially valuing
the cash flows they expect to get the business with their knowhow, capability, resources and
operating environment.

Fundamentally . . . if one contemplated Cable & Wireless or Digicel or American Mobile
entering into this they would have a completely different perception of the possibilities of
this market because they have different assets, different capabilities and different knowhow
to bring to bear. So the business plan represents a view of the management of what it thinks
it can do with its current operating model and the evolutions it has postulated in its busine:
plan. That is not necessarily the value of the business for a fair market purpose because it
doesn’t contemplate the value that could be achieved by a class of buyers or, indeed, value
that they would have to pay for if it were able to acquire that company. I think that is an
important distinction between the business plan and looking at this from the outside
perspective of a universe of potential buyers.

 

  

 
    

 

234. The Claimant concludes: “the Business Plan does not accurately capture Telemedia’s potential as
a business as at 25 August 2009, it does not include the improvements and benefits that a large
international operator would be able to realise and it includes the downward pressures of

Government interference, and so it should not be a proxy for Telemedia’s valuation.”?!°

The Respondent’s Position

235. In contrast, the Respondent’s expert, Dr. Hern, carried out his DCF analysis on the basis of what
the Parties have termed a “top down” approach. Dr. Hern based his future cash flow predictions
on Telemedia’s 2009-2010 business plan, adjusted to take account of information as at August

2009, in particular with respect to the effects of the financial crisis.

In the Respondent’s view:

Dr. Hern’s analysis reflects what a real-world fair market value would look like. A willing
and likely buyer would certainly turn first to Telemedia’s own business plans, to see what its
management, the people most knowledgeable about the company and its prospects, believed
to be possible, before then making adjustments to reflect its own views about prospects and
value as well as risks, including country-specific risk.2!!

  

Reviewing the Claimant’s approach, Dr. Hern concludes as follows:

the problem with that approach is that it can be very sensitive to one or two key assumptions
and very sensitive to the comparators that are used for, for example, deriving long-term

hi ions, or long-term achievable fixed rate I think
when we looked very closely at the PwC model we found many areas where those
assumptions that were being made were based on subjective data, ie, the perspective that this
country was the best comparator for Belize and not that country, or that this growth rate of
GDP which we can see based up to 2015 would continue right throughout the whole horizon.
There are many assumptions like that made in the PwC model and the valuation, as a result,
is very sensitive to some of those assumptions.

I think maybe that’s fine, but at the very least there has to be some cross check based on
management projections for the business, what the business has managed to achieve over the
period of time that we can see historical data, and the trends of those key revenues. And,
when I look at the PwC’s projections, I see a significant divergence between the projections
that are coming out of the PwC model and what’s coming out of those management
projections and historic trends. They are way, way higher than the management is projecting
. [ think it’s implausible that an investor in this type of business is going to
s at a significant premium to what the existing management of the business
say is achievable.?!?

  

Dr. Hern also observes that “Telemedia has significantly underperformed against previous
Business Plans, and PwC do not provide any evidence that investors would be likely to expect
outperformance”.?'? Accordingly, he concludes that “it is not credible to assume that shares in
Telemedia would be based on revenue and cost growth rates that are substantially more optimistic
than management targets.”?!4 Finally, Dr. Hern notes that Belize is a particular market, with a low
per capita GDP, high country risk and corruption figures, and a sparsely dispersed population. As
such, he considers it “inappropriate to take these other countries . . . and use those as comparators

wus

for what could be achievable in Belize.

The Tribunal’s Considerations

With respect to the overall approach, the Tribunal accepts Respondent’s submission that the

Business Plan for 2009-2010 would be a first point of reference for a willing and likely buyer in

order to ascertain what Telemedia’s management believed to be achievable, before making
adjustments to reflect its own views about prospects and value as well as risks, including country-

specific risk.

In opposing the use of the Business Plan for valuation purposes, the Claimant raised two
objections: first, that the Business Plan sets out depressed projections as a result of Telemedia’s
dispute with the Government, and second, that the Business Plan does not account for the potential
synergies that could be realized by another telecommunications company. With respect to the
former, the Tribunal considers that, to the extent the business plan presents lower projections as
a result of the non-application of the Accommodation Agreement, this can be captured through
adjustments to the cash flows projected in the Business Plan and by including a value for historic
breaches in the value attributed to the Accommodation Agreement. To the extent that, more
generally, Telemedia may have only underperformed its Business Plan as a result of Government
interference, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent (see paragraph 254 below) that these were
“one-off” events only in the sense that particular past adversities involved the Government. With
respect to the Claimant’s second objection, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent regarding
the appropriateness of valuing synergies, which will be discussed in greater detail below (see
paragraph 269). For the Tribunal, therefore, neither objection warrants departing from the

Business Plan as the starting point for the valuation.

The Tribunal respects the significant effort that evidently went into the creation of the Claimant’ s
valuation model, but considers that too many of the projections underpinning it are ultimately
speculative, in particular over the extended period projected by the Claimant. Taken together, the
effect of these projections is to increase the degree of uncertainty in the Claimant’s calculations
beyond what the Tribunal considers reasonable. Accordingly, the Tribunal prefers the “top down”

model developed by the Respondent as a starting point for its own conclusions.

ii. The appropriateness of assumptions underlying the Claimant’s DCF

calculation

Beyond their differences in overall approach, the Parties also differ with regard to certain specific
assumptions made in each of their respective DCF calculations. In light, however, of the
Tribunal’s preference for the Respondent’s overall approach to valuing Telemedia, it is
unnecessary to resolve these differences in respect of the assumptions underlying the Claimant’s

DCF calculations.

iii. The appropriateness of the assumptions underlying the Respondent’s DCF

calculation

The Tribunal is, however, called upon to resolve the Parties’ differences with respect to the

appropriateness of the assumptions made in the Respondent’s DCF calculation.

The Claimant's Position

The Claimant makes seven overarching criticisms of the assumptions applied in the Respondent’s

DCF calculation.

First, the Claimant submits that Dr. Hern employed too short a time frame for forecasting cash-
flows, relying on the five-year forecast set out in Telemedia’s business plan. Although Dr. Hern’s
DCF calculation specifies a continuing value thereafter, the Claimant argues that this “does not
capture the incremental value expected from these long-life capital investments beyond five
years”.?!© The Claimant notes that Belize is an emerging market where substantial growth can be
expected even beyond five years.?!” Additionally, the Claimant considers telecommunications to
be a capital intensive industry in which assets frequently have a life of 10 or 15 years, such that
“a longer forecasting period is . . . necessary to reflect the full value of Telemedia’s capital
investment programme.”'* The Claimant notes that the business plan was not prepared as a
valuation, and the selection in the plan of a five-year forecasting period cannot reflect a

determination that this was an adequate period for valuation purposes.7!*

Second, the Claimant considers that Dr. Hern’s approach treats Telemedia’s business plan as an
upper limit for what the company could achieve and has the effect of extending specific instances
of historic underperformance into the future. According to the Claimant, “Telemedia’s revenues
were very close to its business plan targets in three of the five years in question.”””° In 2005/2006
and 2008/2009, however, results were affected by one-off events in the form, first, of the after-
effects of the failed Prosser transaction (see paragraphs 112-114 above) and, second, of the new
Belize Government’s refusal to apply the Accommodation Agreement.””! While the Respondent

considers that potential willing buyers would anticipate that similar issues could arise in the

future, the Claimant considers that this is already accounted for in the discount for country risk.
In the Claimant’s view, “by factoring country risk into his assessment of the 2009/10 Business
Plan and hence Telemedia’s future cash-flows, Dr Hern is guilty of double counting, as his
calculation of Telemedia’s cost of capital also includes an assessment of Belize’s country risk

premium.”?”?

Third, the Claimant argues that Dr. Hern assumes an EBIT margin for FY 2014/2015 that is below
the trend of the preceding years. Dr. Hern projects an EBIT margin rising from 29 percent in
FY 2009/2010 to 39 percent in FY 2013/2014, before dropping back to 35 percent in FY
2014/2015. According to Mr. Macpherson, Dr. Hern “does not provide any explanation for why
Telemedia’s EBIT margin should decrease from 2013/2014 to 2014/2015, and stay at that lower
level indefinitely. The impact of this is it significantly reduces NOPLAT in 2015 and therefore

lowers Telemedia’s ‘Continuing Value’.”??3

Fourth, the Claimant argues that Dr. Hern inappropriately projects low revenue growth with
continued high capital expenditure. While Dr. Hern has adjusted Telemedia’s business plan to
decrease projected revenue, he has used the plan’s capital expenditure forecasts without
adjustment. In the view of Mr. Macpherson:
itis unlikely that management would continue to invest capital at planned levels if it believed
planned revenues would no longer materialise. In my view management is more likely, to
stem capital spending to ameliorate the pressure on return on investment. Furthermore,
NERA’s exclusion of the Accommodation Agreement would make this level of capital
expenditure less likely because it would be considerably more difficult for Telemedia to make
areturn.?”*
Mr. Macpherson examines the relationship between annual revenue and capital expenditure
growth for 162 listed telecom operators and argues that they are correlated, such that capital
expenditure should fall along with revenue.??5
Fifth, the Claimant considers that Dr. Hern’s assumption of a constant effective tax rate overstates
the taxes that Telemedia would actually have paid. The Claimant notes that internet and data
revenues are taxed in Belize at a lower level of 1.75 percent (as opposed to 19 or 24.5 percent for

telecommunications revenues). Because Dr. Hern has projected a growing share of Telemedia’s

revenue deriving from internet and data services, the Claimant considers that he should also have
projected a falling effective tax rate.?”°

Sixth, the Claimant argues that Dr. Hern overestimated the effect of the financial crisis on revenue
growth and the time that would be required for recovery by using “data which would not have
been available at the valuation date, resulting in an overestimate of the shock effect and an
underestimate of the pace of recovery.”??’ The Respondent notes that Dr. Hern uses September
2009 data on Telemedia’s actual results in the first half of FY 2009/2010 to estimate the effect of
the financial crisis when July 2009 data on the company’s performance that was actually available
at the valuation date would have predicted a lesser effect.?* Similarly, the Claimant notes that
April 2009 data from the IMF that was actually available at the valuation date predicted a faster
recovery than the October 2010 data actually used by Dr. Hern.?”?

Lastly, the Claimant submits that the final result of Dr. Hern’s calculation at BZ$1.44 per share
is implausibly low, such that the result should call into question the validity of the model. The

Claimant notes as follows:

(a) Dr. Hern’s valuation is less than the BZ$1.46 per share that was offered by the Government
to Telemedia’s shareholders (see paragraphs 143, 158 above), who rejected the offer. There

was therefore not, the Claimant argues, a willing seller at this price.”

(b) Dr. Hern’s valuation is substantially less than, and in the Claimant’s view not reconcilable

with, the Government’s October 2010 offer of BZ$5 per share.?"!

(c) Dr. Hern’s valuation would accord the entirety of Telemedia less value than the

Government was able to raise from selling 30 percent of the shares 14 months later.?*?

(d) “Dr Hern’s valuation of BZ$71.4 million is just twice Telemedia’s net earnings in the year

to March 2008 (BZ$37.8 million) and three times its net earnings in the year to March 2009

(BZ$22.2 million).” The Claimant endorses Mr. Macpherson’s view that a multiple of 12

to 20 times net earnings would be more usual for a telecommunications company.”**

(e) Dr. Hern’s valuation nearly equals Telemedia’ s capital expenditure in the 17 months prior
to the nationalisation. In the Claimant’s view, this would suggest that “no other part of the
company had any value whatsoever”.?™

(f) Dr. Hern’s valuation equals only one third of the book value of Telemedia’s assets. The
Claimant endorses Mr. Macpherson’s view that this is implausible insofar as Telemedia’s

recent capital expenditures were on new assets and included in the book value.*°

The Respondent’s Position
The Respondent replies to each of the Claimant’s objections in turn.

First, with respect to the use of a five year cash-flow forecast, the Respondent’s expert, Dr. Hern,

notes as follows:

In terms of the time periods over which the valuation was undertaken, in essence here my
logic was the following. An investor into the business looks at the available projections of
revenues and cost forecasts, as far as they are available, going forwards. In the case of Belize
Telemedia, those public projections by the business were only available for the next five
years. So Telemedia only published its business plan forecast for the next five years. There
were no other public forecasts or revenues and costs for this business after that point.

 

So I had to make an assumption about how best to project forward revenues and costs for the
business for the period after that, and my logic was that, rather than trying to do it on an
annual basis, which would have been quite sensitive to the assumptions that I would have
made for each individual year after that, a better approach is to assume an average growth
rate going forwards from 2015, and to calculate what I call a continuing value from that point
onwards, so you can think of it, in essence, as a terminal value but it’s a terminal value with
an assumed growth rate of revenues and costs from that point onwards. That growth rate was
set at 3 per cent, so I assumed revenues and costs would grow at 3 per cent from 2013/14
onwards, and that 3 per cent was consistent with the business plan forecast for the next five
years, and broadly consistent with historical data.

 

The driving factor in the continuing value calculation was the growth rate -- or one driving
factor was the growth rate of revenues and, therefore, profits.?*°
Second, on the effect of one-off events like the Prosser sale or the breakdown of Telemedia’s

relationship with the new government, Dr. Hern notes:

‘The Claimant’ s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 286(e).

Hearing Tr. 678:17 to 679:25.

Page 98 of 132

An investor would look at, in my view, the history of revenues taking account of the full
context, of which a very important part is the political environment in which the company
operates. You know, when you say one-off, it’s one-off in a sense that this was Prosser. It’s
one-off in a sense that this was this particular change of Government. But it’s not one-off in
the sense that thi an adverse event or an event that can affect a company’s performance.
It’s that kind of event that I am certain is taken into account by investors when they think
about valuations.?*7

   

255. Third, on the selection of the EBIT margin, Dr. Hern explains as follows:

My EBIT margin assumption of 35% is calculated as the average EBIT margin of the five
prior forecast years, from 2009/10 to 2013/14.

[L.]

Since the EBIT margin is used to calculate the cash flows resulting from the company in its
long-run steady state, the margin should not be based on temporary EBIT fluctuations or the
business cycle. I use the five-year average to capture the underlying steady state of the
company. PwC on the other hand suggests I should project the current trend forwards, which
would bias the CV based on the temporary trend from previous years.

The five years of data in the explicit forecast period characterises the trend in the business
cycle. By taking the average, I assume that the business cycle repeats itself in perpetuity,
which is a more realistic assumption than assuming that the 2014 margin applies continuously
into perpetuity. Evidently, there are recessions (2009) and periods of recovery (2010 to 2014)
and by taking an average we assume that this pattern of a business cycle also holds true into
the future.

  

I prefer a more prudent approach by taking the average of the five previous cash flows. This
reflects the uncertainty around how cash flows may develop from 2015 onwards. [.. ./25*

256. Fourth, with respect to the relationship between revenue growth and capital expenditure, Dr. Hern

responds as follows:

. By presenting the relationship between average revenue growth and average capex
growth for 162 telecoms operators, PwC only considers the mean, and does not
consider the range. There is significant variation in the relationship between capex
and revenue across companies, and PwC fails to consider where in the distribution
Telemedia, which faces Belize-specific conditions, would fall.

. Even if Telemedia is close to the mean of these comparators, PwC’s chart shows that
low revenue growth was associated with high capex growth in the years 2010-12.
Therefore, PwC’s evidence supports my forecast of low revenue growth and high
capex growth.

. Telemedia’s business plan confirms this as the management has noted that it aim[s]
to increase capex to stimulate revenues when revenue growth is low. This motivation
is consistent with my forecast of low revenue growth and high capex.?*
Dr. Hern further notes that “[o]ur analysis of Telemedia’s financial statements from 2004 to 2009
confirms the view that capital expenditure bears little relation with concurrent revenue
generation” and that “following the economic crisis, interest rates have been lowered to stimulate

economic activity. With lower interest rates, the critical internal rate of return that Telemedia

investment projects must attain decreased, potentially driving up the number of projects that are

profitable, in net present value terms.””°

Fifth, Dr. Hern explains his effective tax rate calculation by noting that the share of Telemedia’s
revenue taxed at 1.75 percent was effectively constant between FY 2004/2005 and FY 2008/2009,
supporting the application of a constant rate thereafter.™' Dr. Hern also notes that the calculation

of the implied share of Telemedia’s revenue taxed at different levels is necessary because actual

revenue share data is not available.

Sixth, on the selection of data sets to measure the effects of the financial crisis, Dr. Hern explains

the reliance on September 2009 data as follows:

I think the reality is that an investor would have at least had the August data. So, when my
attention was drawn to that, I felt there was no real good reason to adjust my valuation. I'd
used one month one side. This data was published one month the other side. The average
would have been in the middle. You know, I felt that a rational investor -- I felt it was a
reasonable assumption.29

Dr. Hern further explains the use of October 2010 data to measure the rate of recovery from the

crisis in the following terms:

we did the valuation in October 2010. At that time the data that was available on GDP growth
in Belize was in the October 2010 tab, which was 0 per cent. And we said, OK -- we asked
the question what would an investor have assumed in 2009 about GDP growth rate in that
year in August. I understood this data was not published at that time, but I felt it was
reasonable that -- basically I'm making a rational investor’s assumption here which is that
it’s quite reasonable that an investor could have predicted that the Belize economy over that
period would have achieved, in fact, 0, which it did achieve, even though the data that was
published by the IMF didn’t predict it. You have to bear in mind here that the IMF is just one
source of predictions about GDP growth. The other source was the Belize Central Bank
which didn’t at the time publish retrospective data so we couldn’t go back and ask what did
they view when standing in the middle of 2009. The World Bank at the time had published a
report in January 2010 saying that they expected GDP growth to be negative in a year in
2009, so there were different sources available. This is one source. The IMF is one source of
forecast. We felt it was better to use what actually happened on the basis that an investor
would have considered a variety of data. What actually happened was Belize GDP was 0 per
cent in that year and we thought it was a reasonable assumption that an investor would also
have made that assumption. Even, you know, as I say, there were different sources available
that showed different numbers.”+

The Tribunal’s Considerations

Having considered the assumptions underlying the Respondent’s DCF model, the Tribunal agrees
with the Respondent’s reasoning in significant part. In particular, the Tribunal accepts the
Respondent’s reliance on a five-year forecast of annual cash flow. This is a necessary
consequence of basing the valuation, as the Tribunal prefers to do, on the Telemedia Business
Plan and its five-year period of forecasts. The Tribunal recognizes that the Respondent’s
continuing value calculation is necessarily an approximation, but notes that such approximation
could potentially overstate, as well as understate, the actual results that Telemedia would have
achieved in the “but for” scenario represented by the forecast. The Tribunal considers this
approximation to be unavoidable. It is of the view that the Claimant’s effort to model particular

growth patterns beyond the five-year period of the Business Plan is unduly speculative.

The Tribunal is also persuaded by the Respondent’s explanations regarding Telemedia’s historical
underperformance of its Business Plan and the use of the Plan as an upper bound, the use of an
average EBIT margin for the calculation of continuing value, the link between Telemedia’s
revenue growth and capital expenditure, and the projection of a constant effective tax rate across

the forecast period.

The Tribunal disagrees, however, with the Respondent’s use of data that were not available on
the valuation date to model the effects of the financial crisis on Telemedia’s revenue forecasts.
The Tribunal recognizes that the comparable data then available (actual company results from
30 July 2009 and IMF forecasts of GDP growth from April 2009)™° may also misrepresent the
overall perception of Telemedia’s value by a willing buyer, in particular with respect to the state
of the Belize economy, which may have shifted between April and August 2009. The Tribunal is
not satisfied, however, that the general impressions of a potential buyer on 25 August 2009 that
the Belize economy was performing worse than any published prediction available at that date
provides sufficient reason to substitute actual GDP data that would only be available well after
the valuation date. Faced with the fact that any data that the Tribunal may select will necessarily
only approximate the situation on the valuation date, the Tribunal prefers to restrict itself to data
actually available on 25 August 2009. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent’s method, but
will re-run the Respondent's financial crisis calculations using the earlier data from April and July

2009.

The Tribunal notes the Claimant’s argument (see paragraph 251 above) that the Respondent’s
value for Telemedia is unreasonable on its face in light of various metrics. The Tribunal will
return to this point after having adjusted the Respondent’s calculations to correspond with its own

assumptions.

(c) The Appropriateness of Valuing Synergies
The Claimant's Position

The Claimant notes that “Mr Macpherson takes into account interest from more than one potential
buyer, the potential of improving upon existing performance and includes the value of synergies
in his valuation.”*“° In the Claimant’s view, it is appropriate and accepted practice to include value
for synergies where “there was a reasonable probability as of 25 August 2009 that Telemedia

would be sold to a capable third party—a telecoms sector buyer.”**” Reviewing the record, the
Claimant concludes that “sustained interest from Cable & Wireless, Digicel, and Atlantic
Telenetworks demonstrates that there is clearly a reasonable probability that Telemedia would

have been sold to a telecoms sector buyer.”*“* This “population of willing telecoms buyers” would
have, according to the Claimant, “created competitive tension and would have forced potential
buyers to pay for synergies.” The Claimant’s expert, Mr. Macpherson, ascribes a value of
BZ$0.74 per share to synergies.”
Ultimately, the Claimant considers its valuation of potential synergies to be conservative.
Mr. Macpherson emphasized that he had included value only for cost synergies and not for
potential revenue synergies.*! As summarized by Mr. Macpherson, such synergies should be
achievable irrespective of the market in which a company operates:

Every telco buys the same types of plant and equipment assets, and they buy them broadly

from the same constituency of international product vendors. I did not have any revenue

synergies in my number. I had a capex synergy which went to bulk buying of assets which

would have to be bought by an operator in a poorer market and in a larger market, and I had

efficiencies savings due to economies of scale and scope at the management layer and at the
operational layer. Neither of those has anything to do with the richness of the market.”

According to the Claimant, the resulting figure was below the level actually achieved by Cable &
Wireless in its prior acquisition of the Bahamas Telecommunications Company and the forecasted

synergies underpinning Cable & Wireless’ January 2008 offer for Telemedia.?*

The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that Mr. Macpherson was incorrect to include synergies in his valuation,
as there was “insufficient evidence to show the buyer would be a telecoms operator, in which case
financial theory does not support the inclusion of synergies in the FMV.”?**

According to the Respondent’s Expert, Dr. Hern, “it is an established principle of valuation that
synergies should not normally be included in a Fair Market Valuation since they represent a
source of value to only one category of investor, rather than the generalised class of investor.” As
such, “including synergies . . . is .. . only justified in fairly unique situations, namely that we have
very strong evidence of competitive interest by competing potential acquirers that are prepared to

pay for the full cost of those synergies or full value of those synergies.”?°°

Dr. Hern does not consider the Claimant to have established that Telemedia would have been
acquired by a telecommunications operator capable of generating synergies and notes that the
valuation date falls in August 2009, at the height of the financial crisis, during a period in which
there were few other transactions. Dr. Hern also notes that an “analysis of mergers and
acquisitions in Central America and the Caribbean in the past decade shows there have been a
number of acquisitions in the Latin America and Caribbean region in the recent past involving a
takeover of a telecoms company by a nonstrategic buyer.” Finally, Dr. Hern notes, ““a buyer would
be able to extract value from synergies by buying an asset without a premium for synergies,
particularly in illiquid markets.” Because “[t]he market in the Belize environment is relatively
illiquid with a high country risk premium .. . the valuation of synergies is irrelevant for

determining the FMV of Telemedia.”?*”

Page 103 of 132

The Tribunal’s Considerations

The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent concerning the appropriateness of valuing synergies.
The Tribunal would consider the inclusion of synergies to be appropriate only in the event that a
specific telecommunications buyer, able to realize synergies from the purchase, could be
identified and that sufficient competition among potential telecoms buyers could be identified to

force the purchaser to pay for such synergies.

Accordingly, the mere existence of other telecommunications companies in the Caribbean with a

regional expansion policy falls short of this threshold.

(d)  Cross-checks to the DCF analysis

i Overall approach

The Claimant's Position

According to the Claimant’s Expert, Mr. Macpherson, it is “an important part of any valuation to
identify if there is external evidence which can be used to corroborate the evaluation from a DCF
approach.”?°* In his view, “valuation best practice is to use multiple valuation approaches
wherever possible and to consider all relevant available information.” Accordingly,
Mr. Macpherson sought to confirm the results of his DCF calculation by examining (a) the 15
January 2008 offer by Cable & Wireless for 100 percent of Telemedia; (b) the valuation of BZ$6
per share made by the Government in October 2010 in connection with Telemedia’s share
offering; (c) a multiples valuation of nine comparable publicly traded companies; and (d) a

multiples valuation of the market value of three comparable transactions.

Mr. Macpherson considers that the Respondent’s sole reliance on DCF departs from valuation
best practices for unlisted businesses, and “ignores the fact that, when available, market
approaches, not DCF, are generally acknowledged to provide the best evidence of market value”,

and dismisses relevant evidence.

Page 104 of 132

The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent’s expert, Dr. Hern, submits that “using one valuation technique is appropriate if
there is no reliable market evidence” and notes that both Parties have advanced DCF analyses.”*!
Dr. Hern concludes that the “C&W offer cannot be used with any reasonable degree of accuracy
given it was made prior to the change of Government and the start of the financial crisis” and was
“withdrawn following the change of Government”.? Dr. Hern also concludes that “there is no

suitable multiple-based evidence to fully cross-check the DCF methodology results.”?°

Dr. Hern emphasizes, however, that he did not undertake a DCF analysis without cross-checks.
Rather:

The cross checks were significant, but they were within the DCF model, so the cross checks

were to look at the reasonableness of the fair market valuation based on projections against

the historic trends or revenues and costs and what they would have produced if an investor
had placed more emphasis on that data rather than the business plan.?

The Tribunal’s Considerations

As a matter of principle, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that the use of cross-checks
represents a best practice in the conduct of valuation. However, such cross-checks require that
genuinely comparable variables are, in fact, available. The Tribunal will address the specific
cross-checks proposed by the Claimant in turn. Before doing so, however, the Tribunal notes that
the Respondent is correct regarding the use of internal cross-checks within its expert’s DCF
calculation, which compare the adjusted forecast for Telemedia’s revenues and costs to the time

trend of Telemedia’s historic results.

ii. The January 2008 offer from Cable & Wireless

The Claimant's Position

The Claimant’s expert, Mr. Macpherson, considers the January 2008 offer from Cable & Wireless
to be “[o]ne of the most important pieces of information” insofar as it was an arms-length offer,

conducted after significant due diligence, with an evaluation of potential synergies, at a time when

the Accommodation Agreement was still in effect.°> Mr. Macpherson then looked at the change
in Telemedia’s earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”)
between January 2008 and August 2009 to reach a lower value on the valuation date, reflecting
the effect of the financial crisis and Government actions prior to that date.”° This calculation
produces an estimated value at August 2009 of BZ$10.18 per share, which the Claimant considers

to compare favourably with the result of BZ$10.23 reached through its expert’s DCF analysis.?””

The Claimant acknowledges that the Cable & Wireless offer did not close, for reasons that are not
in the record, but argues that this does “not render the Cable & Wireless offer ‘meaningless’”.?*
The Claimant notes in particular that the Cable & Wireless offer was made after substantial due
diligence and is simply being used as a cross-check, rather than as the basis for the Claimant’s
valuation.” According to the Claimant, “[{t]hat the adjusted Cable & Wireless offer is so similar
to the results of PwC’s independently-produced DCF analysis is strong evidence that PwC’s
assumptions align closely with those made by a real-world arm’s length willing buyer.”?”
Mr. Macpherson also notes that the 23 percent downward adjustment of Cable & Wireless’ actual
offer (based on changes in Telemedia’s EBITDA) aligns closely with the 20 percent downward

adjustment posited by the Respondent’ s expert.?”!

The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that Cable & Wireless withdrew its offer, rendering any conclusions
drawn from the offer “no more than speculation”.”” In the Respondent’s view, “[nJot knowing
why C&W chose not to pursue the transaction makes it inappropriate to rely on its non-binding

numbers to value Telemedia nineteen months later.”?”3

The Tribunal’s Considerations

The Tribunal considers that the offer from Cable & Wireless was just that: simply an offer. The
Tribunal does not know what information prompted Cable & Wireless to withdraw its offer for
Telemedia or how that information might have impacted Cable & Wireless’ valuation of the
company had it nevertheless sought to go ahead with the deal. Without more details as to why
Cable & Wireless chose not to proceed with the deal, the Tribunal considers it inappropriate to

draw inferences from the offer.

tii. | The October 2010 Telemedia share offering

The Claimant's Position

The Claimant’s expert, Mr. Macpherson, considers a further comparison in the form of the
October 2010 issue of 44 percent of Telemedia’s shares by the Government at a price of BZ$5
per share (based on a valuation of BZ$6 per share and a BZ$1 discount).*” Using an Enterprise
Value/EBITDA (“EV/EBITDA”) analysis, as with Cable & Wireless’ offer, Mr. Macpherson
posits an equivalent value at August 2009 of BZ$7.34 per share.”> Mr. Macpherson recalls that
the Government’s valuation necessarily excluded the Accommodation Agreement, which the
Government considered illegal, and lacked any value for synergies, insofar as it was a public
offering. Stripped of the value of the Accommodation Agreement and synergies, Mr. Macpherson

6

notes that his DCF analysis produced a value of BZ$6.39 per share,’ which the Claimant

considers to compare favourably to the Government’s valuation.2””

Considering the Respondent’s arguments, the Claimant concedes that the October 2010 share
offering is not a perfect comparator, insofar as “[i]t doesn’t include any control premium; it
doesn’t attribute the values of Accommodation Agreement to synergies; and . . . only something
like 70 per cent of the shares on offer actually were sold in that sort of IPO.” Nevertheless, the
Claimant considers the October 2010 share offering to be incompatible with the Respondent’s
DCF value of BZ$1.44 per share.””” The Claimant notes that the Respondent's attempt to reconcile

these two valuations assumes that certain favourable tax changes that were planned, but not yet

approved in October 2010, were fully reflected in the offer price.’*° The Claimant also notes that,
even adjusted to August 2009, the October 2010 value is likely low, insofar as the Belizean public,
to whom the shares were offered, lacked the purchasing power of a buyer in the
telecommunications industry and “given the ongoing constitutionality litigation, the public may

have also been concerned about the Government’s title to the shares.””*!

The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that the Claimant is incorrect to place weight on the 2010 Telemedia share
offering, on the grounds that it occurred 14 months after the valuation date and “was not the
market-clearing price and not indicative of the [fair market value] as of the valuation date.”?*?

Reviewing the Claimant’s comparison, the Respondent’s expert, Dr. Hern, notes that the 2010
share offering was premised on the basis that Telemedia’s loan debt to British Caribbean Bank
was invalid and need not be valued (in contrast to the Respondent’s DCF assumptions following
the award in the British Caribbean Bank Proceedings). According to Dr. Hern, invalidating the
loan debt to make the comparison effective would raise his own valuation by 90 cents to BZ$2.34

283

per share.** Furthermore, Dr. Hern argues:

A bigger difference is the change in the tax rate that was announced around the time of the

Belize offer, including a reduction in the rate of tax on revenues I think from 24.5 to 19 and

a removal of tax on dividends. So when I tried to compare what difference that would make

to my valuation, I think that increases my valuation up by about 67 per cent, so you move

from 2.44 up to around $4.2
Dr. Hern suggests that any remaining difference can be explained by the fact that the Government
was to remain the majority shareholder and could, accordingly, “control to some extent risks of
competition or risks of bankruptcy”.”*° Ultimately, Dr. Hern concludes that “the valuation of $5
at the time, notwithstanding the fact it wasn’t a market clearing price, actually reconciles fairly

well with my $1.44.”8°

Page 108 of 132

The Tribunal’s Considerations

In the Tribunal’s view, a public share offering such as the October 2010 issue may serve as a
relevant point of comparison. Ultimately, however, the most important fact is that the share
offering occurred 14 months after the valuation date. Both Parties have identified certain factors—
including concerns about constitutionality, the protection offered by Government involvement,
synergies, control premium, the exclusion of the BCB loan debt, and promised changes to the
applicable tax rate—to explain the difference between this amount and their own calculations of
the value of Telemedia on the valuation date. For the Tribunal, the net effect of these competing
narratives is merely to highlight the uncertainty inherent in attempting to project the market value
of a company from one point in time to another in significantly differing circumstances. The
October 2010 share offering is therefore a relevant point of information, but the valuation date

prevails.

iv. Comparable companies

The Claimant's Position

The Claimant’s expert, Mr. Macpherson, carried out a further cross-check by comparing his DCF
analysis of Telemedia with nine publicly traded telecommunications companies™’ that he
considered comparable in terms of services offered and GDP of the country of operations.
Mr. Macpherson corrected these calculations with updated data during the hearing to produce a
range of EV/EBITDA multiples from 3.29 to 7.4. Applying the average of that range to
Telemedia’s EBITDA as at August 2009 produces a per-share value of BZ$6.89, which the
Claimant considers to compare favourably to its expert’s DCF valuation (excluding the

Accommodation Agreement and synergies) of BZ$6.39 per share.

Considering the Respondent’s criticism of this approach, Mr. Macpherson notes that he does not
consider the spread of EV/EBITDA values to be “a surprising or large range for this kind of
analysis”.’** The Claimant also argues that the Respondent’s criticism that these companies were
subject to varying levels of country risk is undercut by the Respondent relying on country risk

data from 2014—long after the valuation date.*? The Claimant notes that the Respondent’s own

expert’s country risk figures for Belize in 2009 are significantly closer to the average of the nine

comparators.”

The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent’s expert, Dr. Hern, rejects the use of a valuation multiples approach for the

following reasons:

Principally it’s because, having worked in Belize, having understood the Belize local context,
having understood the risks that investors face in Belize, for a variety of reasons I just don’t
think it’s right to take companies in other markets that are very different and use those as an
appropriate basis for valuation.

[L.]

Whilst I might accept in principle that a telecom company in essence does the same thing in
terms of mobile, fixed and internet data, what it doesn’t do is operate in the same environment
with similar population, with similar demographics between urban and rural areas, with
similar country risk, with similar regulation. Implicit in all of these different valuations are a
multitude of differences about the operating environments in which these companies work.”?!

 

 

Even narrowed by the corrected data, Dr. Hern submits that there remains “a very wide range in

the context of the multiples analysis,” as a result of dissimilar assets.”

The Respondent also criticizes the Claimant’s multiples approach on the grounds that it neglects

the significantly higher country risk profile applicable to Belize.”

According to Dr. Hern, “when
you’re looking at multiples, if you don’t control for country risk differences, then you’ re missing
a big factor that explains those multiples. . . . the PwC multiples are highly misleading because of
these differences”.* Dr. Hern also asserts that the Claimant is incorrect that 2009 country risk
data would lead to a lower number as the two figures are derived from different baselines and are,

accordingly, not comparable.”

The Tribunal’s Considerations

In principle, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that a cross-check with comparable companies
on the basis of earnings multiples is a valuable exercise. The value of such an exercise, however,

is predicated on the existence of publicly traded companies that are genuinely comparable. In this

respect, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that no such comparable companies are
available. The nine companies identified by the Claimant’s expert Mr. Macpherson operate in a

range of markets that differ materially from the circumstances prevailing in Belize.

The Tribunal does not believe that an earnings multiple comparison can provide meaningful

results when stretched across such a range of markets, companies, and circumstances.

Vv. Comparable transactions

The Claimant's Position

The Claimant’s expert, Mr. Macpherson, carried out a third cross-check by comparing his DCF
analysis of Telemedia with three comparable transactions (narrowed from a broader list in
response to criticism from the Respondent). These three transactions featured EV/EBITDA
multiples ranging from 5.48 to 6.56. Applying the average of that range to Telemedia’s EBITDA
as at August 2009 produces a per-share value of BZ$8.39 per share.’ The Claimant notes that
these transactions likely included some value for synergies, such that the appropriate comparison
would be with Mr. Macpherson’s DCF valuation of Telemedia with synergies (but without the

Accommodation Agreement) at BZ$7.13 per share.?°*

The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent objects to the use of multiples in the Claimant’s comparable transactions cross-
check for broadly the same reasons that its objects to their use in the comparable companies

context.

The Tribunal’s Considerations

As with the Claimant’s comparable companies exercise, the Tribunal does not believe that
comparators exist to permit this analysis to produce meaningful results. To the afore-mentioned
difficulties in selecting comparators across a range of countries and market environments, the
Claimant’s comparable transactions exercise adds the complexity of comparing transactions that
occurred at widely varying points in time. The Tribunal also notes that the exercise includes a

comparison with the 2003 sale of Belize Telemedia Ltd. to Mr. Prosser, which the Claimant’s

expert concedes was not an arms-length transaction. Accordingly, the Tribunal declines to give

weight to the Claimant’s comparable transactions analysis.

(e) The Tribunal’s valuation of Telemedia

On the basis of the foregoing conclusions, the Tribunal calculates the value of Telemedia as

follows. The Tribunal’s calculations are derived from those set out in the Respondent’s expert

report, but updated to reflect the Tribunal’s decisions.

The Tribunal has considered whether Telemedia’s revenue projections should be adjusted to

model the effect of the Accommodation Agreement’s ban on the use of VoIP. Having reviewed

Telemedia’s Business Plan, the Tribunal notes the inclusion of statements such as the following:

3.2 Major Project Initiatives

The following key projects shall be undertaken and completed during the year in order to
achieve the objectives that have been set out:

[

 

5. Continue the expansion of company’s VoIP and VoIP management solution (includes
the Cisco Security Engine, the Bitek solution, an additional method for dealing with
VPNs, and the WebTalk product). Other platforms to be investigated / utilised,
including the new Nortel softswitch;*"!

Page 113 of 132

And also the following:

[. . .] Telemedia recently installed a Cisco solution to better manage the VoIP illegal traffic.
This, coupled with the original Bitek solution, is working to ensure that VoIP is difficult to
use. There does need to be a continued effort to manage this traffic effectively and to limit
the revenue loss.

Telemedia does allow some customers to utilise third party VoIP providers in some cases,
however those customers are required to pay for their internet at a higher rate, and to agree
to additional controls to ensure that the VoIP is used by the customer only, and not by
additional users.

As we look forward, Telemedia’s best line of defence will be the continued bundling of
services, including international and domestic minutes for fixed prices, internet services,
substantial increases in off-peak (low capacity utilisation) low cost / free services
customers, so that the marginal benefits for customers buying third party product:
substantially reduced.*°”

  

Taken together, the Tribunal considers these statements to indicate that Telemedia was already
largely successful in restricting competition from VoIP, even without the Accommodation
Agreement, and that the projections in the Business Plan do not reflect significant losses to VoIP
competition. In any event, the Tribunal also considers that it does not have the information before
it to reasonably model Telemedia’s losses to VoIP competition and is of the view that the
approach taken in the Accommodation Agreement Award cannot be adapted to a later time or
extended over a longer period without producing results that are unduly speculative (a point also
acknowledged by the Claimant’s expert*”’). For both reasons, the Tribunal declines to adjust

Telemedia’ s revenue projections to reflect the Accommodation Agreement’s ban on VoIP.

The Tribunal thus reaches the following adjusted forecasts for Telemedia’s revenue through FY
2013/2014, which are paired with Telemedia’s actual cost and depreciation forecasts to produce

projected EBIT values:

Telemedia’s revenue for FY 2014/2015 for the purpose of calculating a continuing value is
projected using a 3 percent growth rate, and its EBIT for that year is calculated using an average

of Telemedia’s EBIT margin across the preceding five years:

taxed at the 1.75 percent business tax rate. To model the effect of the Accommodation Agreement
on Telemedia’s tax rate, the Tribunal applies a 25 percent income tax on the remaining 78.66
percent of Telemedia’s revenue. The Tribunal applies this tax to Telemedia’s projected EBIT,
thereby assuming that costs and depreciation are divided equally between revenue subject to a
1.75 percent business tax and revenue subject to the Accommodation Agreement’s altered
arrangements. The Tribunal understands that interest charges are not tax-deductible in Belize and

has made no adjustment to account for Telemedia’s interest costs:

The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that Telemedia’s Business Plan includes no reference
to import duties. Therefore, it declines to adjust the capital expenditure projections to account for
the Accommodation Agreement’s waiver of import duty. As the Tribunal accepts the
Respondent’s view that Telemedia’s capital expenditure projections should be used without
adjustment on the basis of revised revenue forecasts, the capital expenditure projections from

Telemedia’s Business Plan are then added to produce the following free cash flow projections:

The Tribunal has reviewed the Respondent’s calculation of Telemedia’s cost of capital and

understands that the gearing used already reflects the assumption that the BZ$45 million loan debt

to British Caribbean Bank was valid. Accordingly, the Tribunal has made no adjustment to

In order to reflect the Tribunal’s view that cash flow associated with the Accommodation
Agreement should be subject to a supplemental discount, the Tribunal calculates Telemedia’s
operating value both with and without the Accommodation Agreement and discounts the
operating value associated with the Accommodation Agreement by five percent to reflect the
agreement’s status as an un-arbitrated contingent claim. The Tribunal also removes the amount
of tax adjustment associated with unpaid taxes on dividends to reflect the Accommodation
Agreement’s waiver of such taxes (see paragraph 117 above at para. 6.1(v)) and adds an amount
for historic breaches, based on the Claimant’s calculation. Both such values are subject to the
supplemental discount for the Accommodation Agreement. The resulting per-share value of

Telemedia is then as follows:

Recalling the Claimant’s argument that the Respondent’s calculation produced facially
unreasonable results (see paragraph 251 above), the Tribunal notes that it considers the value

reached through it adjusted calculations to be reasonable in light of all the circumstances.
The Tribunal accepts that Dunkeld’s interest in Telemedia at the valuation date was as follows:

PCA Case N° 2010-13

Page 117 of 132

The Tribunal understands, on the basis of Telemedia’s 31 March 2009 Director’s Report*** that
there were 49,551,652 issued shares of Telemedia. Further to the Tribunal’s invitation to the
Parties’ experts to review the Tribunal’s calculations, the Claimant noted that the Tribunal’s use
of this figure to calculate the per-share value of Telemedia did not include 1,648,676 shares in
Telemedia held by Telemedia’s subsidiaries BTL (Overseas) Limited, BTL International Inc.,
BTL Investments Limited, and Telemedia Investments Limited. The Claimant argued that

The calculation for Shares Outstanding requires the deduction of the number of Treasury

Shares held by Telemedia from the number of Shares Issued. This is because those Treasury

Shares were shares in Telemedia acquired by the subsidiaries of Telemedia. As a

consequence of the fact that those shares are owned by the company, they are excluded from.

the shares which have an ownership stake in the company; namely the Shareholders

Equity.2°
The Tribunal recalls that the treatment of shares of Telemedia held by a subsidiary of the company
was the subject of consideration in British Caribbean Bank v. Belize and that the award in that
matter held that “as the capital of the subsidiary is distinct from the capital of the parent, . . . the
acquisition by a subsidiary of shares in its parent does not amount to a reduction of the share
capital of the parent.”*°’ Because the acquisition of the shares by its subsidiaries did not reduce
the share capital of Telemedia, the Tribunal considers that the shares held by Telemedia’s
subsidiaries should be regarded as distinct from the unissued shares of the company for which no
capital had been paid in. The shares held by Telemedia’s subsidiaries were, rather, assets of those
subsidiaries, which were either acquired by the Government directly (in the case of the shares
held by BTL International Inc. and BTL Investments Limited, see paragraph 135 above) or
constructively through the acquisition of Telemedia itself (in the case of the shares held by BTL
(Overseas) Limited and Telemedia Investments Limited). As a matter of consolidated accounting,
however, the value of such assets is reflected in their treatment as treasury shares in Telemedia’s
consolidated financial statements and their deduction from the shares outstanding for the purposes
of calculating earnings per share. The Tribunal thus agrees with the Claimant regarding the effect
of shareholdings by Telemedia’s subsidiaries on the number of shares outstanding for the
purposes of valuing Telemedia and considers that this is consistent with the treatment of shares

held by subsidiaries in British Caribbean Bank v. Belize.

The Tribunal also notes the Respondent’s objection that the Claimant’s comments on this point
exceeded the Parties’ undertaking to “limit their comments to the accuracy of the Tribunal’s

calculations and not to seek to re-litigate any points of substance decided by the Tribunal.” The

Consolidated Financial Statements for Belize Telemedia Limited for the Year Ending March 2009,

Page 118 of 132

Tribunal disagrees and considers that the calculation of Dunkeld’s interest in Telemedia was part
of the calculations on which the Tribunal sought the Parties’ comments. The draft valuation
provided for the Parties’ comments did not reflect any decision on the treatment of shares held by
subsidiaries, and the Tribunal considers that to neglect such shareholdings would be to distort the

value of Telemedia.

Based on that figure, the Tribunal calculates Dunkeld’s percentage interest in Telemedia as

follows:

 

Company Shares _ Percentage Share
ECOM Ltd. 10,841,778
3,200,879
1,135,831

Subtotal held through ECOM Ltd.: 15,178,488 31.69%

Total: 34,107,117 71.20%

Applying Dunkeld’s interest to Telemedia’s equity value at 25 August 2009, the Tribunal
calculates the value of Dunkeld’s interest at BZ$ 192,867,186, of which BZ$ 115,530,419 is

attributable to the Accommodation Agreement.

The Claimant points out that Article 5 of the Treaty specifies that compensation shall be
“effectively realisable and be freely transferable.” The Claimant notes that, as indicated in

Mr. Macpherson’s expert report, the International Monetary Fund lists the United States dollar as

being a freely transferable currency, but not the Belizean dollar. For this reason, “Dunkeld

therefore seeks payment of damages in dollars.”*°*

The Claimant also rejects the Respondent’s argument that Belize law requires damages to be paid
in Belizean dollars. The Claimant recalls the observation in Petrobart Limited v. Kyrgyz Republic
that a “state cannot invoke its municipal law as a reason for not fulfilling its international
obligations”>” and submits that the Respondent “is, once again, conflating its domestic law rules

with its international law obligations.”3!

The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent contends that Belizean exchange control laws require that damages must be in

Belizean dollars, unless the Belizean Controller gives “express permission.”*!!

The Tribunal’s Considerations

Although the Parties’ arguments concerning the currency of damages appear to fall within the
Remaining Issues for Tribunal decision, the Tribunal notes that paragraphs 4.3 and 4.5 of the
Parties’ Settlement Agreement address the currency of payments pursuant to this Award. The

Tribunal considers that the Settlement Agreement accordingly resolves the issue of currency.

To the extent that any aspect of the question of currency is not resolved by the Settlement
Agreement, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant regarding the currency of damages and
translates its calculation of Telemedia’s value to U.S. dollars using the average inter-bank rate for
the sale of Belize dollars on 25 August 2009 of 1.98965 Belize dollars to the U.S. dollar. On this
basis, the Tribunal calculates the value of Dunkeld’s interest at US$96,935,233, of which
US$58,065,699 is attributable to the Accommodation Agreement.

5. Interest
The Claimant's Position

The Claimant “seeks interest at the weighted average annual rate for fixed term deposits over one
year paid by commercial banks in Belize, compounded quarterly, with interest to run from
25 August 2009 when compensation should have been paid, until the obligation to pay is
fulfilled.”3!?

The Claimant notes that Article 5(1) of the Treaty provides that compensation “‘shall include

interest at the rate prescribed by law until the date of payment,’” though the Treaty does not
indicate which law applies and Belize law generally gives the courts broad discretion in awarding
interest.*'> The Claimant notes, however, that Section 68(1) of the 2009 Act provides that interest

be calculated by “‘the rate paid by commercial banks in Belize on fixed deposits at the date of

acquisition.””*'* According to the Claimant, this rate was 8.34 percent on 25 August 2009.7!

Citing various cases, including Middle East Cement Shipping and Handling Co. S.A. v. Arab

Republic of Egypt,*'® the Claimant argues that “[i]t has become common practice for investment

treaty tribunals to award compound interest in expropriation cases on the basis that it best reflects
the commercial return that an investor would expect to receive on its money.”*"”

Regarding the Respondent’s view that Dunkeld is not entitled to interest because the Companies
have submitted claims to the Government, the Claimant argues that “[t]he Government cites no

legal authority for this assertion.”>"*

The Respondent’s Position

326. The Respondent contends that “Dunkeld is not entitled to any interest” because the Companies

have submitted claims to the Government.*!? The Respondent further argues that:

If the Tribunal makes an award of damages, it should not award interest for the entire time
period because much—f not all—of the delay is attributable to Dunkeld’s litigation strategy.
GOB made offers of compensation to the registered shareholders; ultimately, it is they, and
not Dunkeld, who are entitled to compensation.*””

 

The Tribunal’s Considerations

327. The Tribunal recalls that in its written pleadings, the Respondent did not contest the rate of interest
requested by the Claimant. When the Respondent sought to do so during the hearing, the Tribunal
ruled that “the matters raised in the e-mail of the Respondent of [8 April 2015] are raised too late.
They should have been raised earlier. We have to proceed on the basis of what is in the
submissions, the two exchanges and here at the hearing.”*?! The Tribunal stands by this decision
and does not see that the extended nature of these proceedings can be attributed to the Claimant,

such that it would affect the justification for an award of interest.

328. Accordingly, between 25 August 2009, the date of the expropriation, and the date of this Award,
the Tribunal will follow section 68 of the Belize Telecommunications (Amendment) Act 2009,
which provided as follows:

(1) The Court, in awarding compensation, may add interest thereto and shall be guided
by the rate paid by commercial banks in Belize on fixed deposits at the date of

acquisition; so, however, that reasonable compensation shall be paid to the claimant
having regard to all the circumstances.

 

(2) The interest under subsection (1) above may be added for the whole or any part of the
period between the date of acquisition of the property and the date of the payment of
the compensation awarded by the Court.

329. The Tribunal accepts Claimant’s evidence that the rate of the weighted average annual rate for
fixed term deposits of over one year in duration paid by commercial banks in Belize as at
25 August 2009 was 8.34 percent. Applying that rate, compounded quarterly and taking account
of the Respondent’s payment on 22 September 2015 of $24,557,124 pursuant to the Parties’
settlement agreement, the Tribunal calculates the interest due from 25 August 2009 to 28 June
2016 at US $72,017,410, of which US $44,099,684 is linked to the value of the Accommodation

Agreement.

From the date of this Award, the Tribunal considers that its discretion with respect to the rate of
interest is circumscribed by Article 5(1) of the Treaty, which provides that compensation for
expropriation “shall include interest at the rate prescribed by law until the date of payment”.
Accordingly, the Tribunal determines that from the date of this Award until the date of payment,
the interest payable on all outstanding amounts shall be at a rate of 8.34 percent, compounded

quarterly.

WHETHER THE CLAIMANT IS ENTITLED TO RECOVER THE COSTS OF THE DUNKELD II
PROCEEDINGS AND PROCEEDINGS IN THE BELIZE COURTS

The Claimant's Position

The Claimant seeks compensation for legal and other costs spent on the Dunkeld II Proceedings,
since it “was a necessary response to the measures taken by the Government to prevent Dunkeld
from pursuing this arbitration.”*”? The Claimant also seeks costs, including the legal fees of Allen
& Overy LLP and Courtenay Coye LLP, related to its litigation in Belize courts regarding the
Dunkeld I and Dunkeld II Injunctions.

According to the Claimant, “Dunkeld claims these losses as either flowing from the Government’ s
breach of the agreement to arbitrate set out in Article 8 of the Treaty and/or on the basis that they
were necessary to bring and pursue these proceedings.”*”* The Claimant also notes that some of
these costs were awarded by the Court of Appeal, although Dunkeld has not yet recovered these
costs. The Claimant adds that it “does not seek double recovery” and will alert the Tribunal should

it recover any of these costs before the Tribunal hands down an award.*
The Claimant assesses these costs as follows:

courts regarding the First and Second Injunction = £1,297,314.40°5

(c)  PricewaterhouseCoopers, for costs related to preparing an expert report for the Second

Arbitration = £221,035.00*”

The Respondent’s Position

As confirmed by the Parties’ correspondence of 26 February 2016, the Respondent has conceded
the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to address the costs of the Dunkeld II Proceedings, as well as the costs
associated with Belize court litigation concerning the Dunkeld I and Dunkeld II Injunctions. The
Respondent has also conceded the merits of the Claimants’ claim that the Government’s actions
to restrain Dunkeld from exercising its rights to arbitration constituted a breach of Article 8 of the

Treaty.

The Tribunal’s Considerations

The Tribunal considers that the issue of the costs of related proceedings is effectively determined
by the Parties’ Settlement Agreement. The Tribunal recalls the view expressed in the British
Caribbean Bank Proceedings that “as a general matter, the costs of a proceeding in a particular
forum are most appropriately assessed by that forum”,’* but considers that the present

circumstances differ as a consequence of the Parties’ agreement.

Notwithstanding the Parties’ agreement that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to determine the costs
of ancillary proceedings, the Tribunal would still have discretion pursuant to Article 40(2) of the
UNCITRAL Rules and could, if appropriate, leave the question of costs to the Dunkeld II
Proceedings and to the courts of Belize. However, the Parties’ agreement that the Government’ s
efforts to enjoin the present proceedings constitute a violation of Article 8 of the Treaty—and that
the violation of that provision entails a damages remedy—leads to a different result. In contrast
to Article 5 of the Treaty, Article 8 specifies no particular standard of damages for a breach of the
obligation to arbitrate. The applicable standard in respect of such a breach is accordingly that
existing in customary international law, as set out by the Permanent Court of International Justice

in the Factory at Chorzéw case as follows:

LLP (Exhibit C-223).

PCA Case N° 2010-13
Award
Page 124 of 132

The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act—a principle which
seems to be established by international practice and in particular by the decisions of arbitral
tribunals—is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the
illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that
act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum
corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of
damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in
place of it—such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of
compensation due for an act contrary to international law.*”?

   

In the Tribunal’s view, full reparation for the breach of an agreement to arbitrate—which the
Parties agree has occurred—would necessarily include the costs of domestic court litigation in
respect of the Dunkeld I injunction applicable in these proceedings. These costs would, as a
practical matter, also wholly encompass the costs of the Dunkeld II Injunction insofar as the two
issues were litigated jointly. Additionally, the Tribunal considers that full reparation extends to
other costs caused by the Government’s breach of Article 8, which include the costs of reasonable
efforts to exercise and protect the right to arbitrate through related proceedings such as the

Dunkeld II arbitration.

The Respondent has not contested the amounts claimed in respect of each of these ancillary
proceedings. Whether viewed as a matter of costs or as compensation for the breach of Article 8,
the Tribunal therefore considers that its role is limited to determining whether the amounts
claimed by Dunkeld are reasonable. In this respect, the Tribunal recalls that both injunctions were
intensively litigated in the courts of Belize and that the Dunkeld II Proceedings were on the verge
of a hearing when interrupted by the Dunkeld II Injunction. Under the circumstances, the Tribunal
considers the costs sought by the Claimant to be reasonable and awards the Claimant
£1,518,349.40 for the costs of Allen & Overy and PricewaterhouseCoopers and £136,550.98
(equivalent to BZ$364,789.85 as on 28 June 2016) for the costs of Courtenay Coye LLP.

VI. COSTS

339. The Treaty contains no provisions on the allocation of the costs of arbitration arising out of a
difference or dispute. The provisions regarding the Tribunal’s decision in the matter of costs are
therefore to be found in Articles 38 to 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules. Article 38 of the UNCITRAL
Rules defines the “costs of arbitration” as follows:

The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its award. The term ‘costs’ includes
only:

(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be
fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 39;

(b) The travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;

(c) The costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal;

 

(d) The travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved
by the arbitral tribunal;

(e) The costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party if such costs

were claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and only to the extent that the arbitral
tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;

   

(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the expenses of the
Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.

340. The principle governing the awarding of the costs of arbitration, according to Article 40 of the
UNCITRAL Rules, is that:
(1) — Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne
by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such

costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into
account the circumstances of the case.

 

(2) With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in article
38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the
case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion
such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.

A. COSTS OF ARBITRATION

341. As recorded in the Tribunal’s Order N° |, the Parties agreed that the deposit held by the PCA in
relation to the Dunkeld II proceedings (PCA Case N° 2010-21) would be used in connection with

this arbitration.

342. The Parties deposited with the PCA a total of €830,000.00 (€505,000.00 by the Claimant;
€325,000.00 by the Respondent) to cover the costs of arbitration both in PCA Case N° 2010-21

and this arbitration.

343. The fees and expenses in this arbitration of Mr. John Beechey, the arbitrator appointed by the
Claimant, amount respectively to €59,375.00 and €12,230.07.

The fees and expenses in this arbitration of Mr. Rodrigo Oreamuno, the arbitrator appointed on

behalf of the Respondent, amount respectively to €108,250.00 and €1,299.00.

The fees and expenses in this arbitration of Professor Albert Jan van den Berg, the Presiding

Arbitrator, amount respectively to €236,166.77 and €4,991.39.

Pursuant to the Tribunal’s Order N° 1, the International Bureau of the PCA was designated to act
as Registry in this arbitration. The PCA’s fees for registry services in this arbitration amount to

€84,527.50.

Also pursuant to the Tribunal’s Order N° 1, Ms. Niuscha Bassiri was appointed as Tribunal

Secretary for these proceedings. Ms. Bassiri’s fees in this arbitration amount to €16,974.97.

Other tribunal costs in this arbitration, including court reporters, interpreters, hearing room
equipment, tribunal accommodation, bank charges, and all other expenses relating to the

arbitration proceedings, amount to €88,996.00.

Based on the above figures, the combined tribunal costs in this arbitration, comprising the items

covered in Articles 38(a) to (c) of the UNCITRAL Rules, total €615,269.26.

The Parties’ respective portions of these tribunal costs, amounting to € 307,634.63 for each Party,
shall be deducted from the deposit. Any unexpended balance shall be reserved pending the

resolution of the Dunkeld II proceedings.

In the course of constituting the Tribunal in this arbitration, the fee of the PCA Secretary-General
for the designation of an appointing authority was €750.00. The fee of the appointing authority
for the appointment of an arbitrator on behalf of the Respondent was €1,000.00. These amounts,
comprising the items covered in Article 38(f) of the UNCITRAL Rules, were borne by the

Claimant in the first instance.

Turning to the application of Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal recalls that the
Rules anticipate that costs will be borne by the unsuccessful Party, but that “the arbitral tribunal
may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is
reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.” In the Tribunal’s view the Parties’
settlement agreement is such that neither Party can fairly be called the unsuccessful Party.
Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that the circumstances of the case call for apportionment and
decides that the Parties shall bear the costs of arbitration in equal shares. In light, however, of the
Parties’ unequal contributions to the deposit held by the PCA, the Tribunal effects an equal

apportionment by ordering that the Respondent shall pay to the Claimant the amount of

€67,590.94 (corresponding to the Respondent’s portion of the tribunal costs, borne by the
Claimant in the first instance and half of the fees of the PCA Secretary-General and the appointing

authority, borne by the Claimant in the first instance).

Costs OF LEGAL REPRESENTATION AND ASSISTANCE

The Claimant's Position

The Claimant seeks costs in respect of its legal representation and assistance in the following

 

 

amounts:
Ttem Cost
Allen & Overy LLP Legal Fees: £2,717,964.61
Disbursements: £175,102.38
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Fees: £507,000.00
Courtenay Coye LLP Legal Fees: BZ$224,433.75
Witness Travel and Accommodation: $115,469.29
Total (converted to GBP): £3,546,059.91

The Claimant requests that “in the event that the Tribunal finds that the Claimant is successful in
proving its claims under the Treaty, . . . the Tribunal to order the Government to pay for all costs
incurred by the Claimant in connection with these arbitration proceedings (including costs of legal
representation and assistance)”.* According to the Claimant, Gemplus S.A. v. Mexico, ADC v.
Hungary, and SPP v. Egypt establish the proposition that the award of legal costs is necessary to
wipe out the consequences of unlawful acts.**! The Claimant also notes that this approach was

followed by the Tribunal in the British Caribbean Bank Proceedings.**”

Additionally, the Claimant submits that an award of the costs of legal representation is warranted
by the Respondent’s “dilatory tactics before and during the arbitration proceedings” and by its
“spurious and unsupported counterclaims”.**? The Claimant relies on LETCO v. Liberia,
Cementownia v. Turkey, and Euram v. Slovakia for support for its proposition that “arbitral

tribunals should award costs against a party that unnecessarily delays the arbitration and increases

the costs of the proceedings by making meritless applications, claims or objections.”*™* In these

proceedings, the Claimant argues, the Respondent engaged in dilatory tactics by:

(a) pursuing and obtaining the anti-arbitration injunction in the Courts of Belize;

(b) delaying the proceedings through the passage of the Supreme Court Judicature Act;

(c) pursuing and obtaining an anti-arbitration injunction against the Dunkeld II Proceedings;
(d) employing the decisions of the Courts of Belize as a pretext for unnecessary extensions;
(e) seeking to change the hearing venue;

(f) submitting overly broad and irrelevant requests for the production of documents; and

(g) seeking to bifurcate the proceedings only six weeks prior to the commencement of the

hearing.**5

In the Claimant’s view, the Respondent also initiated counter-claims that were “without any basis
or merit”, only to withdraw them at the hearing after forcing the Claimant to incur costs in

response.**°

Finally, the Claimant emphasizes that its claim for the costs of legal representation is irrespective
of the outcome of these proceedings on the merits. According to the Claimant:

even if the Government prevails on its jurisdictional arguments or the merits, these aspects

of the Government's case and the manner in which it was advanced justify a finding that the

Claimant should not be responsible for any of the Government's costs, and that an award of
the Claimant’s costs of legal representation should be made in the Claimant’s favour.**7

The Respondent’s Position

defending this arbitration proceeding”, ** as well expert witness fees and costs in the following

amounts:

The Tribunal’s Considerations

360. The Tribunal considers that, although Article 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules affords the Tribunal
a measure of discretion, the general principle should be that the “costs follow the event,” save for
exceptional circumstances. In keeping with its decision on the costs of arbitration, however, the
Tribunal considers that “the event” in this instance has been a settlement agreement to the benefit

of both Parties and of the people of Belize.

361. Accordingly, the Parties shall each bear their own costs of legal representation and assistance.
