Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1 Filed 09/26/18 Page 5 of 22

Petitioner Entes Industrial Plants Construction and Erection Contracting Co. Inc. (“Entes”
or “Petitioner”), by and through its attorneys, alleges as follows in support of its petition (the
“Petition”) for entry of an order confirming and recognizing, pursuant to the United Nations
Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, 21 U.S.T. 2517
(the “New York Convention” or the “Convention’”) and Chapter 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act,
9 US.C. § 201 et seg. (the “FAA”), the final arbitral award (the “Award”) dated September 29,
2015 in the arbitration (the “Arbitration”) between Petitioner on the one hand and Respondent
The Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic (the “Ministry”) on the
other hand. The Arbitration was captioned Entes Industrial Plants Construction and Erection
Contracting Co. Inc. v. The Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic,
and was conducted in Bishkek, Kyrgyz Republic under the 1976 version of the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules. Petitioner Entes respectfully seeks an order: (1) entering judgment in
Petitioner’s favor against the Kyrgyz Republic (the “Republic”) in the amount of the Award,
with interest and costs as provided therein; (2) awarding Petitioner post-judgment interest at the
applicable statutory rate; and (3) awarding Petitioner such further relief as the Court deems just
and proper.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

Petitioner brings this proceeding under the FAA and the New York Convention to
confirm and recognize the Award rendered by an international arbitral tribunal against the
Ministry and to enter judgment against the Republic in the aggregate principal amount of
approximately $16.6 million, plus interest. The Ministry is treated as the Republic itself under
the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1602-1611 (the “FSIA”). See Roeder v.

Islamic Republic of Iran, 333 F.3d 228, 234-35 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (holding that Iran’s “Ministry

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1 Filed 09/26/18 Page 6 of 22

of Foreign Affairs must be treated as the state of Iran itself’ because this Circuit has “adopted a
categorical approach: if the core functions of the entity are governmental, it is considered the
foreign state itself”).

The underlying dispute that gave rise to the Award arose out of a contract between
Petitioner and the Ministry executed in August 1999 (the “Contract”). Under the Contract, Entes
agreed to act as contractor for a road construction project called the Second Road Rehabilitation
Project Bishkek-Osh Road Civil Works (the “Works”), a job that required Entes to rehabilitate
two sections of the 620-kilometer road connecting the cities of Bishkek and Osh in the Republic.
In the Contract, the location of the Works was described as follows:

The Works are located roughly south-west of Bishkek in a mountainous area of

the Tien Shan range with elevations ranging from about 1000 m to 2200 m. The

terrain is mountainous and much of the road alignment is tortuous having

numerous tight curves and steep gradients.

The Works required construction or repair to the carriageway, shoulders, slope stability, drainage
system, structures and road furniture, and road alignments. The scope of work also required
repairing existing bridges and tunnels, and broadening those structures to accommodate the full
width of the new road.

Entes initially targeted a December 3, 2002 completion date. Following extensive delay,
and corresponding requests to prolong the timeframe for completion, Entes finished the project
on October 12, 2005. The causes of delay included design changes, late instructions, additional
work added to the project, material shortages, inclement weather, and political unrest, in
particular the Tulip Revolution of March-April 2005. On completion of the project, on March
17, 2006, Entes submitted a Statement of Completion to the engineering consultants overseeing

the Works that claimed an additional $22,982,039.25, primarily in compensation for costs for the

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1 Filed 09/26/18 Page 7 of 22

extended period of construction. However, the engineering consultants granted Entes only an
additional $1,161,870.19. Entes appealed the decision, but was rejected.

On January 15, 2009, Entes commenced arbitration seeking to recover the amounts
rightfully owed by the Ministry, including the costs associated with the extended period of
completion for the Works. The total amount sought by Entes was $25,359,472.27, plus interest
and Arbitration costs. The Ministry counterclaimed, seeking $487,238 primarily for its legal
fees.

A three-member tribunal was constituted and initial instructions provided to Entes and
the Ministry in December 2009. The Arbitration subsequently suffered serious delays. Entes
submitted its Statement of Claim on March 15, 2010; the Ministry submitted its Statement of
Defence on March 31, 2011; and the tribunal held a procedural hearing on April 27, 2011 to
provide further instruction regarding written submissions and an evidentiary hearing. An
evidentiary hearing was finally held in October 2011 in Bishkek, and the parties submitted
additional expert reports, correspondence, and claims for costs from 2012 through 2015. On
September 29, 2015, the tribunal unanimously awarded Entes $16,388.631.59 for costs related to
the Works and $225,000 representing the Ministry’s share of the costs and fees of the
Arbitration, plus interest at one month LIBOR plus 2%.

PARTIES

1. Petitioner Entes Industrial Plants Construction and Erection Contracting Co. Inc.

is a company organized under the laws of Turkey, with its principal place of business at

Biiyiikdere Cad. No. 107, Kat 5 Bengiin Han Gayrettepe — Istanbul, Turkey.

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1 Filed 09/26/18 Page 8 of 22

2. Respondent The Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz
Republic is part of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic with its headquarters at 42 Isanov
Street, Conference hall, 6/F, MOTC Bishkek City 720017, Kyrgyz Republic.

3. Respondent The Kyrgyz Republic is a foreign state located in Central Asia,
bordering Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and China.

4. For all purposes in this action, including jurisdiction under the FSIA, the Ministry
and the Republic should be treated as one and the same. The D.C. Circuit has held that a foreign
state’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs must be treated as the foreign state itself under the FSIA. See
Roeder vy. Islamic Republic of Iran, 333 F.3d 228, 234-35 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (holding that Iran’s
Ministry of Foreign Affairs must be “treated as the state of Iran itself’ because “[t]he conduct of
foreign affairs is an important and ‘indispensable’ governmental function”). The same holds true
for a foreign state’s other ministries that perform governmental functions (such as the Ministry
here). See, e.g., Ministry of Def. & Support for the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran
v. Frym, 814 F.3d 1053, 1055 n.3 (9th Cir. 2016) (noting that Iran’s “Ministry of Defense is an
inseparable part of the Republic of Iran, and it therefore qualifies as a ‘foreign state’ within the
meaning of the FSIA”); Garb v. Republic of Poland, 440 F.3d 579, 595 (2d Cir. 2006) (treating
Poland’s Ministry of the Treasury as part of the Polish state itself for purposes of determining the
Ministry’s immunity from suit under the FSIA); see also Transaero, Inc. v. La Fuerza Aerea
Boliviana, 30 F.3d 148, 153 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (holding that a foreign state’s “armed forces are as
atrule so closely bound up with the structure of the state that they must in all cases be considered
as the ‘foreign state’ itself, rather than a separate ‘agency or instrumentality’ of the state”).

5. This Court has personal jurisdiction over the Ministry and the Republic in this

proceeding regardless of the nature or extent of the Ministry’s contacts with Washington, D.C. or

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document 1 Filed 09/26/18 Page 9 of 22

the United States because the Republic, as a foreign state, is not entitled to due process
protections. See Price v. Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 294 F.3d 82, 96 (D.C. Cir.
2002) (“[F]oreign states are not ‘persons’ protected by the Fifth Amendment.”).

6. Accordingly, the Ministry should, for all purposes, be treated as the Republic
itself and thus indistinguishable, jurisdictionally and for purposes of confirmation and
enforcement, from the Republic. See Compagnie Noga D’Importation et D’Exportation, S.A. v.
Russian Fed’n, 361 F.3d 676, 677 (2d Cir. 2004) (holding that “a foreign arbitration award can
be confirmed and enforced against a sovereign nation where the arbitration agreement was
signed by an organ of that nation’s central government and where that organ—and not the nation
itself—participated in the underlying arbitration proceedings”). Notably, the Superior Court of
Justice of Ontario, Canada has already entered judgment against the Republic itself on the very
same Award that is the subject of this Petition. See Entes v. Kyrgyz Republic, 2016 ONSC
7221.!

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

7. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to 9
US.C. §§ 201 and 203, which provide that the United States District Courts shall have original
subject matter jurisdiction over a proceeding governed by the New York Convention. Both the
Republic and the United States are signatories to the New York Convention, which calls for the
recognition and confirmation of the Award in favor of Petitioner.

8. This Court also has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1330(a),
which provides that the United States District Courts shall have original subject matter

jurisdiction over any nonjury civil action against a foreign state, as defined in 28 U.S.C. §

' Available at https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2016/20160nsc7221/20160nsc7221.html.

 

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document1 Filed 09/26/18 Page 10 of 22

1603(a), unless the foreign state is entitled to immunity under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1605-1607 or an
applicable international agreement. The Ministry and the Republic are the same “foreign state”
within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1603(a). The FSIA denies immunity to a foreign state in an
action to enforce an international commercial arbitral award. 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(6); see
Creighton Ltd. v. Gov’t of State of Qatar, 181 F.3d 118, 123 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (section 1605(a)(6)
“applies by its terms” to the “enforcement of any arbitral award rendered within the jurisdiction
of a signatory country” to the New York Convention). Therefore, Respondents are not immune
from suit in this action, and this Court has subject matter jurisdiction.

9. The Court has personal jurisdiction over Respondents pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §
1330(b), which provides that a United States District Court shall have personal jurisdiction over
a foreign state that is not immune from suit, provided that service of process is effected in
accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 1608(a). Petitioner will serve Respondents according to 28 U.S.C.
§ 1608(a), which governs service on foreign states.

10. Venue is proper pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 204 and 28 U.S.C. § 1391(f).

from 13 May 2006 until full settlement;

(iv) The [Ministry] shall pay US$225’000 to [Entes] on account of the
share of the Tribunal’s costs and fees advanced by [Entes] plus interest as
per above (iii) from the date of this award;
(v) A party that pays the share of the other Party in the additional amount
ordered by the Tribunal in the Procedural Order on Cost shall be entitled
to reimbursement of this payment.
(vi) Each Party shall bear its own costs of the arbitration.

Akinci Decl. Ex. A, at { 779.

35. With regard to its award of interest, the Tribunal explained that it had evaluated
Entes’ and the Ministry’s positions articulated in their Final Submissions. /d., at {| 747-752.
Entes argued that “the contractual interest shall be applied to the interest on [Entes]’s claim in
this arbitration” and that the applicable rate should be “the interest rate pursuant to contract or
the legal interest rate under Kyrgyz Law (whichever is higher).” Id., at [ 748 (emphasis added).
For its part, the Ministry “did not consider the case in which the Tribunal would find that some
amounts were due to [Entes]; nor did it address the contractual basis of the interest claim.” Jd.,
at] 751.

36. The Tribunal took note of the Ministry’s confirmation that the applicable legal
interest rate under Kyrgyz Law includes “an additional penalty of 5%” but found that “the parties
to a contract may make different arrangements for the payment of interest and under the
principle of freedom to contract the contractual rates should be applied.” /d., at {| 750, 753.

37. The controlling provision of the parties’ agreement concerning the interest due on
unpaid amounts, Clause 60.8 of the CPA, provides in relevant part:

In the event of the failure of the [Ministry] to make payment within the

times stated, the [Ministry] shall pay to [Entes] interest compounded
monthly at the rates stated in the Appendix to Tender upon all sums

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document1 Filed 09/26/18 Page 18 of 22

unpaid from the date at which the same should have been paid, in the
currencies in which the payments are due.

Id., at [ 570; see also id., at { 755 (emphasis added).

38. As the Tribunal further found, the Appendix to Tender referenced in Clause 60.8
identified the interest rate to be applied as “LIBOR + 2%.” Id., at { 757. The Tribunal noted
that Clause 60.8 “does not specify which LIBOR rate is applicable.” Jd. But “[s]ince Clause
60.8 provides for monthly compounding, the Tribunal conclude[d] that the appropriate interest
rate is the monthly LIBOR rate plus 2%.” Id.

39. Accordingly, while the dispositive portion of the Award provides only that “[t]he
amounts awarded bear interest at one month LIBOR plus 2% from 13 May 2006 until full
settlement” (id., at {| 779(iii)), the Tribunal explicitly stated that it was awarding interest at this
rate “[o]n the basis of the considerations set out above.” Jd., at { 779. And as demonstrated in
the immediately preceding paragraphs 35-38 of this Petition, the “considerations set out above”
in the Award, including Clause 60.8 of the CPA on which the Tribunal based its award of
interest, make clear that Entes is entitled to interest compounded monthly at one month LIBOR
plus 2%. As of the date of the Award, compound interest accruing monthly from May 13, 2006
to September 29, 2015 at one month LIBOR plus 2% resulted in a total monetary award to Entes
(including interest) of over $600 million. In the nearly three years since the Award was issued,
compound interest has continued to accrue, such that the aggregate amount due and owing to
Entes, as of the date of this filing, now totals nearly $2 billion.

40. Despite numerous demands by Entes for payment of the amounts due under the

Award, the Ministry has failed to pay any of the Awarded Amounts to Entes.

ARGUMENT

Al. “Confirmation proceedings under the [New York] Convention are summary in
nature, and the court must grant the confirmation unless it finds that the arbitration suffers from
one of the defects listed in the Convention.” Argentine Republic v. National Grid PLC, 637 F.3d
365, 369 (D.C. Cir. 2011). “[G]iven the strong public policy in favor of international arbitration,
a party challenging an award under the New York Convention bears a heavy burden.” Belize
Bank Limited v. Government of Belize, 191 F. Supp. 3d 26, 37 (D.D.C. 2016). Review of arbitral
awards under the New York Convention is limited “to avoid undermining the twin goals of
arbitration, namely, settling disputes efficiently and avoiding long and expensive litigation.” Jd.;
see also BCB Holdings Ltd. v. Government of Belize, 110 F. Supp. 3d 233, 247 (D.D.C. 2015)
(“Because the New York Convention provides only several narrow circumstances when a court
may deny confirmation of an arbitral award, confirmation proceedings are generally summary in
nature.”). Consistent with its purpose “to remove obstacles to confirmation,” the Convention
manifests a “general pro-enforcement bias.” Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee v.
Hammermills, Inc., Civ. A. No. 90-0169 (JGP), 1992 WL 122712, at *5 (D.D.C. May 29, 1992).

42. The Petition should be granted because, as demonstrated below, (1) all statutory
conditions for confirmation and enforcement are satisfied; and (2) none of the limited grounds

for refusal to confirm exist.

A. Entes_Has_Satisfied_All_of the Statutory Conditions for Confirmation and
Enforcement

43. This Petition falls within the confirmation and enforcement regime of the
Convention and satisfies the statutory requirements for confirmation and enforcement.
44. Chapter 2 of the FAA, 9 U.S.C. § 201 ef seq., authorizes federal courts to enforce

foreign arbitral awards that are governed by the New York Convention. Article I(1) of the

15

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document1 Filed 09/26/18 Page 20 of 22

Convention states that it “shall apply to the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards . . .
not considered as domestic awards in the State where their recognition or enforcement is
sought.” Section 202 of the FAA provides that an award is considered non-domestic if it arises
out of a legal relationship that is “not entirely between citizens of the United States” or that
“involves property located abroad, envisages performance or enforcement abroad, or has some
other reasonable relation with one or more foreign states.” 9 U.S.C. § 202; see Africard Co. v.
Republic of Niger, 210 F. Supp. 3d 119, 123 (D.D.C. 2016). Here, the Award arose from a legal
relationship between Entes (an entity organized under the laws of Turkey) on the one hand and
the Ministry (a foreign state) on the other hand. Therefore, the Award is not “entirely between
citizens of the United States.” Moreover, the legal relationship involved performance abroad in
the Republic. See Africard Co. Ltd., 210 F. Supp. 3d at 123 (finding an award non-domestic
“because it involves a dispute originating in Niger, and none of the parties are citizens of the
United States”). Consequently, the Award is non-domestic and falls within the Convention.

45. Articles II and IV of the Convention further require that a petition for
enforcement be accompanied by a duly certified copy of the award and of the parties’ written
agreement to arbitrate. A duly certified copy of the Award is appended to the Akinci Declaration
as Exhibit A, and a true and correct copy of the GCC, which contains the parties’ written
agreement to arbitrate in Clause 67.3, is appended to the Akinci Declaration as Exhibit B.
Accordingly, these Convention requirements for confirmation and enforcement are satisfied.

46. Moreover, this Court has jurisdiction to grant the Petition, and venue in this
District is proper. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1330(a) and
1605(a)(6). See, e.g., Belize Social Developmental Ltd. v. Government of Belize, 794 F.3d 99,

101-02 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (quoting § 1605(a)(6)’s statutory language). Additionally, this Court

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document1 Filed 09/26/18 Page 21 of 22

has subject matter jurisdiction under 9 U.S.C. § 203, which confers federal jurisdiction in actions
arising under the New York Convention. See, e.g., Stati v. Republic of Kazakhstan, 199 F. Supp.
3d 179, 184 (D.D.C. 2016) (“The district courts of the United States ... shall have original
jurisdiction over an action or proceeding falling under the Convention, regardless of the amount
in controversy.”). This Court has personal jurisdiction over the Ministry under 28 U.S.C. §
1330(b), which provides for personal jurisdiction over foreign states as long as service is effected
pursuant to 28 U.S.C § 1608(a). See Price, 294 F.3d at 96 (‘“[FJoreign states are not ‘persons’
protected by the Fifth Amendment.”). Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §
1391(f).

47. Finally, the Petition is brought within the three-year statute of limitations
provided for by 9 U.S.C. § 207. See id. (“Within three years after an arbitral award falling under
the Convention is made, any party to the arbitration may apply to any court having jurisdiction
under this chapter for an order confirming the award as against any other party to the
arbitration.”). The Award was rendered on September 29, 2015, and the Petition is therefore
within the three-year period.

B. None of the Limited Grounds to Refuse Confirmation and Enforcement Exist

48. The FAA mandates that a court “shall confirm the award” unless one of the
grounds for refusal specified in the Convention applies. 9 U.S.C. § 207 (emphasis added); see
Belize Bank Ltd., 191 F. Supp. 3d at 27. “[A] party challenging an award under the New York
Convention bears a heavy burden.” Jd. “[T]he burden of establishing the requisite factual
predicate to deny confirmation of an arbitral award rests with the party resisting confirmation,
and the showing required to avoid summary confirmation is high.” BCB Holdings Ltd., 110 F.

Supp. 3d at 247 (internal quotations and citations omitted).

Case 1:18-cv-02228 Document1 Filed 09/26/18 Page 22 of 22

49. None of the grounds for refusing enforcement of an award set forth in Article
V(1) of the Convention applies here. Nor do either of the grounds set forth in Article V(2) of the
Convention apply.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Petitioner respectfully petitions this Court pursuant to Article

IV of the Convention and 9 U.S.C. §§ 201, 202, and 207, to:

a. enter an order confirming and enforcing the Award against Respondents;

b. enter judgment that Respondent The Kyrgyz Republic is liable to Petitioner in the
amount of $16,388,631.59 for costs associated with the Works, plus interest at one
month LIBOR plus 2%, from May 13, 2006 as awarded in the Award, and $225,000
for Petitioner’s share of the Tribunal’s costs and fees, plus interest at one month
LIBOR plus 2%, from September 29, 2015 as awarded in the Award;

c. enter judgment that Respondent The Kyrgyz Republic is liable to Petitioner for post-
judgment interest at the applicable statutory rate;

d. enter an order requiring Respondent The Kyrgyz Republic to pay the costs incurred
by Petitioner in connection with this proceeding; and

e. award such further relief as may be just and proper.
