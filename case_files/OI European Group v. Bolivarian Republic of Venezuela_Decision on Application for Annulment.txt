INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW OF THE APPLICATION

This case concerns an application for annulment (the “Application”) of the award rendered
on March 10, 2015 (the “Award”) in the arbitration proceeding between OI European
Group B.V. and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25 (the
“Underlying Arbitration”).

The Award decided a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on the basis of the Agreement on the
Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Bolivarian Republic
of Venezuela and the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which entered into force on
November 1, 1993 (the “BIT” or “Treaty”), and the Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force

on October 14, 1966 (the “ICSID Convention” or the “Convention”).

The Application was filed by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (the “Applicant” or
“Venezuela”). The respondent on annulment is OI European Group B.V. (“OTEG” or the
“Respondent on Annulment”). The Applicant and the Respondent on Annulment are
collectively referred to as the “Parties.” The Parties’ representatives and their addresses

are listed above on page (i).

OIEG initiated the Underlying Arbitration claiming that the Applicant had violated several
substantive provisions of the BIT and was liable for its internationally wrongful conduct in
relation to OIEG’s investment in two of the largest glass production plants in Venezuela
(the “Plants” or the “Investment”). This Investment was held by OIEG through its equity
interest in two Venezuelan companies, Fabrica de Vidrios Los Andes, C.A. and

Owens-Illinois de Venezuela, C.A. (the “Companies”).

In the Award, the Tribunal unanimously held that it had jurisdiction to hear the dispute and
that the Applicant had violated a number of substantive standards contained in the BIT,
namely, (i) that the Applicant had illegally expropriated the Investment in violation of

Article 6 of the BIT; and (ii) that the Applicant had violated the fair and equitable treatment

Il.

Case 1:16-cv-01533-ABJ Document 52-1 Filed 12/10/18 Page 10 of 135

standard within the meaning of Article 3(1) of the BIT as well as (iii) its duty to observe
obligations entered into with regard to OIEG’s Investment under Article 3(4) of the BIT.
As a result of these breaches, the Tribunal ordered the Applicant to pay OIEG
US$372,461,982 in compensation, as well as compound interest on the principal sum using
a LIBOR interest rate for one-year deposits in US dollars, plus a margin of 4 percent. The
Tribunal also ordered the Applicant to pay OIEG US$5,750,000 in costs and expenses,

with the same compound interest rate.!

The Applicant seeks the annulment of the Award on four of the five grounds for annulment
set forth in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention: (i) the Tribunal was not properly
constituted (Article 52(1)(a)); (ii) the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers (Article
52(1)(b)); (iii) there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article
52(1)(d)); and (iv) the Award fails to state the reasons on which it is based (Article
52(1)(e)).

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On July 7, 2015, the Applicant filed the Application with the Secretary-General of ICSID.
The Application was filed in accordance with Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and Rule
50 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “Arbitration Rules”),
within 120 days after the date of the Award.

The Application included a request under ICSID Convention Article 52(5) for a stay of
enforcement of the Award, pending a decision by the ad hoc Committee (the

“Committee’).

On July 17, 2015, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application and at the
same time notified the Parties that enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed,

pursuant to Arbitration Rule 54(2).

' Award, 984.

Case 1:16-cv-01533-ABJ Document 52-1 Filed 12/10/18 Page 11 of 135

By letter of October 13, 2015, the Secretary-General notified the Parties that the Committee
had been constituted, in accordance with ICSID Convention Article 52(3), and that the
annulment proceeding was deemed to have begun on that date. The Committee was
composed of Dr. Alvaro Castellanos Howell (Guatemalan), President, designated to the
ICSID Panel of Arbitrators by the Republic of Guatemala; Prof. Piero Bernardini (Italian),
designated to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators by the Italian Republic, and Mr. David Pawlak
(American and Irish), designated to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators by the Slovak Republic;
all members were appointed by the Chairman of ICSID’s Administrative Council. Ms. Sara
Marzal Yetano, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the

Committee.

On October 14, 2015, OIEG sent a letter noting that the Applicant bears the burden of
specifying the circumstances that require the continuation of the stay of enforcement and
that it had failed to provide any type of justification for its request in its Application. On
this basis, the Respondent on Annulment argued that the stay of enforcement should be
discontinued or allowed to terminate automatically within 30 days of the constitution of

the Committee.

On the same day, October 14, 2015, the ICSID Secretariat sent a letter to the Parties
requesting an initial advance on costs of US$200,000 from the Applicant, in accordance

with Regulation 14(3)(e) of the Administrative and Financial Regulations.

On October 26, 2015, pursuant to the schedule determined by the Committee, as
subsequently amended by the Parties, the Applicant filed a first submission in support of
its request to maintain the stay of enforcement; on November 12, 2015, the Respondent on
Annulment filed observations on the Applicant’s first submission; on November 25, 2015,
the Applicant filed a second submission on the stay of enforcement of the Award; and on

December 8, 2015, the Respondent on Annulment filed its rejoinder.

By letter dated October 27, 2015, the Committee notified the Parties that, as contemplated
by Arbitration Rule 54(2), the Committee decided to maintain the provisional stay on the
enforcement of the Award until it had an opportunity to review the Parties’ submissions

and to issue a further decision on the matter.

Case 1:16-cv-01533-ABJ Document 52-1 Filed 12/10/18 Page 12 of 135

On December 9, 2015, the Committee held its first session. Given that the Parties had not
agreed to hold the first session on any of the dates proposed by the Committee within the
60-day period envisaged in Arbitration Rule 13, and had not agreed to extend such period,
the Committee held its first session without the Parties by teleconference as permitted by

Arbitration Rule 13.

Following the first session, on December 15, 2015, the Committee issued Procedural Order
No. 1 recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters, as previously submitted

in writing, and the decision of the Committee on disputed issues.

On December 20, 2015, the Committee notified the Parties that it deemed that the two
rounds of written submissions had provided ample opportunity for the Parties to present
their observations on the issue of the stay of enforcement, and declined the Applicant’s

November 25, 2015 request for a round of oral submissions.

On March 2, 2016, the Committee informed the Parties by e-mail that, in accordance with
Section 16.5 of Procedural Order No. 1, it had decided not to consider the Respondent on
Annulment’s letter of February 26, 2016, and requested the Parties to abstain from
presenting further unsolicited submissions, consistent with the Committee’s direction in its
letter of October 27, 2015.

On April 1, 2016, the ICSID Secretariat received a wire transfer in the amount of
US$121,000 from the Applicant as partial payment of the funds requested in accordance
with Regulation 14(3)(e) of the Administrative and Financial Regulations to cover the costs
associated with the annulment proceedings. After an additional amount of US$73,767.29
was received, the ICSID Secretariat sent a letter to the Parties on April 7, 2016, confirming

that it had received a total of US$194,767.29 in connection with these proceedings.

On April 4, 2016, the Committee issued a decision rejecting the Applicant’s request to
continue the stay of enforcement (the “First Stay Decision”). The Committee declared the

provisional stay terminated.

Pursuant to the pleadings schedule established in Procedural Order No. 1: (i) on

April 7, 2016, Venezuela filed its Memorial on Annulment (“Memorial on Annulment”);

(ii) on August 5, 2016, OIEG filed its Counter-Memorial on Annulment
(“Counter-Memorial on Annulment”); and (iii) on September 24, 2016, Venezuela filed

its Reply on Annulment (“Reply on Annulment”).

On July 11, 2016, the ICSID Secretariat requested that the Applicant make a second
advance payment of US$200,000 to cover administrative costs and expenditures for the
next three to six months. As explained in the ICSID Secretariat’s letter, this advance
payment was to be paid no later than August 10, 2016. On July 25, 2016, the Applicant
sent a letter in response, requesting that the ICSID Secretariat review and confirm its
projected costs. The ICSID Secretariat reviewed and confirmed its projections with respect
to these proceedings. In a letter dated July 30, 2016, the ICSID Secretariat reiterated its
request for US$200,000.

On September 7, 2016, the ICSID Secretariat sent a letter to the Parties informing them
that no funds had been received. The ICSID Secretariat invited either Party to make the
requested payment as soon as possible and no later than September 22, 2016. No payment

was made, however, by the stipulated date.

By letter of September 28, 2016, the Secretary-General moved that the Committee stay the
proceeding for non-payment of the required advances in accordance with ICSID

Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(d) and (e).

On October 3, 2016, the Committee informed the Parties that it had decided to extend the
deadline for payment until October 14, 2016. Pursuant to the terms of the Committee’s
decision, the annulment proceeding would be stayed automatically if payment were not

received by this extended deadline. No payment was made by this extended deadline.

By letter of October 17, 2016, in accordance with its letter of October 3, 2016, the
Committee stayed the proceedings for non-payment of the required advances, effective as

of October 14, 2016.

On April 4, 2017, the Committee confirmed receipt of full payment of the required

advances and, after a stay of nearly six months, the Committee resumed the proceedings.

On December 14, 2017, the Secretary of the Committee confirmed that, in accordance with
Arbitration Rules 53 and 9(6), the proceeding was suspended until a decision was taken

with respect to the Proposal for Disqualification.

On December 18, 2017, Prof. Bernardini and Mr. Pawlak (the “Two Members”) set a
timetable for the Parties’ submissions and Dr. Castellanos’ explanations. In accordance
with such timetable, the Respondent on Annulment filed a submission on

December 26, 2017 and Dr. Castellanos furnished his explanations on January 2, 2018.

On January 9, 2018, both Parties submitted additional observations on the Proposal for

Disqualification.

By email of January 11, 2018, the ICSID Secretariat asked the Applicant to provide an
update regarding the pending payment. By email of the same day, the Applicant informed
the ICSID Secretariat that the payment was “en route” and that completion of the payment
would occur in “the coming days.” On February 8, 2018, the ICSID Secretariat informed
the Parties that it had not yet received the Applicant’s payment. On March 8, 2018, the

ICSID Secretariat confirmed receipt of the funds from the Respondent on Annulment.

On March 9, 2018 the Two Members issued their decision rejecting the Proposal for

Disqualification and the proceeding resumed pursuant to Arbitration Rules 53 and 9(6).

On June 6, 2018, the ICSID Secretariat requested that the Applicant make a fourth advance
payment of US$180,000 no later than July 6, 2018 to cover administrative costs and

expenditures until the end of the proceedings.

On July 10, 2018, the ICSID Secretariat sent a letter to the Parties informing them that no
funds had been received. The ICSID Secretariat invited either Party to make the requested
payment as soon as possible and no later than July 25, 2018. On July 16, 2018, OIEG sent
a letter informing the ICSID Secretariat that it planned to make the payment of
US$180,000. On July 25, 2018, the ICSID Secretariat informed the Parties that

On September 24, 2018, the Committee issued a decision rejecting the Applicant’s Second

Stay Request (the “Second Stay Decision”).

The annulment proceeding was declared closed on September 25, 2018.

THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS AND THE ANALYSIS OF THE COMMITTEE

As noted above, the Applicant seeks the annulment of the Award on four of the five
grounds for annulment set forth in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention: (i) the Tribunal
was not properly constituted; (ii) the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers; (iii) there
was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; and (iv) the Award fails to

state the reasons on which it is based.”

Below is a summary of the Parties’ arguments and the Committee’s analysis on each of the
grounds of annulment invoked by the Applicant, preceded by a short discussion on the

nature and scope of the annulment mechanism.

NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE ANNULMENT MECHANISM
qd Applicant’s Position

The Applicant disagrees with OIEG’s “excessively restrictive interpretation of the

093

provisions contained in the ICSID Convention on the annulment of awards.”’ According

to Venezuela, if ICSID’s annulment mechanism had “the features described by OIEG, then

the function of the Committee would be virtually non-existent and this proceeding would

be devoid of any sense.”*

In response to OIEG’s argument that the Application is “nothing but an appeal disguised

as annulment,”>

Venezuela contends that its arguments in support of the Application “do
not refer to reasonable disagreements in terms of the interpretation of the facts and the law,
but are limited to certain defects contained in the Award which are so serious that they fit
the specific list included in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention as grounds for

annulment of the Award.”®

Opposing OIEG’s “mistaken” invocation of a “duty to interpret the grounds for annulment

[...] in a restrictive manner,”

the Applicant maintains that, when examining the grounds
for annulment set out in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, the Committee should not
adopt “an extensive or narrow interpretation.”* In support of this position, the Applicant
relies on the decisions in Mitchell v. Congo,? Wena Hotels v. Egypt,!° and Consortium
R.F.C.C. v. Morocco.'' The Applicant also cites the annulment decision in Soufraki v.

UAE," according to which:

Article 52 of the ICSID Convention must be read in accordance with
the principles of treaty interpretation forming part of general
international law, which principles insist on neither restrictive nor

52. Finally, the Applicant objects to OIEG’s argument “that, even if there were reasons to
annul the Award, the Committee has the discretion not to do so.”'* The Applicant contends
that “[t]he limited discretion of annulment committees under the ICSID Convention has to

do with the evaluation of the arguments and documents submitted to it by the parties for

v5

consideration.

53. The Applicant accepts that committees must carefully assess the circumstances in each
case and make sure that they do not annul awards in cases where the defects in the award
“might prove not to be such after a more thorough analysis” or “are not a determining factor
in the final outcome of the dispute.”!° However, citing the decision in Amco v. Indonesia,
the Applicant also argues that this measure of prudence “does not mean that an annulment
committee has the discretion not to annul an award where it has defects listed by the ICSID

Convention as grounds for annulment and those defects have been determining factors in

the final outcome of the dispute between the parties.”!”

Article 53 of the ICSID Convention.'?

55. In this sense, OIEG stresses that annulment under the ICSID Convention is not an appeal
and therefore is not concerned with the substantive correctness of an award.”? The purpose
of the annulment mechanism is limited to “policing the integrity and fairness of the process
leading to the award.””! Further, the role of annulment committees is confined strictly to

the grounds for annulment defined in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention.”

56. Finally, OIEG maintains that, even when there are grounds for annulment, ad hoc
committees have discretion not to annul an award in appropriate cases.” This is confirmed,

annulment committees and authoritative commentators.”+

award.””7 In this sense, OIEG contends that, even if the Committee in the present case finds
that any or all of the grounds invoked by the Applicant meet the threshold (quod non), they
had no effect on the Tribunal’s decision and, therefore, the Committee should not annul
the Award.”*

(3) The Committee’s Analysis

As is well known, the permissible challenges to an ICSID award must be brought within
the framework of the Convention, and pursuant to its terms. The procedure for the
annulment of an award rendered under the ICSID Convention is self-contained, and
autonomous from domestic law. The annulment remedy is governed, in particular, by

Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, and Arbitration Rules 50, 52, 53, 54 and 55.

In accordance with Soufraki v. UAE, as invoked by the Applicant in paragraph 51 above,
among other annulment decisions, this Committee agrees that Article 52 of the ICSID
Convention should be interpreted neither restrictively nor extensively, but rather in
accordance with the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention. As contended by the
Respondent on Annulment,”? one such important purpose — indeed, “a fundamental goal

9930

for the ICSID system” — is “assuring the finality of ICSID arbitration awards.

Additionally, according to the Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the
Administrative Council of ICSID (“2016 ICSID Paper”),

[t]he function of an ad hoc Committee is either to reject the
application for annulment or to annul the award or a part thereof on
the basis of the grounds enumerated in Article 52. Its function is not
to rule on the merits of the parties’ dispute if it decides to annul,

rendered on August 20, 2007, August 10, 2010 (“Vivendi v. Argentina IT’), §§| 232, 240, 267 (OILA-96) as examples
of cases in which annulment committees have exercised their discretion and refused to annul awards despite finding
grounds for annulment. See also generally Rejoinder on Annulment, §§ 371-378.

which would be the task of a new Tribunal should either party
resubmit the dispute following annulment of the award.*!

61. Thus, even if an ad hoc annulment committee reaches a decision to annul, partially or
totally, an ICSID award, that committee does not have the mandate to revisit the merits of
the case in which the annulled award was rendered. The above passage of the 2016 ICSID
Paper is directly relevant in the case at hand, given that the Parties have presented, for

example, expert testimonies during the Hearing on Annulment.

62. It is true that nothing in the ICSID Convention, nor in the Rules, expressly prohibits an ad
hoc committee from stating its opinion on any issues addressed by an ICSID tribunal in its
award. However, this Committee agrees with the proposition stated in various decisions
that an ad hoc committee should not pronounce upon aspects of the award that are not

essential to its decision.”

63. As acorollary of the above, this Committee endorses several of the principles established

by prior ad hoc committees, as expressed in the 2016 ICSID Paper:

(1) the grounds listed in Article 52(1) are the only grounds on which
an award may be annulled;

(2) annulment is an exceptional and narrowly circumscribed remedy
and the role of an ad hoc Committee is limited;

(3) ad hoc Committees are not courts of appeal, annulment is not a
remedy against an incorrect decision, and an ad hoc Committee
cannot substitute the Tribunal’s determination on the merits for its
own;

(4) ad hoc Committees should exercise their discretion not to defeat
the object and purpose of the remedy or erode the binding force and
finality of awards;

(5) Article 52 should be interpreted in accordance with its object and
purpose, neither narrowly nor broadly; and

(6) an ad hoc Committee’s authority to annul is circumscribed by
the Article 52 grounds specified in the application for annulment,
but an ad hoc Committee has discretion with respect to the extent of
an annulment, i.e., either partial or full.*°

It is within the framework for the Committee’s analysis described in paragraphs 58 et seq.
above that the Committee will examine OIEG’s argument that this Application is “at best,

an appeal disguised as an application for annulment,”**

and the Applicant’s position that
its arguments in support of the Application “do not refer to reasonable disagreements in
terms of the interpretation of the facts and the law, but are limited to certain defects
contained in the Award which are so serious that they fit the specific list included in Article

52(1) of the ICSID Convention as grounds for annulment of the Award.” *°

Thus, in the sections of this Decision that follow, with an understanding that the Parties are
in agreement that annulment is not an appeal, but an exceptional remedy, the Committee

will address the alleged defects in the Award from this cardinal point of view.

THE TRIBUNAL WAS NOT PROPERLY CONSTITUTED
qd) Legal Standard
a. Applicant’s Position

In seeking annulment under Article 52(1)(a) relating to the improper constitution of the
Tribunal, Venezuela complains that prior to the Award’s issuance Mr. Mourre lost the
requisite qualities of impartiality and independence under the Convention given that he had
entered into negotiations regarding a consultancy with Dechert LLP (“Dechert”), a law
firm which, the Applicant maintains, was adverse to it in several international and domestic
disputes.*° Further, the Applicant complains that the timing of (i) the revelation of

Mr. Mourre’s professional contacts with Dechert and (ii) the closing of the proceedings in

the Underlying Arbitration “precluded the Republic from exercising its right to [...]

eventually propose [his] disqualification pursuant to the ICSID Convention.”*”

Accordingly, on the basis of Articles 52(1), 14, 40(2) and 57 of the ICSID Convention, the
Applicant argues that “if a member of a tribunal may not be relied upon to exercise
independent judgment, the tribunal is not properly constituted and, therefore, a potential
award rendered by it will not be valid.”** The Applicant relies on the annulment decisions
in Vivendi v. Argentina IP? and EDF v. Argentina which held that an arbitrator’s lack of
the qualities set forth in Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention constitutes a ground for

annulment pursuant to Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention.*!

The Applicant points out that the ability to exercise independent and impartial judgment is
continuous in nature. In this regard, when considering whether a tribunal has been properly
constituted, the requirements in Article 14 of the ICSID Convention “must not only be
satisfied at the time when the tribunal is actually constituted but must also continue to be
met at all times,” that is, until the date of the award. Therefore, there may be cases in
which a tribunal is properly constituted “but-due to a change in circumstances—it

subsequently ceased to be properly constituted,” giving rise to a ground for annulment.**

The Applicant also argues that the ability to reach a decision in an independent and
impartial manner must not be assessed in an abstract or general way, but must be judged in

a concrete and specific manner, on a case by case basis.“

Relying again on Vivendi v. Argentina II and EDF v. Argentina, the Applicant further
contends that a party is entitled to seek disqualification during the annulment proceeding

if the circumstances prevented it from doing so during the pendency of the arbitration

proceeding.*° In such case, the Applicant argues, the annulment committee must conduct a
de novo review of the disqualification proposal.*° The Applicant asserts that this is the only
avenue for its challenge to be heard, and further that the purported conflict and denial of
the right to be heard regarding same are also grounds for annulment under Article
52(1)(d)."7

Regarding the standard applicable to disqualification requests, the Applicant relies on the
disqualification decision issued by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council in
Blue Bank v. Venezuela, which is based on the “objective perspective of an impartial and

sufficiently informed third party:

The applicable legal standard is an objective standard based on a
reasonable evaluation of the evidence by a third party. As a
consequence, the subjective belief of the party requesting the
disqualification is not enough to satisfy the requirements of the
Convention.”

In this same regard, the Applicant also cites the EDF v. Argentina annulment committee,

which held that:

[T]he standard applied under Article 14(1) is whether a reasonable

third party, with knowledge of all the facts, would consider that there

were reasonable grounds for doubting that an arbitrator possessed

the requisite qualities of independence and impartiality.©°
On this basis, the Applicant highlights that proof of actual dependence or bias is not
required, “it is sufficient to establish the appearance of dependence or bias.”*! This

principle of the “avoidance of appearance of impropriety” is generally applied in both

domestic and international law, and reflected in the International Bar Association’s

Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration (the “IBA Guidelines”):

Doubts are justifiable if a reasonable third person, having
knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, would reach the
conclusion that there is a likelihood that the arbitrator may be
influenced by factors other than the merits of the case as presented
by the parties in reaching his or her decision.**

74. In support of its Application, the Applicant cites several cases in which a party sought the

disqualification of an arbitrator:

In Blue Bank v. Venezuela,® arbitrator José Maria Alonso was disqualified given that
he was a member of a law firm in Madrid, whose New York and Caracas offices were
handling an international arbitration against Venezuela addressing similar issues.**

In Burlington v. Ecuador,>> the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council found
that a sentence in one of the explanations provided by arbitrator Francisco Orrego
Vicuiia concerning the alleged conflict would lead a third party making a reasonable
evaluation to manifestly perceive an appearance of lack of impartiality.©°

In Perenco v. Ecuador,*" the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration
considered that Judge Brower’s words in a journalistic interview created an unfavorable
opinion against Ecuador, thus giving a reasonable third party justifiable doubts about

his impartiality.>*

© In Caratube v. Kazakhstan, the other members of the tribunal found that a reasonable
third party would find it very likely that, in view of arbitrator Bruno Boesch’s work in
a prior case that involved similar parties and facts, his objectivity and open-mindedness
regarding the facts and issues to be decided upon would be tainted.°

¢ In Vito Gallo v. Canada,°' it was established that the conflict of interest created by a
professional relationship between an arbitrator and a firm with an interest in the
outcome of the dispute could not be side-stepped by the mere fact that this work was
not substantial or current.

© In Alpha Projekt v. Ukraine,® it was established that failure to disclose the relationship
between an arbitrator and a third party with an interest in the dispute could constitute

evidence of bias, if the relationship was recent and professional.

75. Finally, relying on EDF v. Argentina, the Applicant states that the party seeking annulment
is not required to prove that a lack of impartiality or independence did in fact have a
material effect on the award, but merely that it could have done so.°° In this regard, the
Applicant explains that the fact that an award is unanimous, as in the present case, cannot
in itself “constitute an indicator that the award cannot be annulled.”® For Venezuela, “[i]t

Case 1:16-cv-01533-ABJ Document 52-1 Filed 12/10/18 Page 28 of 135

b. Respondent on Annulment’s Position

OIEG argues that the threshold for annulling an award on the basis of Article 52(1)(a) of
the ICSID Convention is exceptionally high, as illustrated by the fact that this provision

has only been invoked in three cases and none of them resulted in annulment.®*

The Respondent on Annulment further contends that (i) annulment is not the proper means
to seek the disqualification of an arbitrator;® (ii) even under the Applicant’s interpretation
of Article 52(1)(a), it must establish a manifest lack of impartiality or independence as
required under Articles 14 and 57; which (iii) should lead to annulment only if it would

have altered the outcome of the award.

(i) Annulment is not the proper means to seek the disqualification of an
arbitrator

For OIEG, Article 52(1)(a) should be interpreted in accordance with the customary
international law rule enshrined in Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of
Treaties (the “VCLT”).”° Thus, “the Committee’s starting point should be to discern the
ordinary meaning of the terms ‘that the Tribunal was not properly constituted’” and such
interpretation must lead to the conclusion that Article 52(1)(a) only covers breaches of the
rules governing the process of constitution of tribunals, i.e., Section 2 of Chapter IV of the

ICSID Convention, Articles 37 to 40, entitled the “Constitution of the Tribunal.””!

OIEG further argues that, even if the Committee were to resort to the “supplementary
means of interpretation” referred to in Article 32 of the VCLT, the end result would be the
same, since the drafting history of the ICSID Convention confirms the Respondent on

Annulment’s interpretation of Article 52(1)(a).” In this regard, OIEG explains that

“[dJuring the drafting of the ICSID Convention a proposal similar to what the Applicant is

now advancing was rejected.””*

OIEG finds additional support in the decision of the committee in Azurix v. Argentina.
There, the committee explained that the role of an annulment committee in relation to
arbitrator challenges brought under Articles 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention is limited
to examining under Article 52(1)(d) whether or not there was a serious departure from a
fundamental rule of procedure in the way in which the challenge was addressed; and that a
challenge to an arbitrator brought for the first time on annulment is inadmissible under
Article 52(1)(a).”* For OIEG, the legal authorities on which the Applicant relies — EDF v.
Argentina and Vivendi v. Argentina II — are unpersuasive on this particular issue and the
Committee should adhere to the more judicious and reasoned view expressed by Azurix v.

Argentina.”

OIEG objects to the Applicant’s assertion that the only possibility to challenge arbitrators
in relation to facts discovered after the closure of the Underlying Arbitration is to request
the annulment of the award under Article 52(1)(a) or (d).”° First, if a party discovers any
such facts between the closure of a proceeding and the issuance of the award, it can request
that the proceeding be reopened pursuant to Arbitration Rule 38.”’ Second, if the grounds
for disqualification only become known after the award is rendered, the relevant party can

request the revision of the award under Article 51 of the ICSID Convention.”

OIEG cites Mr. Broches, who stated that “if the grounds for disqualification only became

known after the award was rendered, this would be a new fact which would enable a

revision of the award.””? Similarly, OIEG notes, the Azurix v. Argentina committee stated

that:

In the event that the party only became aware of the grounds for
disqualification of the arbitrator after the award was rendered, this
newly discovered fact may provide a basis for revision of the award
under Article 51 [...] but [...] such a newly discovered fact would
not provide a ground of annulment under Article 52(1)(a).*°

In sum, the Respondent on Annulment states that the Applicant’s reliance on Article
52(1)(a) to raise its alleged concerns regarding Mr. Mourre’s impartiality and

independence is contrary to the proper interpretation of that Article.*!

(ii) Under the Applicant's interpretation of Article 52(1)(a), it must establish a
manifest lack of impartiality or independence as required under Articles 14
and 57
OIEG argues that, even if the Committee were to accept the Applicant’s interpretation of
Article 52(1)(a), the Applicant would still have the burden to prove that Mr. Mourre
manifestly lacked the independence and impartiality required under Articles 14(1) and
57.8

OIEG contends that, contrary to the Applicant’s assertion, the applicable standard under
Article 57 requires the applicant to adduce direct evidence of a “manifest” lack of the
qualities required by Article 14(1).*° This standard must not be confused with the
“reasonable doubts” standard applicable under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules or the

79 Counter-Memorial on Annulment, § 91, citing History, p. 872 (VLA-47).

80 Azurix vy, Argentina, § 281 (OILA-89). OIEG also relies on Kardassopoulos v. Georgia, which stated that “the
revision and annulment remedies are compartmentalized. The discovery of a new fact does not come under one of the
grounds for annulment listed at Article 52(1), so that there can be no overlapping between a ground for annulment and
a ground for revision.” See Rejoinder on Annulment, § 39, citing Joannis Kardassopoulos and Ron Fuchs v. Georgia,

IBA Guidelines,®* which standard was expressly rejected in Nations Energy v. Panama,

Universal Compression v. Venezuela, and OPIC v. Venezuela, among others.*°

86. OIEG states that the relevant standard under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention is an

objective one and imposes a high burden of proof on the Applicant.** As succinctly stated

in ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela:*’

The standard to be applied [...] is whether a reasonable third person,
with knowledge of all the facts, would conclude, on an objective
basis, that the challenged arbitrator is manifestly lacking in the
ability to act impartially (Article 14 read with Article 57 of the
ICSID Convention).**

87. Also relying on ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela, OIEG argues that under this standard it is
not enough for the applicant to show that the challenged arbitrator may harbour a proclivity
of bias in general. Rather, “it must establish facts indicating that [Mr. Mourre] would have
a manifest bias in relation to the outcome of the present case.”*” The Respondent on
Annulment cites the following passage from the ConocoPhillips Decision on

Disqualification IT:

The allegation that serves as the basis for the challenge, assuming it
can be established, must be capable of being related to the present
case, that is, that the particular facts must give rise to a manifest lack
of independence and impartiality in this case.”

88. With respect to the requirement of “manifest,” OIEG maintains that, as confirmed by
“ICSID jurisprudence” and commentary, “manifest” means “evident” or “obvious” and
related to the “ease with which the alleged lack of the qualities can be perceived.”*!
According to OIEG, this high standard has been applied in Blue Bank v. Venezuela,
Burlington Resources v. Ecuador, Caratube v. Kazakhstan, Abaclat v. Argentina, and

ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela.”

89. OIEG contends that the Applicant’s reliance on the disqualification decisions it cites in

support of its Application is misplaced:

¢ In Blue Bank v. Venezuela,” the facts are “starkly different from those in the OJEG

Arbitration.”* In contrast with the situation of Mr. Mourre:

(a) Arbitrator Alonso was a partner in Baker McKenzie
Madrid; (b) Baker McKenzie New York and Baker
McKenzie Caracas represented the claimant in a parallel and
similar ICSID proceeding against Venezuela (ie., in
Longreef v. Venezuela); (c) Arbitrator Alonso likely would
have had to decide issues in Blue Bank v. Venezuela relevant
to Longreef v. Venezuela; (d) Arbitrator Alonso was a
member of Baker McKenzie’s International Arbitration
Steering Committee; and (e) Arbitrator Alonso stated that

disqualification or explaining circumstances relevant to the allegations that the
arbitrator manifestly lacks independence or impartiality.”””” In this case, the Applicant
has never argued that Mr. Mourre made those sorts of allegations.”

In Perenco v. Ecuador,” the conclusion of the Secretary-General of the Permanent
Court of Arbitration was based on a statement made by Judge Brower that expressed
unfavorable views on Ecuador and prejudged a fundamental issue of the case. Again,
the Applicant has never argued that Mr. Mourre made similar comments. Additionally,
in that case the parties had agreed that the challenge would be resolved applying the
IBA Guidelines, which set a different standard than the one applicable to this case.'°

In Caratube v. Kazakhstan,'°!

when deciding on the challenge of Mr. Thomas (an arbitrator) due to his contacts with
Mr. Paulsson (Counsel for Pakistan) in another arbitration, the deciding arbitrators made
clear that an applicant must show “dependency” or “reciprocal partisanship.”!°* Similarly,

impartiality or independence can be inferred, this may only lead to annulment if the
Committee is also persuaded that it would have altered the outcome of the Award.!!° OIEG
points out that “all committees considering this ground of annulment have paid close
attention to the capacity of the invoked circumstances to alter the outcome of the award”

92. In this regard, OIEG maintains that the Applicant must demonstrate that the lack of
impartiality or independence must have arisen prior to the rendering of the award,''* and
cites the annulment decision in EDF v. Argentina, according to which “if an arbitrator
ceased to be independent or impartial only after the award has been finalised, his lack of
the requisite qualities could not have affected the award and would not, therefore, constitute

a ground for annulment.”!!°

93. Finally, and contrary to what the Applicant asserts, OIEG contends that the fact that an
award is unanimous “is a relevant factor for whether an alleged lack of impartiality or

independence was capable of affecting the outcome of the case.”!!*

c. The Committee’s Analysis

94. As recorded above, the Parties have debated at length whether an arbitrator’s loss of his or
her ability to act in an impartial and independent manner, as required under Articles 14(1)
and 57 of the ICSID Convention, may properly constitute a ground for annulment under

Article 52(1)(a).

95. As a starting point, the Committee undertakes to discern the intent of the Contracting States
when agreeing to the specific wording of Article 52(1)(a) stating that “the tribunal was not
properly constituted.” To that end, the Committee recalls Articles 31 and 32 of the
VCLT.!'5 As is known, Article 31(1) provides that “[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good
faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their
context and in the light of its object and purpose.” In accordance with Article 32,
interpretation of a treaty also includes recourse to supplementary means of interpretation,
“including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in

order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31 [...].”

Case 1:16-cv-01533-ABJ Document 52-1 Filed 12/10/18 Page 36 of 135

Applying the foregoing, the Committee begins with a focus on the text of Article 52(1)(a),
which, as noted above, provides that a “party may request annulment of the award” on the
ground “that the Tribunal was not properly constituted.” In its ordinary meaning, the term
“constitute” means “establish,” “form,” “frame,” “give legal form to,”''® thus pointing to
the initial formation of a given body. This interpretation is supported by the use of the verb
“was” immediately preceding the term “constituted,” pointing to a situation existing at the

point in the past when the tribunal was established.

The Committee further interprets the term “properly constituted” in the context of the
ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules. Namely, Chapter IV, Section 2, of the
Convention, entitled “Constitution of the Tribunal” and comprising Articles 37-40, lists the
conditions to be met for a “properly constituted” tribunal, which must be satisfied at the
time of the tribunal’s initial formation. Such conditions include, for example, the number
of arbitrators and the method of their appointment, applicable timeframes, nationality
requirements, and, under Article 40(2), the condition that arbitrators “shall possess the
qualities stated in paragraph (1) of Article 14,” including the ability to “exercise

independent judgment.”

The foregoing interpretation also is supported by reference to the Arbitration Rules.
Specifically, Chapter I (Rules | through 12), entitled “Establishment of the Tribunal,” in
its very first provision refers to [CSID Convention Chapter IV, Section 2 (“Constitution of
the Tribunal”),!!’ indicating a connection between the terms “establishment” and

“constitution.”

Accordingly, if the conditions under Articles 37-40 of the ICSID Convention for the proper
constitution of the tribunal are not satisfied at the time of such constitution, then as a
general matter either party may request the annulment of the award under Article 52(1)(a)

on the ground that “the tribunal was not properly constituted.”!'* However, in the case of

"7 ICSID Arbitration Rule 1(1) (“Upon notification of the registration of the request for arbitration, the parties shall,
with all possible dispatch, proceed to constitute a Tribunal, with due regard to Section 2 of Chapter IV of the
Convention.”).

"8 Aron Broches suggested that, given the complex provisions governing the constitution of the tribunal and the fact
that improper constitution of the tribunal may lead to annulment of the award, the tribunal should obtain the parties’

28

Case 1:16-cv-01533-ABJ Document 52-1 Filed 12/10/18 Page 37 of 135

the lack or loss of qualities listed in Article 14(1), the disqualification provisions of Articles
57 and 58 apply (together with Arbitration Rule 9), which regulate the disqualification of
an arbitrator in case of a manifest lack of the qualities required by Article 14(1).!'? Contrary
to the Applicant’s contention,'?° Article 52(1)(a) is not the proper means to address the

disqualification of an arbitrator.

100. As OIEG has maintained,'*! the intent of the drafters of the ICSID Convention was to
distinguish annulment under Article 52(1)(a) from disqualification under Article 57. The

latter provision provides:

A party may propose to a Commission or Tribunal the
disqualification of any of its members on account of any fact
indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1)
of Article 14. A party to arbitration proceedings may, in addition,
propose the disqualification of an arbitrator on the ground that he
was ineligible for appointment to the Tribunal under Section 2 of
Chapter IV.

101. The last sentence of Article 57 appears to confirm OJEG’s interpretation in that it provides
that a party “may” in addition (i.e., to disqualification for manifest lack of the qualities
required by Article 14(1)) propose disqualification as a remedy also in a case in which the
arbitrator “was ineligible for appointment to the Tribunal under Section 2 of
Chapter IV.”!?? Notably, Section 2 includes Article 40(2), which requires that “[a]rbitrators

appointed from outside the Panel of Arbitrators shall possess the qualities stated in

agreement that the tribunal was properly constituted at the first session with the parties. See A. Broches, Convention
on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States of 1965, Explanatory Notes
and Survey of its Application in AJ van den Berg (ed.), Yearbook Commercial Arbitration, Vol. XVIII (1993), 627,
662-663. ICSID practice indicates that it is not uncommon for tribunals to ask the parties during the first session to
confirm that the tribunal was duly constituted, in order to avoid untimely, subsequent challenges. Bishop-Marchili,
cit. footnote. 21, 4] 5.17. See also 2016 ICSID Paper, § 78 (OILA-117).

21 Counter-Memorial on Annulment, § 87. For support, OIEG cites R. Doak Bishop & Silvia M. Marchili, Annulment
Under the ICSID Convention (Oxford University Press, 2012), pp. 50-51 (OILA-77). Upon a close examination of
that source, it is true that its authors posit such a possible intent on the part of the drafters, but they ultimately are
equivocal as to the interplay between Article 52(1)(a) and disqualification. /d., p. 53. Regardless, herein, the
Committee finds ample support for such a distinction in the text and context of Articles 52(1)(a) and 57 of the
Convention, as confirmed by the travaux préparatoires.

'2 Notably, in presenting a quotation of Article 57, including its last sentence, the Applicant describes that the
provision “regulates the possible grounds for disqualification.” See Reply on Annulment, § 71.

Case 1:16-cv-01533-ABJ Document 52-1 Filed 12/10/18 Page 38 of 135

paragraph (1) of Article 14.” Thus, even in the case of an arbitrator’s lack of qualities
required for the proper constitution of the Tribunal, the remedy expressly identified in the
ICSID Convention is not annulment under Article 52(1)(a) but disqualification under
Article 57. If this is so at the time of constitution of the tribunal, there is no evident basis
to draw the opposite conclusion where a condition of dependence or partiality arises due
to a change of circumstances at a later point in the proceeding. Thus, the distinction in the
ICSID system between annulment and disqualification means that Article 57 regulating

disqualification is to the exclusion of Article 52(1)(a) regulating annulment.

As supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32 of the VCLT, the drafting
history of the ICSID Convention confirms the Committee’s conclusions.'> During the
drafting, a proposal similar to the interpretation now advanced by the Applicant was
rejected when the States did not agree to add a provision “which would allow annulment
of the award where disqualification could have been possible had it been made before the
award was rendered.”!*4 In the context of that discussion, Mr. Broches observed, “if the
grounds for disqualification only became known after the award was rendered, this would

be a new fact which would enable a revision of the award.”!?5

Similarly, the 2016 ICSID Paper observes that:

the drafting history of the ICSID Convention indicates that the
ground of improper constitution of the Tribunal was intended to
cover situations such as a departure from the parties’ agreement on
the method of constituting the Tribunal or an arbitrator’s failure to
meet the nationality or other requirements for becoming a member
of the Tribunal.!7°

In addition to the above VCLT analysis, the Committee considers in chronological order
the three cases that the Parties have presented in addressing this issue. The first is Azurix

v. Argentina, in which the committee considered whether a challenge addressed in the

Convention to support their respective cases. See generally Tr. Day 2, pp. 528-548.

Case 1:16-cv-01533-ABJ Document 52-1 Filed 12/10/18 Page 39 of 135

underlying proceeding pursuant to ICSID Convention Articles 57 and 58, could be
reviewed on annulment under Article 52(1)(a).'?’ In answering the question in the negative,

the Azurix committee reasoned that:

Article 52 does not state that “any fact indicating a manifest lack of the
qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14” will constitute a
ground of annulment. Rather, the ground of annulment in Article
52(1)(a) is that the tribunal was “not properly constituted”. The
procedure for constituting the tribunal, including the procedure for
challenging arbitrators on grounds of a manifest lack of the qualities
required by Article 14(1), is established by other provisions of the
ICSID Convention. If [such] procedures have been properly complied
with, the Committee considers that the tribunal will be properly
constituted for the purposes of Article 52(1)(a).'2*

105. The Azurix committee thus found that the review of a decision on disqualification would
amount to an improper “de novo opportunity to challenge members of the tribunal after the
tribunal has already given its award.”'?? As recorded by OIEG, the Azurix committee —

consistent with Mr. Broches’ observations set forth above — further stated,

[iJn the event that the party only became aware of the grounds for
disqualification of the arbitrator after the award was rendered, this
newly discovered fact may provide a basis for revision of the award
under Article 51 of the ICSID Convention but, in the Committee’s view,
such a newly discovered fact would not provide a ground of annulment
under Article 52(1)(a). If no proposal for disqualification is made by a
party under Article 57, there will be no decision under Article 58, and
in such a case there can [...] be no basis for contending that the tribunal
was not properly constituted by reason of any failure to comply with
Article 57 or Article 58.!°

106. The second case is Vivendi v. Argentina II, in which the committee considered Argentina’s
argument that the tribunal was not properly constituted under Article 52(1)(a), because of

an arbitrator’s purported conflict of interest during the proceedings, which was discovered

only after the issuance of the Award in question.'*! According to the Vivendi I] committee,

this was a question that could be reviewed on annulment.!*?

Similarly, in EDF v. Argentina (the third case addressed by the Parties), at issue was
Argentina’s challenge to an arbitrator based on a purported conflict that was discovered
between the time the proceedings had closed and the time of the Award.!*> According to
the EDF committee, a challenge based on Article 14(1) was “a ground on which an award
might be annulled under Article 52(1)(a).”'54 The EDF committee observed the holdings

of Azurix and Vivendi II as follows:

The Committee has taken careful note of the views of the Azurix
Committee [...] that [...] the issue should be raised in proceedings for
revision under Article 51 and not for annulment but it respectfully
disagrees and prefers the approach of the Vivendi IJ Committee [...].'*°

For the above-stated reasons concerning the ordinary meaning of Article 52(1)(a), and its
context within the ICSID Convention and Rules, as confirmed by the Convention
negotiating history, this Committee is respectfully unable to share the holding and
conclusion of the committees in Vivendi IJ and EDF, and instead prefers those of the Azurix
committee. This interpretation maintains the distinction between the rules and standards
concerning tribunal formation, arbitrator challenges and annulment, thus facilitating the

operation of the Convention and Rules, as the drafters intended.'*°

Accordingly, the Committee finds that the Applicant’s claims of partiality and dependence

are inadmissible as grounds for annulment under Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention.

(2) Application of the Legal Standard to the Present Case

a. Factual Background

110. The Applicant invokes this ground for annulment based on the following factual

background.

111. On March 4, 2015, in Fabrica de Vidrios Los Andes, C.A. and Owens-Illinois de Venezuela,

C.A. v. the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/21) (“Favianca v.
Venezuela”), Mr. Mourre, then a member of the tribunal in that case, informed the parties
that in May 2015 he would enter into a consultancy agreement with Dechert with the title

of Special Counsel. The letter to the parties in Favianca v. Venezuela stated as follows:

As from May 2015, I will leave Castaldi Mourre & Partners to
establish my own individual arbitrator practice. I will also as from
then have a consultancy agreement with the law firm of Dechert LLP
with the title of Special Counsel. At Dechert, I will only work on
specific matters on which Dechert will ask me to participate, and I
will have no access whatsoever to databases for matters other than
those on which I will work directly. I will have a fixed compensation
from Dechert and will not share in its profits or costs. My arbitrator’s
work will therefore be completely separate from Dechert. As a
consequence, I do not consider me a Dechert lawyer for conflict
purposes and I do not see Dechert’s activities, except for the Dechert
cases I work on, to be such as to cast any doubt on my independence
and impartiality.

I am however informing the parties, for the sake of transparency,
that Dechert has within the past year been adverse to the Bolivarian
Republic of Venezuela and/or Petroleos de Venezuela in six
litigation matters that are entirely unrelated to the present
arbitration. I have no additional information on these cases and, for
the avoidance of doubt, I of course confirm that I will not participate
in any manner in any work of Dechert with respect to the Bolivarian
Republic of Venezuela, Petroleos de Venezuela or any other entity
related to the Republic of Venezuela.'>7

112. Mr. Mourre did not send such a letter to the Parties in the Underlying Arbitration.

113. On that same date, March 4, 2015, the Tribunal notified the Parties that the proceeding was

declared closed in accordance with Arbitration Rule 38(1).!°8

114. On March 9, 2015, Venezuela replied to Mr. Mourre’s communication in Favianca v.
Venezuela alleging that the information received raised doubts about his ability to act as an
independent and impartial arbitrator in the cases in which Venezuela was a party and

seeking additional information.!*° In particular, Venezuela requested:

* The date of commencement of the negotiations or talks between
Mr. Mourre and Dechert LLP that led to the decision to join the law
firm under the terms disclosed on 4 March 2015.

* The date on which those negotiations or talks concluded through
the agreement disclosed on 4 March 2015.

* The identity of the persons who conducted those negotiations or
talks between Mr. Mourre and Dechert LLP and the place or places
where they were held.

+ A list of the cases in which Dechert LLP acts as attorney or counsel
in—domestic or international—arbitration or court proceedings
against Latin American States or their instrumentalities, including
details on the stage of the proceedings, industry, subject matter,
claimant and—in the case of arbitration proceedings—institution
conducting the proceedings and names of the members of the
tribunal.

+ A list of the duties to be performed by Mr. Mourre as from May
2015 in his capacity as “Special Counsel’ for Dechert LLP.

+ A list of the team of in-house attorneys and external advisors with
which Mr. Mourre will work as legal consultant within Dechert
LLP, including the organizational chart on the basis of which he will
receive his work requests and/or instructions.

with Dechert LLP or thereafter, a list of the cases in which Mr.

Mourre will participate, including the industries and subject matters
involved.'*°

115. On March 10, 2015, the Award was dispatched to the Parties in the present case. The dates
of signature of the Award are as follows: Mr. Mourre signed on February 20, 2015;
Mr. Orrego Vicuiia on February 26, 2015; and the President, Prof. Fernandez-Armesto, on

March 4, 2015.

116. In response to Venezuela’s additional information request in Favianca v. Venezuela, on

March 11, 2015, Mr. Mourre sent a letter to the parties in the following terms:
Dear Ms. Planells-Valero,

I acknowledge receipt of a communication dated March 9, 2015
from counsel for the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in this case.
In this communication, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela
requests additional information regarding my communication to the
parties dated March 4, 2015, stating however that my future
professional relationship with Dechert LLP “is such as to generate
conflicts of interest that are not compatible with the requirements
that an arbitrator must meet under the ICSID Convention”
(arbitrator’s translation). In this regard, I can only confirm that my
professional relationship with this law firm — which will only start
on May Irst [sic] — is not such as to generate any conflict since, (i)
my arbitrator’s work (including in this case) will be totally separated
from Dechert, (ii) I will not be a partner in Dechert and I will have
no access whatsoever to their databases, (iii) my relationship with
Dechert will be limited to specific matters on which Dechert will
ask me to participate, and (iv) I will not have any involvement (and
information on) in the cases on which Dechert may act against the
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela or related entities. Therefore, I
am unable to provide any information relating to cases in which
Dechert may be acting against the Republic or related governmental
entities, since I don’t have that information and I don’t have access
to it. I can only add that the conversations that led to the
establishment of this professional relationship were informally
conducted with Dr. Eduardo Silva Romero, with whom I have a
longstanding friendship, and were concluded shortly before I made
my declaration. Based on this, I can only confirm my total
independence and impartiality. | however understand and respect

the position of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. In view of the
importance attached to all arbitrators having the full confidence of
the parties, if the Republic still believes that my statement is not
compatible with my duties of independence and impartiality, I will
have no choice but to resign as arbitrator in this case.

Sincerely yours,
Alexis Mourre!!

117. On March 13, 2015, Venezuela filed a proposal for the disqualification of arbitrators Alexis

Mourre and Yves Fortier in Favianca v. Venezuela.'”

118. On March 16, 2015, Mr. Mourre resigned as an arbitrator in Favianca v. Venezuela'* and
on March 18, 2015 he also resigned his position in Longreef Investments A.V.V. v.
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (ICSID Case No. ARB/11/5) (“Longreef’ v.

Venezuela”).'4

119. In Longreef v. Venezuela, the resignation of Mr. Mourre was accepted by the other two
members of the tribunal,'*5 and in Favianca v. Venezuela, the Chairman of the
Administrative Council of ICSID held that, in light of Mr. Mourre’s resignation, it was “no

longer necessary to address the proposal for his disqualification, which is accordingly

dismissed.”"4°

Both Parties appear to acknowledge that the consultancy arrangement between Mr. Mourre

and Dechert never materialized.!4”

b. Applicant’s Position

The Applicant argues that the contractual or professional relationship established between
Mr. Mourre and Dechert — in addition to his personal friendship with one of its main
partners — “severely and irretrievably affected his impartiality and independent
judgment.”'*® This is so because the decisions and opinions expressed by Mr. Mourre in
cases in which Venezuela is a party “would have been of great importance for the other
cases” in which Dechert acts against Venezuela or its government-owned company
Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (“PDVSA”).'? As an example, the Applicant refers to
Convial v. Peru'*® in which Dechert acted for the claimants and offered an interpretation
of the content of the fair and equitable treatment standard under international law “which

is radically different from the position adopted by” Venezuela in this proceeding. '*!

The Applicant further claims that Mr. Mourre should have disclosed this relationship in the
present proceeding and his failure to do so precluded Venezuela from exercising its right
to request explanations and to eventually propose his disqualification.!*? In this regard, the
Applicant adds that the situation is analogous to that of Vivendi v. Argentina II and EDF v.
Argentina, since the party seeking the annulment did not have access to the relevant
information before the proceeding was closed and thus it is “the annulment committee that

must resolve the issue for the first time.”!>

447 See, e.g., Tr. Day 1, Mr. Nistal (Counsel for OIEG), 112:3-4 (“It is also undisputed that Mr. Mourre never got to
work with Dechert.”); Tr. Day 2, Mr. Volterra (Counsel for OIEG), 447:11-14; Counter-Memorial on Annulment,

However, the Applicant points out that the situation in this case differs from Vivendi v.
Argentina IT, because in such case this ground for annulment was rejected on the basis of
the explanations given by the challenged arbitrator, Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler, who objected
to the challenge.'* Instead, in Favianca v. Venezuela and Longreef v. Venezuela,
Mr. Mourre — unlike what happened with Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler — “did not challenge the
proposal for disqualification but expressly stated that the Republic’s position as to the
incompatibility between his situation and the duties of independence and impartiality left

him with no choice but to resign.”!°°

The Applicant concludes that, in the instant case, given the similar circumstances as in

Favianca v. Venezuela and Longreef v. Venezuela,

there is no alternative but to assume that, if Mr. Mourre had also
disclosed in this proceeding that he had been hired by the law firm
Dechert LLP (as he should have done), then he would have resigned
from his position as arbitrator by virtue of his conflicts of interest
and, therefore, the Award that is now sought to be annulled would
not have been rendered.'°°

The Applicant states that at the time the Award was signed and the proceeding declared
closed, Mr. Mourre “knew that he was affected by a conflict of interest [of] which he
believed” the parties had to be informed in Favianca v. Venezuela.'>’ Further, for the
Applicant, (i) on the one hand, the fact that the Award was rendered when the conflict of
interest was already present “precludes any possibility of validating [Mr. Mourre’s]

158

acts, and (ii) on the other hand, the fact that the Award was unanimous does not

preclude annulment on the basis of this ground.'®° The Applicant argues that it “cannot be

truly known, nor assumed to be true [...] that Mr. Mourre had no effect on the shaping of

the Tribunal’s opinion in any of the points decided upon.”!°

The Applicant adds that the improper constitution of the Tribunal is “aggravated and
confirmed” by the following circumstances. Even though the Award was dispatched on
March 10, 2015, the Award “was issued” on March 4, 2015, the same date of the closure

of the proceeding.'*!

What is more, the other two arbitrators, Mr. Mourre and
Mr. Orrego Vicuiia, signed before the closure of the proceeding, on February 20, 2015 and
February 26, 2015, respectively, and “[t]his irregularity in itself constitutes a departure

from a fundamental rule of procedure which warrants the annulment of the award.”!

The Applicant contends that the conflict of interest “does not arise upon initiation of
Mr. Mourre’s actual work as Special Counsel for Dechert LLP, but with the incompatible
professional negotiations that ended up giving rise to that contract” and that necessarily

predated the closure of the proceedings and the issuance of the Award.'®

For the Applicant, the facts that have been proven are “sufficient to establish the lack of an
appearance of impartiality of Mr. Mourre” and, in any event, the lack of any additional
evidence that could be deemed necessary cannot be attributed to Venezuela, but to
Mr. Mourre’s “refusal” to provide it!“ Furthermore, the Applicant asserts that Mr.
Mourre’s refusal to provide the information requested “does not reduce but rather ratifies

the need to proceed with the annulment.”!°5

c. Respondent on Annulment’s Position
As mentioned above, OIEG argues that the Applicant’s arguments on this ground for
annulment fail as a matter of law and as a matter of fact. The Applicant’s request fails as a

matter of law because the annulment ground under Article 52(1)(a) is not the proper

procedural avenue to challenge the lack of impartiality or independence of Mr. Mourre.
OIEG states that, on this basis alone, the Committee should reject this ground for

annulment.

130. OJEG further argues that the Applicant’s Application on the basis of this ground fails as a
matter of fact because, even under the Applicant’s own “misinterpretation” of the
applicable legal standard, the Applicant has failed to discharge its burden of proving (i) the
existence of facts indicating that Mr. Mourre manifestly lacked impartiality or
independence in the Underlying Arbitration; and (ii) that Mr. Mourre’s alleged loss of those

qualities could have had a material effect on the Award.

(i) Article 52(1)(a) is not the proper procedural avenue to challenge the lack
of impartiality or independence of Mr. Mourre

131. This argument from the Respondent on Annulment has already been summarized above.
Notably, OIEG adds that the Applicant had “at least two alternative procedural avenues
available to it to raise its concerns regarding the impartiality or independence of Arbitrator
Mourre, requesting: (a) that the Tribunal reopen the proceeding; or (b) revision of the
Award.”'® Additionally, for OIEG:

Both procedural avenues presented significant advantages over the
course of action the Applicant decided to follow. Not only would
pursuit of each avenue have been consistent with the ICSID
Convention, but also it would have allowed the issue to be decided
by the appropriate adjudicators. If the Applicant had requested either
the reopening of the proceeding or the revision of the Award and
then submitted a disqualification proposal, that proposal would have
been decided by Arbitrators Fernandez-Armesto and Orrego
Vicufia, as mandated by the provisions of the ICSID Convention that
govern the disqualification of arbitrators. Unlike this Committee,
those arbitrators would have had access to the entire record of [the]
OIEG Arbitration and, by definition, would have been in a better
position to assess the potential effect of Arbitrator Mourre’s contacts
with Dechert on his ability to exercise independent or impartial
judgment in that arbitration.'©”

134.

Case 1:16-cv-01533-ABJ Document 52-1 Filed 12/10/18 Page 49 of 135

Further, OIEG points out that, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 9(4), if the Applicant
had sought either to reopen the proceeding or to request the revision of the Award, and then
submitted a disqualification proposal, Mr. Mourre would have been able to furnish
explanations.'® By choosing to raise its concerns only in the annulment proceeding,
however, “the Applicant necessarily deprived him of that right and now seeks to have the
Committee engage in a level of speculation regarding Arbitrator Mourre’s actions that is
not only artificial, but also simply contrary to the legal standard applicable to the

disqualification of arbitrators under the ICSID Convention.”!

Finally, OIEG asserts that, if the Applicant had opted for requesting the reopening of the
proceeding “immediately after Arbitrator Mourre’s 4 March 2015 disclosure, with a view
to moving for his disqualification, any disqualification proposal would have complied with
the temporal requirement of ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(1)”!” (i.e. to submit the
disqualification proposal “promptly” after the discovery of the relevant facts). Instead, the
Applicant chose to raise its concerns for the first time in this annulment proceeding, that
is, more than four months after Mr. Mourre’s disclosure. Such period of time, as confirmed

by “ICSID jurisprudence,” cannot possibly meet the “promptly” requirement.!7!

(ii) Even under its own misinterpretation of Article 52(1)(a), the Applicant has

failed to discharge its burden of proof
OIEG argues that, even under the Applicant’s interpretation of Article 52(1)(a), the
Applicant has the burden to prove: (a) the existence of facts that would indicate that
Mr. Mourre manifestly lacked independence or impartiality at end of the Underlying
Arbitration; and (b) that Mr. Mourre’s loss of those qualities at that stage of the proceeding
could have had a material effect on the Award.'”* OIEG contends that the Applicant has

“manifestly failed to discharge its burden of proof for both requirements.”!”>

> The Applicant has failed to prove the existence of facts indicating
Mr. Mourre’s manifest lack of impartiality or independence
OIEG first argues that there is no evidence on the record suggesting a dependency

relationship between Mr. Mourre and Dechert.!”4

Second, OIEG states that the Applicant has failed to prove that Dechert had an interest in
the outcome of the Underlying Arbitration.'”> OIEG explains that, while it appears that
Dechert has represented claimants against the Applicant in a number of proceedings, “the
Applicant has not provided any evidence to suggest that those proceedings were related in

even the most remote way to the [Underlying] Arbitration.”'”°

Third, even assuming that Dechert had an interest in the outcome of the Underlying
Arbitration, “the Applicant has failed to prove that this could have an effect on Arbitrator
Mourre’s impartiality or independence.”'”’ In this regard, OIEG points out that the
Applicant has not provided any evidence that Mr. Mourre “was privy to any information
regarding the arguments made by Dechert on behalf of its clients” in such proceedings.'78
On the contrary, Mr. Mourre’s letter of March 11, 2015 made clear that he did not have
access to such information.!” Further, the Applicant has failed to prove that Mr. Mourre
would have benefited “in a material way from Dechert’s success” in those other cases.'*°
As Mr. Mourre explained, he would be neither a “Partner” nor a “Dechert lawyer” and he
would “have a fixed compensation from Dechert and [would] not share in its profits or

costs,”!8!

OIEG further objects to the Applicant’s suggestion that Mr. Mourre’s alleged “refusal” to
provide additional information should lead the Committee to conclude that a conflict of

interest existed, or that he lacked independence or impartiality. In this regard, first, OIEG

states that it is the Applicant, not the arbitrator, who bears the burden of proving the

existence of facts indicating the manifest lack of impartiality or independence. '**

Second,
OIEG adds that Mr. Mourre did not “refuse” to provide the information requested by the
Applicant. As it “is clear from his 11 March 2015 communication, he responded to those
of the Applicant’s demands to which he was able to respond and considered reasonable.”!*°
Third, “Arbitrator Mourre explicitly and repeatedly ‘confirm[ed] [his] total independence
and impartiality’. He cannot be expected to provide evidence proving the opposite of what

he firmly believed.”!*4

OIEG also rejects the Applicant’s argument that Mr. Mourre lacked impartiality and
independence because he failed to disclose his professional relationship with Dechert in
the Underlying Arbitration, while disclosing it in Favianca v. Venezuela.'** For OIEG this
argument fails as a matter of law because a non-disclosure does not in itself result in
disqualification — it is only the facts and circumstances that were not disclosed that can do
so.'®° Additionally, according to OIEG the argument must fail as a matter of fact, since
there are differences between the two proceedings that “could justify Arbitrator Mourre’s
decision to make his disclosure in Favianca and OldV v. Venezuela but not in the OJEG
Arbitration.”'*” In this regard, OIEG points out that Mr. Mourre’s professional relationship
with Dechert was to start from May 2015, at which point the Favianca v. Venezuela case

would still be active, while the Underlying Arbitration would have concluded.!**

OIEG further objects to the Applicant’s claim that Mr. Mourre’s letter of March 11, 2015
in Favianca v. Venezuela is an implicit admission that his future relationship with Dechert

constituted a conflict of interest in such case, as well as in the Underlying Arbitration.'*

First, OIEG states that Mr. Mourre did not admit to any conflict of interest in Favianca v.
Venezuela. On the contrary, Mr. Mourre made clear that “his resignation was not based on
the existence of a conflict of interest, stating unequivocally that it was based on the
Applicant’s ‘belie[fs]’ regarding his ‘duties of independence and impartiality’ and on the

importance he attached to ‘having the full confidence of the parties.””!°°

Second, even assuming that this communication constituted an admission of a conflict of
interest in Favianca v. Venezuela, “that would not mean that the same conflict existed in
the OJEG Arbitration or that Arbitrator Mourre would have resigned in that case, too.”!9!
As mentioned before, while Mr. Mourre’s relationship with Dechert “would have
overlapped in time with the proceedings in Favianca and OldV v. Venezuela and in
Longreef v. Venezuela, it could not have overlapped with the O/EG Arbitration.”!°”

Additionally, OIEG rejects the Applicant’s argument that “the dates of the closure and
signature [of the Award] were manipulated and distorted to preclude the exercise of [a]

fundamental right of the Republic.”!°? In this regard, OIEG contends that:

In addition to being serious and lamentable, this accusation by the
Applicant is completely devoid of factual support or merit. The
Applicant has not offered even the semblance of evidence that there
was manipulation, alteration or distortion of the dates of the signing
of the Award, much less with the malicious intent of depriving the
Applicant of its rights under the Convention.!°+

> — The Applicant has also failed to prove that Mr. Mourre’s alleged loss
of impartiality or independence at the end of the proceeding could
have had a material effect on the Award
OIEG argues that there are a number of facts that show that any loss of impartiality or
independence by Mr. Mourre resulting from his conversations with a member of Dechert

could not have had a material effect on the Award.'°

First, OIEG points out that (i) Mr. Mourre expressly confirmed that his conversations with
Dechert were conducted shortly before he made his March 4, 2015 declaration;!°° (ii) by
that date all three members of the Tribunal had signed the Award, in fact, Mr. Mourre had
signed it almost two weeks before; and (iii) six days later, on March 10, 2015, the Award
was dispatched to the Parties.'97 According to OIEG, “[t]hese facts, by themselves, militate
strongly in favour of a conclusion that the Award had been finalised by the time Arbitrator

Mourre reached any consultancy agreement with Dechert.”!°*

OIEG rejects the Applicant’s counter-argument that the conflict of interest began earlier,
when Mr. Mourre began his negotiations with Dechert.'°? OIEG explains that, as confirmed
by EDF v. Argentina, the burden of proving that the conversations with Dechert could have
had a material impact on the Award lies on the Applicant.?°° OIEG contends that if, as the
Applicant has expressly recognized, “it is impossible to determine whether the
deliberations of the Tribunal were ongoing at the time the conversations took place, then,
by definition the Applicant has failed to show that those conversations could have had a
material effect on the Award.””°! OIEG notes that, in any event, the Secretary of the

Tribunal sent a letter to the Parties on December 8, 2014 stating that at that time the

Tribunal was reviewing “a complete draft of the Award,”?°? which again would be a strong
suggestion that Mr. Mourre’s conversations with Dechert took place after deliberations had

finished.?°>

Second, OIEG argues that, contrary to the Applicant’s arguments, the fact that the Award
was unanimous “firmly indicates that Arbitrator Mourre’s alleged loss of impartiality or

independence could not have had a material effect on the Award.”?4

Third, OIEG contends that the fact that “at any relevant time, Arbitrator Mourre did not
have any knowledge of the details of the cases in which Dechert is (or was) involved (or
of any other circumstance that could generate a conflict of interest) constitutes yet another
factor that strongly indicates that his [relationship with Dechert] could not have had a
material effect on the Award.”?°> OIEG relies on Vivendi v. Argentina II, where the
committee decided not to annul the award, among other reasons, because
Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler maintained that she had found out about the connection between
UBS (the bank for which she was appointed to the board of directors, and which held shares

of one of the claimants) and the claimants only after the issuance of the award.?°°

d. The Committee’s Analysis

As set forth above in Section III.B(1)c, the Committee disagrees with the Applicant’s
position that in the circumstances of the present case the only available remedy was the
annulment of the Award. Instead, in the Committee’s view, and as argued by OIEG,”” in
the case of discovery of relevant new facts after the Tribunal has already closed the
proceedings under Arbitration Rule 38(1) but before the issuance of the Award, the

Applicant could have requested that the Tribunal reopen the proceedings under Arbitration

Rule 38(2).?°8 If the Tribunal had already issued the Award, the Applicant could have

requested the revision of the Award under Article 51.7" It appears based on the chronology

that both avenues were available to the Applicant.!°

150. As regards Mr. Mourre’s March 4, 2015 communication in Favianca, the Applicant could
have requested the Tribunal prior to the issuance of its Award on March 10, 2015 to reopen
the proceeding under Arbitration Rule 38(2) to entertain Mr. Mourre’s disqualification in
view of concerns expressed by the Applicant in its letter to the Favianca tribunal dated
March 9, 2015.2!!

151. Alternatively, the Applicant could have requested a revision of the Award on the basis of
either (i) Mr. Mourre’s communication of March 11, 2015 in Favianca as regards his

“undisclosed prior negotiations” with Dechert which, according to the Applicant, “embody

212

the elements that show Mr. Mourre’s loss of impartiality or (ii) Mr. Mourre’s

resignation in Favianca and Longreef on March 16 and March 18, 2015 respectively, both

of which represent the “discovery” of the “fact” of Mr. Mourre’s purported lack of

213

independence and impartiality.~'’ Since both events post-date the issuance of the Award in

the Underlying Arbitration, the condition under Article 51 for requesting revision would

have been met.

152. If the Applicant had raised the issue in the Underlying Arbitration under one of these other
mechanisms, Mr. Mourre would have been requested to give his explanations in the context

of the OJEG Arbitration which, under the scenario that in fact unfolded, were not provided.

208 ICSID Arbitration Rule 38(2) provides: “Exceptionally, the Tribunal may, before the award has been rendered,
reopen the proceeding on the ground that new evidence is forthcoming of such a nature as to constitute a decisive
factor, or that there is a vital need for clarification on certain specific points.”

20 ICSID Convention Article 51 provides in pertinent part as follows: “(1) Either party may request revision of the
award [...] on the ground of discovery of some fact of such a nature as decisively to affect the award, provided that
when the award was rendered that fact was unknown to the Tribunal and to the applicant and that the applicant’s
ignorance of that fact was not due to negligence.” Under Article 51(2), the applicant must pursue revision within
90 days after the discovery of such new fact, but in any event within three years from the date of the Award. See also
Azurix v. Argentina, §] 281 (OILA-89); History, p. 872.

210 See supra Section III.B(2)a.

211 See supra § 114.

212 Reply on Annulment, 57.

213 The condition for the application of Article 51 is the “discovery of some fact of such a nature as decisively to affect
the award.” See supra footnote 209.

Case 1:16-cv-01533-ABJ Document 52-1 Filed 12/10/18 Page 56 of 135

Such explanations likely would have been different than those he provided in Favianca in
view of the timeline of that case, as compared to the OE/G Arbitration, and the timing of
his never-consummated agreement with Dechert.?'* The advantage of either a reopening or
revision would have been to allow the possibility for the members of the original tribunal
to consider the Applicant’s request.?!5 Such an outcome would have been consistent with
the letter and the spirit of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules, as set forth and

interpreted herein by the Committee.

For these reasons and those detailed above in Section III.B(1)c, this Committee has found
that the Applicant’s charge of Mr. Mourre’s lack of impartiality is inadmissible as a ground
for annulment under Article 52(1)(a). Indeed, this Committee has concluded that the ICSID
Convention provides other mechanisms for a party to seek redress in circumstances like

those present in the Underlying Arbitration.

Even if it were otherwise, the Committee has concluded in Section III.D(2)c below
(addressing the grounds for annulment under Article 52(1)(d)) that the Applicant has failed
to make a factual showing of a lack of impartiality. Further, even if the Applicant had
established Mr. Mourre’s partiality or appearance thereof, the Applicant has failed to
establish, especially given the timeline of the allegations, that the alleged partiality had, or
even could have had, an impact on the outcome of the unanimous Award. Rather, as
elaborated in Section III.D(2)c below, the evidence strongly supports a conclusion that the
Tribunal had already prepared “a complete draft of the Award”?!° even prior to the start
of any negotiations between Mr. Mourre and Dechert. Not only does the alleged
relationship fail to satisfy the disqualification standard, but also there has been no showing
that the impugned relationship overlapped in time with the Tribunal’s substantive

deliberations.

214 See supra § 139 (as pointed out by OIEG, Mr. Mourre’s professional relationship with Dechert was to start from
May 2015, at which point the Favianca v. Venezuela case would still be active, while the Underlying Arbitration
would have concluded); supra §| 142 (as argued by OIEG, Mr. Mourre’s relationship with Dechert “would have
overlapped in time with the proceedings in Favianca and OldV v. Venezuela and in Longreef v. Venezuela, it could
not have overlapped with the O/EG Arbitration”).

155. In this regard, as noted above, both Parties have invoked and addressed at length the
decision of the committee in EDF v. Argentina.?'” As also noted above, contrary to this
Committee’s finding, the EDF committee held that a lack of the qualities “required under
Article 14(1) [...] is [] a ground on which an award might be annulled under Article

52(1)(a).”?!8 However, the EDF committee also concluded that:

in a case in which an application for annulment is made on the basis
that there were reasonable grounds to doubt the independence or
impartiality of one of the arbitrators and no proposal for
disqualification had been made before the proceedings were
declared closed, the role of an ad hoc committee is to decide the
following questions:-

(a) was the right to raise this matter waived because the party
concerned had not raised it sufficiently promptly ?

(b) if not, has the party seeking annulment established facts the
existence of which would cause a reasonable person, with
knowledge of all the facts, to consider that there were reasonable
grounds for doubting that an arbitrator possessed the requisite
qualities of independence and impartiality ? and

(c) if so, could the lack of impartiality or independence on the part
of that arbitrator — assuming for this purpose that the doubts were
well-founded — have had a material effect on the award ??!°

156. The Applicant has failed to establish either prong (b) or (c), as detailed below in

Section III.D(2)c. Thus, applying even this test, this Committee’s decision to reject the

application for annulment under Article 52(1)(a) would remain undisturbed.

Cc. THE TRIBUNAL HAS MANIFESTLY EXCEEDED ITS POWERS
qd) Legal Standard
a. Applicant’s Position

157. In advancing its view that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, the Applicant
argues that the Committee should adopt the two-step approach of the most recent and
representative annulment decisions, first “determining whether there was an excess of

powers and, if so, whether that excess was manifest.”?? The Applicant acknowledges

that “[i]t is a dual requirement.””?!

158. As for the ways in which a tribunal may exceed its powers, the Applicant contends that the
excess may arise when a tribunal: (i) inappropriately exercises jurisdiction (or fails to

exercise jurisdiction); or (ii) fails to apply the proper law.?”

159. With regard to (i) the “jurisdictional” excess of powers, the Applicant points out that
multiple annulment committees have explained that awards can be annulled if tribunals (a)
assume powers to which they are not entitled; or (b) do not use the powers that have been

vested upon the tribunal by the parties.???

224

160. Furthermore, the Applicant argues that in MHS v. Malaysia*** the “committee noted that

manifest excess of powers in asserting jurisdiction over a given issue must consist in a de

novo review.”

161. Regarding item (ii) above,””° the Applicant explains that a “substantive” excess of powers

happens when a tribunal “fail[s] to apply the proper law, since it would also be disregarding

the powers granted to it by the parties.”??7

162. As for the second requirement in the two-step approach, citing the annulment committees

in Sempra v. Argentina’ and Soufraki v. UAE,2° the Applicant states that “manifest”

means “clear,” “plain,” “obvious” or “evident” or easily understood or recognized by the

mind.?°°

163. However, the Applicant further argues that “the need for such excess to be clear does not
mean that the committee must not analyze the arguments raised by the parties.”?3! In this
regard, the Applicant relies on the statement of the Pey Casado v. Chile committee that

“extensive argumentation and analysis do not exclude the possibility of concluding that

99232

there is a manifest excess of power, as long as it is sufficiently clear and serious. In

similar words, the Caratube v. Kazakhstan®® and Occidental v. Ecuador** committees
also reiterated that the manifest requirement does not prevent that in some cases extensive
argumentation and analysis may be required to prove that such a manifest excess of power

has in fact occurred.

164. Additionally, the Applicant cites Philippe Pinsolle,~’? who explains that:

Manifest means obvious, but this adjective relates only to the excess
of powers itself. Establishing the existence of an excess of powers,
as distinct from assessing its degree, may not be obvious. If the word
“manifest” relates to degree in which the tribunal exceeded its
powers, it does not necessarily imply that the error (in our case, the
excess of powers) must be detected easily.

In other words, “manifest excess of powers” is not synonymous with
“prima facie excess of powers”.

Prima facie review would mean that the excess of powers should be
apparent on the face of the award, thereby limiting considerably the
extent of review. If the review was a prima facie test only,
competent drafting of the award would in all likelihood render it
immune from subsequent challenge. This cannot be so, especially
when jurisdictional issues are concerned. This never was, in any
event, the practice of ad hoc committees.?*°

165. The Applicant further contends that the EDF v. Argentina committee confirmed that a
tribunal’s damages calculation may result in annulment if “in assessing damages, [it]

manifestly exceeds its power by failing to apply (as opposed to arguably misapplying) the

applicable law.”?57

166. In opposing OIEG’s statement of the standard as biased and incorrect, the Applicant
contends that OIEG “confuses the difference between an annulment proceeding and an
appeal with the lack of an effective annulment proceeding.”™* As regards OIEG’s

invocation of Kompetenz-Kompetenz to assert that “the Committee cannot replace the

9239

tribunal’s decision on jurisdiction with its own decision,”*’ the Applicant responds that it

“does not and could not disregard the validity of [this] principle.”**° However, this does

not mean that the tribunal’s decision on its own jurisdiction cannot be reviewed by an

annulment committee."!

The Applicant rejects OIEG’s interpretation of the MHS v. Malaysia decision “in support
of its unduly restrictive version of the grounds for annulment for manifest excess of
powers.” In fact, according to the Applicant, the MHS v. Malaysia committee “firmly
rejects OIEG’s biased and restrictive approach, as it does not limit its review to the
application or nominal invocation of certain legal rules, but it also analyzes the manner in
which these rules were applied, and it is pursuant to this substantial analysis that it makes

its decision” to annul the award on the grounds of manifest excess of powers."

For the Applicant, in addressing whether the applicable law was indeed applied or whether
it was invoked in a way that lacked a real normative effect, it is not necessary that the
Committee replace the Tribunal’s judgment.“ In fact, OIEG states that when a tribunal’s
decision on its jurisdiction is “reasonable or tenable,” a committee must not substitute the
tribunal’s decision with its own and, “by saying this, OIEG recognizes that if the decision
is unreasonable and untenable, a committee must replace such tribunal’s decision on
jurisdiction with its own.”*45 According to the Applicant, “[t]he only way to determine
whether the decision was ‘reasonable or tenable’ is to assess its content in relation to the

applicable legal rules, the positions of the parties and the evidence in the file.”**°

In this regard, the Applicant also notes that the Occidental v. Ecuador?” committee, while
affirming the difference between annulment proceedings and appeals, nevertheless
performed “‘a detailed analysis of the content of the decision in view of the applicable laws

and proven facts of the case, which led it to partially annul the award.”?**

b. Respondent on Annulment’s Position

170. The Respondent on Annulment agrees with the Applicant that, to establish this ground for
annulment, the Applicant must prove that (a) the Tribunal exceeded its powers and (b) the
excess was manifest.”

171. With regard to the ways in which a tribunal may exceed its powers, OIEG also agrees that
this may be done in two ways: (a) by inappropriately exercising jurisdiction (or failing to

exercise its jurisdiction), and/or (b) by failing to apply the proper law.?*’

172. However, OIEG disagrees with the Applicant’s position as to the scope of review that a
committee may undertake to determine whether a tribunal manifestly exceeded its

powers.7*!

173. As for a jurisdictional excess of powers and the standard of review of a tribunal’s decision
on its competence, OIEG first recalls that Article 41 of the ICSID Convention embraces
the general legal principle of Kompetenz-Kompetenz and argues that a committee may only

annul an award if the tribunal’s decision on jurisdiction is manifestly wrong or

untenable.”>

174. In this regard, OIEG cites the annulment decision in Soufraki v. UAE, according to which
“the requirement that an excess of power must be ‘manifest’ applies equally if the question
is one of jurisdiction.” OIEG notes that the explanation in Soufraki v. UAE has been

175. Contrary to what the Applicant argues, OIEG states that the analysis of the committee must
not consist of a de novo review and contends that the Applicant has misinterpreted the
annulment decision in MHS v. Malaysia on which it relies.2°° OIEG further argues that

committees “consistently have refused to annul awards in which a tribunal’s assumption of

99 256

jurisdiction was sensible or defensible’ and quotes the decision in Rumeli v. Kazakhstan,

which observed:

An ad hoc committee is not a court of appeal and cannot therefore
enter, within the bounds of its limited mission, into an analysis of
the probative value of the evidence produced by the parties ....
Indeed, this is why the Award can only be annulled for a manifest
excess of powers. Such lack of jurisdiction should have been evident
on the face of the award and should not require the Committee to
reconsider the evidence put before the Tribunal.

 

[a]n ad hoc committee will not annul an award if the tribunal’s
approach is reasonable or tenable, even if the committee might have
taken a different view on a debatable point of law.?°”

176. With respect to a substantive excess of powers, OIEG objects to the Applicant’s claim that
a committee should investigate the “manner” in which the proper law was applied and
determine whether it was applied “effectively.”?** On the contrary, OIEG asserts that “it is
well established in ICSID jurisprudence that only the complete failure to identify and apply
the correct body of law” — and not an error in the application of law — “can constitute

annullable error” under Article 52(1)(b).?°°

177. The Respondent on Annulment further notes that, given that an annulment proceeding is
not concerned with the substantive correctness of the award, the annulment committee is
not empowered to correct an error of law “no matter how egregious.”” Rather, citing the
annulment decision in MTD v. Chile, OIEG contends that the committee’s inquiry should

be limited to a “determination of whether or not the Tribunal endeavoured to apply” the

applicable law.

178. In relation to the second requirement that the excess be “manifest,” the Respondent on

Annulment agrees with the Applicant that a tribunal’s excess of powers must be “clear,”

“plain,” “obvious” or “evident.””°? However, in response to the Applicant’s argument that

this requirement does not preclude an assessment of extensive argumentation or analysis
in certain cases, OIEG points out that “even if this position were accepted, it would not

relax in any way the fundamental requirement that the excess of powers must be

‘manifest.””?

179. Finally, citing the annulment decision in Soufraki v. UAE, OIEG contends that to qualify
as manifest the excess of powers must be both “textually obvious and substantively
serious.” Moreover, relying on the decisions in Sempra v. Argentina and Patrick Mitchell

v. Congo, OIEG asserts that in order to find a manifest excess of powers, a committee must

do so with “certainty and immediacy, without it being necessary to engage in elaborate

analyses of the award.”6°

c. The Committee’s Analysis

There is no contention between the Parties regarding the fact that a manifest excess of
powers may derive either from a jurisdictional or substantive source. Nor is there any
disagreement regarding the fact that this ground calls for a two-step process, first
determining whether there was an excess of powers and then whether it was manifest. This
process has been adopted by several annulment committees including Sempra v. Argentina,
Fraport v. Philippines, Occidental v. Ecuador and Total v. Argentina.2° The Committee

shares this view and will therefore apply it.

The Committee concurs with the Parties and confirms that a manifest excess of powers
may arise as regards a jurisdictional determination, where a tribunal either fails to exercise

jurisdiction when it should have or exercises jurisdiction when it should not have.

In determining whether a tribunal exceeded its powers in the jurisdictional sphere, two
principles, which are deeply engrained in the Convention and have been confirmed in
numerous proceedings, are paramount: (i) Kompetenz-Kompetenz and (ii) an annulment is

not an appeal.

Although the principle of Kompetez-Kompetez does not shield the Tribunal’s decision on
its own competence from scrutiny, the principle favors a presumption of deference to the
Tribunal as regards its decision. Taken together with the fact that this process must not be
treated as an appeal, it is clear that the Committee cannot conduct a de novo analysis of the
reasoning underlying the Tribunal’s jurisdictional decision. On the contrary, and in line

with the ICSID Convention’s use of the word “manifest” in setting forth this ground for

annulment, it is only where the Tribunal’s jurisdictional decision is untenable or
unreasonable, that the Committee may annul the award, if it is to preserve the above-cited

principles of the ICSID Convention.

Despite their agreement that a manifest excess of power may be of a substantive nature,
the Parties fail to agree on how a Tribunal might exceed its powers regarding the
application of the law. Whereas the Applicant maintains that a committee should
investigate the “manner” in which the proper law was applied and determine whether it
was applied “effectively,”°’ OIEG contends that “it is well established” that “only the

complete failure to identify and apply the correct body of law” “can constitute annullable
error.”*°8 Thus, OIEG urges this Committee to find that an error in the application of law,

even if serious, is insufficient to give rise to annulment for manifest excess of powers.”

Consistent with OIEG’s position?” and that adopted by several other committees in cases
such as Enron v. Argentina, MTD v. Chile, and CMS v. Argentina," this Committee finds
that an excess of powers of substantive nature may arise only from a complete failure to
apply the correct body of law. As is clear from the drafting history of the ICSID
Convention, the intention underlying this specific ground for annulment was to exclude the

possibility of annulling an award based on an erroneous application of the law:

Chairman Broches confirmed during the meetings that failure to
apply the proper law could amount to an excess of power if the
parties had agreed on an applicable law. One proposal suggested
adding the “manifestly incorrect application of the law” by the
Tribunal as a ground of annulment, but it was defeated by a vote of
17 to 8.7

Moreover, if this Committee were to delve into how the Tribunal applied the law in the

Underlying Arbitration and base its decision on that assessment, the Committee would

Case 1:16-cv-01533-ABJ Document 52-1 Filed 12/10/18 Page 67 of 135

improperly transform this procedure into one that is in the nature of an appeal. Instead, the
Committee’s role in evaluating an application for annulment for manifest excess of powers

is limited, as follows:

in determining whether a tribunal has committed a manifest excess
of powers, an annulment committee is not empowered to verify
whether a tribunal’s jurisdictional analysis or a tribunal’s
application of the law was correct, but only whether it was tenable
as a matter of law. Even if a committee might have a different view
on a debatable issue, it is simply not within its powers to correct a
tribunal’s interpretation of the law or assessment of the facts.?”>

Lastly, as previously suggested, this Committee believes “manifest” to mean “obvious,”
“evident,” or “plain,” as the Parties’ themselves appear to have agreed.” This approach,
by its nature, excludes the possibility of a “manifest” excess of powers which cannot be
detected relatively easily. Therefore, for an excess of power to be considered manifest,
while some degree of inquiry and analysis may be required, it must not require a deep and
complex analysis to be perceived. On the contrary, the excess must be evident to the

Committee without difficulty.
(2) Application of the Legal Standard to the Present Case

a. Applicant’s Position

According to the Applicant, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by (i) asserting
jurisdiction without deciding on Venezuela’s objections and (ii) failing to apply the proper

law in calculating the compensation.

(i) The Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in asserting jurisdiction
without deciding on Venezuela's objections

The Applicant asserts that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in asserting

jurisdiction in three aspects.

23 See, e.g., TECO Guatemala Holdings LLC v. Republic of Guatemala, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/23 (Hanotiau,
Oyekunle, Sachs), Decision on Annulment, April 5, 2016 (“TECO v. Guatemala”), § 78 (VLA-49).

Case 1:16-cv-01533-ABJ Document 52-1 Filed 12/10/18 Page 68 of 135

The first aspect in which the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers refers to the
Tribunal’s rejection of Venezuela’s objection based on the lack of investment. The
Tribunal acknowledged that, according to the applicable law, the alleged investment must
not only meet the characteristics specified in the BIT but also the objective concept of
investment set forth in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, which requires the

identification of a contribution by the investor.’”°

In this regard, the Applicant explains that the Tribunal identified two contributions. The
first was undistributed reserves, that is, OIEG’s decision not to withdraw its share of the
Companies’ profits and instead keep that share as undistributed reserves. However, the
Applicant argues that in the Award “[t]here is no explanation as to how the creation of a
reserve [...] may constitute a contribution to the Companies, [...] since the reserves are
created from funds of those Companies and no transfer of funds from [OIEG] to the

Companies [...] may be identified.”?”°

For the Applicant, “the Tribunal’s decision on this matter is not supported by any
applicable rule or legal authority allowing us to claim that the lack of active cash
contribution —at least at the beginning of the alleged investment, in the Tribunal’s own
terms— can be replaced with a potential — and passive — withdrawal of funds at a later
time.””’’ On the contrary, “compensating for the lack of real contributions using alleged
contributions consisting in the lack of transfer of dividends would otherwise lead to the
fact that merely nominal changes in equity securities could be sufficient to assume the

status of protected international investor.”?”8

The Applicant notes that the Tribunal found that OIEG also contributed by managing the

companies, indirectly, since 2002, and directly, since 2005.?” This contribution was made

OIEG failed to transfer dividends as a means to reinvest in the economic flows of the Venezuelan companies.” Reply

by participating and voting in shareholders’ meetings, and appointing directors and
managers of the Companies.”*” However, the Applicant contends that the Tribunal failed
“to make any specific reference to the alleged appointments of directors and managers to
which it refers or to how those appointments may have actually impacted on the

performance of the companies.”?*!

282

For the Applicant, these defects “manifestly” arise from a reading of the Award-** and are

key to the determination of the rights of the Parties to the Underlying Arbitration.?*?

The second aspect in which the Tribunal is alleged to have manifestly exceeded its
jurisdiction refers to the Tribunal’s finding that OIEG “suffered losses in the Brazilian
market without first addressing the objection put forward by the Republic.”?** That
objection was based on the fact that the alleged damages related to assets that do not belong
to OIEG, since they were owned by another company of the Owens-Illinois group of

companies (the “OI Group”) that was not a party to the Underlying Arbitration.

The Applicant explains that the Tribunal stated that this objection could not be separated
from the substance of the dispute and that the claim would be addressed once the existence
of an expropriation is found and in the context of the determination of the compensation

due. However, the Tribunal later failed to make any observation on the objection.?*°

The third and last aspect with respect to which the Applicant alleges a manifest excess of
powers is related to the parallel proceeding in Favianca v. Venezuela. Given that the BIT
at issue and the object of that proceeding and the Underlying Arbitration “are exactly the

same,” Venezuela requested that the Favianca v. Venezuela proceeding be stayed.?*®

However, in the Award “the Tribunal refused to come to a decision on the existence of this
parallel proceeding and attempted instead to hold that the Republic did not make any claim
in this regard.”?8” In this sense, the Tribunal failed to decide on the objection raised by
Venezuela, “which was clearly within its jurisdiction, which entails the serious risk that

[Venezuela] be held liable twice for the same act.”?88

(ii) The Tribunal exceeded its powers by failing to apply the proper law in
calculating the compensation

The Applicant argues that, in calculating the damages, the Tribunal disregarded “the basic

principle establishing that the discount rate to be considered must reflect the time value of

money.”*° For the Applicant, the rate applied by the Tribunal results in a negative discount

rate for the first four years and, as explained by the expert Daniel Flores, a negative

discount rate “runs afoul of the fundamental economic principle of the time value of

money.”2%

In addition, the Applicant states that, “even though the Tribunal maintains that it is carrying
out a valuation based on the ‘market value’, that is not the standard actually applied. Thus,

the Tribunal failed to apply the standard suggested by it and exceeded its powers.”??!

Finally, in response to OIEG’s attempt to attack the credibility of the expert Daniel Flores
on the basis that he has been retained on various occasions as an expert by Venezuela, the
Applicant reaffirms Mr. Flores’ independence and points out that (i) Econ One bills the
time spent by its staff in this and all other international arbitrations involving Venezuela

and PDVSA according to pre-set hourly rates and, therefore, its compensation is not linked

applying the law applicable to the dispute, should have suspended this proceeding when the parallel arbitration began,
or it should have consolidated both proceedings in order to prevent the Republic from wasting time and money due to
the duplication of claims for compensation attempted by OIEG. By not doing so, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its
powers.”

represent a very small fraction of Econ One’s billings.’

b. Respondent on Annulment’s Position

(i) The Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers in asserting jurisdiction

> The Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers in holding that
OIEG had a covered investment under the BIT and the ICSID
Convention

201. According to OIEG, the Tribunal’s decision that OIEG’s assets qualified as investments

under both the BIT and the ICSID Convention “is eminently reasonable:”

[T]here can be no doubt that the Tribunal “correctly identified the
applicable law, and strove to apply it to the facts that it established”.
In paragraphs 196 to 206 of the Award, the Tribunal established the
relevant “proven facts”. In paragraphs 207 to 211, it correctly
identified the “applicable law”. In paragraphs 212 to 232, it
methodically and logically analysed the “the concept of investment”
and applied its findings on the law to the facts of the case. There is,
therefore, “no room for annulment”.”>

202. OJEG argues that “it is disingenuous for the Applicant to suggest that the Tribunal
considered the requirement that the investor bringing a claim must have made a
contribution to the investment to be an essential component of the applicable law.”?°4 On
the contrary, OIEG asserts that the Tribunal made clear that that requirement was a
secondary, peripheral issue and only analyzed it after having already concluded that the
assets qualified as an investment both under the BIT and the ICSID Convention.?*>

203. OJEG points out that the Applicant’s arguments regarding the lack of contribution refer to
the Tribunal’s failure to refer to specific evidence on the record.?*° In this regard, OIEG

contends that these arguments from the Applicant “make abundantly clear that its true

complaint relates to the Tribunal’s assessment and identification of the evidence on the
record.””*” Yet, previous annulment committees have confirmed that “neither disagreement
with a tribunal’s assessment of the evidence nor an alleged failure to specify the evidence
on which a specific finding is based can possibly constitute a manifest excess of powers

under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.”2%

Furthermore, OIEG argues that the Applicant’s arguments also fail as a matter of fact, since
the Tribunal reached its conclusion regarding the existence of two contributions (OIEG’s
decision not to withdraw its share of the Companies’ profits and instead to keep that share
as undistributed reserves; and OIEG’s management of the Companies) on the basis of

specific evidence before the Tribunal.?°°

> The Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers by exercising its
jurisdiction in relation to the issue of the consequential losses in the
Brazilian market

OIEG rejects the Applicant’s contention that the Tribunal failed to address or decide on the
jurisdictional objection regarding Venvidrio’s entrance into the Brazilian market.>°” OIEG
explains that the Tribunal found that OIEG’s claim for additional damages resulting from
Venvidrio’s exports was intrinsically linked to the existence of a breach and, as a result,
decided that it would address the Applicant’s objection in the context of the determination
of the compensation due.*”! OIEG points out that the Tribunal expressly “reject[ed] the two
jurisdictional defences raised by Venezuela, and rule[d] that the Centre has jurisdiction and

the Award devoted to “Additional Damages,” the Tribunal reverted to the objection raised

by the Applicant*? and rejected OIEG’s claim:

In summary, the Tribunal considers that the effect of the exports that
Venvidrio has begun is already duly included in the DCF model and
that Claimant has not been able to demonstrate the existence of any
additional damage for this reason. The burden of proof being on
OIEG, the Tribunal rejects the claim.*°*

OIEG further argues that, even if the Tribunal had not ruled on the Applicant’s
jurisdictional objection (quod non), “the Tribunal’s finding on the merits rendered moot

the Applicant’s jurisdictional objection”>?>

and that, in any event, the Applicant has failed
“to ident[ify] any manifest excess of powers in the Tribunal’s ruling on the Respondent on
Annulment’s claim for additional damages resulting from the exports by Venvidrio to

Brazil.

> — The Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers by not staying the

proceedings

misrepresentation of the facts with respect to both the OJEG Arbitration and the Favianca

and OldV yv. Venezuela arbitration.”>"

According to OIEG, the Tribunal’s actions in this regard were entirely proper and cannot
lead to the annulment of the Award given that: (i) in the Underlying Arbitration, the
Applicant made only one objection with respect to the Favianca v. Venezuela arbitration
on November 27, 2012, requesting that the Tribunal suspend the proceedings for no less

8

than three months due to its initiation;*°* and (ii) upon the Tribunal’s rejection of this

suspension request the Applicant stated that it reserved all its rights in this regard, after

object to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction or for any other reason.>”

(ii) The Applicant has failed to demonstrate that the Tribunal manifestly
exceeded its powers when determining the amount of compensation

OIEG contends that the Applicant’s arguments in this respect have no basis in law or

fact.3!°

First, OIEG points out that “[w]hile the Applicant may disagree with the end result of the
methodology that the Tribunal adopted with respect to the calculation of damages, that
does not mean that the Tribunal failed to identify and apply the correct body of law.”>!! In
fact, the Tribunal duly identified and applied the proper law (the compensation standard in
Article 6(c) of the BIT) when determining the compensation.*!? OIEG further notes that,
even though the Applicant invokes “‘basic economic principles’ and argues that they
constitute the ‘correct body of law’, but it does not even attempt to explain, much less

prove, how such ‘basic economic principles’ constitute a ‘body of law.””'>

In any event, OIEG contends that the Applicant’s arguments also fail as a matter of fact.
OIEG states that “[t]o the extent that ‘basic principles of economic and financial
calculation’ are even an applicable body of law (quod non), the Applicant’s position, aided
and abetted by Dr Flores, betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of both those principles

and what the Tribunal did in its Award.”3!4

In this regard, OIEG argues that the Tribunal’s calculation of damages pursuant to Article

6(c) of the BIT was in all respects in full compliance with basic economic principles*!> and

notes that the Tribunal adopted the methodology advocated by the Applicant’s own expert
to determine the fair market value of OIEG’s Investment, that is, the DFC methodology.*'®

OIEG further explains that in applying this DCF methodology, the Tribunal discussed in
detail the discount rate that it applied,>!’ which, for OIEG, “took account of the time value

of money.”3!8

In response to the Applicant’s argument that the discount rate used to value a company
cannot be negative, since that would run afoul of the fundamental economic principle of

the time value of money, OIEG states the following:

As Messrs Kaczmarek and Shopp explain in the Navigant Report:
(a) the discount rate method employed by the Tribunal is wholly
consistent with basic economic principles; (b) Dr Flores
miscalculated the difference between his preferred discount rate
method and the discount rate method employed by the Tribunal; and
(c) Dr Flores’s discount rate is inconsistent with the conclusions of
both Parties’ experts in the OJEG Arbitration.>!”

Finally, OIEG contends that no credence should be given to Econ One’s expert reports

given the “dependency of both Dr Flores and his firm [on] the Applicant.”??°

c. The Committee’s Analysis

The Committee will address, under the ground set forth in Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID
Convention: (i) if the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in asserting jurisdiction
without deciding on certain of Venezuela’s objections; and then, (ii) if the Tribunal
manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to apply the proper law in calculating the

compensation.

(i) The Applicant has failed to establish that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded

its powers in asserting jurisdiction
Even if this Committee were to find attractive the line of argument as regards whether the
Tribunal did or did not address the jurisdictional objections posed by the Applicant in the
Underlying Arbitration, a review of the Award in its relevant sections makes plain that no
ground for annulment can be sustained on this basis, particularly in view of the fact that

the Parties themselves concur that this Annulment is not an appeal.

With respect to the question of the existence of an investment under the BIT and ICSID

Convention, Respondent on Annulment asserts that

there can be no doubt that the Tribunal “correctly identified the
applicable law, and strove to apply it to the facts that it established”.
In paragraphs 196 to 206 of the Award, the Tribunal established the
relevant “proven facts”. In paragraphs 207 to 211, it correctly
identified the “applicable law”. In paragraphs 212 to 232, it
methodically and logically analysed the “the concept of investment”
and applied its findings on the law to the facts of the case.*?!

The Committee agrees. It has undertaken an independent analysis of the above-referenced
paragraphs of the Award, as well as, for example, paragraphs 245 and 246 identifying
OIEG’s specific contributions, and paragraphs 238 and 241 setting forth the rationale for
the Tribunal’s finding on OIEG’s contributions. On this basis, the Committee cannot
conclude other than that the Tribunal did, in fact, conduct a reasonable analysis as regards
what constitutes an investment under both the BIT and ICSID Convention, regardless as to

whether the Committee agrees, or not, with such analysis.

Further, this Committee subscribes to the position, as posited by the Respondent on

32

Annulment citing several prior committee decisions,*”” that neither disagreement with a

tribunal’s assessment of the evidence, nor a failure to specify the evidence on which a

specific finding is based, constitutes a manifest excess of powers under Article 52(1)(b) of
the ICSID Convention.

In regard to the allegation that the Tribunal found that OIEG suffered losses in the Brazilian
market without first addressing the Republic’s objection as regards such claims, this
Committee considers that the Tribunal did address the Applicant’s jurisdictional objection
when it expressly rejected such objection in paragraph 268 of the Award. Further, the
Tribunal decided, as summarized in paragraph 893 of the Award, that the effect of
Venvidrio’s exports was already included in the DCF model and that the Claimant had not
been able to demonstrate the existence of any additional damage, adding even that the
burden of proof was on OIEG, and consequently, the Tribunal rejected the corresponding

claim.

Finally, the Committee does not find convincing the argument that the Tribunal’s failure
to stay the proceedings, notwithstanding the “parallel” Favianca v. Venezuela proceeding,
constituted a manifest excess of powers. As argued by the Respondent on Annulment, and
as is evident from a reading of the pertinent sections of the Award, especially its Section
V concerning jurisdictional objections, the Tribunal rejected the requested suspension, and
the Applicant reserved all its rights with respect to the “initiation of the parallel proceeding

and its impact on the present dispute,”>??

after which the Applicant never again raised the
Favianca vy. Venezuela arbitration, neither as a basis on which to object to the Tribunal’s

jurisdiction or for any other reason.*?4

These circumstances are set out and addressed in paragraph 175 of the Award, and there is
no evidence in the file of the Underlying Arbitration that could lead this Committee to
conclude that the Tribunal’s evaluation and statement of the circumstances is not true to

the facts.

Consequently, for the above reasons, including in particular that this Committee does not

serve as an appeal body that is authorized to consider the correctness of the Tribunal’s

23 Award, 4175.

reasoning, this Committee rejects the Applicant’s above-reviewed arguments that the
Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in asserting jurisdiction without deciding on

certain of the Applicant’s objections.

(ii) The Applicant has failed to establish that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded
its powers by failing to apply the proper law in determining the amount of
compensation

As summarized above, the Applicant also argues that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its
powers in calculating the damages, because the Tribunal disregarded basic or fundamental
economic principles, especially those that reflect the economic principle of the time value
of money. The Applicant adds that such principles were part of the applicable law, which

the Tribunal ultimately did not apply.°?5

Additionally, according to the Applicant, the Tribunal stated that it was carrying out its
valuation based on market value, but ultimately that was not the standard that the Tribunal

in fact applied.*7°

This Committee finds no support for these allegations, even after having heard and
considered the presentations of the experts during the Hearing on Annulment, including

the Applicant’s appointed expert, Mr. Flores, of Econ One.*2”

The Committee, to the contrary, is of the view that the Tribunal undertook a thorough
analysis of the economic principles invoked by the Parties during the original proceeding.
The Committee has taken particular note of the Respondent on Annulment’s point that the
Tribunal duly identified and applied the body of law, that is, the compensation standard in

Article 6(c) of the BIT.** Indeed, upon the Committee’s independent analysis of the

35 See supra { 198.

326 See supra § 199.

37 The Committee does not, however, accept the Respondent on Annulment’s argument to deny any credence to Econ
One’s expert reports on the basis of an alleged “dependency of both Dr. Flores and his firm [on] the Applicant.”

Mr. Flores (Econ One) by Mr. Mandelli (Counsel for OIEG), pp. 228-247. Although the Committee had made clear
in the pre-hearing exchanges that it did not deem the experts’ oral testimony to be necessary (Letter from the ICSID
Secretariat to the Parties of August 29, 2017), the Committee has heard the testimony that was tendered during the
Hearing on Annulment on behalf of both Parties and carefully considered that testimony in rendering this Decision on
Annulment.

Award, it is evident that the Tribunal, for example (i) analyzed the compensation standard
under Article 6(c) of the BIT;*”? (ii) determined an appropriate methodology for calculating
the market value of the expropriated companies, namely the DCF method;>* (iii) examined
in detail and decided points of contention between the Parties’ experts in the application of
the methodology;**! (iv) examined the experts’ models and calculated and applied an
332

appropriate discount rate;’’" and (v) confirmed its conclusions using alternative

methodologies.**?

In these circumstances, even if, as the Applicant maintains, the Tribunal should have
adopted the views advanced by Venezuela and its experts in the Underlying Arbitration as
regards the application of certain economic principles (and the Committee expresses no
position in this regard), it cannot be maintained that such an error would justify annulment
of the Award. As the TECO ad hoc committee stated, “an annulment committee is not
empowered to verify whether [...] a tribunal’s application of the law was correct, but only
whether it was tenable as a matter of law. Even if a committee might have a different view
on a debatable issue, it is simply not within its powers to correct a tribunal’s interpretation

of the law or assessment of the facts.”3*4

Thus, whether the Tribunal made a correct application of the relevant standard and
methodology in calculating the damages in Section VII of the Award is a matter outside
the scope of this Committee’s mandate, as has been stated in the recitation of the standards
applicable, in general, to an annulment proceeding, and in particular under Article 52(1)(b)

of the ICSID Convention.

As addressed in paragraph 185 above, according to the 2016 ICSID Paper, the drafting
history of the ICSID Convention confirms that a tribunal’s failure to apply the proper law

could constitute a manifest excess of powers, but that an erroneous application of the law,

even if it is serious, could not amount to an annullable error.**> As stated above and as has
been expressly recognized by many other ad hoc committees, an incorrect tribunal decision

is no basis for annulment.>*°

Notably, in setting forth its own position on the nature and scope of an annulment, the
Applicant accepted that the mechanism is not intended to address “reasonable
disagreements in terms of the interpretation of the facts and the law,” but rather is intended

to serve as a check against “certain defects contained in the Award which are so serious

 

that they fit the specific list included in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention as grounds
for annulment.”**” This Committee has carefully reviewed the Award, and heard arguments
and expert oral testimony from both Parties during the Hearing on Annulment. Applying
the standards of Article 52(1)(b) as reviewed above, this Committee cannot conclude that
the Award has a serious defect in regard to the damages determination. Reaching the
opposite conclusion, on the grounds called for by the Applicant, would constitute a

denaturalization of the mechanism of annulment.

SERIOUS DEPARTURE FROM A FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE
qd) Legal Standard
a. Applicant’s Position

The Applicant states that this ground for annulment is subject to a double requirement: (i)
the departure must occur in relation to a fundamental rule of procedure, and (ii) that

departure must be serious.***

With regard to the notion of a “fundamental rule of procedure,” the Applicant explains that
in the travaux préparatoires of the ICSID Convention, “Mr. Broches established a

connection between the fundamental rule of procedure and the principles of natural

justice.”**? Additionally, the Applicant notes that in Fraport v. Philippines*° the

committee stated that the general principles of law are fundamental rules of procedure, and
in Wena Hotels v. Egypt the committee construed fundamental rules of procedure to mean
the “minimal standards of procedure to be respected as a matter of international law.”>4!
Furthermore, the Applicant explains that the Jmpregilo v. Argentina committee
summarized the views of prior committees and identified the following fundamental rules
of procedure: “the equal treatment of the parties, the right to be heard, an independent and
impartial tribunal, the treatment of evidence and burden of proof, and deliberations among
members of the Tribunal.”3

235. As to the second requirement that the departure be “serious,” the Applicant contends that

the assessment is very fact specific and should be done on a case by case basis.*47

236. For the Applicant, the “serious departure” requirement should not be understood to mean
that the applicant is required to demonstrate that such departure has led to a different
outcome. As explained by the Kilig v. Turkmenistan committee, it is sufficient for the

departure to have a potential material effect on the award.*44

237. Relying on the annulment decision in Victor Pey Casado v. Chile, the Applicant adds
that, once a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure is established, the

award must necessarily be annulled and “any speculation without evidentiary support about

the possible impact that the violation of the rule could effectively have on the parties and

the decision cannot prevent the Award from being annulled.”*4°

238. Finally, the Applicant observes that, according to the EDF v. Argentina committee, the
lack of independence and impartiality of an arbitrator may, by itself, constitute grounds for

annulment under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention:**”

It is difficult to imagine a rule of procedure more fundamental than
the rule that a case must be heard by an independent and impartial
tribunal. The Committee accordingly considers that, in principle, an
ad hoc committee can examine under Article 52(1)(d) [...]
allegations that the lack of independence and impartiality of an
arbitrator meant that there was a serious departure from a
fundamental rule of procedure in the arbitration as a whole.*4*

b. Respondent on Annulment’s Position

239. OJEG states that to annul an award under Article 52(1)(d), the Applicant must: (a) identify
the applicable rule of procedure; (b) demonstrate that this rule is fundamental; (c) show

that the Tribunal departed from the rule; and (d) prove that this departure was serious.*””

240. OIEG maintains that, as recognized by the Applicant, not all rules of procedure qualify as
“fundamental rules of procedure.”**° Rather, they “are those that set the minimal standards
of procedure, are essential to a fair hearing and necessary to ensure the integrity and

fairness of the arbitral process.”**! Further, relying on the 2016 ICSID Paper, OIEG asserts

99352

ordinary arbitration rules,”?>? no matter how serious.**

OIEG agrees with the Applicant that those “minimal standards of procedure” include the
right to be heard.*°+ However, it points out that this right is “not a catch-all principle that
the Applicant can use to circumvent the requirement that the departure concern a
‘fundamental’ rule.”>*> According to OIEG, the right to be heard “is generally understood
as the ‘full and equal opportunity of the parties to present their case’” and all of the previous
annulment decisions that have found a violation of this right are based on “situations where
the relevant award was based either on evidence that the parties never had a chance to

address or on arguments that the parties had not made.”>*°

OIEG further claims that the Applicant must be able to explain how the conduct of which
it complains negatively affects the interest protected by the rule in question.**” Citing
El Paso y. Argentina, MINE vy. Guinea, Continental v. Argentina and Impregilo v.
Argentina,** among others, OIEG explains that annulment committees have repeatedly
confirmed that a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure may only lead to
annulment if it is “such as to deprive a party of the benefit or protection which the rule was
intended to provide.”>*? For OIEG, the Applicant “has not disputed these basic, self-evident

principles.”

OIEG posits that the main point of disagreement between the Parties is in relation to the
meaning and consequences of the requirement that the departure be “serious.”*°! OIEG

asserts that such departure cannot be regarded as “serious” where it is insubstantial or has

Argentina, Wena Hotels v. Egypt? and Daimler v. Argentina,*® OIEG asserts that the
departure must have “caused the Tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what
it would have awarded had such a rule been observed.”°° OIEG adds that numerous

244. In this regard, OIEG objects to the Applicant’s claim that it is sufficient for the departure
to have a “potential” material effect on the award. Even if a minority of annulment
committees have followed this approach, OIEG contends that the better approach is the

one followed by the majority of the annulment committees explained above.>”>

c. The Committee’s Analysis

245. Article 52(1)(d) contemplates the possibility of annulling the award based on the existence
of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. This ground necessarily
imposes on the Applicant two obligations, first, to identify the rule of procedure the
Tribunal purportedly departed from, and second, to satisfy its burden of proof regarding
three points: (i) the “fundamental” nature of said rule; (ii) the departure by the Tribunal

from said rule; and lastly (iii) whether the departure was serious.

Case 1:16-cv-01533-ABJ Document 52-1 Filed 12/10/18 Page 85 of 135

The drafting history of the ICSID Convention sheds light upon the “fundamental” nature
of certain rules. According to the drafters, the phrase “fundamental rules of procedure” was
a direct reference to certain principles, including those of natural justice, and necessarily
excluding ordinary rules which are not concerned with the integrity and fairness of the
arbitral process.3”* As stated above, the burden of proof regarding the departure and its

seriousness must be met by the Applicant.

As for the departure, the Committee considers that it requires a showing, based on specific
factual circumstances, that such departure was so substantial that the tribunal effectively

deprived the parties of the benefits or protection which the rule was intended to provide.>”>

Finally, as for the seriousness requirement set forth in Article 52(1)(d), this Committee is
aware that some committees have previously adopted an approach under which the
requirement is met upon a showing of a potential material effect on the award.>”° Although
not decisive in this case, this Committee takes note of the position of OIEG and the
holdings of prior committees that “seriousness” should be interpreted as requiring a
showing that the violation did in fact materially change the outcome of the award.>”7
Annulling an award based on a lesser showing would amount to excessive formalism,
speculation and second-guessing of decisions taken in the original arbitration in a manner

that is improper for an annulment proceeding, thus frustrating the purpose of the arbitration.

Therefore, the Committee finds that in the circumstances of the instant case it does not
suffice that the alleged departure could potentially have affected the Award; the departure
must be shown effectively to have caused the Tribunal to reach a substantially different
result from what it would have reached, if the relevant rule had been observed. Notably,

however, as explained below in Section III.D(2)c, the Applicant has failed to meet its

burden to make the necessary showing under either interpretation of the “seriousness”

requirement.

(2) Application of the Legal Standard to the Present Case
a. Applicant’s Position

The Applicant contends that the Award should be annulled on the basis of Article 52(1)(d)
in connection with two circumstances: (i) the allegedly partial and biased conduct of
Mr. Mourre, including his failure to disclose his relationship with Dechert in a timely
manner; and (ii) the Tribunal’s treatment of evidence in finding that there was an

expropriation in violation of the Treaty.

(i) Mr. Mourre’s conduct

The Applicant argues that a fundamental rule of procedure was seriously departed from as
a result of both Mr. Mourre’s lack of impartiality, and the fact that Venezuela was deprived

of its right to be heard on the matter.>”

First, as explained above, the Applicant maintains that Mr. Mourre’s “lack of impartiality
is in itself, a paradigmatic case of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of

procedure,” and an Award rendered with Mr. Mourre’s participation “must be annulled.”?””

The Applicant objects to OIEG’s argument that Venezuela has failed to explain how
Mr. Mourre’s lack of impartiality materially impacted the outcome of the Award. The
Applicant contends that it is incorrect to impose this burden on Venezuela since “neither
the Republic nor OIEG can provide documentary evidence proving such aspects.”>*°
Furthermore, OIEG errs in assuming that the lack of impartiality of Mr. Mourre occurred

only when his negotiations with Dechert concluded “shortly before” the issuance of the

Award,**! since, as noted above, the conflict was purportedly present “during the ongoing

full deliberation stage to issue the Award.”3*?

Second, the Applicant argues that Venezuela was deprived of its right of defence given that
Mr. Mourre’s alleged conflict of interest became known on the same day when the
arbitration proceeding was declared closed and hence, the “Republic was not allowed to
activate the mechanism set forth in Articles 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention and submit
a proposal for disqualification.”**?

For the Applicant, “[t]his problem is even more serious” when considering that
Mr. Mourre’s signature is dated February 20, 2015 and Mr. Orrego Vicufia’s signature is
dated February 26, 2015, that is, before the proceeding was declared closed.5** These
circumstances are in conflict with Arbitration Rule 46, which requires arbitrators to sign
the Award after the closure of the proceeding.**> The Applicant adds that those signature
dates are inconsistent with the procedural history of the Award, which refers to later-in-

386

time events,**° and concludes that:

This alteration to and distortion of the dates shows not only that the
Republic was unable to challenge arbitrator Mourre due to the fact
that the proceeding was closed and the Award was signed, but also
that the dates of closure and signature were manipulated and
distorted to preclude the exercise of the fundamental right of the
Republic referred to above, which warrants the annulment of the
Award.>*”

Additionally, Arbitration Rule 46 is a fundamental rule of procedure since it is “a special
case of the general rule that provides that parties have the right to be heard.”>** In this

sense, the Applicant explains that “[i]f the arbitrators could sign an award before the

closure of the proceeding, the parties would have their right to petition the arbitral tribunal

curtailed.”3°

(ii) Evidence concerning expropriation
The Applicant also argues that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of
procedure when it found that Venezuela had unlawfully expropriated OIEG’s investment.
This is so “because the Tribunal did not specify the evidence on which it relied in finding
that the failure to make the payment without delay, i.e., in a timely fashion, is attributable

to the Republic.”?”°

The Applicant states that the only evidence on which the Tribunal relies is a statement
made by Venezuela’s expert during the hearing, which the Tribunal distorted to mean that
the Companies’ failure to participate in the local expropriation proceedings would not
delay the payment of compensation.**! The Tribunal improperly concluded, according to
the Applicant, that Venezuela had failed to offer a plausible explanation to justify the delay
in the payment of compensation, effectively reversing “the burden of proof since it is
[OIEG] that, in alleging the expropriation, must demonstrate that there was a delay in the

payment of compensation and that such delay is attributable to the Republic.”>*

b. Respondent on Annulment’s Position

The Respondent on Annulment contends that the Applicant has failed to show that any of
the following constitutes a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure: (i)
Mr. Mourre’s alleged lack of impartiality or independence; (ii) Mr. Mourre’s decision not

to disclose his conversations with Dechert in the Underlying Arbitration; (iii) the timing of

failure to participate would not draw the proceeding out, since without such a distortion the Tribunal’s statement
would have no evidentiary basis. That assertion is not included in the statements made by expert Cabrera.”

the signature of the Award by arbitrators Mourre and Orrego Vicufia; and (iv) the

Tribunal’s treatment of the evidence.

(i) Mr. Mourre’s alleged lack of impartiality or independence

The Respondent on Annulment refers to its position regarding the Applicant’s arguments
on Article 52(1)(a) and states that “[m]utatis mutandis, the reasons provided in that section
apply with equal force to the Applicant’s arguments regarding 52(1)(d).”>°> OIEG recalls
in that regard that the annulment mechanism is not the appropriate procedural avenue to
challenge the impartiality or independence of an arbitrator>™* and that the Applicant had
avenues at its disposal to raise its concerns regarding Mr. Mourre that it chose not to use.*?
On this basis alone, OIEG contends that the Committee should reject this ground for

annulment.3%°

OIEG further contends that the Applicant’s arguments fail for two additional reasons.*°”
First, as previously set forth, “the Applicant has manifestly failed to prove the existence of

facts indicating that Arbitrator Mourre lacked impartiality or independence.”*°*

Second, even if the Applicant had met this burden of proof (quod non), it has failed to

prove that this alleged departure from a fundamental rule of procedure is “serious,”?”? i

in
that the Applicant has failed to show that Mr. Mourre’s “alleged loss of impartiality or

on the Award.’4°°

(ii) Mr. Mourre’s decision not to disclose his conversations with Dechert in the
Underlying Arbitration

First, OIEG notes that Arbitration Rule 6(2) sets out the disclosure obligations of arbitrators
and argues that the Applicant has failed to prove how this rule required Mr. Mourre to
disclose his conversations with Dechert in the Underlying Arbitration.*°' Indeed, as set
forth above,*°? OIEG contends that Mr. Mourre was under no obligation to disclose such
conversations since they did not question “his reliability for independent judgment."
OIEG also contends that there could be no deprivation of the right to be heard in the case

of facts that Mr. Mourre was not obligated to disclose.4

OIEG points out again that the Applicant had at least two procedural avenues at its disposal

through which to raise its alleged concerns in the Underlying Arbitration.‘°°

Second, OIEG argues that “even assuming that Arbitrator Mourre’s failure to disclose his
contacts with Dechert in the O/JEG Arbitration amounted to a departure from a rule of
procedure, the Applicant has failed to prove that such departure could be considered
‘serious’ under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.”4°° In this regard, OIEG
maintains that “[e]ven in the impossible scenario that Arbitrator Mourre would have been
disqualified in the OJEG Arbitration on the basis of the disclosure of those facts, the
Applicant has not even tried to explain, let alone demonstrate, how that would have caused
the Tribunal ‘to reach a result substantially different’ from what it decided, unanimously,

in the Award.”4°7

(iii) The timing of the signature of the Award by arbitrators Mourre and Orrego
Vicunia
OIEG argues that Arbitration Rule 46 is not a fundamental rule of procedure, since it

“neither seeks to protect ‘natural justice’ nor concerns ‘the essential fairness of the

proceeding.’’”*°* Rather, “it merely seeks to avoid excessive delays in the preparation of

ICSID awards after the closure of the proceedings.”4?

Further, OIEG contends that, even assuming that Arbitration Rule 46 were a fundamental
rule and that Mr. Mourre and Prof. Orrego Vicuiia had departed from that rule by signing
the Award before the closure of the proceedings, such departure could not be considered
“serious” under Article 52(1)(d).*'° Indeed, as argued by the Respondent on Annulment,
“the Applicant has failed to explain how Arbitrators Mourre and Orrego Vicufia signing
the Award after (instead of before) the closure of the proceeding would have ‘had the
potential of causing the tribunal to render an award substantially different from what it

actually decided.””4"!

(iv) The Tribunal’s treatment of the evidence

According to OIEG, the Applicant’s arguments regarding the Tribunal’s alleged treatment
of the evidence as grounds for annulment under Article 52(1)(d) have no basis in law or
fact. First, the Applicant has failed to identify a fundamental rule of procedure from which
the Tribunal allegedly departed, since previous “committees have confirmed consistently
that the tribunals are not required procedurally to specify or itemise the evidence on which

their findings are based.””4!?

Second, the Applicant’s argument also fails as a matter of fact since “the Tribunal did
analyse and specify the evidence on which it relied to find that the Applicant had failed to
comply with its obligation to provide compensation to the Respondent on Annulment

‘without undue delay.’”*4!

OIEG objects to the Applicant’s argument that the Tribunal incorrectly interpreted the

testimony given by the Applicant’s legal expert in relation to the effects of the Companies’

non-participation in the local expropriation proceeding. First, OIEG points out that this
argument from the Applicant “merely confirms that the real basis of its claim is that it
disagrees with the Tribunal’s assessment of the testimony of its legal expert,” which can
not constitute, by itself, a ground for annulment,‘ as confirmed by several annulment
committees and scholars.*'* Second, OIEG also contends that the Applicant’s argument is
without merit as a matter of fact, since the Tribunal did not rely exclusively on the expert’s

testimony, but “on a wealth of evidence and on thorough analysis.”*!°

c. The Committee’s Analysis
(i) Purported conflict of Mr. Mourre

At the outset, this Committee observes that whether or not an arbitrator’s purported lack of
impartiality or independence is reviewable under Article 52(1)(d) has been a matter of
some debate among the Parties and in view of prior committee decisions. Thus for example,
in Vivendi IT and EDF, the committees accepted that such challenges could be heard under
Article 52(1)(d) (in addition to Article 52(1)(a)), although, as noted above, neither
committee annulled on that basis.*!7 By contrast, in Azurix, the committee rejected the
admissibility of the challenge under Article 52(1)(d) for the same reasons set forth in its
analysis under Article 52(1)(a).“!8

In this case, it appears that the Applicant is making two main arguments with respect to
arbitrator conflict under Article 52(1)(d): first, that — procedurally — Mr. Mourre’s failure
to timely disclose facts that could have led to his disqualification deprived the Applicant
of its right to be heard by an impartial tribunal; and second — substantively — that
Mr. Mourre actually lacked the requisite impartiality and independence, which also led to

a deprivation of that right.4!° This Committee has already held (see supra Section III.B(1)c)

that the second argument is inadmissible as a ground for annulment.’”° Like the committee
in Azurix, this Committee holds that this conclusion applies to both Articles 52(1)(a)
and (d).4?!

The Applicant’s first argument appears to be strictly a matter of procedure and concerns
Mr. Mourre’s purported failure to timely disclose his relationship with Dechert (which
relationship is said to have given rise to his lack of impartiality and independence). This
Committee finds that objection to be admissible under Article 52(1)(d), which by its terms
is designed to ensure the availability of procedural protections for the parties. However,
for the reasons stated below, the Committee does not consider that the Applicant’s claims
regarding the timing and manner of such disclosure support a finding that a fundamental

tule of procedure was breached in this case.

f,"?? as set forth above the

More specifically, in addition to lack of impartiality “in itsel
Applicant has alleged in connection with Mr. Mourre’s purported conflict a serious
departure from (i) the right to timely disclosures under Arbitration Rule 6(2)*?> and (ii) the
right to be heard, positing that Arbitration Rule 46 is a specific case of the latter right.*?*
The Applicant specifies that because there are “overlaps” in these alleged departures “that

makes it twice as serious.”“75

Before addressing each of the Applicant’s specific allegations in turn, and in particular

because of the Applicant’s asserted “overlaps,” the Committee first scrutinizes the
Applicant’s allegations of lack of impartiality, which are the focal point of and ultimately
underpin each of the above-noted Applicant’s arguments in support of annulment under

Article 52(1)(d). Indeed, as the Applicant itself has acknowledged,

20 Of course, corruption is a ground for annulment under ICSID Convention Article 52(1)(c). However, corruption is
not being alleged in this case. No annulment committee (as of May 2016) has issued a decision based on a charge of
corruption. 2016 ICSID Paper, § 97 (OILA-117).

it would make no sense to contend that the [T]ribunal has departed
from a fundamental rule of procedure demonstrated by the lack of
impartiality [...] if the [Applicant] did not claim and prove, at the
same time, that said lack of impartiality occurred.*”°

As a starting point in the chronology of relevant events, the Respondent on Annulment has
argued, and the Applicant has not contested, that ICSID sent a letter to the Parties on
December 8, 2014, stating that at that time the Tribunal was reviewing “a complete draft
of the Award.” 427 According to the facts of the case, including Mr. Mourre’s declaration
regarding the timing of the conclusion of his conversations with Dechert, this ICSID letter
is a strong suggestion that Mr. Mourre’s conversations with Dechert took place after
deliberations had finished.*”* Taken together with the final part of the procedural history
contained in Section II of the Award, it is reasonable for this Committee to conclude that
deliberations took place substantially, if not entirely, during the year of 2014, which
according to the evidence before the Committee was before Mr. Mourre even began

negotiations with Dechert.

Moreover, as observed by OIEG,*? the fact that Mr. Mourre made his March 4, 2015
disclosure in the Favianca arbitration, as opposed to the Underlying Arbitration, is
reasonable in light of the timing of the facts concerned. Namely, whereas Mr. Mourre’s
professional relationship with Dechert was to begin from May 2015, the Underlying
Arbitration would have been already concluded (as opposed to the Favianca Arbitration,
which would have been ongoing at that time).’°° Indeed, as noted above, Mr. Mourre had

already signed the Award on February 20, 2015.

The Committee recalls in this context the applicable holdings of the annulment decisions
in Vivendi IJ and EDF. In Vivendi IJ, in rejecting the application for annulment, the
committee found relevant the fact that Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler was not aware of the

potential for conflict resulting from her role on the board of directors of the bank concerned,

Case 1:16-cv-01533-ABJ Document 52-1 Filed 12/10/18 Page 95 of 135

at a time when such role could have affected tribunal deliberations. In EDF, the committee
found that the “drafting of the Award had been completed several weeks before” the
purported conflict arose, based in part on the Award’s complexity and the fact that it was

to be rendered in two languages.**!

So too in this case, the Committee finds that, even if a conflict could have arisen due to
Mr. Mourre’s relationship with Dechert, that alleged conflict could not have affected the
Award based on the timeline of the facts concerned, and on that basis the seriousness
requirement of Article 52(1)(d) is not met. As previously set forth in Section III.B(2)d
above, if the Applicant nevertheless had reason to be concerned about such a possible
conflict — arising as it did at such a late stage of the proceedings — it could have pursued a

reopening of the case or revision under Article 51 of the ICSID Convention.

In any event, and for the same reasons as outlined above, the Committee finds that there is
no showing on the record of any lack of independence or impartiality on the part of
Mr. Mourre. The threshold commonly used to make such a determination is whether an
independent third party could, based on the facts of the case, reasonably conclude that the
arbitrator obviously was, or appeared to be, influenced by external forces. This standard
has been used recently in the Blue Bank v. Venezuela case, which was cited by both the
Applicant and OIEG.**7

Based on the facts of the case, Mr. Mourre did not have any occasion to influence his
co-arbitrators during the deliberations leading to the decision since, at the relevant time,
the evidence strongly suggests that he had not yet even initiated negotiations with Dechert,
and therefore, could not have been influenced by that fact. Indeed, Mr. Mourre’s alleged
conflict is to be excluded on the basis of the fact that when he informed the Parties in
Favianca by letter of March 4, 2015 that “[a]s from May 2015” he would have a

consultancy agreement with Dechert he had already signed the Award in the present case
on February 20, 2015.47

Furthermore, even if Mr. Mourre hypothetically had already begun negotiations with
Dechert during the Tribunal deliberations period, there has been no showing that his
impartiality or independence would have been, or even appeared to have been,
compromised, given the explanations that Mr. Mourre provided in the letters delivered in
Favianca v. Venezuela, The Committee recalls that Mr. Mourre represented — in the
Favianca arbitration — that the relationship with Dechert would not provide him with access
to relevant information concerning cases involving Venezuela or related entities.*** This
Committee has no reason to doubt the reliability of that statement, and the Applicant has
raised none.**> Moreover, on the evidence, the reality is that the allegations of possible
conflict are all the weaker in the present case, given that for all practical purposes
deliberations appear to have been completed before the time of any negotiations with
Dechert. In brief, the Applicant has made no showing of any “dependency” or “reciprocal
partisanship’° between Mr. Mourre and Dechert, which would have affected the
Underlying Arbitration.

In view of the above review of the Applicant’s allegations, the Committee addresses each
of the Applicant’s specific alleged rule violations in light of the applicable legal analytical
framework. The Committee’s recalls (see Section III.D(1)ce above) that to succeed on
annulment under Article 52(1)(d) the Applicant must satisfy its burden of proof regarding:
(a) the “fundamental” nature of the rule; (b) the departure by the Tribunal from said rule;

and lastly (c) whether the departure was serious.

Case 1:16-cv-01533-ABJ Document 52-1 Filed 12/10/18 Page 97 of 135

First, as the Committee made clear was the case in its analysis under Article 52(1)(a),"°” as
a factual matter the Applicant has failed to establish the partiality of Mr. Mourre or the
appearance thereof, and even if the Applicant had done so, given the timeline of the
allegations, there has been no showing that such alleged partiality even could have had an
outcome-determinative effect on the Award. Thus, even assuming such a charge were
deemed admissible under Article 52(1)(d), the Committee’s ultimate decision rejecting the

Application on this basis would remain undisturbed.

Second, as for the right to timely disclosures under Arbitration Rule 6(2), the Applicant’s
arguments must be rejected for similar reasons. Notably, Arbitration Rule 6(2) requires
disclosure of information that an arbitrator “reasonably believes [...] would reasonably
cause his or her reliability for independent judgment to be questioned by a reasonable
person.” In view of the Committee’s findings above, there was no obligation on the part
of Mr. Mourre to disclose his relationship with Dechert in the Underlying Arbitration.
While his disclosure may have been temporally relevant in Favianca v. Venezuela, the
anticipated commencement date of the Dechert relationship was well after the anticipated
issuance of the Award. Indeed, Mr. Mourre had signed the Award on February 20, 2015.
Further, the evidence strongly suggests that the Tribunal had substantially completed its
deliberations already in December 2014, even before any negotiations between Mr. Mourre
and Dechert. Accordingly, the absence of a disclosure in the Underlying Arbitration does

not constitute a departure from Arbitration Rule 6(2).

Additionally, the absence of a disclosure did not result in a breach of the right to be heard.
There is no right to be heard about facts that Mr. Mourre was not obligated to disclose.
Further, upon learning of Mr. Mourre’s relationship with Dechert through the disclosure in
Favianca, the Applicant could have, notwithstanding the timing of the closing, pursued (i)
reopening under Arbitration Rule 38(2) as a means of having its concerns heard in the

Underlying Arbitration, or (ii) revision under Article 51 of the ICSID Convention.

Case 1:16-cv-01533-ABJ Document 52-1 Filed 12/10/18 Page 98 of 135

As a final point as regards Arbitration Rule 6(2), even assuming Mr. Mourre’s decision not
to disclose was a departure from that rule, the Committee finds that the Applicant has not
established the requirement of seriousness in terms of Article 52(1)(d). The Applicant has
not shown that the disclosure of the information would have (or even could have) resulted
in a substantially different outcome in the Award. Among other reasons, the Committee’s
findings above make clear that such information would not have resulted in Mr. Mourre’s
removal from the Tribunal in the Underlying Arbitration, especially given that it was on a
different temporal footing than, for example, Favianca v. Venezuela. Even if such a
disclosure would have resulted in Mr. Mourre’s disqualification, the December 8, 2014
ICSID letter reported that the Tribunal was reviewing “a complete draft of the Award”?
and thus the Underlying Arbitration was at a very late stage. While the Committee
acknowledges that under Arbitration Rule 12 a newly-appointed committee member may
require that the oral procedure be recommenced, even in such case it is unlikely that a
reconstituted Tribunal, including Prof. Fernandez-Armesto and Prof. Orrego Vicufia as

members, would have reached a substantially different conclusion.

Third, and finally, as for the Applicant’s allegations of a right to be heard, this Committee
has found immediately above that Mr. Mourre’s decision not to disclose the Dechert
relationship in the Underlying Arbitration did not deprive the Applicant of the general right
to be heard.

As noted above, the Applicant also cites Arbitration Rule 46 as a specific case of the right

to be heard.” It provides,

The award (including any individual or dissenting opinion) shall be
drawn up and signed within 120 days after closure of the proceeding.
The Tribunal may, however, extend this period by a further 60 days
if it would otherwise be unable to draw up the award.

By way of background, this Committee observes that the proceedings in the Underlying

Arbitration were in fact closed on the same date that the President of the Tribunal signed

439 Rejoinder on Annulment, { 120, citing the Communication from the Secretary of the O/EG Tribunal to the Parties,
December 8, 2014 (Exhibit OI-70).
+9 See supra $¥ 256, 274, citing Reply on Annulment, § 215.

Case 1:16-cv-01533-ABJ Document 52-1 Filed 12/10/18 Page 99 of 135

the Award (March 4, 2015), whereas both co-arbitrators signed the Award some days

before the proceedings were closed.*!

291. Based on the Award’s procedural history, it can be inferred that there were some
administrative issues arising towards the end of the case.” Once a new Secretary to the
Tribunal was appointed, the proceedings were declared closed as the President was ready
to sign the Award, which his co-arbitrators had already signed. Consequently, while there
may have been an administrative imperfection on the part of the Tribunal in its approach
to declaring the closure of the proceedings, the closing was necessary, even if it might have

been done at an earlier stage.

292. More importantly for present purposes, to the extent that the sequence of events can be said
to have conflicted with Arbitration Rule 46, this Committee cannot conclude that that Rule
(stating that the signature should take place after the closure) is “fundamental’“* or that

any such departure was “serious” within the meaning of Article 52(1)(d).“*

293. For the foregoing reasons, the Committee finds that there was no departure from a
fundamental rule of procedure and that even if there had been such a departure, it could not

have been so substantial as to deprive the Applicant of the protection which the rules in

445

question were intended to provide.** Nor has the Applicant established that such alleged

violations had a material impact on the outcome of the Award."

294. Accordingly, this Committee rejects the Applicant’s request for annulment on the basis of

its partiality-related arguments under Article 52(1)(d).

441 See supra § 115. Prof. Orrego Vicufia signed the Award on February 26, 2015, and Mr. Mourre signed on
February 20, 2015.

482 Award, $77 (“On 4 March 2015, the Parties were informed that Mr Gonzalo Flores would act as the Secretary of
the Tribunal, replacing Ms Ann Catherine Kettlewell who was no longer with the ICSID Office of the Secretary, and
the arbitration proceedings were declared closed in accordance with Rule 38(1) of the Arbitration Rules.”).

48 This Committee’s conclusion finds support in the reasoning of prior committees (see, e.g., CDC v. Seychelles, § 62,
65 and footnote 92 (VLA-10) and the leading commentary on the ICSID Rules, The ICSID Convention: A

(ii) The Tribunal’s treatment of evidence concerning expropriation

Finally, in regard to Article 52(1)(d), the Applicant argues that the Tribunal seriously
departed from a fundamental rule of procedure in finding that there was an expropriation

in violation of the Treaty.

The Applicant rests this allegation principally on its view that the Tribunal did not specify
the evidence on which it relied in finding that the failure to make payment without delay,
i.e., in a timely fashion, is attributable to the Republic. The Applicant adds that the only
possible evidence on which the Tribunal relied was the statement made by Venezuela’s
expert during the hearing, which the Tribunal misinterpreted to mean that the Companies’
failure to participate in the local expropriation proceedings would not delay the payment

of compensation.*4”

OIEG maintains that the Applicant’s arguments are without merit as a matter of fact,
because the Tribunal did not rely exclusively on the expert’s testimony, but “on a wealth

of evidence and on thorough analysis.”44*

Even assuming that the Applicant’s arguments in this regard were borne out by the record
(a matter about which the Committee draws no conclusion one way or another), it is even
more evident than in the case of the Applicant’s other causes for annulment that these
arguments invite this Committee to evaluate not only the Tribunal’s criteria for assessing
which evidence was pertinent or not, but also, and moreover, the interpretation of the

evidence, and which facts have been proven or not.

As this Committee has already made clear above, entering into such an analysis is clearly
outside the boundaries of an annulment proceeding. The ICSID Convention and the
Arbitration Rules constrain this Committee from relying on any such disagreements with
the Tribunal’s assessment of the evidence as a valid cause for partial or total annulment of
the Award. These circumstances alone are sufficient to reject the Applicant’s position in

this instance.

300. Accordingly, the Committee dismisses this second line of argument in favor of annulment
under Article 52(1)(d).

E. THE AWARD FAILED TO STATE THE REASONS ON WHICH IT IS BASED
qd) Legal Standard
a. Applicant’s Position

301. The Applicant argues that Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention cannot be interpreted
separately from Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention.” When these two provisions are
read in conjunction, it is clear that “arbitral tribunals are under a fundamental obligation to
provide a reasoned award’”**° and that the tribunal’s failure to provide “coherent and

adequate reasoning” renders the award of no effect.**!

302. The Applicant states that the purpose of these provisions is to guarantee that the parties

“may understand the decisions rendered by the tribunals and the reasons leading to those

99452

decisions, so as to ensure respect for due process and the right of defence. Citing

Libananco v. Turkey,*> in its Memorial on Annulment the Applicant contends that this
duty to provide reasons “applies to any argument and claim expressly made before the
Tribunal.’**4 However, in its Reply on Annulment, the Applicant specifies that it “does not

challenge [that] the Tribunal [does not have an] obligation under Articles 48(3) and

52(1)(e) to provide a detailed answer to each and every argument of the parties.”4>

Case 1:16-cv-01533-ABJ Document 52-1 Filed 12/10/18 Page 102 of 135

The Applicant points out that the ICSID Convention “does not impose any condition upon
the failure to state reasons which may give rise to a restrictive interpretation,” since there

is no requirement that the failure be “manifest” or “serious.”*°°

The Applicant posits that
the only option available under the ICSID Convention in case of a failure to state reasons

is the annulment of the award.*°”

With regards to the impact that the failure to state reasons should have in order to render
the award annullable, the Applicant contends that the criterion established by the

committee in TECO v. Guatemala should be followed.*** According to such decision:

The Committee wishes to point out that it cannot determine whether
the evidence that was ignored by the Tribunal would have had an
impact on the Award or not. What can be ascertained at the
annulment stage is that the Tribunal failed to observe evidence
which at least had the potential to be relevant to the final outcome
of the case.*?

The Applicant further notes that, since a total absence of reasons in a tribunal’s decision is
almost unconceivable, annulment committees “have stated that the provision of
contradictory reasons and/or inadequate or insufficient reasons equally amounts to ‘failure
to state reasons.” Thus, as explained in the decision on annulment in Jberdrola v.
Guatemala, “there are three possible issues relating to the statement of reasons for the

Award: (i) absence of reasons; (ii) insufficient reasons and (iii) contradictory reasons.”*°!

Regarding contradictory reasons, those are reasons that are “mutually inconsistent and thus
cancel each other out.”4 As set forth by several annulment committees under the ICSID

Convention, contradictory reasons are tantamount to a failure to state reasons.*°

As for inadequate or insufficient reasons, the Applicant points out that these reasons are
those “which do not logically lead to the conclusion reached.”“™ As explained by the MINE
v. Guinea committee, “[t]he requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award
enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A to Point B and eventually

to its conclusion[.]"4°

According to the Applicant, this means that “the mere statement of
some ‘reason’ by an arbitral tribunal in alleged support of a decision is not enough to
comply with the duty to state reasons under international law. These ‘reasons’ must be
coherent and adequate.”4°°

The Applicant contends that OIEG is wrong in asserting that “the ad hoc committee should
not determine whether the reasons stated by the tribunal are ‘adequate.””*°? For the

Applicant, OIEG is confusing the “‘adequacy’ requirement applicable to the reasons
provided by a tribunal with the review of the ‘merits’ of these reasons.”4°* In this regard,
the Applicant clarifies that “Venezuela is not holding that the Committee should review
the adequacy or merits of the reasons presented by the Tribunal in terms of factual or legal

correctness.’”4

470

Relying on the annulment decision in TECO v. Guatemala,*" the Applicant further argues

that “the failure to state reasons may also arise where the tribunal ignores the evidence

before it.”*”! According to the Applicant, in that case the committee gave high importance
“to the fact that the tribunal’s reasoning with respect to damages was unclear and hard to

follow [and that this] defect was not compensated for by the mere reference made to

elements that were not actually considered at the time of adopting the decision.”4””

310. Finally, the Applicant also contends that annulment committees should not “create the

reasons justifying the conclusion reached by a tribunal.”*75

b. Respondent on Annulment’s Position

311. First, OIEG asserts that, as pointed out by previous annulment committees, the scope of
review under Article 52(1)(e) is very narrow and the threshold for annulment very high.‘
For OIEG, the standard to be applied is whether the Tribunal has failed to satisfy the
“minimum requirement” to state reasons sufficient “to explain to the parties the motives
that have induced the tribunal to adopt its decision.”*”* As long as “an ‘informed reader’
would understand the reasons, discern no material contradiction in them, and the reasons
are ‘sufficiently clear and sufficiently displayed’, annulment under Article 52(1)(e) must
be refused.”4” In other words, “[flor annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID
Convention to be justified: (a) the failure to state reasons must leave the decision on a
particular point essentially lacking in any expressed rationale; and (b) that point must itself

be necessary to the tribunal’s decision.”4””

Second, OIEG argues that a tribunal is not required to address each argument or sub-issue
raised by the parties but only such questions as it considers determinative to resolve the
dispute.‘”* Citing the annulment decision in Alapli v. Turkey,*” OIEG points out that
tribunals have a broad discretion in the exercise of their decision-making power. “They are
not required to address each and every argument or sub-issue. Rather, tribunals are required
to: (a) deal with each of the parties’ heads of claim more broadly; and (b) decide questions

raised by the parties that are determinative to resolve the dispute between them.”4*°

OIEG further contends that an award should be construed so as to eliminate contradictory
reasoning insofar as is possible.**! Citing Amco v. Indonesia and Rumeli v. Kazakhstan,
OIEG argues that “[n]ot every gap or ambiguity in reasoning [] constitutes a failure to state
reasons”**? under Article 52(1)(e) and “[c]ontradictory reasons do not constitute a failure
to state reasons ‘unless they completely cancel each other out and therefore amount to a
total absence of reasons.””4*? For OIEG, “jurisprudence confirms that committees should
always attempt to construe the language of an award in a way that results in consistency,”

as opposed to its inner contradictions.**4

Finally, OIEG maintains that failure to state reasons can only lead to annulment when it
concerns a decision that had an impact on the outcome of the dispute.**> As the committee
in Alapli v. Turkey made clear, the tribunal’s lack of reasoning must refer to “a point that

was essential to the outcome of the case.”4*°

that annulment under this ground requires a failure by the tribunal to comply with its duty
of rendering an award that allows an informed reader to comprehend and follow its

reasoning, *®”

The 2016 ICSID Paper, quoting decisions of other ad hoc committees, similarly confirms
that “the requirement to state reasons is intended to ensure that parties can understand the
reasoning of the Tribunal, meaning the reader can understand the facts and law applied by
the Tribunal in coming to its conclusion. The correctness of the reasoning or whether it is
convincing is not relevant.”4** As this Committee has already expressed in Section ITI.A(3),
addressing the “Nature and Scope of the Annulment Mechanism,” annulment under the

ICSID Convention is not in any form an appeal of an award.

The Applicant agrees that this Committee should not review the adequacy of the merits of
the reasons presented by the Tribunal in terms of factual or legal correctness.**? The
Respondent on Annulment maintains the same principle, adding that, despite the
Applicant’s statements to the contrary, most of the Applicant’s arguments are directed at

showing the Tribunal’s findings on the facts and the law are incorrect.*”°

As stated by the ad hoc Committee in MINE v. Guinea, “the requirement to state reasons
is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from
Point A to Point B, and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of
law”?!

This Committee considers relevant and appropriate that in analyzing if this ground on
annulment has been established, or not, the Committee should generally seek to construe
the language of the Award in a way that results in consistency, as opposed to finding its

possible inner contradictions.*””

Case 1:16-cv-01533-ABJ Document 52-1 Filed 12/10/18 Page 107 of 135

Prior annulment committees have recalled that the standard under Article 52(1)(e) is a
minimum standard, which is intended to ensure that a reasonable reader may understand
the award.**? Thus, this Committee concurs in the view that, as in the case of the other
annulment grounds, the scope of review under Article 52(1)(e) is strict and the threshold

for annulment is high.4"

Article 52(1)(e), therefore, does not allow a committee to evaluate or assess the correctness
or adequacy of the reasoning in the award, even less, inquire into or raise questions
regarding the quality of the reasons. Rather, as specified by the ad hoc committee in Alapli,
“the Applicant bears the burden of proving that the Tribunal’s reasoning on a point which
is essential to the outcome of the case was either unintelligible or contradictory or frivolous

or absent.”45

(2) Application of the Legal Standard to the Present Case
a. Applicant’s Position

The Applicant states that the Tribunal failed to state reasons (i) in deciding that there was

an expropriation in violation of the BIT and (ii) in calculating the amount of damages.

(i) The Tribunal failed to state reasons in deciding that there was an
expropriation in violation of the BIT

The Applicant explains that the Tribunal concluded that Venezuela violated Article 6 of

the BIT “by purportedly failing to appropriately identify the property subject to

expropriation,” which led the Tribunal to conclude that Venezuela violated the due process

of law.*°° However, the Applicant notes that the property expropriated is identified in the

Award itself, “which confirms that such property was always identified and known to

OIEG.”°7 On this basis, the Applicant argues that the Tribunal’s Award includes a

contradiction that is equivalent to a failure to state reasons.‘°*

324. Further, the Applicant contends that the “Tribunal includes no discussion, explanation, or
indication as regards the international law decisions or doctrines that allegedly support the
idea that the clear identification of the property subject to expropriation ‘constitutes a basic
guarantee of due process required by international [I]aw.’”? This failure makes it
impossible for Venezuela to understand the decision adopted by the Tribunal in this

respect,*” particularly since:

it is not possible to identify any international law rule stating that
“due process” may be affected by an alleged defect in an
administrative act within the framework of an expropriation,
without evidence having been submitted that there were no judicial
remedies for the purportedly affected party to complain about such
defect or that such party actually attempted—at least—to make use
of such remedies or demonstrated that any attempt to do so would
have been futile.°°!

325. In this regard, the Applicant points out that there is “an incurable contradiction in the

Tribunal’s arguments” in this respect given that:

it is a proven fact that the Claimant did not resort to any of the
judicial remedies that were available with the aim of challenging any
potential defect that it deemed to exist in any of the administrative
acts of the Republic relating to the expropriation and because the
general definition of the guarantee of due process provided by the
Tribunal in the Award refers to the “minimum regulatory standard
commonly accepted” in relation to the availability of appropriate
judicial proceedings to protect any right that a person might deem to
be affected by a State act.*

Moreover, the Applicant claims that, when analyzing the measures from the perspective of
the fair and equitable treatment standard, the Tribunal reaches the opposite conclusion:
“that the Republic did not violate international law because [OIEG] did not resort, attempt
to resort, or demonstrate the futility of resorting, to the judicial remedies that [...] were
available to it.%°> For the Applicant, this “flagrant logical inconsistency, which is
equivalent to the total absence of reason, is confirmed upon verifying that the Tribunal uses
the same concept of ‘due process’ as it is understood in international law to analyze the
matter of expropriation and the issue of fair and equitable treatment, as expressly stated by

the Tribunal.”°*

(ii) The Tribunal failed to state reasons in calculating the amount of damages

The Applicant claims that the Tribunal applied a discount rate that “is in conflict with the

premises established in the Award.” As explained by expert Daniel Flores:

The Award stated that the DCF valuation it calculated was
“confirmed” by two “sanity checks”: (i) pricing multiples and (ii)
the Companies’ share of the OI Group (the parent of the
Companies). In fact, the Award’s “sanity checks” are contradicted
by its own reasoning elsewhere in the Award. Had the “sanity
checks” been properly performed, they would have shown that the
Award’s DCF valuation of the Companies was overstated.*°>

In this regard, the Applicant contends that the Tribunal’s multiples calculation did not
apply a country risk adjustment that it recognized was necessary in the DCF valuation.*°°
Similarly, with regard to the second “sanity check” (the Companies’ share of the OI
Group), the Applicant states that it is impossible to assign the Companies an intrinsic value
as a percentage of the entire group without taking into account “the ‘risk premium’ which
weighs the circumstances to which each of the assets of this ‘group as a whole’ are

exposed.”°07

Additionally, the Applicant claims that the Tribunal contradicted itself in fixing the value

of Bolivars in US dollars terms.*° As explained by expert Daniel Flores:

[...] the Award found that OIEG was not entitled to unfettered
access to the official exchange rate and therefore could not claim
damages for not being able to exchange bolivars at that rate.

However, the Award took a different position with respect to the
U.S. dollar value of bolivar denominated “excess cash balances”
that the Companies held on the valuation date. For those cash
balances, [...] the Award assumed that OIEG would have been able
to convert its excess cash from bolivars into U.S. dollars using the
official exchange rate, which is inconsistent with the Award’s earlier
determination that OIEG was not entitled and had not been able to
do so in the past. The Award did not state any reason for this
inconsistent treatment of the value of bolivars.

Lastly, the Applicant argues that the Tribunal failed to state the reasons based on which it
assigned a unified value to both Plants and then calculated the 72.983% equity interest,
“which led to an artificial increase in the value of the [C]ompanies.”*!° According to the
Applicant, the Tribunal’s “mistake is glaring, since it is an undisputed fact that [OTEG] had
different levels of participation in the [C]ompanies. [...] In this context, the calculation of
damages recognized by the Tribunal not only does not reflect those circumstances—which

were established in the proceedings—but is actually inconsistent with them.”5!!

b. Respondent on Annulment’s Position

Contrary to the Applicant’s arguments, the Respondent on Annulment contends that: (i)
the Tribunal’s finding that the Applicant’s expropriation of the Respondent on
Annulment’s investments was not carried out in accordance with due process, and (ii) the
Tribunal’s valuation of the expropriated investments are both based on sufficient, adequate

and coherent reasons.

(i) The Tribunal’s finding that the expropriation was not carried out in
accordance with due process is based on adequate, sufficient and coherent
reasons

Contrary to the Applicant’s arguments, OIEG claims that there is no contradiction between
the Tribunal’s conclusion “that the Expropriation Decree did not clearly identify the assets
that were to be expropriated and the fact that, once the effects of the expropriation
materialised fully, the Tribunal and some experts were able to assess the value of the assets

that had been expropriated.”*!

In this regard, the Respondent on Annulment explains that the Tribunal found that, at the
time the Expropriation Decree was issued, OIEG could not know precisely which assets
would be expropriated! and on this basis concluded that the expropriation was not carried
out in accordance with the “due process of law” requirement in Article 6(a) of the BIT.*!*
However, by the time the Tribunal started its deliberations and issued its Award, “the
effects of the expropriation had materialized fully” and OIEG “knew which assets had been
taken from it by the Applicant,” and thus the Tribunal was able to determine the amount of

compensation owed by that the Applicant.*!>

Further, OIEG also objects to the Applicant’s argument that there is a contradiction
between: (a) the Tribunal’s finding that the Applicant’s failure to identify clearly the assets
that would be expropriated constitutes a breach of the BIT’s “due process of law”
requirement; and (b) the Tribunal’s finding that the Applicant had not violated due process
as part of the protection against unfair and inequitable treatment under the BIT.*!®
According to OIEG, this argument “lacks any merit because it is based on a blatant

misrepresentation of the Award.”>!”

First, OIEG argues that the premise that the Tribunal found that the Applicant had not

violated due process as part of the protection against unfair and inequitable treatment under

the BIT is false. Instead, “[t]he Tribunal actually concluded that the Applicant violated due
process as part of the protection against unfair and inequitable treatment under the BIT in

several ways.”>'® OIEG cites as examples paragraphs 560 and 557 of the Award.>!

Second, OIEG claims that “the Tribunal never stated that a finding of [a] violation of due
process in the context of the fair and equitable treatment standard requires that the injured
party use avenues available to it to challenge the flaws of the relevant administrative

acts,”°2°

(ii) The Tribunal’s valuation of the expropriated investments is based on
sufficient, adequate and coherent reasons

OIEG claims that the Applicant’s argument that the Tribunal contradicted itself by not
applying a country risk adjustment to its EBITDA multiples “sanity check” must fail. OTEG
contends that “[w]hen undertaking an EV/EBITDA multiples analysis, it is wrong to apply
country risk because one of the steps of that analysis involves identifying comparable
companies” and therefore, as explained by the Second Navigant Report, “[b]y definition,
that step takes into account a level of country risk in which those comparable companies

operate.”57!

OIEG further notes that, indeed, on the basis of the evidence before it, the Tribunal
determined that two companies, Argentina-based Rigolleau and Brazil-based CIV, were
truly comparable companies for the purposes of the sanity check and that the Applicant’s
own expert in the Underlying Arbitration accepted as much.°? Accordingly, for the
Respondent on Annulment, “the Tribunal’s approach and its reasoning was consistent with
economic principles and with the positions of both Parties and their experts in the OJEG

Arbitration.”°

OIEG also objects to the Applicant’s argument regarding the alleged contradiction
concerning the conversion of the excess cash balance from Bolivars into US dollars and
the Bolivar-denominated DCF valuation. In this regard, OIEG contends that the Tribunal
did not find that access to the official exchange rate had not been available for OIEG or the
Companies, but that the BIT did not guarantee such access. In fact, the Tribunal rejected
the Respondent on Annulment’s repatriation claim not because OIEG or the Companies
were unable to access the official market, but because the Companies chose not to and

opted instead for the “parallel market.”°74

On this basis, OIEG claims that the Tribunal did not contradict itself by finding that the
official exchange rate was the appropriate rate to use to otherwise convert the value of the
Respondent on Annulment’s investment into US dollars. “To the contrary, as explained by
Messrs Kaczmarek and Shopp in the First and Second Navigant Reports, ‘the [Tribunal’s]
use of the official exchange rate aligns with fundamental economic principles’ and ‘is

consistent with the practice of financial and economic experts.””°75

Finally, OIEG contends that the Applicant’s argument that the Tribunal failed to state the
reasons based on which it assigned a unified value to both Plants and then calculated the
72.983% equity interest, which led to an artificial increase in the value of the Companies,

is entirely unsubstantiated by the evidence.*”°

OIEG explains that the Tribunal “valued the Respondent on Annulment’s shareholding in
both [Companies] on a combined basis” and then allocated a portion of this combined value
to the Respondent on Annulment in accordance with its equity interest.°?” OIEG notes that
this approach “was necessary due to the consolidated nature of the [C]ompanies’ financial

result and their shared management”*”* which is confirmed by the fact that “both Parties’

c. The Committee’s Analysis

As set forth above, the Applicant advances two main arguments or grounds in support of
the alleged failure to state the reasons on which the Award is based (Article 52(1)(e)), as
follows: (i) that the Tribunal failed to state its reasons in deciding that there was an
expropriation in violation of the BIT; and (ii) that the Tribunal failed to state its reasons in

calculating the quantum of the damages awarded.

At the outset, this Committee confirms as part of this final Section of its analysis that it
holds the view that the Award, in general, is well motivated.**? Consequently, the
Committee has strained to comprehend the position of the Applicant, particularly in view
of the very basic point already stated throughout this Decision that annulment is an
extraordinary recourse, and not a mechanism of appeal by virtue of which an ad hoc
committee can revisit the correctness or incorrectness of the Tribunal’s reasons for its

Award.

As for the finding of expropriation more specifically, the Award sets out detailed reasoning
leading to its findings concerning compliance with each of the various requirements for a
lawful expropriation under Article 6 of the BIT.**! After analyzing the applicable law and
the facts, the Tribunal specifically concluded that the expropriation was carried out in the
public interest and was not discriminatory, but also determined that there had been a lack
of due process as well as an “excessive and unjustified delay in the payment” of

compensation.**?

529 Counter-Memorial on Annulment, 373.

530 This Committee has had no difficulty understanding the Tribunal’s reasoning in the Award. The present case is by
no measure comparable to the TECO v. Guatemala case, to which the Applicant refers (see supra §] 309). There, the
committee stated that “the Tribunal’s reasoning on the loss of value claim is not clear at all, such that the Committee,
despite having had the benefit of the Parties’ submissions and of the entire record before it, has struggled to understand
the Tribunal’s line of reasoning.” TECO v. Guatemala, § 128 (VLA-49).

346. This Committee considers, as the Respondent on Annulment maintains,>*> that the
Tribunal’s determination that the Applicant’s expropriation of OIEG’s investments was
not carried out in accordance with due process was sufficiently reasoned, including the
Tribunal’s finding that a failure to identify clearly the expropriated assets affects due
process. The Committee recalls that the due process requirement, which the Tribunal
applied, is contained in the BIT’s expropriation provision (Article 6(a)),°*4 and that it is for

the Tribunal to interpret the BIT as part of its findings on the merits.

347. In the Committee’s view, the Tribunal adopted a clear three-step rationale (i) defining due
process of law within the meaning of Article 6 of the BIT,**> (ii) explaining why the failure
to identify clearly the expropriated property is incompatible with due process,**° and (iii)

showing that the expropriation measure in dispute failed to comply with the due process

requirement of Article 6(a) of the BIT.**”

348. The Tribunal reviewed the provisions of the Expropriation Decree so as to demonstrate
that “[t]he imprecise language of the Decree prevented the Claimant from knowing

precisely which of its assets would be expropriated, and as such, violated its right to due

99,538

process”;*** the Tribunal then showed how the “uncertainty regarding exactly which

property was being expropriated persisted throughout the expropriation process.”°*? In

view of the “significant weaknesses”? the Tribunal had identified, the Tribunal concluded

54 Award, | 385.

535 Award, | 387. The Tribunal noted that Article 6(a) of the BIT “does not refer specifically to the regulations of the
expropriating State, but to due process in general, a generic concept which must be interpreted in accordance with the
requirements of international Law [...].” /d. The Tribunal went on to explain that due process “is this minimum
regulatory standard commonly accepted in all States under the rule of law which guarantees the subject that any
decision affecting it will be adopted after having gone through a fair and equitable process.” Id.

536 Award, 395. The Tribunal agreed with the Respondent on Annulment’s view that “an essential component of
due process, required by international Law, is that the party whose property is expropriated must know, with certainty,
which assets the State is forcibly acquiring.” /d. The Tribunal then elaborated that “if the expropriation order, which
may have been issued inaudita parte, did not clearly and with certainty define which assets are to be expropriated,
this would allow the Executive Branch to determine, at its discretion, what set of assets would be expropriated and
this would undermine the investor’s right to obtain an independent review of the decision.” Id.

that it was “a proven fact that in the Expropriation Decree and the subsequent legal action,
the Respondent failed to clearly identify the property subject to expropriation, the
definition of which constitutes a basic guarantee of due process required by international

Law.”™! This in turn amounted to a violation of due process under Article 6(a) of the BIT.

The fact that the Tribunal’s reasoning does not contain references to cases or scholarly
comments does not mean that that its reasoning is absent or contradictory. On the contrary,
as shown above, the Tribunal’s reasoning can easily be followed from point A to point B,
as required under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention. That is not to say, of course,
that this Committee agrees or not with the Tribunal’s reasoning or that it considers such
reasoning correct or incorrect. The Committee has been able to understand how the
Tribunal reached its conclusions, regardless of whether the Committee agrees or disagrees

with those conclusions.

In addition, this Committee is persuaded by the point made by the Respondent on
Annulment that there is no contradiction between the Tribunal’s conclusion “that the
Expropriation Decree did not clearly identify the assets that were to be expropriated and
the fact that, once the effects of the expropriation had materialised fully, the Tribunal and

some experts were able to assess the value of the assets that had been expropriated.”°*”

Similarly, the Committee cannot agree with the Applicant’s contention that there is a
contradiction amounting to a failure to state reasons based on the Tribunal’s findings that
(a) the Applicant violated the BIT’s “due process of law” requirement upon failing to
identify precisely the assets to be expropriated; and (b) the Applicant had not violated due

process as part of the protection against unfair and inequitable treatment under the BIT.

The Award is clear that, in fact, the Tribunal found that the Applicant had violated due
process in breach of the BIT’s fair and equitable treatment obligation.* Indeed, in
applying the fair and equitable treatment standard to the facts, the Tribunal began by

recalling its conclusion of an unlawful expropriation due to the Applicant’s failure to

follow due process as well as “an excessive and unjustified delay in payment of the due
compensation.”** In such case, the Tribunal concluded, “the Republic must have also

breached the guarantee of FET.”*45

Additionally, even assuming that the Applicant could establish the asserted contradiction
as regards the Tribunal’s findings on due process, as noted the Tribunal also based its
finding of unlawful expropriation on “an excessive and unjustified delay” in the payment
of compensation. Thus, the Applicant has not sustained its burden of proving that the
Tribunal’s reasoning on “a point which is essential to the outcome of the case” was absent
or contradictory.*“° Accordingly, there is no annullable error for failure to state reasons as
regards the Tribunal’s determination that the Applicant violated the due process

requirement under Article 6 of the BIT.

The second asserted basis for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) (failure to state reasons)
relates to the calculation of the amount of damages. The Applicant’s principal argument is

that there are serious contradictions in the Tribunal’s Award.

The debate circles around various topics, including contentions that the Tribunal
contradicted itself by (i) not applying a country risk adjustment to its EBITDA multiples
“sanity check”;*4’ (ii) determining that two companies were truly comparable for the
purpose of the sanity check;*#* and finally (iii) using the official exchange rate from
Bolivars to US dollars to convert the excess cash balance and a Bolivar-denominated DCF

valuation.”

As regards these and other similar arguments raised by the Applicant as a basis for this
ground for annulment, and the counter arguments of the Respondent on Annulment, this
Committee confirms what was stated at the outset, at paragraph 344 above: it finds that the

Award is abundant in its reasoning as regards matters related to the calculation of damages

and, as addressed above, the prior determination that there was an expropriation in violation
of the BIT.

Specifically as regards the calculation of damages, the Tribunal’s findings are set forth in
detail, and accompanied by ample reasoning.’ The Applicant’s principal contentions to
the contrary are addressed in turn. The first and second contentions are considered together.
Namely, the Applicant maintains that the Tribunal failed to state its reasons in undertaking
sanity checks by not applying a country risk adjustment to its EBITDA multiples analysis
(after having done so in its DCF analysis), and by determining that two companies were

comparable.

The Committee rejects these grounds. The expert evidence supports a view that because
the EBITDA multiples analysis involves identifying comparable companies, “[b]y
definition, that step takes into account a level of country risk in which those comparable

companies operate.”°>!

Furthermore, in determining the appropriate comparable
companies, the Tribunal methodically reviewed the positions of each Party’s expert in the
Underlying Arbitration.**? Indeed, the Award records a measure of agreement on the part
of Venezuela’s appointed expert with this aspect of the Tribunal’s determination.*> In the
circumstances, the Applicant has not sustained its burden to show the asserted

contradiction.

The Applicant’s third contention concerns the Bolivar-US dollar exchange rate used by the
Tribunal in the conversion of (i) the excess cash balance and in (ii) a Bolivar-denominated
DCF valuation. The Applicant complains that the Award assumes that the conversion
could have been undertaken at the official (“privileged”) exchange rate, whereas according
to the Applicant the Tribunal found in a prior section of the Award that such rate was not
available to OIEG.*** However, the Tribunal’s prior finding, which pertains to OIEG’s

claim under the BIT transfers provision, was in fact that OIEG, “had the option of resorting

to the official market or the parallel market” for currency conversion.*°> “By opting for the
parallel market,” the Tribunal explained, “it is inappropriate for Claimant to complain”
about decisions to reject the transfer requests.**° Thus, the Tribunal rejected the transfers
claim based on a finding that OIEG had opted to forego the official market, not that OIEG
was not entitled to the official rate or had not been able to obtain that rate in the past. Again,

the Applicant has not established the alleged contradiction.°*”

360. Finally, the Committee briefly addresses the Applicant’s further contention that “the
Tribunal failed to state the reasons based on which it assigned a unified value to both Plants
and then calculated the 72.983% equity interest, which led to an artificial increase in the
value of the [C]ompanies.”*** The Committee notes that the Applicant has elected not to
expand on this argument.**? Nor has it provided a response to the Respondent on
Annulment’s arguments on this point,* neither in the Applicant’s Reply on Annulment
nor at the Hearing on Annulment. The Committee further notes the statement in the First
Navigant Report that, in the Underlying Arbitration, “[...] both Parties’ experts only ever
valued the companies as a combined entity.”**! In the circumstances, the Committee finds

no basis for annulling the Award on this ground.

361. In summary, after a careful review of the Award, the Committee does not discern any of

the contradictions alleged by the Applicant, even less, contradictions of such nature that

they could be considered mutually inconsistent and thus cancelling each other out.”

Rather, the Committee is able “to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A to Point

B and eventually to its conclusions.”>°

Accordingly, this Committee is not satisfied that there is a showing by the Applicant of the
existence or materialization of a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID

Convention.

Costs

On December 11, 2017, each Party presented its submissions on costs in accordance with
Section 22.1 of Procedural Order No. 1 and the Committee’s direction at the close of the
Hearing on Annulment.* Additionally, following a March 9, 2018 decision, as noted at
paragraph 40 above, rejecting the Applicant’s proposal to disqualify Dr. Castellanos and
condemning the Applicant to bear all the associated costs,*°* the Respondent on Annulment
provided on March 29, 2018 its statement of costs incurred in relation to the Proposal for
Disqualification, followed by the Applicant’s observations. On September 7, 2018, further
to the Committee’s invitation, each Party submitted its statement of costs associated with

the Second Stay Request.

As set forth below, each Party invokes the principle of costs follow the event and seeks

reimbursement of all of its costs, with interest.

qd Applicant’s Cost Submissions

In its Costs Submission of December 11, 2017, referring to Article 61(2) of the ICSID
Convention and Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e), the Applicant seeks an
order condemning the Respondent on Annulment to pay all the costs of the proceedings

maintains that its costs amply satisfy the requisite reasonableness threshold, especially in

view of the complexity of the case and multiple grounds of annulment.*”

366. The Applicant specifies that the Committee has discretion to determine the allocation of
all costs.°°* Citing the EDF annulment committee, the Applicant maintains that there are
no presumptions in respect of the allocation of costs between the parties, nor have the
decisions of ad hoc committees given rise to a jurisprudence constante.*® Rather, the
Applicant asserts that the result should depend in “great measure” on the circumstances of

the case, which in this case warrant that the Respondent on Annulment should carry the

entirety of the costs.>”°

367. The Applicant invokes the principle of costs follow the event, which “serves to compensate
the prevailing party” and “has been followed by various annulment committees in

numerous cases.”57' The Applicant approvingly quotes, for example, the committee’s

decision in Adem Dogan v. Turkmenistan for the proposition that “‘costs follow the event’,

99572

unless a different approach is called for,”°’* and adds that the principle that costs must be

charged to the losing party is “strongly recognized.”>7>

368. The Applicant further states that the representation has been managed with complete
seriousness and — as the jurisprudence has signalled is important — professionalism,*”* and

with “maximum efforts” for achieving an abbreviated schedule and complying with the

As regards ICSID advance payments, in its December 11, 2017 Submission on Costs, the

However, as of that date, the Applicant in fact had made advance payments of
US$394,767.29, not US$600,000.**! Additionally, the Applicant noted its payment of the
US$25,000 registration fee with its Application.

In its April 9, 2018 observations on the Respondent on Annulment’s statement of costs in
relation to the Proposal for Disqualification, the Applicant recorded that “the Republic has

no observations on the economic content of said declaration,”*** but added,

its absolute disagreement with the early condemnation of costs
incurred by the arbitrators Bernardini and Pawlak, which

(2) Respondent on Annulment’s Cost Submissions

372. The Respondent on Annulment’s Submission on Costs of December 11, 2017 maintains
that the Applicant should bear all costs of this proceeding and all of the Respondent on

Annulment’s legal fees and expenses, together with interest.°**

373. The Respondent on Annulment posits that there is a presumption that the applicant should
bear all costs of the proceeding (i.e, ICSID and Committee costs), citing ICSID
Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e), and the annulment decision in Azurix v.
Argentina.*> The Respondent on Annulment contends, “while an equal distribution of
costs was common in early annulment decisions, recent jurisprudence supports OIEG’s
position.”°*°

374. The Respondent on Annulment adds that no special circumstances justify departing from
this presumption in this case, and that an award of legal fees and expenses in its favor is
necessary to make it whole, if the Application is unsuccessful.**? For support, the
Respondent on Annulment cites the annulment decisions in Adem Dogan v. Turkmenistan
and Alapli v. Turkey, in which the unsuccessful applicants were ordered to bear all costs of

the proceeding and all of the responding parties’ legal expenses.***

375. The Respondent on Annulment further argues that a costs award in its favor, including
legal representation costs, is warranted because the Applicant’s Application was
“manifestly meritless,” citing the annulment decisions in CDC v. Seychelles and AES v.

Hungary.>*° The Respondent on Annulment adds that the Applicant’s litigation tactics

improperly delayed the proceeding and increased costs.*””

Case 1:16-cv-01533-ABJ Document 52-1 Filed 12/10/18 Page 124 of 135

376. The Respondent on Annulment also refers to the Applicant’s failures to comply in a timely
manner with the advance payment requests of the Centre pursuant to Administrative and
Financial Regulation 14(3)(e), which resulted in “a close-to-six-month suspension of the
proceeding” and “the consequent postponement of the hearing” by nine months.*?! The
Respondent on Annulment adds that the Applicant’s (i) repeated use of evidence not in the
record (in breach of the Committee’s procedural orders); (ii) insistence on oral expert
testimony at the Hearing on Annulment (although deemed not necessary by the
Committee); and (iii) unsuccessful request for a stay of enforcement of the Award,

unnecessarily increased costs in this case.*”

377. _ Finally, the Respondent on Annulment seeks interest on any costs award in its favor, under
the same terms as ordered by the Tribunal in its Award.*?? Among the factors offered in
support of an award of interest, the Respondent on Annulment cites the Applicant’s failure
to pay ICSID advances and failure to comply with recent adverse awards, and states that
awarding interest will mitigate the risk of noncompliance with a costs award, without

causing undue prejudice to the Applicant.°*

378. In its December 11, 2017 Submission on Costs, the Respondent on Annulment presented
that its total legal fees and expenses arising from the proceeding amount to

US$3,241,998.98.5%

379. On March 29, 2018, the Respondent on Annulment further reported that the costs incurred
in connection with the Applicant’s failed proposal to disqualify Dr. Castellanos amounted

to US$206,524.°°° On September 7, 2018, the Respondent on Annulment informed the

(3) The Committee’s Analysis

382. ICSID Convention Article 61(2) (read in connection with ICSID Arbitration Rules 47(1)()
and 53), provides that this Committee shall

118

383.

384.

385.

Case 1:16-cv-01533-ABJ Document 52-1 Filed 12/10/18 Page 127 of 135

assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the
proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the
fees and expenses of the members of the [Committee] and the
charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid.

These provisions grant this Committee broad discretion concerning apportioning and

awarding costs.

a. Costs of Proceeding

With respect to the costs for the use of the Centre, and the fees and expenses of the
Committee members, the Committee finds, consistent with the decisions of a majority of
annulment committees in recent years, that an unsuccessful applicant should generally bear
the full costs of the Centre and of the Committee members, unless special circumstances

warrant otherwise.°!

The Committee’s finding is also informed by ICSID Administrative
and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e), which provides that the applicant is “solely responsible”
for paying the advances (without prejudice to the Committee’s later discretion to
reapportion those costs).°? Regulation 14(3)(e), together with the Applicant’s delays in

603

making advance payments” and more generally the principle that costs follow the event

604

(which the Applicant has endorsed),°”* support the allocation of costs of the proceeding to

the unsuccessful Applicant.

Accordingly, given that each of the Applicant’s asserted grounds for annulment has failed,
the Committee finds that the Applicant should bear the costs of the proceeding in full. No
special circumstances exist in this case that justify a different result.°°> As noted above, the
Respondent on Annulment has paid the third and fourth advances on the Applicant’s behalf

in March and July of 2018, and therefore the Applicant must reimburse the Respondent on

Annulment the expended portion of the advance payments (and interest thereon) made by

the Respondent on Annulment, namely US$381,862.05.5°
386. The costs of the proceeding are summarized as follows:

Committee’s fees and expenses

Dr. Alvaro Castellanos US$133,839.70

Professor Piero Bernardini US$239,296.30

Mr. David Pawlak US$189,162.24
ICSID’s administrative fees US$148,000
Direct expenses US$68,296.84
Total US$778,595.08

387. The above costs have been paid out of advances made by the Applicant (US$394,767.29
and interest thereon), and the Respondent on Annulment (US$379,970 and interest
thereon). As noted above, the expended portion of the advance payments (and interest

thereon) made by the Respondent on Annulment amounts to US$381,862.05.

b. Legal representation fees and expenses

388. With respect to the legal representation fees and expenses of the Parties, the Committee
recalls its broad discretion to decide based on the circumstances of the case, which, as noted

above, is a position advocated by the Applicant. The Committee also observes that other

606 See Letter from ICSID to the Parties, February 8, 2018 (in Spanish), pp. 1, 2 (recording the Applicant’s assurances
of December 13, 2017 and of January 11, 2018 that payment was imminent, although it never was made); Letter from
ICSID to the Parties, March 8, 2018; Letter from ICSID to the Parties, July 25, 201 S See also Repsol v. Petroecuador,

Centre that it had incurred, including the fees and expenses of the committee members), of. Suez v. Argentina, § 434
(OILA-141) (where the unsuccessful applicant had already paid all ICSID advances, “no reimbursement order [was]
required.”). The interest earned on the advance payments made by the Respondent on Annulment amounts to
US$ 1,892.05. A statement of account will be sent to the Parties separately.

ad hoc committees have ordered the applicant to reimburse the successful respondent on

annulment for all or a substantial portion of such fees and expenses.”

In deciding on the proper apportionment of legal fees and expenses, the Committee has
taken into account, first and foremost, that the Applicant has failed to sustain any of the
alleged grounds for annulment.5* The Committee, like others before it, tends to agree that
generally a party that has been compelled to defend a favorable award against a wholly

unsuccessful Application should not suffer the further burden of having to pay for it.°

In addition, the Applicant has failed in these annulment proceedings to make the requested
advance payments in a timely manner. The Applicant’s delays resulted in numerous
unnecessary communications and substantial disruption to the proceedings, including a
nine-month postponement of the Hearing on Annulment, the date of which had been
confirmed already in Procedural Order No. 1. As the Respondent on Annulment has
observed, the Repsol committee, noting “exceptional delay” relating to advance payments,
ordered that the applicant “bear all the costs incurred by the Centre [...] [and] half of the

professional fees and related expenses incurred by [the respondent on annulment].””!°

In the overall circumstances, the Committee exercises its discretion as to the allocation of
costs under ICSID Convention Article 61(2) by deciding that the Applicant shall reimburse
all of the Respondent on Annulment’s reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in

connection with the main proceeding.

As for the legal representation costs associated with the Proposal for Disqualification, it

has been decided that those costs shall be borne by the Applicant. As noted, the Respondent

on Annulment has claimed US$206,524 in connection with the challenge to
Dr. Castellanos. The Applicant was explicit that it had “no observations on the economic
content of” the claimed amount.°!! While the costs claimed are high,°'? the Applicant has
not objected as to the amount, and it is understandable that the Respondent on Annulment
would defend against the Applicant’s Disqualification Proposal vigorously, especially
given that it was presented at a late stage in the proceedings. In the circumstances, the
Committee confirms the decision to award the Respondent on Annulment its legal fees

associated with the Disqualification Proposal.

393. The Committee recalls, as recited in paragraph 371 above, the Applicant’s “absolute
disagreement” with the decision of the Two Members, and the statement that such decision
“contravenes sustained practice in the matter of challenge and [...] sets a dangerous
precedent.”°'? However, the Two Members’ directive is consistent with prior cases,°'* and
with the principle of costs follow the event, both in the context of the ultimate disposition
of a case,°'5 as well as in earlier phases thereof (such as at the time of the decision rejecting

the challenge).°!®

°!! E-mail from the Applicant to ICSID, April 9, 2018 at 4:30 PM.

°!2 The Committee observes that the amount claimed by the Respondent on Annulment is equivalent, for example, to
approximately 550 hours of work at the rates afforded to ICSID tribunal and committee members. At even triple those
rates, the amount claimed is equivalent to approximately 180 hours of work on opposing the challenge. This work
necessarily had to have been undertaken during the period from the date of the Disqualification Proposal on December
13, 2017 to the final submission of the Applicant on January 26, 2018 relating to translation issues associated with the
Disqualification Proposal.

394. The Committee further recalls that the Applicant filed a Second Stay Request at a very late
stage in this proceeding, which gave rise to additional costs (US$21,360 for the Applicant
and US$34,426.02 for the Respondent on Annulment). As noted in the Committee’s
Decision on the Second Stay Request, not only did the Applicant fail in its bid to challenge
the rationale of the Committee’s First Stay Decision, but the available evidence confirmed
this rationale.*'’ In addition, the Committee cannot help but note the incongruity of the
Second Stay Request at such a late stage and in the circumstances of the Applicant’s failure
to make two of the requested advance payments. While, in light of the foregoing, these
further costs could have been avoided, they do not appear to be excessive in view of the

Parties’ submissions on the Second Stay Request.

395. More generally as to the reasonableness of legal fees and expenses claimed by each Party,
the Committee records that neither Party has provided any substantiation and only very
limited specification of its legal representation costs and expenses, in accordance with the
approach that the Parties effectively agreed upon, and the Committee accepted, at the close
of the Hearing on Annulment. While the Committee considers that the costs claimed by
both Parties are rather high for an annulment proceeding involving one two-day hearing,
and that the better practice is at least some degree of substantiation and specification of
legal fees and costs, both Parties have advocated for a costs-follow-the-event approach and
neither Party has contested the quantum of the legal fees and expenses of the other Party.

In fact, although not decisive as to reasonableness,°!* the Parties respective claims for legal

fees and expenses for the main proceeding are not vastly different (US$2,810,000.00°"” for
the Applicant and US$3,241,998.98°° for the Respondent on Annulment).

396. Under the circumstances, in the exercise of the Committee’s discretion, it determines that
it is appropriate to apportion all of the Respondent on Annulment’s legal fees and expenses,

as set out in the table at paragraph 381 above, to the Applicant.

c. Interest

397. As set forth above, this Committee retains broad discretion to fashion an appropriate cost
award,°"! and both Parties have called for an award of interest. As observed by the

Respondent on Annulment, previous ad hoc committees have issued interest on costs

622

awards against unsuccessful applicants. Consistent with the principle that costs

generally follow the event, this Committee finds that an award of interest (at the rate
provided in the Tribunal’s Award) is appropriate in this case to promote the Applicant’s

timely compliance with this Decision.°*

°l9 This figure reflects the Applicant’s claim for legal representation fees of US$2,750,000 (which includes expert
fees), and US$60,000 in expenses.

©0 This figure reflects the Respondent on Annulment’s claim for legal representation fees of USS3,241,998.98 until
December 11, 2017 (which includes Navigant’s expert fees and US$3,512.18 for expenses of OIEG’s representatives).
See supra 4378.

d. Summary of Determinations

For the reasons outlined above, the Committee finds that the Applicant shall be responsible
in full for the cost of proceeding in the amount of US$778,595.08, and thus must reimburse
the Respondent on Annulment the third and fourth advances paid to cover the costs of the
proceedings, including interest thereon, namely US$381,862.05. Additionally, the
Applicant shall bear the Respondent on Annulment’s legal representation costs and
expenses in the amount of US$3,482,949 (including US$3,241,998.98 for the main
proceedings up until December 11, 2017, US$206,524 of such costs associated with the
Disqualification Proposal, and the US$34,426.02 for costs arising out the Applicant’s
Second Stay Request). Interest shall apply to the total amount of the award of costs
(US$381,862.05 plus US$3,482,949) as of the date of this Decision until paid at the rate
provided in the Tribunal’s Award (i.e., calculated at a LIBOR interest rate for one-year

deposits in US dollars, plus a margin of 4%, with annual compounding of accrued interest).
