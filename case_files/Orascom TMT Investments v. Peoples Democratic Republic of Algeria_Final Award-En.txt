INTRODUCTION

This is an arbitration brought before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes (“ICSID”) under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between
States and Nationals of other States dated 18 March 1965 (“ICSID Convention”) and the
Agreement between the Belgo-Luxembourg Economic Union and the People’s Democratic
Republic of Algeria on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments (the “BLEU-
Algeria BIT” or the “BIT” or the “Treaty”).'

THE PARTIES

The Claimant

The Claimant is Orascom TMT Investments S.a r.l. (the “Claimant” or “OTMTI”). OTMTI was
incorporated in Luxembourg on 24 May 2005. Until 29 November 2012, OTMTI was named
Weather Investments II S.a r.|. (“Weather II”). Its current registered office is at 31-33, Avenue
Pasteur, L-2311 Luxembourg.*

The Respondent

The Respondent is the People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria (the “Respondent” or
“Algeria”).

OVERVIEW OF THE DISPUTE

This overview provides some basic background on the merits of the dispute and puts this
Award in context. It is not an exhaustive description of all the events relating to the merits and
it essentially relies on the account of the facts in the Claimant's Memorial on the merits, as the
Respondent has not submitted pleadings on the merits at this stage.

This dispute arises from the Claimant's alleged investments to build a mobile telephone
system in Algeria.

In May 2001, Algeria launched a public tender for bids for the award of a second Groupe
Spécial Mobile License (“GSM License”) to develop a mobile telecom network for Algeria. The
Egyptian company Orascom Telecom Holding S.A.E. (“OTH”, now Global Telecom Holding,
“GTH’) made the winning bid for the GSM License in the amount of US$ 737 million.

7. OTH began operations through its Algerian subsidiary, Orascom Telecom Algérie S.P.A.
(‘OTA’), in 2002. OTA operated under the brand names Djezzy and Allo. The Claimant
contends that after less than one year in business, OTA had 70% of the GSM market share.®

8. On 24 May 2005, Weather II, now known as OTMTI, was created and, so it submits, became
the ultimate owner of OTA. The Claimant contends that Weather II, along with its subsidiaries
(collectively the “Weather Group”), continued to make investments in OTA through 2011.° The
Claimant also asserts that between 2008 and 2011, OTA invested US$ 2.7 billion in Algeria
and between 2004 and 2007 freely transferred dividends to OTH and its related entities.”

9. It is the Claimant's argument that starting from 2008, Algeria began an unlawful campaign
against OTA and its investors due to a political vendetta against the Egyptian businessman
Naguib Sawiris, the Claimant’s ultimate controlling shareholder, and his family and as a result
of a policy shift against foreign investment.® In particular, the Claimant submits that Algeria’s
measures began in December 2008 through the issuance of tax reassessments for the year
2004, when OTA was tax exempt under its Investment Agreement.° Subsequently, so the
Claimant contends, Algeria used the 2004 tax reassessment to block OTA’s dividend transfers
to OTH, the Claimant and its related entities. 1°

10. The Claimant asserts that in 2009 the Respondent increased the pressure through a massive
tax reassessment for the years 2005-2007, when OTA was tax exempt for the majority of this
period under its Investment Agreement.'' According to the Claimant, Algeria’s measures
caused it to incur substantial damage bringing it to the brink of financial collapse. '*

11. After the 2009 events, the Claimant started to pursue exit strategies and engaged consultants
to attempt to find a willing buyer for its investment.'? Deals to sell OTA through a sale of
OTH's shares were negotiated with South African telecom provider Mobile Telephone
Networks Holdings (Proprietary) Limited (“MTN”) and VimpelCom Limited (“VimpelCom’).
According to the Claimant, throughout the course of these negotiations, Algeria bombarded
OTA with a series of coordinated measures. "4 In particular, the Claimant contends that the
Respondent demanded full payment of the remaining 2005-2007 tax reassessments within
three days over the Easter holiday, knowing that the Weather Group would have had no
access to international banks.‘ The Claimant further submits that Algeria imposed an

injunction freezing all of OTA’s bank accounts without prior notice and without any legal or

factual basis.'® Moreover, the Claimant contends that a few days after the injunction, Algeria
imposed a customs blockade over goods and supplies essential to run OTA’s business. '7

On 28 April 2010, according to the Claimant, Algeria announced that it would expropriate OTA
if the Weather Group tried to sell OTA and to evade Algeria's pre-emption right (provided
under the “Supplemental Finance Act” of 2009).'® As a result, the negotiations with MTN
collapsed. '? The Claimant submits that shortly thereafter Algeria forced OTA to shut down its
international communications network on “national security grounds”.?°

According to the Claimant, around the time when the Claimant was negotiating with
VimpelCom (with a view to achieving OTA’s sale through a merger of the Claimant's
subsidiary, Weather Investments S.p.A. (“Weather Investments”), with VimpelCom), Algeria
enacted the 2010 Supplemental Finance Act to attempt to thwart a sale of OTA effected
through an upstream foreign entity. The Claimant submits that the effect of such law was that
if the Claimant sold shares in any of its foreign companies to effect a sale of OTA, Algeria
could buy back OTA’s shares for a price selected by valuators chosen by Algeria."

In September 2010, according to the Claimant, Algeria issued a further provisional notice of
tax reassessment for 2008-2009 against OTA in the amount of US$ 230 million.22

The deal with VimpelCom was concluded on 15 April 2011—according to the Claimant, for a
substantially impaired consideration of approximately US$ 6.486 billion as a result of Algeria's
measures.” The Claimant sold its indirect shareholding in OTA to VimpelCom by selling its
immediate subsidiary, Weather Investments.

On 16 April 2012, the Claimant sent a Notice of Dispute under the BIT to the Respondent.*4

On 19 October 2012, the Claimant filed its Request for Arbitration, accompanied by Exhibits
C-1 through C-36 (the “Request”). Through this arbitration, the Claimant seeks compensation
for the loss it alleges to have incurred on the sale of its indirect interest in OTA to VimpelCom,
its share of lost dividends between 2009 and 2011, and damages allegedly caused by Algeria
that required the Claimant to obtain bridge loans as a result of the dividend delays and
blockade and undertake capital restructurings to prevent the outright collapse of the Weather
Group.?5

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

The Request was received by ICSID on 24 October 2012. The Centre acknowledged receipt
of the Request and transmitted it to the Respondent on 25 October 2012. The Request was
supplemented by the Claimant's letter of 14 November 2012.

On 15 November 2012, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance
with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the
Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an
Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of the Centre’s Rules of
Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.

By letters exchanged on 12, 18, and 26 December 2012, and 8 January 2013, the Parties
confirmed their agreement on the method of constitution of the Tribunal as follows: A Tribunal
consisting of three arbitrators, one appointed by each Party, and the third, presiding arbitrator
appointed by agreement of the Parties.

On 9 January 2013, the Centre acknowledged the Respondent's appointment of Professor
Brigitte Stern, a national of France, as arbitrator, and the Claimant's appointment of Professor
Albert Jan van den Berg, a Dutch national, as arbitrator. On 24 January 2013, Professor Stern
accepted her appointment as arbitrator nominated by the Respondent, and on 25 January
2013, Professor van den Berg accepted his appointment as arbitrator nominated by the
Claimant.

On 31 January 2013, the Claimant informed the Secretariat of a change in its name from
“Weather Investments II S.a r.l.” to “Orascom TMT Investments S.a r.l.”.

On 22 March 2013, the Centre informed the Parties that the two party-appointed arbitrators
had selected Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a Swiss national, as presiding arbitrator.

On 28 March 2013, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of
Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “Arbitration Rules”) notified the Parties that all three
arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to
have been constituted on that date. Ms. Aurélia Antonietti, ICSID Senior Counsel, was
designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal. In addition, with both Parties’ agreement, Dr.
Michele Potesta was designated as Assistant to the Tribunal on 11 October 2013, and a
signed declaration was transmitted to the Parties.

On 16 May 2013, the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties in Geneva. The Parties
confirmed that the Members of the Tribunal had been validly appointed. It was agreed inter
alia that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, and that
The Hague (The Netherlands) would be the place of the proceeding.

As the Parties did not reach an agreement on the procedural language, they each selected
one of the official languages of the Centre as a procedural language in this arbitration (in this
case, English for the Claimant and French for the Respondent), in accordance with ICSID
Arbitration Rule 22. It was agreed that the orders, decisions, and award of the Tribunal would
be rendered and the record kept in both procedural languages (i.e. English and French), both
versions being equally authentic.

On 29 August 2013, the Parties agreed that Paris would be the hearing venue for all hearings
in this matter.

On 9 September 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 embodying the Parties’
agreement on procedural matters discussed during the first session.

On 20 December 2013, the Claimant filed a Memorial on the Merits with Exhibits C-37 through
C-657, and Legal Authorities CLA-1 through CLA-136 (“Memorial on the Merits”).

On 24 January 2014, the Respondent filed a Request for the bifurcation of the proceeding with
Exhibits R-1 and R-2, and Legal Authorities RL-1 through RL-23.

On 21 February 2014, the Claimant filed a Response to the Respondent's Request for
Bifurcation with Legal Authorities CLA-137 through CLA-162.

On 26 March 2014, a Hearing on Bifurcation took place by telephone conference.

On 10 April 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, by which it granted the
Respondent's application for the bifurcation of the proceedings between a jurisdictional phase
and a merits phase. As a consequence, the proceedings on the merits were suspended.

On 20 June 2014, the Respondent filed a Memorial on Preliminary Objections with Exhibits R-
3 through R-233 and Legal authorities RL-24 through RL-200 (“Memorial on Preliminary
Objections”), including materials related to the arbitration proceeding before the Permanent
Court of Arbitration (“PCA”) Case No. 2012-20, also referred to as the “OTH Arbitration”.

On 11 August 2014, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal strike all materials related to the
OTH Arbitration, including the exhibits submitted by the Respondent on 20 June 2014. The
Claimant further requested that the Tribunal order the Respondent to disclose all submissions,
documents, and exhibits filed in the OTH Arbitration in order to grant the Claimant an equal
opportunity to respond to the documents submitted by the Respondent. Additionally, the
Claimant requested that the Tribunal order the Respondent to disclose the Share Purchase
Agreement entered into between VimpelCom, OTH (which had by then changed its name to
Global Telecom Holding S.A.E., “GTH”) and the Algerian Fonds National d’Investissement (the
“FNI’) on 18 April 2014 (the “SPA’).

28 Accordingly, in this Award documents submitted in English and French are either referred to in their original
language, without translation, or in a free translation made by the Tribunal. For the transcript of the Hearing, the
Award refers to the original language.

On 18 August 2014, the Respondent rejected all of the above Claimant's requests, adding that
the disclosure of the SPA was premature.

On 25 August 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 inviting inter alia the
Respondent to supplement its letter of 18 August 2014 and setting out a schedule for the
Parties’ further submissions concerning the OTH Arbitration and the SPA.

On 26 August 2014, the Claimant requested a modification of the schedule for the submission
of its Counter-Memorial. The Respondent commented on 28 August 2014.

On 29 August 2014, the Tribunal rejected any modification of the schedule for the written
submissions.

On 2 September 2014, the Respondent reiterated that the disclosure of the SPA was
premature, and confirmed that it did not have the authorization to produce it.

On 9 September 2014, the Claimant reiterated its requests formulated in its letter of 11 August
2014.

On 16 September 2014, the Respondent opposed the Claimant's request to strike the
materials relating to the OTH Arbitration from the record.

On 19 September 2014, the Claimant filed a Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections with
Exhibits C-658 through C-854, and Legal Authorities CLA-163 through CLA-227 (“Counter-
Memorial”).

On 1 October 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, ordering the Respondent to
produce to the Claimant by 23 October 2014 all submissions, documents, and exhibits of the
record of the OTH Arbitration and the SPA.

On 24 October 2014, the Respondent produced to the Claimant documents ordered by the
Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 4.

On 24 October 2014, each Party filed a request for the Tribunal to decide on production of
documents.

On 28 October 2014, the Claimant submitted that the Respondent had breached Procedural
Order No. 4 and asked that the Tribunal take immediate action. The Respondent answered on
31 October and 3 November 2014. The Claimant replied on 3 November 2014.

Given that the SPA raised confidentiality issues, the Tribunal noted on 7 November 2014 the
Parties’ willingness to negotiate a confidentiality agreement and invited them to use their best
efforts to conclude a Confidentiality Agreement (“CA”) by 21 November 2014.

On 14, 15 and 28 November 2014, and 4 December 2014, the Parties objected to each other's
requests for production of documents.

By letters of 25 November 2014, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had not been able
to agree on the terms of a CA.

On 8 December 2014, the Tribunal held a telephone conference with the Parties to discuss the
terms of a CA.

On 12 December 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 on the Parties’ respective
requests for document production with corresponding Redfern Schedules, and ordering that
documents be produced by 19 December 2014.

On 12 December 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6, implementing further the
confidentiality regime put in place in Procedural Order No. 1.

On 12 December 2014, the Tribunal further issued Procedural Order No. 7, a confidentiality
order regarding the OTH Arbitration record and the SPA.

On 23 December 2014, with the Parties’ consent, the Secretary of the Tribunal wrote to Dr.
Brooks Daly, Deputy Secretary-General and Principal Legal Counsel of the Permanent Court
of Arbitration, to designate him as Confidentiality Advisor to decide whether certain documents
to be produced by the Respondent pursuant to Procedural Order No. 7 contained
commercially sensitive information.

On 6 January 2015, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that the OTH Arbitration, which had
been previously stayed, had resumed, and that consequently, the discussions with OTH’s and
VimpelCom’s counsel regarding the production of documents from that arbitration into this
arbitration had temporarily stopped.

On 8 January 2015, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal order the Respondent to
immediately produce the OTH Arbitration record, the Schedules to the SPA (the “SPA
Schedules”), and the documents concerning the valuation of OTA. Alternatively, the Claimant
requested that all references to the OTH Arbitration and the SPA be stricken and that adverse
inferences be drawn against the Respondent for its non-disclosure in violation of Procedural
Orders Nos. 1, 4, 5, and 7.

On 21 January 2015, the Respondent contested the Claimant's production of documents
made pursuant to Procedural Order No. 5 with regard to the redaction of certain documents
relating to Board of Manager Meeting Minutes and Crédit Agricole Private Banking Bank
statements, and requested that the Tribunal order the Claimant to produce said documents
without redactions. The Claimant submitted its observations on 26 January 2015.

On 30 January 2015, further to the production by the Respondent of the OTH Arbitration
record and the SPA Schedules, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal order that the
Respondent's preliminary objections concerning the OTH Arbitration be deferred until the
merits phase of the case. The Claimant further requested that the Tribunal order the
Respondent to produce documents that had been redacted.

On 3 February 2015, the Tribunal decided on the Respondent's request of 21 January 2015
concerning the redaction of certain documents.

On 6 February 2015, the Respondent filed a Reply on Preliminary Objections with Exhibits R-
234 through R-1112, and Legal Authorities RL-201 through RL-262 (“Reply”).

On 11 February 2015, the Tribunal denied the Claimant’s request of 30 January 2015 that
certain of the Respondent's Preliminary Objections be joined to the merits.

On 9 February 2015, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal regarding the redaction of the SPA
Schedules, to which the Claimant answered on 16 February 2015. By letter of 18 February
2015, the Tribunal consulted the Parties as to the possible mandate of Dr. Daly if his services
were to be required.

On 3 March 2015, after receiving both Parties’ positions, the Secretary informed Dr. Daly that
the Tribunal needed his advice as per ICSID’s letter of 23 December 2014.

On 9 March 2015, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal order the Respondent to produce
documents requested in its request for production of documents, namely the Framework
Agreement and the Amended Framework Agreement between Cevital and OTH. The Claimant
also requested that the Respondent be ordered to undertake additional searches in relation to
Exhibit C-194 and the documents referenced therein.

On 12 March 2015, the Respondent objected to the Claimant's requests of 9 March 2015.

On 16 March 2015, the Tribunal denied the Claimant's requests of 9 March 2015.

On 16 March 2015, the Respondent supplemented its request of 21 January 2015.

On 17 March 2015, the Respondent filed a request for leave to submit additional Exhibits R-
1113 to R-1123.

On 18 March 2015, the Claimant requested a three week extension to file its Rejoinder on
Preliminary Objections.

On 19 March 2015, Dr. Daly issued a report in which he noted that certain of the SPA
Schedules contained “a mixture of commercially sensitive information and information that is
not commercially sensitive”. The Claimant submitted its comments on Dr. Daly's report on 23
March 2015, and the Respondent on 24 March 2015.

On 23 March 2015, the Claimant filed observations on the Respondent's request to file
additional documents dated 17 March 2015.

On 24 March 2015, the Respondent confirmed that it did not object to the Claimant's request
for extension to file its Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections. The Respondent also submitted
Exhibit R-307, the consent award rendered in the OTH Arbitration.

On 25 March 2015, the Tribunal granted the Respondent’s leave to submit the additional
documents mentioned in its letter of 17 March 2015, and granted the Claimant an extension
until 24 April 2015 to file its Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections.

On 26 March 2015, the Claimant maintained its request that the Tribunal order the
Respondent to undertake additional searches in relation to Exhibit C-194. The Respondent
replied on 31 March 2015.

On 27 March 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would retain Dr. Daly's advice in
relation to the Schedules that he found to be “a mixture of commercially sensitive information
and information that is not commercially sensitive’, by requesting that he redact all of the
commercially sensitive information contained in the SPA Schedules, and that he review four
additional documents, which were produced by the Claimant to the Respondent in redacted
form, to determine whether they contained “commercially sensitive information”.

On 1 April 2015, the Respondent filed a request for leave to submit additional Exhibits R-1124
to R-1127.

On 2 April 2015, Dr. Daly transmitted to the Parties the Schedules with the redactions he
made pursuant to the Tribunal’s directions of 27 March 2015.

On 3 April 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8, a Confidentiality Order on
Restricted Access Information which further implemented the confidentiality regime put in
place in Procedural Orders Nos. 1, 6 and 7. By letter of the same date, the Tribunal ordered
the Respondent to transmit unredacted copies of all of the SPA Schedules indicated, bearing

the designation “restricted access information”, to the Claimant's counsel by 7 April 2015.

On 7 April 2015, the Respondent transmitted to the Claimant the unredacted versions of the
SPA Schedules, as ordered by the Tribunal on 3 April 2015.

On 7 April 2015, the Tribunal denied the Claimant’s request of 26 March 2015 that the
Respondent be ordered to undertake additional searches in relation to Exhibit C-194.

On 7 April 2015, the Claimant did not object to the filing by the Respondent of new exhibits as
per its request of 1 April 2015.

Accordingly, on 9 April 2015, the Tribunal granted the Respondent leave to submit Exhibits R-
1124 to R-1127.

On 15 April 2015, Dr. Daly issued a further Report, on which both Parties commented on 17
April 2015.

By letter of 20 April 2015, further to Dr. Daly’s Report, the Tribunal ordered the Claimant to

transmit to the Respondent unredacted copies of certain documents as well as documents
bearing the designation “restricted access information” by 21 April 2015.

On 21 April 2015, the Claimant transmitted to the Respondent the documents ordered by letter
of 20 April 2015.

On 24 April 2015, the Respondent requested leave to submit Exhibits R-118-bis, R-119-bis
and R-120-bis.

On 24 April 2015, the Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections with Exhibits C-
855 through C-1081, and Legal authorities CLA-228 through CLA-268 (‘“Rejoinder’).

On 28 April 2015, the Claimant indicated that it did not oppose the Respondent's submission
of its new exhibits.

On 29 April 2015, the Tribunal granted the Respondent leave to submit additional Exhibits R-
118-bis, R-119-bis and R-120-bis.

On 3 May 2015, the Respondent filed a request to produce an amended version of Exhibit R-
1111.

On 6 May 2015, the Respondent filed a request for leave to submit new Exhibits R-1128 to R-
1132. On the same date, the Claimant indicated that it did not object to the submission of
Exhibit R-1111, subject to certain qualifications.

On 8 May 2015, the Tribunal granted the Respondent leave to submit its amended Exhibit R-
1111 provided the amended exhibit contained no information that was not already part of the
evidentiary record, and that it listed the sources in the record from which the information was
derived.

On 8 May 2015, the Claimant filed a request for leave to submit a new Exhibit C-1082.

On 10 May 2015, the Tribunal granted leave to the Respondent to submit additional Exhibits
R-1128 to R-1132. The Tribunal also granted leave to the Claimant to submit the Exhibit C-
1082.

On 11 May 2015, the President of the Tribunal held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with
the Parties by telephone conference.

On 15 May 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9 on the organization of the
hearing, confirming that a hearing would take place in Paris from 26 to 30 May 2015, and
addressing all logistical questions.

On 15 May 2015, the Respondent filed a request for leave to submit Exhibits R-1133 to R-
1135 (corresponding to the full copies of the exhibits filed by the Claimant as C-935, C-936
and C-937).

On 16 May 2015, the Respondent filed a request for leave to produce Legal Authorities RL-
263 to RL-267.

On 18 May 2015 and 19 May 2015, the Claimant opposed the Respondent's request of 15
May 2015 and of 16 May 2015.

On 19 May 2015, the Tribunal granted leave to the Respondent to submit full copies of the

exhibits filed by the Claimant as C-935, C-936 and C-937.

On 20 May 2015, the Tribunal denied the Respondent's request to submit the additional
Exhibits RL-263 to RL-267, as the Respondent had not established that any exceptional
circumstances existed warranting the admission of those additional documents.

The audio recording of the Hearing was made available to the Parties and the Members of the
Tribunal.

On 4 June 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 10 on post-hearing matters.

On 4 June 2015, the Tribunal invited the Parties’ comments on a draft letter it intended to
address to the Kingdom of Belgium and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg regarding the
request for the travaux préparatoires of the BLEU-Algeria BIT, which the Respondent was
unable to locate.

On 12 June 2015, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they approved the draft letter. The
letter was sent by ICSID on the same date.

On 15 June 2015, each Party submitted its respective list of additional international decisions
and awards, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 10; namely Legal Authorities CLA-270
to CLA-294 and RL-263 to RL-269, respectively.

On 22 June 2015, each Party submitted rebuttal authorities; namely Legal Authorities CLA-
295 to CLA-299 and RL-270.

On 30 September 2015, each Party filed its Post-Hearing Brief.

By letter of 16 October 2015, the Centre transmitted to the Tribunal with copy to the Parties a
hard copy of the documents of the travaux préparatoires in relation to the BLEU-Algeria BIT,
that it had received on 14 October 2015 from Mr. Didier Reynders, Vice-Prime Minister and
Minister of Foreign and European Affairs of the Kingdom of Belgium.

On 21 October 2015, the Claimant submitted a complete version of Exhibit C-855.

On 18 November 2015, each Party filed a Reply Post-Hearing Brief. The Claimant's Reply
Post-Hearing Brief was submitted with amended Legal Authority CLA-226.

By letter of 25 November 2015, the Respondent objected to the Claimant’s submission of
amended Legal Authority CLA-226.

By letter of 28 November 2015, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal admit its resubmitted
Legal Authority CLA-226 into the record and deny the Respondent's request to submit any
responsive legal authorities.

On 4 December 2015, each Party filed a Submission on Costs (the “Claimant's Submission on
Costs” and the “Respondent's Submission on Costs”). The Claimant filed Legal Authorities
CLA-300 through CLA-306.

By letter of 7 December 2015, the Tribunal took note of the Parties’ correspondence of 25 and
28 November 2015 regarding Exhibit CLA-226, and informed them that it would address the
objection raised, if at all necessary, in its forthcoming decision or award.

By letter of 10 December 2015, the Respondent objected to the Claimant's submission of legal
authorities with its 4 December 2015 Submission on Costs and asked the Tribunal to strike

them from the record. By letter of the same date, the Claimant asked the Tribunal to deny the

Respondent's request to strike its new legal authorities from the record. By email of 14
December 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would address the objection raised, if
at all necessary, in its forthcoming decision or award.

On 18 December 2015, each Party filed a Reply on Costs (the “Claimant's Reply Submission
on Costs” and the “Respondent's Reply Submission on Costs”).

On 1 February 2016, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it had changed its siége social to
anew address in Luxembourg.

On 12 February 2016, the Tribunal invited the Parties to provide their views on (1) the award
issued on 29 January 2016 in Tenaris S.A. and Talta - Trading e Marketing Sociedade
Unipessoal Lda. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, |CSID Case No. ARB/11/26 (“Tenaris
and Talta’; available on the ICSID website),?” which discussed, among other issues, the
requirement of siége social in the BIT applicable in that case, and on (2) the meaning of Article
1(1)(b), and in particular of the term “siége social’, in the Dutch and Arabic versions of the
Agreement between the Belgo-Luxembourg Economic Union and the People’s Democratic
Republic of Algeria on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments.

On 11 March 2016, each Party filed its observations. The Claimant also filed Exhibits C-1083
to C-1095. The Respondent filed two annexes.

In a letter of 13 March 2016, the Claimant objected to the Respondent's comments on
jurisdiction ratione materiae made in its submission of 11 March 2006. The Respondent
objected to that letter on 18 March 2016.

On 1 and 8 April 2016, the Tribunal clarified that each Party would have the opportunity to file
a rebuttal submission, with the possibility of filing relevant additional exhibits and legal
authorities and that sur-rebuttal documents with brief explanations would be allowed, to the
exclusion of additional expert reports.

On 21 April 2016, each Party filed a rebuttal submission. The Claimant filed three new Legal
Authorities numbered CLA-300 to CLA-302.78 The Respondent filed Exhibits R-1136 to R-
1139 and Legal Authorities RL-275 to RL-283.

On 28 April 2016, each Party filed a sur-rebuttal submission. The Respondent filed Legal
Authorities RL-284 to RL-285.

On 29 April 2016, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal strike the Claimant's sur-
rebuttal. The Claimant opposed that request on 30 April 2016. The Respondent replied on
3 May 2016.

On 13 May 2016, the Tribunal took note of the positions expressed in the Parties’ letters of
30 April 2016 for the Claimant and of 29 April and 3 May 2016 for the Respondent, and
deferred its determination of the Parties’ requests to its forthcoming decision or award.

On 4 October 2016, the Tribunal informed the Parties that considering the number of the
Respondent's preliminary objections and the complexity of some of the objections, the
Tribunal expected to be able to complete the drafting of its Decision or Award in early 2017,
after which ICSID would have to edit and translate the draft.

On 31 May 2017, the proceeding was declared closed.

PRELIMINARY MATTERS

Prior to considering the merits of the Parties’ positions, the Tribunal will address the scope of
this Award (A); the law applicable to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal (B); and a number of
outstanding requests from the Parties (C).

SCOPE OF THIS AWARD

The present proceedings were bifurcated between jurisdiction/admissibility and merits in PO2.
The present Award thus addresses the Respondent's preliminary objections to the Tribunal's
jurisdiction and the admissibility of the Claimant's claims.

LAW APPLICABLE TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE TRIBUNAL

It is not in dispute that the Tribunals jurisdiction is governed by the ICSID Convention and the
BIT, the relevant provisions of which are reproduced below when dealing with each
jurisdictional objection.

Both Parties agree that the interpretation of the ICSID Convention and the BIT is governed by
the customary international law principles on treaty interpretation as codified in the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969 (“VCLT”).

It is also undisputed that the Tribunal has the power to rule on its own jurisdiction.?°

OUTSTANDING REQUESTS
In this section, the Tribunal resolves a number of outstanding requests from the Parties.

With regard to the Respondent's request in connection with the Claimant’s submission of
28 April 2016,°° the Tribunal decides to strike from the record the Claimant's Sur-Rebuttal to
Respondent’s 21 April 2016 Submission, dated 28 April 2016, as, contrary to the Tribunal’s

29 Art. 41(1) of the ICSID Convention.

directions of 1 April 2016, the Claimant did not use this opportunity to “file simultaneous sur-
rebuttal documents, if any, with brief explanations”, but instead provided additional comments
on the relevance of Tenaris and Talta in reply to the Respondent’s 21 April 2016 submission.
Furthermore, the Tribunal decides to deny the Claimant's request not to admit Exh. RL-276,°"
which the Respondent introduced with its submission of 21 April 2016. The introduction of
such legal authority complied with the Tribunal’s directions of 1 April 2016, which specifically
invited the Parties to file rebuttal submissions “with the possibility of filing relevant additional
exhibits and legal authorities”.5? In this context, it appears irrelevant that at an earlier stage of
the proceedings (namely days before the May 2015 Hearing) the Tribunal had rejected the
introduction of this legal authority, as that ruling only found that at that time the circumstances
for inclusion were not met.*?

Furthermore, the Tribunal denies the Respondent's request to exclude from the record the
Claimant's Legal Authority CLA-226,°4 resubmitted with the Claimant's Reply Post-Hearing
Brief. Indeed, the Claimant did not submit a new legal authority in violation of the Tribunal’s
directions, but simply submitted additional portions of a book, excerpts of which were already
in the record.

Finally, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal exclude Legal Authorities CLA-300 to
CLA-306 which the Claimant submitted with its Submission on Costs dated 4 December 2015,
arguing that these authorities were filed in violation of the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No.
10.°5 The Claimant, for its part, argued that it had complied with the Tribunal’s direction in
Procedural Order No. 10, adding that “the Tribunal may apply the maxim jura no[vJit curia (or
jura novit arbiter) and rely on any applicable legal authorities it deems relevant to its
analysis”.°° The Tribunal generally agrees with the Claimant,°’ and in particular notes that its
direction in Procedural Order No. 10 that “[n]o supporting document shall be appended” to the
Parties’ cost submissions clearly referred to substantiation of the amount of the Parties’ costs,
not to legal authorities concerning issues that neither Party had previously addressed. The
Respondent's request is thus rejected.

The following paragraphs provide a summary of the Parties’ positions on the origin of the
Claimant's alleged investment in OTA, the structure of the Weather Group, and the acquisition
of Wind Telecomunicazioni S.p.A. (“Wind”). Some of these facts are in dispute between the
Parties and are relevant to a number of jurisdictional or admissibility objections, in particular
the Respondent's objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione materiae (see infra section
V.C) and the Respondent's jurisdiction and admissibility objections in relation to the Claimant's
status of indirect shareholder, the OTH Arbitration and settlement, and the sale of the
Claimant's investment (see infra section V.D). The following summary does not reflect any
finding of fact.

THE CLAIMANT’S POSITION

OTMTI’s acquisition of interest in OTA in August 2005

Prior to August 2005, 56.5% of OTH’s shares were owned by three companies, April Holding
(‘April’), OS Holding (“OS”), and Cylo Investments Ltd. (“Cylo”) (collectively, the “Sawiris
Entities”).2® OTH, in turn, owned 87.66% of OTA, including through its subsidiary Oratel
International Inc. (“Oratel”). This pre-August 2005 ownership structure is shown in the
following chart:3°

 

56.5%

 

 

87.66%

According to the Claimant, OTMTI’s acquisition of an interest in OTA occurred in August 2005
as follows:4°

38 Tolkien Second Expert Report, para. 19.
38 Reproduced from Tolkien Second Expert Report, para. 19.
40 See esp. Tolkien Second Expert Report, Appendix 2, with further details on this set of transactions.

16

a. The Sawiris Entities sold 50% plus one share of OTH to Weather Capital, a subsidiary of
Weather Investments, in exchange for €3.5 billion in cash and a receivable under a
subordinated loan (€1.2 billion in cash and €2.3 billion in the form of a loan).*"

b. The Sawiris Entities used this amount of €3.5 billion to subscribe shares in Weather
Investments during a share offering. 4?

c. OTMTI (then named Weather Il) paid €294 million in cash to subscribe shares in
Weather Investments during the share offering. The Italian utility company Enel S.p.A.
(“Enel”) and twenty-two other companies and individuals paid an additional €510 million
in cash to subscribe Weather Investments shares during this share offering.

d. OTMTI then paid new OTMTI shares valued at €3.5 billion*? to the Sawiris Entities in
consideration for their shares in Weather Investments.

e. As a result of these transactions, the Claimant contends that, as of 11 August 2005,
OTMTI had paid €3.5 billion in new shares and over €294 million in cash to purchase
Weather Investments shares. Because one of Weather Investments’ main assets was its
indirect shareholding in OTA, OTMTI thus paid €3.794 billion in cash and shares to
acquire its indirect interest in OTA.*+

41 Tolkien Second Expert Report, Appendix 2, para. 3. As part of the 1 August 2005 purchase agreements, the
Sawiris Entities were required to use the proceeds from the sale to purchase the shares of Weather Capital’s
parent, Weather Investments, within 10 business days. Failure to use the proceeds to subscribe the shares of
Weather Investments would render the sale null and void retroactively, and require the Sawiris Entities to return
the funds to Weather Capital. See Tolkien Second Expert Report, Appendix 2, para. 5.

42 A first increase of capital of Weather Investments was decided on 5 August 2005 for a total of €2.3 billion. To
subscribe this share capital increase, the Sawiris Entities assigned to Weather Investments their receivable from
the loan which they extended to Weather Capital. A second increase of capital of Weather Investments was
approved on 10 August 2005 for a total of €2 billion. The Sawiris Entities subscribed €1.2 billion of this capital
increase in cash.

43 On 5 August 2005, OTMTI increased its capital in an amount of €2.3 billion. The Sawiris Entities purchased
these shares through payment of the Weather Investments’ shares that they had purchased earlier that day. See
Tolkien Second Expert Report, Appendix 2, para. 8. On 11 August 2005, OTMTI increased its capital by a further
€1.2 billion. The Sawiris Entities subscribed this capital increase through a payment of the Weather Investments
shares that they had subscribed the previous day. See Tolkien Second Expert Report, Appendix 2, para. 12.

145. The following paragraphs summarize the acquisition of Wind, a matter which Algeria has
raised in the context of its objections. For the Claimant, the acquisition of Wind is separate
from OTMTI's acquisition of interest in OTH and OTA,** “though both acquisitions occurred as
part of one set of transactions”.4”

146. In August 2005, Weather Investments’ subsidiary, Wind Acquisition Finance S.p.A. (“Wind
Acquisition”), purchased 62.75% of Wind from Enel Investment Holding BV (“Enel
Investment”) for €2.986 billion in cash. The funds for this purchase came from a loan secured
by OTH's shares and future earnings (€1.2 billion), loans secured by Wind's shares and future

company’s assets is a method commonly used and referred to as a leveraged buyout (“LBO”).
In this case, one third of the purchase price came from debt secured by the target asset itself,
while the remainder came from debt secured by assets of the acquirer.5' Furthermore, in the
Claimant's submission, there was nothing unusual about the use of loans collateralized by
another asset - in this case, the shares of OTH - to acquire a new asset. ®

3. OTMTI’s further purchases of Weather Investments shares

150. The Claimant submits that, between December 2006 and January 2007, after acquiring Wind,
it further increased its ownership interest in OTA through purchases of additional shares in
Weather Investments:

a. On 21 December 2006, OTMTI directly purchased 16.1% of Weather Investments from
Enel for a consideration of €1.21 billion in cash and a loan (€248 million in cash®? and
€962 million in the form of a loan guarantee), which loan was repaid with interest in June
2008;54

b. In December 2006 and January 2007, OTMTI purchased an additional 0.62% of
Weather Investments shares from 17 Middle Eastern minority shareholders for
€44.47 million;

c. Wind Acquisition Holdings Finance S.p.A. (“WAHF”), a subsidiary of OTMTI and
Weather Investments, purchased the remaining 10% of Weather Investments shares
from Enel for €751 million in cash.°

151. Furthermore, the Claimant alleges that it made regular payments from 2006 to 2010 directly to
Weather Investments in an aggregate amount of approximately €2.48 million.5”

4. OTMTI’s ownership of OTA in 2011

152. After 2007, OTMTI sold certain shares in Weather Investments.*® It asserts, however, that at
all times prior to its 2011 exit sale of Weather Investments to VimpelCom, it held about 70% or

more of Weather Investments share capital.°°

53 The Claimant directed its subsidiaries, Weather Investments and WAHF, to pay Enel from a dividend payment
of €281 million that Weather Investments owed to the Claimant. See Rejoinder, para. 62.

154. In conclusion, the Claimant asserts that OTMTI paid a total of €5.1 billion in cash and shares,
inter alia, to acquire its indirect investment in OTA through the acquisition of shares in
Weather Investments.®!

155. Because OTMTI controlled more than 50% of the shares at each link in the corporate chain
between OTMTI and OTA, OTMTI controlled OTA.® OTMTI's control of OTA is also
evidenced by the fact that Mr. Sawiris was the Chairman of OTMTI’s Board, was elected by
OTMTI as Chair of the Board of Weather Investments, and maintained his positions as
Chairman of OTA and Executive Chairman of OTH’s Board after OTMTI’s creation.®

B. THE RESPONDENT'S POSITION

156. The Respondent maintains that OTMTI (then Weather Il) was created within the context and
for the sole purpose of the acquisition of Wind, which presents no link with Algeria.®* The
Respondent contends that Mr. Sawiris decided to use the OTH shares in order to finance such
acquisition. It is within such context that Weather Il was created and thus became a very
indirect shareholder in OTH and OTA.

157. The Respondent relies on a number of decisions rendered by the English courts between
2009 and 2013 in connection with the litigation opposing Mr. Alessandro Benedetti, an Italian
businessman, on the one hand, and Mr. Sawiris, April, OS and Cylo, on the other hand,
concerning the amount of the compensation due to Mr. Benedetti in consideration for his role
in the closing of the purchase of Wind.® The Respondent relies in particular on the decision of
the High Court of Justice of 15 June 2009, describing the genesis and the conditions of the
acquisition of Wind.® On the basis of this narrative, the Respondent argues that the creation
of Weather II, as well as the use of OTH’s shares to finance the acquisition of Wind, were
envisaged at the last moment by Mr. Sawiris; and that Weather Il became a very indirect
shareholder in OTH (which owned directly and indirectly OTA) for the sole purposes of the
Wind transaction, and not for the purpose of investing in Algeria.

1. The genesis of the acquisition of Wind

158. Until May 2005, Wind was owned 37.25% by Enel and 62.75% by Enel Investment. The
Respondent argues that around 2002 Mr. Sawiris envisaged to acquire control over Wind by
effecting an investment through Rain Investments S.p.A., a company created in Italy together
with Mr. Benedetti.°” At the end of 2004, however, the idea of using that vehicle was
abandoned because Messrs. Sawiris and Benedetti had difficulties finding other investors.©

159. According to the Respondent, Mr. Sawiris then partnered with different financiers with a view
to acquiring all of Wind’s shares through the Luxembourg-incorporated Weather Investments
S.A. (‘Weather |”).6° This second project was similarly abandoned in April 2005, when Mr.
Sawiris’ financial partners decided to withdraw.” It is in this context, the Respondent
contends, that Mr. Sawiris, who at that time did not wish and was not in the position to invest a
substantial amount to purchase Wind, “at the last moment” decided to use OTH shares as
collateral to finance the operation.”' As a consequence, a new acquisition structure was put in

place, which entailed the incorporation of the Luxembourg company Weather Il on 24 May
2005, i.e. just two days before the conclusion of the sale purchase agreement of Wind.”? The
creation of Weather II was, for the Respondent, essentially linked to tax efficiency reasons. 7°
The incorporation of Weather II followed a few days after the incorporation of another vehicle,
Weather Investments, which had been constituted on 20 May 2005.74

On 26 May 2005, Enel and its holding company Enel Investment, on the one hand, and
Mr. Sawiris, Weather II, April, OS and Weather Investments, on the other, signed the purchase
agreement of Wind.”5

On this basis, the Respondent considers that it cannot be disputed that the purpose of the
creation of Weather II and the use of shares in OTH for the purposes of financing such
transactions were to allow Mr. Sawiris to purchase Wind at the lowest price, and not to invest
in Algeria.”6

The acquisition of Wind

At the moment of the closing of the purchase, the Sawiris Entities held 56.4% of OTH.”” The
Respondent alleges that pursuant to the share purchase agreement, the acquisition of Wind
occurred in two steps. First, different vehicles (held directly and indirectly by Weather
Investments) purchased 62.75% of the shares in Wind. At a second stage, the remaining
37.25% of the shares were purchased. Following such transactions, the Claimant then
acquired further shares in Weather Investments to finalize the acquisition.

a. First phase: the purchase of 62.75% of Wind on 11 August 2005

In May 2005, Mr. Sawiris and Banca IMI agreed to use the OTH shares as security for a loan
of €1.2 billion financing the acquisition.”® According to the Respondent, it is within this context
and pursuant to the share purchase agreement of 26 May 2005, that Weather II became an
indirect shareholder in OTH.79

On 1 August 2005, the Sawiris Entities sold 50% plus one share in OTH to Weather Capital
(which was fully owned by Weather Investments) pursuant to two share purchase agreements
providing that the purchase price (in the amount to €3.5 billion) was to be used by the Sawiris
Entities to subscribe shares in Weather Investments. ®°

Weather Investments then increased its capital twice: on 5 and 10 August 2005, the Sawiris
Entities subscribed shares in Weather Investments in consideration of a contribution in cash of
€1.2 billion and of a contribution in kind of a credit amounting to €2.3 billion due by Weather
Capital.*'

Further, in the context of the capital increase of Weather Investments of 10 August 2005,
Weather Il and Enel made cash contributions in Weather Investments, which for the
Respondents were one of the conditions precedent to the two collateral loans granted by
Banca IMI.® In this connection, Weather II allegedly made its cash contribution of €294
million.

As part of the sequence of transactions, the Sawiris Entities sold their shares in Weather
Investments to Weather II in consideration for new shares in Weather Il (for a value of €3.5
billion, equal to the sales price of the OTH shares to Weather Capital). On 10 August 2005,
Weather II could then give its 50% plus one share in Weather Investments as security for the
two loans previously obtained by Weather Capital from Banca IMI.®

Therefore, Algeria submits that the use of the OTH shares allowed Mr. Sawiris to purchase
Wind and that Weather II became an indirect shareholder of OTH during this first phase of the
transaction for the purposes of financing the Wind transaction.

b. Second phase: the purchase of 37.25% of Wind on 2 February 2006

In February 2006, Weather Investments (through its subsidiary Wind Acquisition Finance
S.p.A. (“Wind Acquisition” or “WAF”)) acquired the remainder of Wind from Enel by paying
€328 million in cash® and €1.665 billion in form of its own shares.®

Following the closing of the Wind acquisition, Weather Il owned 71.1% of Weather
Investments; Enel 26.1%; and other investors 2.8%. Weather Investments owned 100% of
WAHF, which owned 100% of Wind Acquisition, which owned 100% of Wind.®

Finally, on 21 December 2006, Enel sold the entirety of its 26.1% shareholding in Weather
Investments to WAHF and Weather II.” Weather II then acquired further shares in Weather
Investments (0.62%) from certain Middle Eastern investors, upon terms which the Claimant
has allegedly refused to disclose. ®*

85 On 8 February 2006, Weather Investments issued shares for €1.665 billion, which were fully subscribed by Enel
using the remaining 30.98% of its interest in Wind. Weather Investments then sold the 30.98% of Wind that it had
received from Enel to Wind Acquisition in exchange for a payment of €1.665 billion. Weather Investments’
ownership in Wind was then moved down to its subsidiary, Wind Acquisition, which now owned 100% of Wind.

172. Thus, the Respondent concludes, Mr. Sawiris and his family acquired control of Wind “with a
minimum of cash whilst retaining a majority interest in the 50.1% stake in [OTH]”.®° According
to the Respondent, Mr. Sawiris is alleged to have stated that he managed to acquire Wind “for

free”.°

Vv. OBJECTIONS TO THE TRIBUNAL’S JURISDICTION AND TO THE ADMISSIBILITY OF
THE CLAIMS

A. OVERVIEW OF THE OBJECTIONS AND THE PARTIES’ PRAYERS FOR RELIEF

173. | The Respondent has put forward the following objections to jurisdiction and to the admissibility
of the claims:

a. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione personae, because the BIT requires an “investor”
to have its “real seat” in one of the Contracting States and the Claimant's real seat is not
in Luxembourg, but in Egypt.

b. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae, because the Claimant made no
investment within the meaning of the BIT and the ICSID Convention. Furthermore,
Algeria’s offer to arbitrate contained in the BIT was not addressed to the Claimant at the
time of filing of the Request for Arbitration on 19 October 2012, as at that time the
Claimant owned an indirect shareholding in OTA equivalent to zero.

c. The Tribunal further lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae, because the Claimant is (or was)
an indirect shareholder in OTA which is “too far removed” (trop éloigné) from the
investment in OTA.

d. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction or should declare the claims inadmissible because there is
no dispute between the Claimant and Algeria within the meaning of Article 9 of the BIT.
Moreover, the claims are inadmissible as a result of OTH’s exercise of its right to bring
arbitration proceedings against Algeria which deprived the Claimant of standing to
pursue its claims against the Respondent. Furthermore, Mr. Sawiris used his group of
companies to seek to maximize his chances of success by introducing several arbitration
proceedings against the Respondent at different levels of the chain of companies, which
is an additional ground for the inadmissibility of the claims under the doctrine of abuse of
rights. Finally, the Tribunal should decline jurisdiction or declare the Claimant's claims
inadmissible as a result of the Settlement Agreement which has resolved the disputes
opposing OTA and OTH to Algeria.

e. The claims are inadmissible as the Claimant transferred its right to bring arbitration
proceedings against Algeria when it sold its investment to VimpelCom.

The acts of the state-owned television provider ENTV are not attributable to Algeria and
the Tribunal should decline jurisdiction over the claims in relation to those acts.

Finally, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the “purely contractual claims” relating to the
Investment Agreement, and the umbrella clause claims in relation to the Investment
Agreement, the GSM Licence and the Investment Code are also inadmissible.

174. In its Reply Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondent has summarized its prayers for relief as

follows:

La République Algérienne Démocratique et Populaire demande
respectueusement au Tribunal arbitral de :

+ SE DECLARER incompétent pour trancher le différend soumis par la
Demanderesse ;

+ DECLARER, 4 titre subsidiaire, les demandes de la Demanderesse
irrecevables ;

+ REJETER, en conséquence, l'ensemble des demandes de la
Demanderesse;

+ CONDAMNER la Demanderesse au paiement de I'intégralité des frais
encourus par la Défenderesse dans le présent arbitrage, en ce compris les
frais et honoraires des Membres du Tribunal arbitral, des conseils de la
Défenderesse et de ses experts, ainsi que de toutes autres sommes
exposées par la Défenderesse pour les besoins de sa défense.%"

175. The Claimant has replied to the Respondent's jurisdictional and admissibility objections with

the following arguments:

a.

The Claimant is a Luxembourgish investor within the meaning of Article 1(1)(b) of the
BIT, because it was constituted in accordance with Luxembourg law and its siége social

is and has always been in Luxembourg.

The Claimant made numerous investments and reinvestments within the meaning of
Article 1(2) of the BIT and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.

The Respondent is bound by the consent to arbitrate given in the BIT which expressly
extends to “minority or indirect” investors, and the Respondent's suggestion that
jurisdiction over indirect shareholders should be denied based on an asserted “cut-off

point” is ill-founded.

A dispute has existed between the Parties at all times since the Claimant's notification
on 16 April 2012. Furthermore, OTH’s commencement of a separate arbitration against
the Respondent is irrelevant to this Tribunal’s jurisdiction and to the admissibility of the
claims in this arbitration. The Respondent's assertion that the claims should be
dismissed under the doctrine of abuse of rights thus lacks merit. Similarly, the settlement
of the OTH Arbitration is also irrelevant to jurisdiction and admissibility in this arbitration.

°' R-PHB 2, p. 55.

26

e. The Claimant never sold or waived its right to bring arbitration against the Respondent;
in effect, it expressly retained that right in the Risk Sharing Agreement which it
concluded with VimpelCom on 15 April 2011.

f. The Respondent's objection concerning the attribution of ENTV’s actions pertains to the
merits of the dispute and not to jurisdiction or admissibility. The Tribunal should thus
postpone this issue until the merits phase.

g. Finally, each of the claims relating to the Investment Agreement is for a violation of a
specific provision of the BIT and the umbrella clause claims in relation to the Investment
Agreement, the GSM Licence, and the Investment Code are all admissible, as the
Claimant is entitled to rely upon the MFN clause in Article 10 of the BIT to invoke more
favorable standards of protection in other investment treaties concluded by Algeria.

176. nits Reply Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimant has summarized its prayers for relief as follows:

[...] Claimant requests that the Tribunal dismiss Respondent's preliminary
objections in their entirety and order Respondent to bear all costs and
expenses incurred by Claimant in defending against Respondent's
meritless preliminary objections, including all legal fees and disbursements.
Claimant also requests such further or other relief as the Tribunal may
deem appropriate. °*

177. As is clear from the preceding paragraphs, the Respondent has raised many preliminary
objections. Some of these objections address closely related issues, although they are
presented from different viewpoints. For a better structure and legibility of its analysis, the
Tribunal deems it convenient to review the Respondent's objections in four main groups. First,
the Tribunal will examine whether the Claimant fulfils the requirements ratione personae under
the ICSID Convention and the BIT, in particular whether it is an “investor” pursuant to Article
1(1)(b) of the BIT (B). Second, the Tribunal will analyze whether the Claimant has made an
“investment” within the meaning of Articles 25 of the ICSID Convention and 1(2) of the BIT (C).
Thi

the Tribunal will deal with the objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction and/or the

indirect” shareholder of OTA and the inter-relationship with the claims put forward by OTH in
different proceedings, including the settlement of these claims. This group of objections also
covers the consequences of the sale of the Claimant's alleged investment, the alleged sale,
loss or waiver of its right to bring arbitration proceedings and the defense of abuse of rights
(D). While the Parties have “dissected” each of these issues (and additional related sub-
issues) in separate objections, the Tribunal considers that it is convenient to treat all of these
issues within the same context as they are intertwined. Fourth and last, the Tribunal will deal

 

with a number of miscellaneous objections, namely whether the acts of the state-owned
television provider ENTV are attributable to Algeria (E), whether the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction

°2 C-PHB 2, para. 121.

27

over the “purely contractual claims’ relating to the Investment Agreement (F), and whether the
umbrella clause claims in relation to the Investment Agreement, the GSM License and the
Investment Code are admissible (G).

B. JURISDICTION RATIONE PERSONAE: IS THE CLAIMANT AN INVESTOR UNDER ARTICLE 1(1)(B) OF THE
BIT?
1. The Respondent’s position

178. |The Respondent argues that the BIT requires an “investor” to have its “real seat” in one of the
Contracting States (a) and that the Claimant is not an investor under the BIT because its real
seat is not in Luxembourg, but in Egypt (b). The Tribunal therefore lacks jurisdiction ratione
personae.

a. To qualify as an investor under the BIT, the Claimant must have its real seat in
Luxembourg

179. |The Respondent argues that Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT requires an “investor” to have its “real
seat” in one of the Contracting States, which must be understood to mean “place of effective
management” (centre de direction effective).°*

i. To qualify as an investor under the BIT, the Claimant must fulfil the two
separate and cumulative conditions of incorporation and siége social

180. | The Respondent contends that the absence of a definition of nationality of legal persons in the
ICSID Convention leaves it to the Contracting States to define the criteria that determine such
nationality under their investment treaties.% In this sense, it refers to Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT,
which reads as follows:

Pour I'application du présent Accord,
1. le terme « investisseurs » désigne :

a) les « nationaux », c'est-a-dire, toute personne physique qui, selon la
législation des Etats contractants, est considérée comme citoyen de la
Belgique, du Luxembourg ou ayant la nationalité algérienne;

3 In its Memorial on Preliminary Objections and in its Reply, the Respondent also argued that, even if the
Tribunal were to find that it has jurisdiction ratione personae, the Claimant's claims are inadmissible, because the
Claimant was not an investor at the time of the impugned acts (faits litigieux). See Memorial on Preliminary
Objections, paras. 274-282; Reply, paras. 395-407. This admissibility objection rests on the same facts as the
Respondent's objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione personae, although there is a different temporal
element (with regard to the jurisdictional objection the Respondent contends that “cette qualité [d'investisseur]
s'apprécie au jour du depot de la Demande diarbitrage’, Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 106). The
admissibility “facet” of this objection was not further pursued in the Respondent's post-hearing submissions. The
Claimant has not expressly addressed the Respondent's objection to admissibility, but it argues that the Claimant
“has always had” its seat in Luxembourg and that it “is and it has always been” an investor under the BIT.

b) Les « sociétés », c'est-a-dire, toute personne morale constituée

conformément a la législation belge, luxembourgeoise ou algérienne, et

ayant son siége social sur le territoire de la Belgique, du Luxembourg ou

de l’Algérie.
According to the Respondent, to qualify as an investor under Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT, the
Claimant must meet the following cumulative and distinct requirements: (a) it must be
incorporated in accordance with the laws of one of the Contracting Parties and (b) its siége
social must be located in the territory of that party.°° For the Respondent, “simply incorporating
a company in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties is not sufficient to meet the two
nationality conditions provided in the BIT”.9”

For the Respondent, this interpretation flows from the text of Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT, whose
meaning is identical in the three official languages (French, Dutch and Arabic).% In particular,
the Respondent contends that the Dutch and Arabic terms are the literal translation of the term
“siége social’. By contrast, the term “statutory seat” (“siége statutaire”) does not appear in any
of the three authentic versions of the Treaty.

The Respondent contends that, in accordance with the principle of effectiveness, the criteria of
incorporation and siége social cannot have the same meaning.'°° Because incorporation in
one of the Contracting Parties entails a registered office (siége statutaire) on the territory of
such Contracting Party, any interpretation that would attribute the same meaning to
incorporation and siége social must be discarded. '°'

For the Respondent, it is undisputed that a company must have its statutory seat in a
Contracting Party to be validly incorporated in that Contracting Party. The hypothetical
presented by the Claimant in order to differentiate incorporation and statutory seat, i.e. the
possibility of a transfer of the statutory seat abroad, is not pertinent to interpret the BIT which
was concluded in 1991, as such possibility did not exist in 1991 and is “very rare”
nowadays. 1°

ii. The Claimant’s nationality under the BIT must be determined by
reference to the domestic laws of the Contracting Parties, which point to the
“real seat”

The Respondent's position on the applicable law to determine the meaning of siége social has
somewhat evolved throughout its pleadings. In its Reply, the Respondent argued that the
Claimant's status as an investor under the BIT should not be based “on the principles of
Luxembourg law relating to nationality” but rather on the meaning of siége social under

“principles of applicable international law”.'°° In its post-hearing submissions, however, the
Respondent now submits that, in accordance with international law, the nationality of a
company under Article 1(1)(b) is determined by reference to the domestic laws of the
Contracting Parties, which adopt the notion of “siége social réel’ as the connecting factor for
purposes of nationality. '°¢

186. The Respondent contends that Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT uses “siége social’ as a connecting
factor to determine nationality. With regard to nationality, international law leaves it to each
state to decide to which entities it confers the status of subject of national law (sujet de droit
interne).'°° For the Respondent, the travaux produced by Belgium confirm that the Contracting
Parties intended that siége social be defined by national law.'° The Tribunal must thus rely on
the connecting factors of nationality provided in the domestic laws of the Contracting
Parties.'°7 According to the Respondent, while common law countries refer to “incorporation”
as the relevant criterion for nationality, civil law countries, such as the Contracting States to
the BIT, require a real connection (rattachement réel), i.e. the effective presence of the
corporation on the territory. 18

187. In any event, even if the Tribunal were minded to interpret the term siége social in an
autonomous manner as a “requirement for nationality under the BIT”, it would reach the same

outcome. 19

188. With regard to the Claimant’s arguments on the ordinary meaning of the BIT term, the
Respondent first contends that dictionaries “are of no use”, because “there is no international
law dictionary with a definition of siége social’."'° Second, the fact that the authentic English
version of other BITs signed by the BLEU translates siége social as “registered office” is
irrelevant to establish the Contracting Parties’ common intention in this BIT, as English is not
an authentic language for this BIT. Furthermore, the Respondent submits that “[a]n analysis of
the investment protection agreements signed by the Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union

‘siége social’ au sens de l'article 1(1)(b) de l'Accord s'entend du ‘siége social réel’ de la personne morale”;
“Contrairement a la Demanderesse qui se fonde sur les principes de droit luxembourgeois relatifs a la nationalité,
la Défenderesse soutient que l'absence de définition de la nationalité d'une personne morale dans la Convention

fails to reveal an ‘ordinary meaning’ of the concept of ‘siége social”, and “confirms conversely
that there is no practice about how to translate the concept of ‘siége social”.'"’ For the
Respondent, at the time of the negotiation of the BIT, there was no Belgo-Luxembourg
practice to use the terms siége social and registered office interchangeably or to insert the
criterion of siége statutaire in the definition of investor.'? To the contrary, the “traditional
formula” alluded to in the Explanatory Note submitted by the Belgian Government to the
Belgian Senate on 8 November 1995 for purposes of ratifying the BIT must be seen as a
reference to nationality in accordance with Belgian and Luxembourgish law. ''?

Second, the Respondent argues that “in the absence of an unequivocal ordinary meaning of
the concept of siége social in international law, reference to the national laws of the
Contracting Parties is justified in light of the principles stipulated in [Article 32 of] the Vienna
Convention”.''* In this case, all three Contracting Parties provide that the connecting factor to
determine nationality of companies under their domestic laws is the siége réel.''> This was
true when the BIT was signed in 1991 and continues to be true now.''® In this respect, so the
Respondent notes, the fact that Luxembourg law in other contexts sometimes uses the term
siége social to designate the company’s siége statutaire lacks relevance when interpreting the
concept of siége social as a connecting factor to determine nationality.1'”

Furthermore, investment tribunals dealing with similar definitions of investor have also ruled
that mere incorporation in a state is insufficient to establish the existence of a social seat. The
Respondent cites Alps Finance and Trade v. Slovakia, where the tribunal noted that “[t]he fact
that Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT requires a Swiss ‘seat’ as a distinct element in addition to
‘constitution and organization under Swiss law’ demonstrates that the mere incorporation in
Switzerland is insufficient to constitute a ‘seat’ in the terms of the BIT”."®

iii. The travaux produced by Belgium confirm the Respondent’s
interpretation
For the Respondent, the travaux préparatoires produced by Belgium confirm the Respondent's
arguments. The Respondent notes that Algeria sought to exclude from the BIT’s scope of
application individuals or companies of a Contracting Party who did not have their principal
center of economic activities (centre principal des intéréts économiques) in Belgium or
Luxembourg.''? Algeria thus proposed the addition of such economic criterion which was

independent from nationality, and was defined by reference to the investor's average turnover
(chiffre d'affaires moyen des investisseurs). However, following exchanges between the
Contracting Parties, the Algerian negotiators did not insist on their proposal. '?°

For the Respondent, the Claimant’s argument that the criterion of siége réel was rejected
during the BIT negotiations is ill-founded.'*! The Contracting Parties subjected the notion of
investor, inter alia, to a nationality test consisting of the presence of the siége social on their
territory by reference to their national legislation. Thus, it is clear that the Contracting Parties
intended to provide for the “real seat” as it is known in their domestic laws. 122

Finally, in connection with disclosure of the travaux, the Respondent opposes the Claimant's
criticism by pointing to the numerous attempts made by the Respondent to retrieve such
travaux during the proceedings. '?° In any event, the Claimant's request that the Tribunal draw
adverse inferences against the Respondent has become moot after the production of the
travaux by Belgium. '24

iv. “Real seat” means the company’s place of effective management

The Respondent argues that the notion of siége réel in civil law countries, including the BIT
Contracting Parties, corresponds to the center of effective management of the company. It
refers to Jean Corbiau’s definition of the “heart and the brain” of the corporation, which in the
Respondent's view is still valid today and conforms to recent Luxembourgish case law. !25

To identify the real seat, it is necessary to verify the reality or effectiveness of the seat over the
appearance created by the statutory seat.'?° For the Respondent, the presumption that the
real seat is identified with the statutory seat is a simple presumption (présomption simple)
which can be rebutted by any means.'?” The main test to localize the siége réel is the place
where the company’s important business decisions are taken (lieu ou sont prises les décisions
importantes se rapportant a la marche de l'entreprise).'?® While the Respondent agrees with
the Claimant that the factors to be considered include the place where the meetings of the
corporate organs are held, where the administrative services are provided, where the
accounting is held, and to which correspondence is addressed or from which it is sent, the
Respondent submits that one must take account of the effectivity of these factors.'*9 Thus, the

place where the corporate meetings take place is relevant, but it is necessary to verify how
those meetings take place.'%° Similarly, it does not matter where the accounting records are
maintained, but where the accounting is effectively carried out.'3!

Finally, the certificates of residence issued by Luxembourg on which the Claimant relies are
irrelevant, as such certificates are issued to any company having its statutory seat in
Luxembourg.'%? In the absence of any official document attesting the Luxembourgish
nationality of the Claimant, it is for the Tribunal to assess the totality of the factual elements, to
decide whether the Claimant's real seat, namely its place of effective management, is situated
in Luxembourg. '33

v. Tenaris and Talta confirms the Respondent’s interpretation of siege
social

In response to the Tribunal’s invitation to the Parties to submit comments on the award issued
on 29 January 2016 in Tenaris and Talta, the Respondent contends that such award confirms
its interpretation of the BIT and the ICSID Convention. '%

First, in the context of a similarly worded provision, the Tenaris and Talta tribunal interpreted
siége social to mean siége réel. For the Respondent, the tribunal's conclusion is based on a
reasoning and interpretation method similar to those advanced by Algeria in these
proceedings. The Respondent points in particular to the tribunal’s resort to the principle of
effectiveness '®> and its conclusion that the conditions in Article 1(1)(b) of the applicable BIT
“are, in substance, nationality requirements” which, in the Respondent's view, justifies
referring to the applicable domestic law. '°°

Second, the Respondent highlights that, in determining whether Tenaris had its real seat in
Luxembourg, the tribunal proceeded to analyse in concreto the facts of the case, taking into
account all available factual elements and the particular circumstances of the case.'9” The
Respondent contends that, contrary to Venezuela in Tenaris and Talta, it has established that
the Claimant's real seat is located in Egypt. "3°

b. The Claimant’s real seat is in Egypt

Algeria argues that the Claimant's real seat is in Egypt. In particular, the Respondent argues
that the brain and the operational bodies of the Claimant are located in Cairo, from where Mr.

Sawiris and his team effectively manage the company (i). Furthermore, the Board of Managers
is not the true management organ of the company, and the fact that its meetings are formally
held in Luxembourg does not establish that the Claimant's real seat is located there (ii).

i. The Claimant’s effective management is in Cairo

The Respondent asserts that the Claimant’s brain and the operational bodies are located in
Cairo, from where Mr. Sawiris manages the company with the help of his team.'°9 Mr. Sawiris
takes all the strategic decisions from his headquarters in Cairo and is the “intellectual center
around which all operations and activities of the company are organized”. 14°

Furthermore, Mr. Sawiris’ entire team is located in Cairo.’ The Respondent notes that Ms.
Wafaa Latif, an A Manager of the company, assists Mr. Sawiris from Cairo in the management
of the business. '4? Moreover, most of the individuals involved in the negotiation and closing of
the Claimant's transactions (in particular the sale of Weather Investments to VimpelCom) are
close employees of Mr. Sawiris residing in Cairo.'* Furthermore, the Respondent asserts that
the company’s accountants work in Cairo, as is proven by the Banca IMI statements
addressed to the “Corporate Accounting Department” of the Claimant in Cairo.'44

The Respondent further asserts that “the majority of the contracts signed by Weather II and
the bank statements [...] between 2005 and 2007 indicated that the domicile of Weather II was
the professional address of Mr. Naguib Sawiris in Cairo”.'45 Moreover, the majority of the
contracts concluded by the Claimant between 2005 and 2012 provide for notices to be sent by
post or fax to Cairo. 146

The Respondent also submits that the Claimant has attempted to increase its presence in
Luxembourg for the needs of the arbitration. In particular, the Respondent notes that the
Claimant filed its consolidated accounts for the years 2009-2011 for the first time in September
2012, i.e. three weeks before it filed its Request for Arbitration, and the accounts unlike its
previous annual reports mention OTA. Furthermore, the Claimant set up a website (whose
servers are located in Egypt) on 15 May 2013, the day before the Tribunal’s First Session,
where the only thing that appeared was the Claimant's logo. '4”

ii. The Board of Managers is not the true management organ of the
Claimant

The Respondent further argues that the Board of Managers is not the true management organ
of the Claimant and does not fulfil the function assigned to it by the Articles of Association. As
a result, the fact that its meetings are formally held in Luxembourg cannot be taken as an
indication that the Claimant's real seat is in Luxembourg. '4°

First, the Respondent contends that the Board of Managers only ratifies decisions taken by
Mr. Sawiris from Cairo.'4° Specifically, the B Managers have no decision-making power nor
room to maneuver when approving resolutions. '©° Further, in light of the number of corporate
positions held by each B Manager it is impossible for him or her to actually monitor the
business of each company and to make enlightened decisions in respect of the resolutions
submitted to the Board of Directors.'*' The Claimant's B Managers are not informed of the
business of the company that they are supposed to be managing, because they do not
participate in negotiating or concluding contracts of the company. '5?

Consequently, the Respondent observes that the Board of Managers does not fulfil its role as
the body entrusted with the management of the company under the Claimant's Articles of
Association. '*? For the Respondent, the requirement of exclusive and effective management
of the company from Luxembourg, which is foreseen by the Articles of Association, is thus
manifestly not respected.'5* The Board of Managers’ role is rather limited to performing
administrative tasks.'5° There is further no element showing that the place of effective
management is located in Luxembourg. 156

In conclusion, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction ratione personae,
because the conditions of Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT are not fulfilled. '57 Indeed, they require that
the investor's siége social réel be in Luxembourg while the Claimant's place of effective
management is in Cairo.

The Claimant's position

The Claimant argues that the Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione personae because the Claimant
is a national under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and a protected investor under Article
1(1)(b) of the BIT.

In sum, the Claimant contends that it was constituted in Luxembourg in accordance with
Luxembourg law and that its registered office is and always has been in Luxembourg. The
Claimant thus is an investor under the ICSID Convention and the BIT, because the ordinary
meaning of “siége social’ in the BIT is “registered office” (a). In the Claimant's view, the BIT’s
travaux, which were produced by Belgium, confirm this interpretation. In any event, even
assuming that “siége social’ means “place of effective management”, the Claimant submits
that the Respondent has failed to meet its high burden of proving that the Claimant's place of
effective management is in Egypt, the evidence confirming that such place is situated in
Luxembourg (b).

a. “Siége social’ means “registered office”

i. The BIT’s definition of “investor” is independent of and not modified by
domestic nationality requirements

The Claimant's position has somewhat evolved throughout its pleadings. Initially, the Claimant
argued that Luxembourg law applies to the determination of the Claimant's nationality. '*
Starting from its Rejoinder and especially in its post-hearing submissions, the Claimant now
submits that the BIT’s definition of “investor” is independent of and not modified by domestic

nationality requirements. '5°

The Claimant argues that under Article 25(2) of the ICSID Convention, state parties enjoy wide
latitude to agree on the criteria by which nationality (including corporate nationality) is
determined.'® It refers to Article 1(1) of the BIT which was quoted in its original French
version above (at paragraph 180) and in its unofficial English translation submitted by Belgium
to the United Nations Treaty Series provides as follows:

For the purposes of this Agreement,

1. The term "investors" shall mean:

(a) "Nationals", i.e. any natural person who, under the legislation of the

Contracting States, is deemed a citizen of Belgium or Luxembourg or who

has Algerian nationality;

(b) "Companies", i.e. any legal person constituted in accordance with

Belgian, Luxembourg or Algerian legislation and having its registered office

in the territory of Belgium, Luxembourg or Algeria.

On this basis, the Claimant contends that the BIT defines investor companies in clear terms,
without referring to domestic nationality requirements. Indeed, while Article 1(1)(a) of the BIT

158 See especially Counter-Memorial, para. 13 (where the Claimant submits that: “[iJt is a well-established
principle of international law that nationality is governed by the domestic law of the State which determines who
will be a national of that State for purposes of the BIT. Algeria confirms this principle. Algeria also agrees that it is
a State’s laws which determine whether a company has met the requirements of siége social. Thus, the law
applicable to the question of whether OTMTI had its siége social in Luxembourg is the law of Luxembourg”).

defines “nationals” as “any natural person who, under the legislation of the Contracting States,
is deemed a citizen of Belgium or Luxembourg or who has Algerian nationality’,'*' there is no
reference to nationality under domestic law when it comes to “companies”.'®* Thus, so the
Claimant argues, the BIT’s definition of investor is independent of domestic nationality
requirements. 1

214. The Claimant notes that, in Barcelona Traction, the International Court of Justice (“ICU”)
observed that “whenever legal issues arise concerning the rights of States with regard to the
treatment of companies and shareholders, as to which rights international law has not
established its own rules, it has to refer to the relevant rules of municipal law”.'® In this case,
the BIT has “established its own rules” and there is therefore no basis to consider national law.
Moreover, in Barcelona Traction, the Court was establishing nationality for the purposes of
diplomatic protection, which is a different issue from the one at stake here. 1°

ii. The ordinary meaning of the term siége social in the BIT is “registered
office”

215. The Claimant stresses that the BIT definition must be interpreted in accordance with the
VCLT, which requires a treaty’s terms to be interpreted “in good faith in accordance with the
ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in light of its object
and purpose”. In this respect, the Claimant submits that the party invoking a special meaning
has the burden of proving it; that the ordinary meaning may not be disregarded based on the
object and purpose of the treaty; and that supplementary means of interpretation (such as the
travaux préparatoires) may only be relied upon to clarify a treaty provision that is ambiguous
or obscure or the ordinary meaning of which leads to a manifestly absurd or unreasonable
result. '® Investment tribunals confirm this understanding. '°7

216. For the Claimant, the ordinary meaning of “siége social’ is “registered office”, i.e., the seat
indicated in a company’s bylaws, for a variety of reasons.

162 Rejoinder, para. 168; C-PHB 1, para. 13.

163 C-PHB 1, para. 13; C-PHB 2, para. 3. The Claimant further submits that “this definition of nationality in the BIT
takes precedence in assessing Claimant's nationality and status as an “investor” for purposes of jurisdiction over
any provision of domestic law of the three Contracting Parties concerning the nationality of juridical entities. This
approach accords, moreover, with the domestic law of Claimant's home State, Luxembourg, which provides that
international treaties have binding force within Luxembourg and supersede national laws” (Rejoinder, para. 143,
internal footnotes omitted).

217. The Claimant points to various legal dictionaries that define siége social as the statutory seat
indicated in the company’s articles of association, and dual language dictionaries translate it
as “registered office”.'° These dictionaries also show that other terms (such as “siége
principal’ or “siége de la direction d'une société’) are used to refer to a company’s “head
office” or “place of management”.'® It is well-established, according to the Claimant, that
tribunals may rely on dictionary definitions to determine the ordinary meaning of a term, and
tribunals have done so repeatedly. '7°

218. In response to the Tribunal’s questions on the meaning of the term siége social in the other
two authentic language versions of the BIT,'7' the Claimant submits that the authentic Dutch
and Arabic versions of Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT confirm that siége social means registered

office. 172

219. First, according to the Claimant, the term “maatschappelijke zetel’, which appears in the
authentic Dutch version of the BIT, is commonly translated as “siége social’ in Dutch-French
dictionaries. The Claimant refers to a number of dictionaries that define the term as the place
where the company is located and which is indicated in its articles of association.'7? The
Claimant also argues that the Dutch term “maatschappelijke zetel’ is also consistently used in
the Belgium Company Code in contexts that clearly mean “registered office”.'7* Furthermore,
in the Belgium Tax and Revenues Code and the Belgium Judicial Code, the terms
“maatschappelijke zetel’ and “siége social” are used to mean “registered office” and are
distinguished from other terms (such as “principal établissement’, “siege de direction’, “siege
d'administration” and “siége administratif’) that correspond to the seat of management or real
seat.'75

220. Second, according to the Claimant, the term “maqaraho al ijtimaee” (os Leis!) which
appears in the authentic Arabic version of Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT, similarly means
“registered office”.'7° The Claimant argues that the term “magaraho al ijtimaee” found in Article
1(1)(b) of the BIT is not a common Arabic expression, but rather a literal translation of the
French term “siége social’ or “social seat”. However, it submits that the more commonly used

terms in Arabic, “markaz al shareka al raesee” or “markaz al shareka” have the same meaning
as “magaraho al ijtimaee” (which is found in the BIT).177

221. Furthermore, for the Claimant, supplementary means of interpretation confirm that the ordinary
meaning of siége social is registered office. In particular, the Claimant submits that although
the BIT was concluded in French, Dutch, and Arabic, Belgium deposited an unofficial English
translation of the BIT with the United Nations Treaty Series, which uses registered office for
siége social.'7® Furthermore, the BLEU’s Model BIT provides in English that “[t]he term
‘investors’ shall mean ... the ‘companies’, i.e. any legal person constituted in accordance with
the legislation of the Kingdom of Belgium, of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg or of

and having its registered office in the territory of the Kingdom of Belgium, of the
Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg or of respectively”. 179

222. Furthermore, numerous other BITs demonstrate that siége social means registered office. The
Claimant refers to the BLEU BIT practice and notes that from 1984 to 2009, the BLEU has
concluded at least 26 treaties that define investors by referring to “registered office” in the
authentic English text and “siége social’ in the authentic French text.'8° Furthermore, the
BLEU-Costa Rica BIT likewise uses “siége social’ in the authentic French text and “domicilio
registral’, which means “registered domicile”, in the authentic Spanish text.'®! Moreover, the
BLEU-United Arab Emirates and the BLEU-Libya BITs demonstrate that siége social means
registered office and not “place of management” or “residence”, which are referred to as “siége
de direction” and “domicile” in the authentic French versions of those BITs.'®* And where the
BLEU sought to impose additional requirements for purposes of defining investors under its

management” (siége de direction), rather than siége social.'** The Claimant concludes on this
point by stressing that the Respondent has failed to submit any treaty entered into by either
Contracting Party that translates siége social as place of management or any other term that
the Respondent seeks to read into the BIT to define siége social.'®>

Third, according to the Claimant, the term siége social is understood under Luxembourg law to
mean “registered office”.'°° The Luxembourg Company Law and its only unofficial but widely
used translation by Elvinger, Hoss & Priissen confirm this understanding. For the Claimant
and its experts, the term “siége social’ or “siége” under Luxembourg law refer to a company's
statutory seat.'®? Indeed, Luxembourg law consistently uses the term siége social to refer to
the seat indicated in the articles of association.'®® By contrast, when Luxembourg intends to
mean the real seat it uses different terms, such as “domicile”, “administration centrale’, or
“siége d’opération”.'°®°

Furthermore, so says the Claimant, the Respondent's argument that the BIT’s terms need to
be understood at the time of its conclusion in 1991 (at which time, according to the
Respondent, the term meant place of effective management under Luxembourg law) is
incorrect. First, pointing to ICU case law, the Claimant submits that the meaning of a term
should not be confined to the meaning given at the time of the creation of the relevant
instrument, and that the meaning of general terms in a treaty with continuing duration should
be understood to evolve over time.'9° Second, even assuming arguendo that the term siége
social should be interpreted at the time of the BIT’s conclusion in 1991, the Claimant and its
expert, Prof. Priim, consider that siége social has always meant the “statutory seat” as a
matter of Luxembourg law. '%'

Finally, arbitral practice confirms that siége social means registered office.'°* The Claimant
points to ICSID case law as well as to Barcelona Traction, where in the Claimant's view the
ICJ used the terms siége social and registered office interchangeably and distinguished the
concept of siége social from place of management and center of control.'°? For the Claimant,
Alps v. Slovak Republic, on which the Respondent relies, is inapposite because it does not
refer to siége social and the BIT applicable in that case defined investors differently, i.e. as
companies “which are constituted or otherwise duly organized under the laws of that

Contracting Party, and have their seat, together with real economic activities, in the territory of
that same Contracting Party”. 194

iii. The travaux confirm that the Contracting Parties intended to accord
siége social its ordinary meaning of registered office

The Claimant first notes that the Respondent obstructed any inquiry into the subjective intent
of the drafters of the Treaty, as it failed to produce the travaux in connection with Article 1 of
the BIT without valid reason in violation of Procedural Order No. 5.195

Second, the Claimant submits that the ordinary meaning of siége social is neither obscure nor
ambiguous and would not lead to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable. '9°
However, in accordance with Article 32 of the Vienna Convention, the Tribunal may rely on the
travaux “to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31”. 197

In this respect, the Claimant asserts that the travaux produced by Belgium show that the
Contracting Parties “agreed to protect companies based on constitution in accordance with
law and registered office in their territory”, and rejected all of Algeria's proposals to impose
additional requirements. 1%

The Claimant argues that Belgium’s earliest draft of the BIT defined investors from Belgium
and Luxembourg as “‘Companies’, i.e. any legal person constituted in accordance with Belgian
or Luxembourg legislation and having its registered office [siége social] in the territory of
Belgium or Luxembourg”.'9° Subsequently, Algeria proposed a draft exchange of letters that
would be attached to the BIT and that would define “[nJational investors or companies” as
“those that have their principal center of economic interest in Belgium or Luxembourg, under
the Algerian legislation in force concerning investments by non-residents in Algeria”.2°° The
Claimant argues that the BLEU rejected this proposal, and asked the Respondent to “abandon
[its] amendment concerning the definition of investors”.2°' The Claimant underscores that the
BLEU also expressed concern that Algeria continued to seek to “exclude from the benefits of
the Agreement multinational companies and to give advantages to ... those which have their

195 Rejoinder, para. 156. The Claimant notes that the Respondent sought to excuse this failure on the ground that

center of principal activities in the BLEU”.°* A proposal by the BLEU that each party define its
respective investors on its own terms was then rejected by Algeria.2°°

230. The Claimant further highlights that, in a letter dated one week prior to the BIT’s conclusion,
the BLEU considered the Algerian proposal, consisting of “excluding investments made in
Algeria by physical or legal persons of the BLEU that do not have their ‘principal center of
economic interests’ in Belgium or in Luxembourg”, as “unacceptable”, because it would
exclude from the BIT’s protection “investments that are made in Algeria” by “the numerous
BLEU companies that realize the most important part of their activities abroad” and “the
numerous BLEU companies that have capital held by shareholders of other countries”.2°* The
Claimant also underscores that the BLEU expressly referred to excerpts from Barcelona
Traction as reflecting a “traditional rule” requiring constitution in accordance with law and
“registered office” in the home state.2°° The Claimant submits that the BLEU concluded “that
the notions of ‘in accordance with the law of the country’ and of ‘siége social are sufficient to
define companies, and that all restrictions that are added are not inscribed in the accepted
practice of the juridical community and are discriminatory towards our companies that exercise
part of their activities abroad or whose capital is held by foreign shareholders”.2°°

231. In sum, according to the Claimant, the travaux definitively confirm that the BLEU insisted —
and Algeria agreed — to protect all companies that were constituted in accordance with the law
and that have their “registered office” in the territory.2°”

232. For the Claimant, this conclusion is further reflected in the Explanatory Note submitted to the
Belgian Senate on 8 November 1995 for purposes of ratifying the BIT. The Note records that
during the negotiations, Algeria proposed “to exclude from the benefit of the treaty any
investments made in Algeria by natural or juridical persons of the Belgium-Luxembourg
Economic Union that did not have the ‘center of their economic activities in Belgium or in

Luxembourg”, but that “[t]his proposal was unacceptable” and the Belgian negotiators “were

able to convince our Algerian partners to adopt our traditional formula for the definition of
investors and the contents of the agreement reached faithfully reflects our current practice”.?°°
For the Claimant, it is clear that Belgium’s “traditional formula” is to give the term siége social
its ordinary meaning of “registered office”, as is shown by the BLEU’s Model BIT, which is in

iv. Interpreting siége social as registered office does not render the term
ineffective or superfluous

233. The Claimant contends that interpreting siége social as registered office does not render the
term ineffective or superfluous, contrary to what the Respondent asserts. For the Claimant,
place of constitution or incorporation and registered office are separate legal concepts, as it
also arises from Barcelona Traction.?'° Referring to the examination of its Luxembourg law
expert, the Claimant explains that there can be circumstances in which the two conditions are
not fulfilled at the same time, i.e. where a company is constituted in one state and has its
registered office in another.2"' The Claimant points to the Explanatory Note to the Draft Law
Modifying the Luxembourg Company Law in 2005 which states that “Luxembourg law is a rare
exception in Europe in this regard [...] a Luxembourg company can validly transfer its siége
statutaire abroad and change its /ex societatis without being dissolved, on the condition that
such transfer is unanimously approved by the shareholders and bondholders”.2'2

234. The reverse situation could also occur, i.e. a company incorporated in Luxembourg and having
its statutory seat and real seat in Luxembourg, could decide to move its statutory seat (its
siége social) abroad but still remain a Luxembourg company.?'? Arbitral tribunals have also
observed that a company may move its registered office without dissolving and
reconstituting.2'4

235. As aconsequence, the Claimant contends that the Respondent's effet utile argument must be
dismissed. Were this not the case, the BLEU’s Model BIT, which is in English, and the 26
BLEU treaties with authentic English texts granting protection to companies based on the dual
requirements of constitution and “registered office” would all run afoul of the principle of
effective interpretation.2' Finally, the Claimant notes the Respondent's concession that a

incorporated and in whose territory it has its registered office,” and “[t]hese two criteria have been confirmed by a
long practice and by many international instruments” (citing to Barcelona Traction, para. 70).

company may dissociate its registered office from its place of constitution in “very rare”
circumstances, which is fatal to the Respondent's effective interpretation argument.2'®

v. The Tenaris and Talta tribunal’s interpretation of siége social in the
BLEU-Venezuela BIT is inapposite to this case

The Claimant submits that the Tenaris and Talta award confirms that the Claimant's siége

social is in Luxembourg and that the Tribunal should affirm jurisdiction.2'7

The Claimant first argues that Tenaris and Talta confirms that the BIT must be interpreted in
accordance with the VCLT and principles of international law and that there is no basis to
impose additional nationality requirements, based on domestic laws, which are not provided
for in the BIT.218

However, so the Claimant contends, the Tenaris and Talta tribunal's finding that siége social
means “place of effective management” is erroneous and should not be relied upon by this
Tribunal to interpret siége social in Article 1(1)(b) of the BLEU-Algeria BIT.?'° For the
Claimant, the Tenaris and Talta tribunal failed to apply the ordinary meaning of siége social,
which is registered office. While the Claimant agrees with the Tenaris and Talta tribunal's

observation that “a ‘term’ may have a number of ordinary meanings”,°”° the evidence shows
that the ordinary meaning of siége social is “registered office” and that the term “place of

effective management’ is not an alternative ordinary meaning.22"

The Claimant in particular notes that it does not appear that any of the dictionaries submitted
into evidence in this arbitration were submitted to the Tenaris and Talta tribunal.?2? Further,
the tribunal's finding that only “a proportion of Belgo-Luxembourg BITs translate ‘siége social

as ‘registered office’, which in the tribunal’s view was not “sufficiently conclusive”, is not

supported by the record of these proceedings.?23

Moreover, contrary to the Tenaris and Talta tribunal's conclusion on this point, interpreting
siége social to mean “registered office” does not render the term ineffective, in violation of the
principle of effectiveness. The Claimant submits that it is undisputed in these proceedings that
a company may validly transfer its registered office outside of Luxembourg without
reconstituting and, therefore, that constitution and registered office have different meanings.
The expert testimony, documentary evidence, and submissions in these proceedings thus are

fundamentally inapposite to the findings of the Tenaris and Talta tribunal and, indeed, are fatal
to the view that the dual requirements of constitution and registered office are superfluous.?*4

241. According to the Claimant, the Tenaris and Talta tribunal's interpretation is further contrary to
the travaux of the BLEU-Algeria BIT, which confirm the ordinary meaning of “registered

office”.225

b. Even if siége social means siége réel, the Claimant’s siége réel is and has
always been in Luxembourg

242. The Claimant submits that, even assuming arguendo that siége social means siége réel or
place of management, OTMTI is an investor under the BIT because its place of management
is in Luxembourg (i),22° which is confirmed by the tribunal's finding in Tenaris and Talta (ii).

i. The Claimant’s siége réel is in Luxembourg

243. In respect of the burden of proof, the Claimant considers that, under international and
Luxembourg law, the Respondent bears a high burden of proving that the Claimant's real seat
is dissociated from its registered office.” It is not up to the Claimant to demonstrate that its
real seat is in Luxembourg; it is up to the Respondent to prove the contrary. Investment
tribunals confirm this allocation of the burden of proof,?#° including with respect to
nationality.229

244. The Claimant contends that Luxembourg has conferred nationality on the Claimant, through
certificates of residence and other official documents stating that its siége social is in
Luxembourg.?°° In accordance with international law, the Respondent must thus show through
“convincing and decisive evidence” that this acquisition of nationality “was fraudulent or at
least resulted from a material error”.25'

245. Furthermore, according to the Claimant, Luxembourg law establishes a presumption that the
siége réel corresponds to the company’s siége social.2°* Consequently, the Claimant is

dispensed from proving a fact that the law presumes,”°? which the Respondent’s experts do
not dispute. This presumption “may be overturned only in exceptional situations in which it is
flagrantly obvious that the siége statutaire is not where the company’s central administration is
located”.?4 The burden of proof is thus high, in particular in the absence of a shareholder
decision to move the siége réel abroad.?°5

In any event, the Claimant has established that its place of management is situated in
Luxembourg. The only factors which are relevant to assess whether the Claimant's place of
effective management is in Luxembourg are whether (a) the general meetings of shareholders
and the meetings of the Board of Managers take place in Luxembourg (which, so says the
Claimant, is the most relevant factor, as this is where the company’s management decisions
become effective); (b) the corporate and accounting records are maintained in Luxembourg;
(c) administrative services are provided in Luxembourg; and (d) the company’s
correspondence is generally addressed to and sent from Luxembourg.*°° The Claimant also
notes that these factors are relaxed for holding companies such as the Claimant,?°” and that
Corbiau’s abstract description of the real seat as “the heart and the brain” of a company is

more poetry than law.238

In this context, the Claimant has further developed the following arguments. First, in its
submission, it is established that all of the Claimant's general meetings of shareholders and
meetings of the Board of Managers were held in Luxembourg.*°° In support, the Claimant
refers to the minutes which confirm that such meetings took place in Luxembourg in
accordance with Luxembourg law and the Claimant's Articles of Association.*4° The fact that
shareholders were represented by proxies, or that the Board met by teleconference, or that
the Board took decisions through circular resolutions does not alter this conclusion.*4'
Luxembourg law and the Claimant's Articles of Association authorize these practices and
provide that meetings held by teleconference or circular resolution are deemed to have taken
place in Luxembourg.*4? The residence or travel itinerary of the Claimant's controlling
shareholder, Mr. Sawiris (who, the Respondent notes, has travelled to Luxembourg on only
two occasions) are irrelevant for the purposes of locating the place of the Board or
shareholder meetings or of the Claimant's real seat.249

Further, contrary to what the Respondent and its expert, Prof. Kinsch, suggest, a company
does not lose its nationality because its board meetings are “purely formal” or “passively
recording decisions that are actually made abroad”. The decisions of the board are not purely
formal; they bind the company and only these decisions may produce legal effects.2“4 If the
Respondent were right, a company’s siége rée/ would shift depending on the place where a
shareholder or manager unilaterally takes decisions. This cannot be the meaning of
Luxembourg law, which must fix the siége rée/ for the benefit of the company and third

parties.245

In addition, the evidence reflects that the Board of Managers has managed the Claimant in
accordance with Luxembourg law and the Articles of Association. The Claimant's B Managers
held a veto over any particular decision. They performed their obligations pursuant to their
fiduciary duties, and reviewed and discussed each proposed transaction to determine whether
it was in the company’s best interest.24° The Claimant relies in particular on Mr. Bourgon’s
testimony, who confirmed that he had no obligation to agree with Mr. Sawiris’ proposal and
always had “the power to say no”.24” For the Claimant, the Respondent has failed to point to
any board decision not in the company’s best interest which the B Managers would have had
to reject.*48 It is also very common in Luxembourg that professional managers serve on
multiple boards and there is no limitation of the number of boards on which a professional
manager may sit under Luxembourgish law.?49

There is also nothing unusual about the Board’s decision to authorize Mr. Sawiris or other
individuals to negotiate and conclude significant contracts, as such delegation of authority is
provided in the company’s Articles of Association and reflects standard practice.?5°

Second, the Claimant's corporate and accounting records are maintained at its registered
office in Luxembourg.7*' The Claimant cites Mr. Bourgon’s evidence, according to which “fall
corporate and legal documents, such as the register of registered shares, the annual
accounts, documents reflecting OTMTI's securities, and minutes of the Board of Managers
meetings are maintained at OTMTI's registered office”.25?

Third, from its inception, all of the Claimant's administrative services, including book-keeping
and accounting were provided in Luxembourg.**? For the Claimant, the use of domiciliation
agents (such as the company Intertrust, used by the Claimant from 2005 to 2010) is common
in Luxembourg. In any event, from 2010, the Claimant acquired its own premises and hired its

own employees. It further retained and paid Luxembourgish lawyers, accountants, and other
service providers to render administrative services.

Fourth, the Claimant's correspondence generally was sent to and from Luxembourg.**4 The
Claimant emphasizes that, based on his review of the files, Mr. Catala confirmed that “all
correspondence addressed to Weather Investments II” was received and archived at
Claimant's registered office.255

Moreover, out of the contracts entered into by the Claimant, only five (signed in May or August
2005) provided for notices to be sent to an address in Egypt and one to an address in Italy.
However, so the Claimant argues, the Claimant specifically represented in all of these

 

contracts that it was iciled in Lt b 256 iti y, it is not uncommon nor unlawful
for companies to designate a location other than their registered office for purposes of
receiving correspondence and notices pertaining to particular transactions.257 And while,
according to the Claimant, four of Banca IMI’s statements mistakenly indicate that the
Claimant's corporate accounting department was located in Cairo, Banca IMI sent all of its
correspondence to the Claimant’s registered office in Luxembourg.*°* Beyond these factors,
none of the other elements cited by the Respondent are relevant to locate the Claimant's
place of management.

Finally, no court in any of the Contracting BIT Parties has ever found that a company in the
Claimant's situation had dissociated its real seat from its registered office.?5° This is
particularly true for Luxembourg, where no court has ever found that a company constituted
and having its registered office there lost its Luxembourg nationality by transferring its real
seat abroad.?®° As to the Belgian cases relied upon by the Respondent, more than half
concerned whether the company’s real seat was in one rather than another Belgian city, and
the Belgian courts have only deemed a company’s real seat to be a fiction in extraordinary
circumstances not present in this arbitration.?°' In the same vein, the Egyptian authorities have
never contended that the Claimant is an Egyptian company.?62

ii. Tenaris and Talta confirms that the Claimant’s siége social is located in
Luxembourg

The Claimant contends that Tenaris and Talta confirms that, if siege social were interpreted to
mean real seat, the applicable test under Luxembourg law is flexible, particularly for holding
companies such as the Claimant, and that the Respondent bears the burden of proving that
the Claimant's real seat is located outside of Luxembourg. The Claimant in particular points to
the factors that the Tenaris and Talta tribunal considered relevant in determining whether a
company has its real seat in Luxembourg (namely, the places where the directors meet; the
place where the shareholders meet (the “really decisive factor”, according to that tribunal), and
the place where the books and records of the company are being kept). For the Claimant, it
is undisputed that all of the Claimant's general meetings of shareholders have been held at its
registered office in Luxembourg and the Claimant also holds its Board meetings and maintains
its records in Luxembourg, thus satisfying all of the Tenaris and Talta factors. The Claimant
also has retained Luxembourgish auditors and lawyers, and generally receives and sends its
correspondence at its registered office. Thus, the Claimant has all of the same links to
Luxembourg that were relied on by the Tenaris and Talta tribunal to determine that Tenaris’

real seat is located in Luxembourg.?6

Analysis

a. Articulation between Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and the requirements
ratione personae in the BIT

The Tribunal begins by recalling that the Claimant must fulfil the jurisdictional requirements
ratione personae under both the ICSID Convention and the BIT.© More specifically, Article
25(1) of the ICSID Convention requires that disputes submitted to arbitration be between a
Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State. Article 9 of the BIT, in turn,
provides for the settlement of “[aJny investment dispute between one Contracting Party and an
investor of the other Contracting Party”.26>

While the requirement ratione personae under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention has not
formed the primary focus of the Parties’ pleadings, which have chiefly addressed the definition
of “investor” in the BIT, it is undisputed that the BIT Contracting Parties enjoy wide latitude in
defining what entities are to be considered as nationals for the purpose of the ICSID

Convention.

259. Thus, according to the Respondent:

L’absence de définition de la nationalité d'une personne morale dans la
Convention CIRDI laisse le soin aux Etats contractants de définir, dans les
accords de protection des investissements, les critéres permettant de
déterminer la nationalité d'une personne morale au sens desdits accords®°.

30 Voir Mémoire en Réponse, {| 159. Cette approche a été confirmée par plusieurs
tribunaux : voir, par exemple, Piece RL-69, Rompetrol Group (CIRD! ARB/06/3, 18
avril 2008), {{] 81-82 ; Piece RL-81, KT Asia (CIRDI ARB/09/8, 17 octobre 2013), ¥

Piéce CLA-117, Mobil Corp. (CIRDI ARB/07/27, 10 juin 2010), 9 156-157.767

260. Similarly, the Claimant has argued that:

Article 25 of the ICSID Convention does not define “nationality.” Rather,
‘fals ICSID tribunals and commentators have regularly observed, the
drafters of the Convention abandoned efforts to define ‘nationality’ for the
purposes of Article 25, and instead left the States Parties wide latitude to
agree on the criteria by which nationality would be determined.’

[1

It is undisputed between the Parties that, under the ICSID Convention, the
Contracting Parties had discretion to determine in the BIT the criteria for
assessing a juridical entity's nationality for purposes of the BIT.26°

261. Indeed, as can be seen from the excerpts quoted above, both Parties have invoked the same
legal authorities in this particular respect. In particular, both Parties rely on Rompetrol and KT
Asia.

262. In Rompetrol, the tribunal observed as follows:

80. As ICSID tribunals and commentators have regularly observed, the
drafters of the Convention abandoned efforts to define “nationality” for the
purposes of Article 25, and instead left the States Parties wide latitude to
agree on the criteria by which nationality would be determined. At the same
time, it is also widely recognized that, as both Parties to this arbitration
accept, Article 25 reflects objective ‘outer limits’ beyond which party
consent would be ineffective.

81. In the Tribunal’s view, the latitude granted to define nationality for
purposes of Article 25 must be at its greatest in the context of corporate
nationality under a BIT, where, by definition, it is the Contracting Parties to
the BIT themselves, having under international law the sole power to
determine national status under their own law, who decide by mutual and
reciprocal agreement which persons or entities will be treated as their
‘nationals’ for the purposes of enjoying the benefits the BIT is intended to
confer. Drawing on concepts of private international law, the Respondent
says that there is no such thing as a ‘nationality’ of corporate entities in the
same sense as for physical persons. To the extent that that were so, it
would reinforce the point: not only does each Contracting Party have the
sole authority to determine the status of juridical entities under its own law,

but the Contracting Parties jointly have the sole authority to determine the
criteria by which juridical persons with a defined status under each other's
law may enjoy the protections of their BIT.

82. To determine the criteria by which the Contracting Parties to a BIT
have agreed that nationality would be determined for its purposes, we must
look, of course, to the BIT itself. . [...] Given the latitude granted to States
under the ICSID Convention to settle the applicable nationality criteria,
there is nothing illogical in looking first of all to whether the nationality
criteria set forth in the BIT are satisfied before going on to examine
whether there is anything in Article 25 of the Convention which stands in
the way of giving effect to that. In any event, the Tribunal cannot see that
anything of substance turns on the order of the analysis — and certainly not
in the circumstances of this case.

[...] Hence the question becomes simply, what did these two States
themselves agree to of their own free will in concluding the BIT? The
Tribunal therefore holds that the definition of national status given in The
Netherlands-Romania BIT is decisive for the purpose of establishing its
jurisdiction.26°

263. In KT Asia, the tribunal observed as follows:

113. It is common ground that the ICSID Convention does not impose any
particular test for the nationality of juridical persons not having the
nationality of the host State, be it the place of incorporation, or the effective
seat, or control. This leaves broad discretion to Contracting States to
define nationality, and particularly corporate nationality, under the relevant
BIT. Kazakhstan and the Netherlands have used that discretion by
agreeing on the following definition of a “national” in Article 1 of the BIT
[...].27

264. The tribunals in Mobil v. Venezuela?”' and SOABI v. Senegal’’? (both relied on by the

Respondent) have taken similar views. Also according to Prof. Schreuer,

Definitions of corporate nationality in national legislation or in treaties
providing for ICSID’s jurisdiction are directly relevant to the determination
of whether the nationality requirements of Art. 25(2)(b) have been met.

They are part of the legal framework for the host State’s submission to the

Centre. Upon acceptance in writing by the investor [...], they become part

of the agreement on consent between the parties. Therefore, any

reasonable determination of the nationality of juridical persons contained in

national legislation or in a treaty should be accepted by an ICSID

commission or tribunal. This conclusion was expressly confirmed in Tokios

Tokeles v. Ukraine.?73
The same view was expressed by Aron Broches, the former General Counsel of the World
Bank, who chaired the consultative meetings at which the preliminary draft of the ICSID

Convention was discussed:

The purpose of [Article 25(2)(b)], as well as of Article 25 (1), is to indicate

the outer limits within which disputes may be submitted to conciliation or

arbitration under the auspices of the Centre with the consent of the parties

thereto. Therefore the parties should be given the widest possible latitude

to agree on the meaning of ‘nationality’ and any stipulation of nationality

made in connection with a conciliation or arbitration clause which is based

on a reasonable criterion should be accepted.?74
The Tribunal agrees with those authorities and considers that “while the ICSID Convention
sets objective outer limits to jurisdiction by requiring nationality, it does not specify the test for
nationality”.2”° Hence, the Contracting States have — in Aron Broches’ terms — the “widest

possible latitude to agree on the meaning of ‘nationality”, provided they use a “reasonable
criterion”.27° Such meaning of nationality is agreed in the instrument granting consent to the
jurisdiction of the Centre (a contract, a domestic legislation, or an investment treaty, as the

case may be).

The question is thus whether - to use Prof. Schreuer’s and Aron Broches’ words — the
instrument granting consent to the Centre (here the BIT) defines nationality by reference to a
“reasonable determination” or “reasonable criterion” within the “outer limits” of Article 25 of the
ICSID Convention. The Tribunal considers that the definition of nationality in the instrument of
consent is reasonable “as long as the requirements are not deprived of their objective
significance”.2”” As noted by the tribunal in KT Asia in the excerpt quoted above, generally
accepted criteria for the determination of nationality of a juridical person include the place of
incorporation, the effective seat, and control.2”8 Similarly, Aucoven noted that “[a]ccording to
international law and practice, there are different possible criteria to determine a juridical
person's nationality. The most widely used is the place of incorporation or registered office.

are reasonable, i.e. as long as the requirements are not deprived of their objective significance, there is no reason
to discard the parties’ choice”).

Alternatively, the place of the central administration or effective seat may also be taken into
consideration”.?”° Any of those determinations would thus be reasonable also for the purposes
of jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention.

Therefore, in accordance with the approach endorsed by several tribunals and with which
neither Party takes issue, the Tribunal will look “first of all to whether the nationality criteria set
forth in the BIT are satisfied before going on to examine whether there is anything in Article 25
of the Convention which stands in the way of giving effect to that”.28°

b. The definition of “investor” under the BIT

Under Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT, the Claimant must meet the following definition of “investor”,
which is set out below in its three official languages, French, Dutch and Arabic, followed by the
unofficial English translation submitted by Belgium to the United Nations Treaty Series:

Pour I'application du présent Accord,
1. le terme « investisseurs » désigne :

a) les « nationaux », c’est-a-dire, toute personne physique qui, selon la
législation des Etats contractants, est considérée comme citoyen de la
Belgique, du Luxembourg ou ayant la nationalité algérienne;

b) Les « sociétés », c'est-a-dire, toute personne morale constituée
conformément a la législation belge, luxembourgeoise ou algérienne, et
ayant son siége social sur le territoire de la Belgique, du Luxembourg ou
de I’Algérie.

Voor de toepassing van deze Overeenkomst,
1. betekent het begrip “investeerders”:

a) de “onderdanen’”, dit wil zeggen elke natuurlijke persoon die volgens de
Belgische, Luxemburgse of Algerijnse wetgeving onderdaan is van Belgié,
van Luxemburg of die de Algerijnse nationaliteit heeft;

b) de “vennootschappen", dit wit zeggen elke rechtspersoon die is
opgericht o comstig de Belgische, L 9. Algerij
wetgeving en die zijn maatschappelijke zetel heeft op het grondgebied van

Belgié, van Luxemburg of van Algerije.

For the purposes of this Agreement,
1. The term "investors" shall mean:

(a) "Nationals", i.e. any natural person who, under the legislation of the
Contracting States, is deemed a citizen of Belgium or Luxembourg or who
has Algerian nationality;

(b) "Companies", i.e. any legal person constituted in accordance with

Belgian, Luxembourg or Algerian legislation and having its registered office

in the territory of Belgium, Luxembourg or Algeria.
It is undisputed that, to be an “investor” under the BIT, a company must be (i) constituted in
accordance with Luxembourg/Belgian/Algerian law (in this case, Luxembourg law) and (ii)
have its siége social there. The disputed question is what siége social means.

The starting point is that the definition of investor is a requirement contained in a treaty and, as
such, it is subject to the rules of interpretation codified in the VCLT. The Tribunal will interpret
Article 1(1)(b) of BIT by applying those rules of interpretation pursuant to Article 31 (infra at i)
and 32 (infra at ii) of the VCLT.

i. Article 31 of the Vienna Convention

According to Article 31 of the VCLT, a treaty “shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance
with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light
of its object and purpose”. The starting point of the interpretation is the “ordinary meaning” of
the text. The latter must be ascertained in the light of the context and the treaty’s object and
purpose, any subsequent agreement or practice of the Contracting Parties related to the
interpretation of the treaty, and any other relevant rules of international law applicable in the
relations between the Contracting Parties.28"

The ordinary meaning of the term siége social is not univocal. In and of themselves, these
terms merely refer to the seat of a corporation, as opposed to anything else, for instance an
arbitral tribunal. Beyond that, a corporate seat or siége social can either be statutaire, referring

281 Article 31 of the VCLT.

54

274.

275.

to the seat appearing in the company’s bylaws or statutes, or réel, referring to the effective
seat where the company is actually managed. In that sense, the Tribunal agrees with the
Tenaris and Talta tribunal that such term is “susceptible of either a formal or substantive

meaning”.282

To clarify the ordinary meaning of the term, one must take account of the fact that it may be
used in different areas of the law. First, it may be used in national law for domestic purposes.
For example, the Luxembourg Company Law normally uses the term siége social with the
connotation of siége social statutaire having the same meaning as “registered office”.?8°
Further, the term may be used as a connecting factor in private international law to determine
the nationality or the /ex societatis of a company. In that sense, a number of countries define
corporate nationality by reference to the place of incorporation, whereas others adopt the
criterion of the effective seat or place of management. In addition, there may be further areas
of domestic law referring to the nationality of corporations, such as those relating to the trade
with enemy countries, sanctions, and taxation. A different area is that of customary
international law dealing with nationality for purposes of diplomatic protection. Finally, still in
international law, there are provisions in treaties defining “nationals” (including corporations)
for the subject matters of these treaties. This is true of treaties for the protection on foreign
investments, like the present BIT, and of certain bilateral tax treaties, peace treaties,
agreements on reparation for war losses, and others.

Given the variety of these legal domains, it is important to recognize that the principles on the
determination of nationality in one framework do not necessarily apply in another

282 Tenaris and Talta, para. 144.

283 See, e.g., Article 27 Luxembourg Law of 10 August 1915 on companies (“Loi luxembourgeoise sur les sociétés
commerciales”), as amended by the law of 21 December 2006 (hereinafter “Luxembourg Company Law”), Exh. C-
726, which provides that the siége social is the seat stated in the “acte de société’, i.e., the articles of
incorporation. See also other references to the term siége social in the Luxembourg Company Law applicable to
the Sarl or the SA that refer to the siége social designated in Article 27, e.g., Articles 39, 70, 73, 76, 187, 198. See
also the Explanatory Note to the 1999 Law, introducing the presumption that siége réel (recte, administration
centrale or principal établissement, as it was then) is found at the statutory seat, where the Luxembourg
legislature treated the term siége social as having the same meaning as siége statutaire and, conversely,
distinguished siége social from “principal établissement’:

Le paragraphe (1) énonce une régle générale pour déterminer la situation du
domicile de toute société, luxembourgeoise ou étrangére. [...] Elle consiste d'une
part a retenir le principe, consacré par une jurisprudence et une doctrine ancienne
et constants, que le domicile d'une société se trouve au centre de ses intéréts
principaux, d'autre part a instaurer la présomption que ce centre des intéréts
principaux est au lieu du siége statutaire.

Grace a la présomption suivant laquelle le siége statutaire ou siége social, notion
bien définie en droit et en fait grace a son indication précise et obligatoire dans
l'acte de société, se confond avec le domicile, la détermination de ce dernier n'est
donc plus a priori une question de fait abandonnée a l'appréciation des tribunaux.
Ceux-ci n'auront a tenir compte de I'existence éventuelle, au Luxembourg ou a
|'étranger, d'un « principal établissement », notion de fait distinct du siége social,
pour y fixer le domicile de la société, que s'il est prouvé que ce «principal
établissement » constitue bien le centre des intéréts principaux, et partant le
domicile de la société.

framework,784 which was not always apparent from the Parties’ pleadings. Indeed, the
meaning of a term in one framework may not be the same in other legal areas.

With this distinction in mind, the Tribunal has approached the threshold issue in dispute
between the Parties, namely whether, pursuant to international law, the term siége social in
the BIT must be interpreted by reference to nationality criteria under the applicable national
law, as Algeria argues, or whether the BIT embodies an autonomous notion of investor
nationality, as OTMTI submits.

If one were to follow the argument that “siége social’ in Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT refers to
domestic nationality requirements, it is undisputed by all experts, including the Claimant's
Luxembourg law expert, Prof. Priim,?8> that the nationality of a company under Luxembourg
law is determined by the siége de I’administration centrale of the company (formerly, principal
établissement), which is presumed to be at the siége statutaire.?®° This flows from Articles 159
and 2 of the Luxembourg Company Law, which provide as follows:

Art. 159.
(Loi du 25 aoat 2006)

«Toute société dont l’administration centrale est située au Grand-Duché,
est soumise a la loi luxembourgeoise, bien que I'acte constitutif ait été
passé en pays étranger.»

(Loi du 31 mai 1999)

«Lorsqu'une société a son domicile au Grand-Duché de Luxembourg, elle
est de i ité b ise et la loi ise lui est
pleinement appliquée.

Lorsqu’une société a son domicile a I’étranger, mais qu'elle a au Grand-
Duché de Luxembourg un ou plusieurs sieges quelconques d’opération, le
lieu de son établissement le plus important au Grand-Duché de
Luxembourg, qu'elle indique a cet effet dans la publication de ses actes
prescrite par la loi, constitue le domicile secondaire de cette société au
Grand-Duché de Luxembourg. »

Art. 2. :

Le domicile de toute société commerciale est situé au siége de
Vadministration centrale de la société. L’administration centrale d’une

and Olleson, Eds., OUP, 2010), pp. 1005-1021, at 1008.

285 Priim, Second Expert Report, para. 4.

286 In 2006, the term “administration centrale” replaced that of “principal établissement’ (found in the original text
and which was applicable in 1991, date of the conclusion of the BIT). See Kinsch, First Expert Report, paras. 10-
17. It appears undisputed that both terms are understood to indicate the siége réel. See Kinsch, First Expert
Report, paras. 11, 15; Priim, Second Expert Report, paras. 4, 9.

société est présumée, jusqu’a preuve du contraire, coincider avec le lieu
du siége statutaire de la société.?°”

278. This being so, in application of Article 31 of the VCLT, the Tribunal cannot agree that the
requirement of siége social in Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT refers to domestic nationality
requirements. The grammatical and syntactic structure of the provision and the context in
which the term siége social is employed make it clear that for corporations the BIT provides its
autonomous or treaty-specific requirement ratione personae. While Article 1(1)(a) of the BIT
makes reference to domestic nationality requirements in respect of individuals?®* and Article
1(1)(b) also operates a similar renvoi to national law for the constitution of a corporation, no
reference to national law applies to siége social.7°°

279. Had the Contracting Parties wished to refer to the domestic nationality criteria, they would
have linked the BIT requirements ratione personae to their domestic law. For that they could
either have taken the same approach as for individuals, i.e. they would have defined corporate
investors as those which are deemed to have the nationality of a Contracting Party according
to that State’s laws, or referred directly to those connecting factors which, under their laws,
define corporate nationality (e.g., for Luxembourg “domicile” or “principal établissement’ as it
stood in 1991, when the BIT was concluded or, in current terminology, “administration
centrale”).2°° Moreover, and importantly, under no reading of the BIT does the term siége
social (whether statutaire or réel) correspond to the Contracting Parties’ domestic law tests for
the determination of nationality of corporations. Indeed, while the BIT defines “investor” by
reference to both “constitution in accordance with law” and “siége social’, under Belgian and
Luxembourg law nationality is determined only by reference to principal établissement or
administration centrale, the place of constitution playing no role in that determination. In
reality, the role of the place of constitution is expressly disavowed for such purpose and the
Belgian and Luxembourgish legislations recognize that place of constitution and siége réel
(recte, principal établissement or administration centrale) may be located in different states.?9'

288 See BIT, Article 1(1)(a) (““Nationals’, ie. any natural person who, under the legislation of the Contracting
States, is deemed a citizen of Belgium or Luxembourg or who has Algerian nationality”, emphasis added).

289 This was also noted in Tenaris and Talta in respect of the similarly worded provision in the BIT applicable in
that case. See Tenaris and Talta, para. 165. The requirement in Article 1(1)(b) that the company be “constituted in
accordance with Belgian, Luxembourg or Algerian legislation [...]” only refers to incorporation modalities, not to
the law governing nationality.

for purposes of domestic law, the Luxembourg legislature treated the term siége social as having the same
meaning as siége statutaire and, conversely, distinguished siége social from “principal établissement’ (or in the
Parties’ terminology siége rée!). See Explanatory Note to Bill No. 4328, Exh. C-732, at 8.

This also confirms that the BIT Contracting Parties incorporated in the BIT a test that differs
from the nationality tests under their domestic laws, providing instead for an autonomous
notion “for the purposes of this Agreement’, as the chapeau of Article 1 expressly states. 79?

There is nothing unusual for contracting states to adopt an autonomous notion of a term used
in a treaty that may differ from the meaning(s) under national law. The resort to autonomous
notions or interpretations, that are independent from national legal concepts, is a technique
often used to ensure the uniform application of a treaty, for example in treaties laying down
uniform rules of private law or private international law rules. As Richard Gardiner notes,
“[these] treaties are applied within national legal systems; but though the terms used in them
are often drawn from concepts in use in national legal systems, once included in treaties they
no longer attract the possibly varying character that they have nationally but assume a single
meaning under the treaty, unless it states otherwise”.*° A prime example of the development
of autonomous interpretation of treaty terms is the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the
European Union on the interpretation of private international law conventions, such as the
1968 Brussels Convention (subsequently replaced by Regulation 44/2001). This technique
may also be used in investment treaties, and this is certainly so for this BIT for the reasons
which the Tribunal has described above.

The Tribunal thus concludes that siége social has an autonomous meaning for the purposes of
the BIT. As a consequence, the next task is to establish the actual meaning of that
autonomous notion of siége social.

The BIT was concluded in French, Dutch, and Arabic, all three texts being equally authentic.
Pursuant to Article 33(3) of the VCLT, “[t]he terms of the treaty are presumed to have the
same meaning in each authentic text’. There is no dispute between the Parties that the term
siége social in the French language version has the same meaning as the corresponding
terms in the Dutch and Arabic versions.%4 The dispute is about what this term means. The
Tribunal notes in this respect that, despite the three languages being equally authentic, initially
both Parties presented arguments almost exclusively based on the French version of the BIT.
It was only in reply to an invitation from the Tribunal after the Parties’ Post-hearing Briefs that
they put forward materials and submissions on the Dutch and Arabic versions of the Treaty.29°
As is shown in the subsequent analysis, the Tribunal has considered all three language
versions, although the French version has attracted particular focus as a result of the Parties’
pleadings and the fact that the BIT was negotiated in French (on which see infra at ii).

282 The specification that the BIT definitions are given “for the purposes of the BIT” also implies that they have no
impact on the other contexts in which issues of nationality of corporations are relevant.

283. The record includes excerpts of a number of dictionaries to which the Parties, and especially
the Claimant, have referred. It is well established that tribunals may rely on dictionary
definitions to elucidate the ordinary meaning of a term? and a number of investor-state
tribunals have done so.?°” With one exception,?°* the French and dual language dictionaries
on record, establish that the ordinary meaning of siége social is “registered office” and that
other terms, namely siége principal or siége de la direction d'une société, are used to define
“head office” or “place of management”.?°9

284. Similarly, the term “maatschappelijke zetel’, which appears in the authentic Dutch version of
Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT, is defined in one instance as the place “where the company is
established,” which “must be indicated in the deed [of incorporation]”.°°° Another definition

equates “maatschappelijke zetel’ to the “[t]he seat of the company”, “siége de la société” and

"statutory seat” and defines those terms as the place “which must be indicated in the
[company] statutes, the address where the company is reachable”, and distinguishes the
company’s “maatschappelijke zetel’ from its “werkelijke zetel [siege réel]”. The latter is defined
as the “place from which the company is actually conducted in light of where the board of
directors and the general assembly meetings are held or where the bookkeeping is being
kept”, or as the “connecting factor in private international law for the purpose of determining
the law governing the company”.9°"

285. By contrast to the French and Dutch terms, the evidence with regard to the term “ofa
gees!” in the authentic Arabic version of Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT, which appears to be a

literal translation of siége social, is more limited and thus not helpful to the Tribunal.

In conclusion, the dictionaries in the record indicate that the ordinary meaning of siége social
is registered office. The Tribunal notes, however, that dictionary meanings are a helpful
starting point though not the end of the Tribunal’s interpretive inquiry. In particular, the Tribunal
must look at the term siége social not in isolation but in its broader context of Article 1(1)(b)
and in particular in correlation with the criterion of constitution mentioned in the same

provision.

In this respect, the Parties have extensively discussed the principle of effet utile or
effectiveness. Specifically, Algeria submits that interpreting siége social as registered office
would render the term superfluous, since Article 1(1)(b) requires incorporation in one of the
Contracting Parties and incorporation entails a registered office (siége statutaire) on the
territory of such Contracting Party. In the same vein, the tribunal in Tenaris and Talta
interpreted siége social in the applicable BIT as real seat essentially on the basis of the
principle of effectiveness.°°° The Tribunal has extensively reviewed Tenaris and Talta and
taken into account the Parties’ comments on this award. It can, however, not subscribe to the
interpretation in that decision, for the reasons discussed in this and the following section, and
on the basis of the supplementary means of interpretation available to this Tribunal (infra
atii.).

It is undisputed, and rightly so, that the principle of effectiveness plays an important role in the
interpretation of treaties. While not expressly included in the VCLT, this canon of interpretation
is normally linked to the object and purpose of the treaty and to the principle of good faith,°°*
and is deemed an integral part of the general rule of interpretation set in Article 31 of the
VCLT.°° The principle has often been applied by the |CJ°°° and investment tribunals.°°” So for
instance, in AAPL v. Sri Lanka,

Nothing is better settled, as a canon of interpretation in all systems of law,
than that a clause must be so interpreted as to give it a meaning rather
than so as to deprive it of meaning [...]. This is simply an application of the
more wider legal principle of “effectiveness” which requires favouring the
interpretation that gives to each treaty provision "effet utile".2°°

While it acknowledges that in most instances the constitution of a company in a Contracting
State implies the presence of the registered office in that State, the Tribunal does not consider

that interpreting siége social as “registered office” renders such term meaningless. In its
opinion, the Contracting Parties chose in Article 1(1)(b) to define corporate nationality for the
purposes of the BIT by reference to the place of incorporation. They did so by naming the two
elements normally part of the incorporation test, i.e. “constitution” and “registered office”. In
other words, constitution in accordance with local law (i.e. the creation of a company as a legal
person within a given system of municipal law) and registered office or siége statutaire in the
respective State (i.e. the seat appearing in the corporation’s constitutive documents) are two
elements of one single test (place of incorporation) and not two different tests.

290. The “combination” of the two conditions of incorporation and registered office as part of one
single test was also notably made in Barcelona Traction. In the context of the discussion of
nationality of corporate entities for purposes of diplomatic protection, the Court held that “[t]he
traditional rule attributes the right of diplomatic protection of a corporate entity to the State
under the laws of which it is incorporated and in whose territory it has its registered office”.°°°
The Court also noted that “[t]hese two criteria have been confirmed by long practice and by
numerous international instruments”. 31°

291. In the commentary to the Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection, the International Law
Commission (“ILC”) referred to this passage and noted that:

Here the Court set two conditions for the acquisition of nationality by a
corporation for the purposes of diplomatic protection: incorporation and the
presence of the registered office of the company in the State of
incorporation.$""

292. Barcelona Traction was of course concerned with nationality for the purposes of diplomatic
protection under customary international law, which is not applicable in investment treaty
arbitration.2'* As was stressed earlier, one must distinguish the different legal frameworks in
which nationality issues arise. This is particularly so here, as the ICJ emphasized that it was
dealing with the default position in customary international law in the absence of a treaty.
Specifically, it stated that “whenever legal issues arise concerning the rights of States with

312 This was held in many investment treaty decisions. See, e.g., Rompetrol, paras. 86-93 and many other cases,
mainly in the context of the issue of shareholders rights, such as CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine
Republic, |\CSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 17 July 2003, paras. 43-45, available

substantive requirements”).

regard to the treatment of companies and shareholders, as to which rights international law
has not established its own rules, it has to refer to the relevant rules of municipal law’.3'3 In
the present case, international law has established its own rules, i.e. those set out in Article
1(1)(b) of the BIT.

293. The fact that the customary rules on diplomatic protection, as referred to in Barcelona
Traction, are not directly applicable here does not mean that the Tribunal cannot take account
of these rules in its interpretive process.°'4 This is especially so here as the travaux show that
the BIT terms were intended to reflect customary international law on corporate nationality for
purposes of diplomatic protection.315

294. That said, the Tribunal returns now to the relevant passage of Barcelona Traction. The Court
there first noted that the “traditional rule” for purposes of diplomatic protection was the one
based on incorporation and registered office (constitution and siége in the French language
version).°"6 It is clear that in the context of the “traditional rule” the Court views “siége” as a
reference to “siége statutaire’.°'7 The Court then added that some States require “further or
different links” to allocate nationality for purposes of diplomatic protection. In particular, the
Court referred to States giving diplomatic protection to a company incorporated under their law
“solely when it has its seat (siége social) or management or centre of control in their territory”
(“uniquement lorsque le siége social, la direction ou le centre de contréle de cette société se
trouve sur leur territoire”) or “when a majority or a substantial proportion of the shares has
been owned by nationals of the State concerned”.2'8 In other words, the Court referred to the
three usual tests for nationality mentioned above (para. 267), i.e. incorporation, effective seat
and control.

295. The Court then gave preference to the “traditional rule” of incorporation and found that the
company had “manifold links” with Canada, the State where it was constituted and had its
registered office.°'? These manifold links included the fact that the company had “maintained
in Canada [...] its accounts and its share registers”, the fact that “board meetings were held
there for many years” and that “it ha[d] been listed in the records of the Canadian tax
authorities”.°°° The Court concluded that “a close and permanent connection” (“lien étroit et

Traction and noting that “the Court in fact refers to multilateral oy bilateral agreements between States for the
protection of foreign investments, and to their provisions as to jurisdiction and procedure in the case of disputes
over the treatment of corporate investors, and does so in terms which unmistakably connote that, where such an
agreement is present, its terms would prevail”.

318 Barcelona Traction, para. 70. Together with incorporation (and registered office), these two further tests are
those generally advanced for nationality. See e.g. the excerpt from KT Asia, para. 113, quoted supra at para. 267.

permanent’) had been established with Canada.*' Incidentally, these are also the links that
the Claimant has with Luxembourg in our case.

In any event, it results from the preceding discussion that the Court viewed “incorporation”
(“constitution” in French) and “registered office” (“siége”) as two elements of the same test,
namely the one based on the place of incorporation, which it regarded as the “traditional rule”
of nationality for the purposes of diplomatic protection.5*? The ILC, in the commentary quoted
above, recognized that the Court “set two conditions” for the acquisition of nationality, although
it acknowledged at the same time that “the laws of most States require a company
incorporated under its laws to maintain a registered office in its territory’. This being so, the
Tribunal could not uphold an objection based on the lack of effet utile without implying that the
mention of registered office in Barcelona Traction is meaningless, a step which the Tribunal is
not prepared to take. Thus, like the Court set “two conditions” within the “traditional rule” of
nationality for the purposes of diplomatic protection, so equally may a BIT provide for these
same two conditions to describe its nationality requirement for purposes of investment treaty
protection.

In light of this analysis, the Tribunal can dispense with addressing the Parties’ arguments on
whether the dissociation between the two requirements is possible or not under Luxembourg
law, as the issue is inapposite in the framework of the BIT.

In conclusion, the context in which the term siége social is placed confirms that the term does
not refer to domestic nationality rules, but embodies an autonomous treaty-specific meaning.
A good faith interpretation of the ordinary meaning of Article 1(1)(b) suggests that siége social
means siége social statutaire or registered office. The object and purpose of the BIT does not
point to a different outcome. This conclusion is consistent with the principle of effectiveness as
the BIT simply spells out the place of incorporation test by specifying the two elements
generally associated with it (constitution in accordance with local law and registered office).
This interpretation of Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT also takes into account the customary rules on
nationality as stated in Barcelona Traction, which constitute the background against which the
treaty’s provision must be viewed, as is shown by the travaux préparatoires.

ii. Supplementary means of interpretation (Article 32 VCLT)

The primacy of the text of the Treaty, viewed in its context and bearing in mind the Treaty's
object and purpose under Article 31 of the VCLT, implies that recourse to supplementary
means (including the travaux préparatoires and the circumstances of the Treaty’s conclusion)
is only allowed in limited circumstances. Pursuant to Article 32 of the VCLT, one may resort to

821 Barcelona Traction, para. 71.

822 In Diallo, the Court relied on Barcelona Traction to conclude that despite the Guinean nationality of Diallo as
the sole shareholder in the two companies in question, "the normal rule of the nationality of the claims” applied
and that having regard to their place of incorporation, “[t]he companies in question have Congolese nationality”.
See Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v. Democratic Republic of the Congo), Preliminary Objections,

supplementary means of interpretation (i) to confirm the meaning resulting from the application
of Article 31 or (ii) to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to Article 31
“leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure” or “leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or
unreasonable”.

300. The following supplementary means are noteworthy as they confirm the interpretation of the
term siége social to which the Tribunal has arrived by application of Article 31.

301. — First, the unofficial English translation of the BLEU-Algeria BIT deposited by Belgium with the
United Nations Treaty Series carries some weight, as it was submitted by one of the
Contracting Parties to the BIT to the United Nations for purposes of publication in an important
database of treaties. The English version submitted by Belgium translates siége social as
registered office.°°5

302. Second, the BLEU Model BIT, which is in English, likewise refers to registered office.°24
Actually, Article 1(1)(b) of the BLEU-Algeria BIT faithfully reflects the BLEU Model BIT in that
respect, as is also evidenced by the travaux préparatoires of the BLEU-Algeria BIT (see
below).

303. Third, at least 26 BITs concluded by the BLEU, the official languages of which are both
English and French, use siége social in French and registered office in English. In this respect,
Algeria does not dispute that treaties on the same subject matter concluded by the Contracting
Parties with third States may legitimately be considered as part of the supplementary means
of interpretation, and rightly so.°° However, it contends that such treaty practice is
inconclusive. While the Tribunal has noted that not all BITs concluded by the BLEU in both
English and French translate siége social with registered office (for example, the BIT between
the BLEU and the Philippines translates siége social with “head office”),5°° the overwhelming
majority of the BLEU BITs clearly indicates that the BLEU’s understanding of siége social in its
own BITs is that of registered office.2*” Moreover, in many of those treaties, the English text
prevails in the event of a discrepancy.*28

Morocco, Judgment, ICJ Reports 1952, pp. 191-192; AAPL v. Sri Lanka, para. 40; Churchill, paras. 195 et seq.
826 The Tribunal notes that the other two BITs invoked by the Tenaris and Talta tribunal in support of its
conclusion that the BLEU BIT practice is not “sufficiently conclusive” were not concluded in French and English.
See BLEU-Rwanda (1983) BIT and BLEU-Czech Republic BIT. Thus, the Tribunal does not consider these two
BITs as helpful as those BITs in which English and French are both official languages.

304. To conclude on this point, interpreting siége social as siége social statutaire or registered
office is fully in line with the BLEU's treaty practice. The Respondent was unable to
convincingly refute this conclusion by pointing to a different treaty practice from either the
BLEU or Algeria. A contrary conclusion would, in the Tribunal’s view, entail extraordinary and
far-reaching consequences, as it would directly contradict the formulations of the requirements
ratione personae in dozens of treaties.

305. The Tribunal has next reviewed the travaux préparatoires which it requested from Belgium and
Luxembourg, with the agreement of the Parties, and which were produced by Belgium. The
travaux fully support the Tribunal’s understanding.

306. The BLEU, represented by Belgium, and Algeria started BIT negotiations in 1980. The earliest
draft of the BIT defined investors from Belgium and Luxembourg like in the final version.°°9 In
fact, all later drafts proposed by Belgium contained the same definition of “investor”.2°° The
first exchanges between the Parties in 1987 to 1989, in which Belgium rejected certain
proposals from Algeria as “for the most part, unacceptable”, were not concerned with the
definition of investor.°*! In November 1990, Belgium and Algeria held negotiation meetings
and came to an agreement ad referendum “on all of the provisions”, except for three issues,
among which the definition of “investors”. On this latter topic, Algeria undertook to engage in
an exchange of letters.°5?

307. On 25 November 1990, Algeria proposed a draft exchange of letters that would be attached to
the BIT and would define “[nJational investors or companies” as “those that have their principal
center of economic interest in Belgium or Luxembourg [“centre principal de leurs intéréts
economiques”], under the Algerian legislation in force concerning investments by non-
residents in Algeria”.°°° On 21 February 1991, Belgium stated that it was ready to sign the BIT,
provided Algeria “abandons [its] amendment concerning the definition of investors”.°°4 On 25
February 1991, Algeria replied that the criterion of siége social was “more vague than the
principal center of economic activities” and that the parties therefore needed to combine these

criteria through an exchange of letters.°° On 19 March 1991, Belgium refused Algeria's
proposal and reasoning. Belgium was concerned that Algeria would seek to “exclude from the
benefits of the Agreement multinational companies and to give advantages to the small-
medium companies (‘PME’) (those which have their center of principal activities in the BLEU)”.
Belgium proposed in consequence that each party define its respective investors on its own
terms, with the BLEU “considering as investors in Algeria the nationals and legal persons
constituted in accordance with Belgian and Luxembourg legislation and having their siége
social in the territory of the BLEU”, while Algeria “could consider as investors in BLEU the
physical and legal persons with their principal center of interests in Algeria”. In reply, Algeria
proposed to reverse this approach, which led Belgium to note that the parties were at “an
impasse”.5°6

On 17 April 1991, one week prior to the signature of the BIT, Belgium reiterated that its
definition of investors was “the classic model of the BLEU and provides classic guarantees in
this field”, whereas “[t]he Algerian proposal [...] consists of excluding investments made in
Algeria by physical or legal persons of the BLEU that do not have their ‘principal center of
economic interests’ in Belgium or in Luxembourg”. Belgium regarded Algeria’s proposal as
“unacceptable”, because it excluded from the BIT’s protection “investments that are made in
Algeria” by “the numerous BLEU companies that realize the most important part of their
activities abroad” and “the numerous BLEU companies that have capital held by shareholders
of other countries”. It further observed that Algeria's proposal did “not accord with international
treaty practice”, as reflected in the ICJ’s decision in Barcelona Traction. |t also emphasized
that, in the words of the Court, “‘no absolute test of the ‘genuine connection’ has found general

acceptance’”’.°°” Thereafter, Belgium stated “that the notions of ‘in accordance with the law of
the country’ and of ‘siége social are sufficient to define companies, and that all restrictions
that are added are not inscribed in the accepted practice of the juridical community and are
discriminatory towards our companies that exercise part of their activities abroad or whose
capital is held by foreign shareholders”.*°* There are no subsequent communications on
record indicating any different position of the Parties on this matter, and in particular no
expression of disagreement by Algeria.

The BIT was then signed on 24 April 1991. On 8 November 1995, the Belgian Government
submitted the Explanatory Memorandum for purposes of ratifying the BIT to the Parliament.°°9
The Memorandum recounted that Algeria had proposed “to exclude from the benefit of the
treaty any investments made in Algeria by natural or juridical persons of the Belgium-

389 The Explanatory Memorandum is of course not part of the travaux préparatoires as it was not originated during
the treaty's preparation phase, but was generated by one of the Parties several years thereafter during the
ratification process. It is mentioned here to the extent that it is as an additional element that sheds light on the

Luxembourg Economic Union that did not have ‘their principal center of economic interest in

Belgium or in Luxembourg”. However, “[t]his proposal was unacceptable”, continues the
Memorandum, and the BLEU was “able to convince our Algerian partners to adopt our
traditional formula for the definition of Investors and the content of the agreement thus

concluded faithfully corresponds to our current practice”.*4°

In the Tribunal’s view, the travaux show the following points. First, it does not transpire from
the travaux that there was a discussion whether siége social meant registered office or siége
réel. Second, it is clear that the BIT under negotiation was based on the BLEU’s treaty
practice and on the BLEU Model BIT, as was repeatedly stated by Belgium.°*' Third, Algeria
sought to add to the criteria of constitution and siége social a third requirement, namely the
“principal center of economic interest” defined by reference to the average turnover of the
company. Belgium firmly opposed this addition and insisted on its traditional formula based on
constitution in accordance with law and siége social. It also dismissed Algeria's suggestion
that siége social was a “vague concept” and instead argued that it had “a firm legal value and
is less susceptible of interpretation than the concept of ‘principal center of economic activities”
(“a une valeur juridique certaine et est dés lors moins susceptible d'interprétation’).*4*

A passage from the travaux towards the very end of the negotiations is particularly
enlightening to appreciate the BLEU’s position, which was accepted by Algeria through the
conclusion of the BIT:

[...] [the Algerian proposal to require a "principal center of economic
activities" as part of the definition of “investor”] ne s’inscrit nullement dans
la pratique conventionnelle internationale. Ainsi, l'arrét Barcelona Traction
rendu a l’encontre de la Belgique, le 05.02.70, par la Cour internationale de
Justice stipule clairement (§70) que « la régle traditionnelle attribue le droit
d’exercer la protection diplomatique d'une société a |'Etat sous les lois
duquel elle s’est constituée et sur le territoire duquel elle a son siége ».
Ces deux critéres (repris dans notre projet) ont été confirmés par une
longue pratique et par maint[s] instruments internationaux. Tout en
constatant que certains Etats limitent quelque fois cette protection
diplomatique lorsqu’il n’existe pas de lieu de « rattachement effectif » (p.
ex. : absence d’organe de direction...) ce méme arrét poursuit cependant
en soulignant qu’ « aucun critére absolu applicable au lien effectif n'a été
accepté ».343

Two observations arise from this passage. First, Belgium was of the view that the dual
condition of constitution and siége social was generally reflective of international treaty
practice. In particular, Belgium equated its proposal of constitution in accordance with local
law and siége social to “the traditional rule” articulated by the ICJ in Barcelona Traction,
quoting the ICJ decision verbatim. It is worth recalling that, in the quoted French original
paragraph, the Court spoke of constitution and siége, which it translated as “registered

office”.*44 On this basis, Belgium confirmed that “these two criteria [i.e., “constitution in
accordance with the law” and “siége”] [were] reproduced in our draft”, which shows beyond
any doubt that Belgium intended to adopt the first test enunciated in Barcelona Traction based
on the place of incorporation (with the two usually associated components) and no other.°45

313. Second, Belgium expressly objected to conditioning protection upon the existence of a
“genuine connection” (“rattachement effectif’) to the home State, such as the presence of a
management body. This objection demonstrates that there is no basis for imposing a genuine
or similar connection test under the BLEU-Algeria BIT. The express reference to the “absence
of a management body” appears significant, as it shows that there is no room for a “place of
effective management” or siége rée/ test, which is the test the Respondent seeks to import into
the meaning of siége social.

iii, Conclusion

 

314. In conclusion, the Tribunal considers that “siége social’ in Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT means
“registered office” or siége statutaire in the sense of the “seat” appearing in a corporation's
constitutive documents. Because there is no dispute that the Claimant was constituted in
accordance with Luxembourg law and has its registered office in Luxembourg, the Tribunal
concludes that it is an “investor” within the meaning of Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT.%4°

315. Finally, as already stated, a BIT criterion based on place of incorporation is an entirely
reasonable criterion for the determination of nationality of juridical persons.*4” Thus, in light of
the conclusion reached above in respect of the interpretation of Article 1(1) of the BIT, the
Claimant is also a “national” of a Contracting Party under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.

c. Even if siége social were to refer to siége réel, the Claimant would have its siége
réel in Luxembourg

316. Even if, contrary to the Tribunal’s conclusion, siége social in Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT were to
imply a reference to domestic nationality requirements and thus have the meaning of siége
social réel, the Claimant would equally be an “investor” under the BIT, as it would be a
national of Luxembourg under the laws of Luxembourg. While the Tribunal would not need to
address this point given its conclusion on the meaning of siége social in the BIT, it will

344 The Tribunal notes that throughout the Barcelona Traction Judgment, the Court translated “siége” in the
French version with “registered office” in the English version (see paras. 30, 31, 70, 71); “siége social’ with “seat
(siége social)” (para. 70); and “siége statutaire” with “registered office” (para. 71).

345 The position adopted by the BLEU during the negotiations of the BLEU-Algeria BIT is in turn confirmed by the
BLEU Model BIT and the overwhelming majority of its BITs with third States (analyzed supra at paras. 301-303),
which in their English versions refer to a company “constituted in accordance with Belgian, Luxembourg or
legislation and having its registered office in the territory of Belgium, Luxembourg or __”, which, once more,
faithfully reflects the English text of para. 70 of the ICJ judgment in Barcelona Traction.

346 To the extent that the Respondent has also advanced and maintained a separate admissibility objection (see
supra note 93), this objection is likewise rejected as the Claimant has fulfilled the conditions of Article 1(1)(b) of
the BIT at all relevant times.

347 See supra para. 267.

nonetheless give brief reasons why a different interpretation of the term would not change the
outcome of this jurisdictional objection.

In the Tribunals view, if it were to engage in an analysis of the nationality of the Claimant
under the BIT by reference to domestic nationality requirements, the Tribunal would have to
analyze whether the Claimant is a “national” of the relevant Contracting Party according to the
criteria set by that Contracting Party to determine corporate nationality. Here, the Tribunal
would thus apply the requirements for corporate nationality under Luxembourg law as they are
applied in Luxembourg. As already explained above, the nationality of a company under
Luxembourg law is determined by the siége de I’administration centrale of the company
(formerly, principal établissement), as is stated in Articles 159 and 2 of the Luxembourg
Company Law, which provide as follows:

Art. 159.
(Loi du 25 aodt 2006)

«Toute société dont l’administration centrale est située au Grand-Duché,
est soumise a la loi luxembourgeoise, bien que l’acte constitutif ait été
passé en pays étranger.»

(Loi du 31 mai 1999)

«Lorsqu’une société a son domicile au Grand-Duché de Luxembourg, elle
est de ic ité b ise et la loi ‘geoise lui est
pleinement appliquée.

[.]
Art. 2. :

Le domicile de toute société commerciale est situé au siége de

Vadministration centrale de la société. L’administration centrale d’une

société est présumée, jusqu’a preuve du contraire, coincider avec le lieu

du siége statutaire de la société.5
While the place of the administration centrale determines the company’s nationality, such
place is, by virtue of Article 2(2) of the Company law, presumed to be at the siége statutaire or
registered office. Under the presumption established by Luxembourg law, the Claimant would
thus be a Luxembourgish national, as its siége statutaire is and has always been in
Luxembourg.

The presumption encapsulated in Article 2(2) of the Luxembourg Company Law is, however,
rebuttable. In this respect, the factors that Luxembourg law considers as relevant to determine
where a company’s administration centrale or siége réel is located are rather formal in nature.
The Tribunal notes that there is no major disagreement between the Parties’ Luxembourg law
experts on these factors (at least in the abstract). The Tribunal discerns the following relevant
factors: whether (a) the general meetings of shareholders and the meetings of the Board of

348 Luxembourg Company law, Exh. RL-177 (emphasis added).

320.

321.

322.

Managers take place in Luxembourg; (b) the corporate and accounting records are maintained
in Luxembourg; (c) administrative services are provided in Luxembourg; and (d) the
company’s correspondence is generally addressed to and sent from Luxembourg.

The Tribunal notes that the Tenaris and Talta tribunal considered similar criteria and found
that the “elements indicative of the presence of an effective seat” in Luxembourg included the
following elements: “the places where the Directors meet; the place where the Shareholders
meet; and the place where the books and records of the company are being kept”.°49 In
assessing whether the claimant in that case had an “effective seat” in Luxembourg, the
tribunal also “consider[ed] it critical to take into account the actual nature of each company,
and its actual activities”.*°° In particular, the tribunal noted that:

In so far as [such] entity is no more than a holding company, or a company

with little or no day-to-day operational activities, its day-to-day

‘management’ will necessarily be very limited, and so will its physical links

with its corporate seat. Put another way, it would be entirely unreasonable

to expect a mere holding company, or a company with little or no

operational responsibility, to maintain extensive offices or workforce, or to

be able to provide evidence of extensive activities, at its corporate location.

And yet holding companies, and companies with little or no operational

responsibility, have ‘management’, and are certainly not excluded from the

[BIT] in this case. Indeed, countries such as Luxembourg [...] clearly

consider it to their respective benefit to attract such companies, and to

maintain a corporate regulatory regime that allows for them.?5"
The Tenaris and Talta tribunal concluded on this point that “the test of actual or effective
management must be a flexible one, which takes into account the precise nature of the
company in question and its actual activities”.25* By contrast, the tribunal also dismissed any
relevance of other criteria advanced by Venezuela to argue that the company’s real seat was
elsewhere. In particular, it held that, in accordance with Luxembourg law, neither the
“nationality and residence of senior management” nor the “number and location of any
employees of a company” constitute valid criteria to assess the effective seat®5° and that
“Tenaris does have a physical presence in Luxembourg” even though “under Luxembourg law,
there is no need for a company to own or rent premises in Luxembourg”.°*

In the Tribunal’s view, applying the relevant criteria under Luxembourg law, as enumerated in
the preceding paragraphs, there can be no doubt that the Claimant fulfills all of these criteria.
First, all of the Claimant's general meetings of shareholders and meetings of the Board of
Managers were held in Luxembourg. Second, the Claimant's corporate and accounting
records are maintained at its registered office in Luxembourg. Third, from its inception, all of
the Claimant's administrative services, including book-keeping and accounting, were provided

in Luxembourg. Fourth, the Claimant's correspondence was generally sent to and from
Luxembourg. The Respondent's objections to the ways those meeting were held (i.e. by proxy,
through teleconference or circular resolution) are unfounded as those practices are allowed
under Luxembourg law (and the Claimant's Articles of Association). Moreover, the
Respondent's insistence on Mr. Sawiris rare appearances in Luxembourg or on his overall role
in the company are misplaced as these facts play no role to establish a company’s siége réel
in Luxembourg. Furthermore, like Tenaris, OTMTI is a holding company and “has no
operational activities of its own and its only function is to manage its portfolio of companies”,
which would necessarily require “relatively limited” management activity.5> Thus, considering
all of these circumstances, there can be no doubt that the Claimant has its administration
centrale or place of effective management or siége réel in Luxembourg. The Tribunal
considers that the Respondent has not been able to establish otherwise.

In conclusion, even if the Tribunal were to engage in an analysis as to whether, under Article
1(1)(b) of the BIT, the Claimant has its siége rée/ in Luxembourg (which would not be justified
under the BIT), the Claimant would nonetheless fulfil the definition of “investor” of the BIT.

The foregoing analysis on the theoretical interpretation of Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT as well as
the subsidiary analysis of the concrete existence of a siége réel is that of the Tribunal’s
majority. Arbitrator Stern is not in agreement with these analyses.°°>

JURISDICTION RATIONE MATERIAE: WHETHER THE CLAIMANT MADE AN INVESTMENT WITHIN THE
MEANING OF THE BIT AND THE ICSID CONVENTION

The Respondent’s position

The Respondent argues that the Claimant made no investment within the meaning of the BIT
(a) and the ICSID Convention (b). The Respondent further objects that the alleged contracts
concluded between OTA and MedCable are not investments of the Claimant (c).

a. The Claimant made no investment within the meaning of the BIT

While the Respondent concedes that OTH made an investment in Algeria,°5” the Respondent
objects that the Claimant made no investment in the economy and on the territory of Algeria
pursuant to the BIT. The Respondent has advanced a number of arguments in this respect.

385 Tenaris and Talta, paras. 204-205.

356 Arbitrator Stern considers that siége social as referred to in the BIT can only mean siége réel, if interpreted, as
it should be according to the Barcelona Traction case (para. 50), by reference to the rules generally accepted by
municipal laws. Moreover, for her, this case is a cas d’école where the siége réel does not coincide with the
registered seat in the Netherlands and must be considered to be in Egypt, because M. Sawiris himself, an
Egyptian national, insisted that he is “everything” in the corporate structure.

387 See Tr. Day 5 (Respondent's Closing), 134:21-134:23 ([...] OTH did carry out an initial investment; there's no
dispute on that”) and Tr. Day 1 (Respondent's Opening), 103:10-103:12 (‘We are not saying that the former
investors didn’t invest ... The investment is still there from OTH"). See also R-PHB 2, para. 78 ("II n'est pas

de la société OTH un investissement sur le territoire algérien au nom et pour le compte de la société OTA,

71

327.

330.

As a preliminary matter, for the Respondent the mere holding of an indirect shareholding in
OTA does not constitute an investment in the local economy or on the territory of Algeria
pursuant to the BIT.°5° Because the Treaty’s purpose, like that of any BIT, is to encourage
investments on the territory of the Contracting Parties, an investor must establish that it has
invested in the economy and on the territory of one of the Contracting Parties or at least
establish a “territorial nexus” with that Contracting Party.°59

For the Respondent, this means that when an investment is made in an indirect manner, the
indirect investor must prove that it has effected the investment through one or more vehicles
established for the purposes of the investment.°° Here, the Claimant has made no
investments or re-investments, whether at the time of acquiring Wind or thereafter. OTMTI
became an indirect shareholder in OTH to finance the acquisition of Wind, not to invest in
Algeria.°*' More specifically, the Respondent's argument is that the pledge of the OTH shares
in the context of the Wind acquisition allowed Mr. Sawiris to obtain part of the funds necessary
to acquire the Italian company through two “collateral loans” concluded with Weather Capital
on 5 August 2005 for a total amount of €1.2 billion.

Algeria further submits that, even after the Wind acquisition, the Claimant made no
investments under the BIT.%* First, contrary to the Claimant's allegations, the share
purchases of Weather Investments in December 2006 and January 2007 are not investments.
In particular, the purchase from Enel of 26.1% of Weather Investments shares is the result of
the sale of Wind, and was thus not made with a view to investing in the Algerian economy.°%
Furthermore, the purchase of 0.62% of Weather Investments shares from certain Middle
Eastern investors does not constitute an investment either. In fact, these acquisitions were
made within the context of the Wind acquisition, and present no links with Algeria,°°* which is
the reason why the Claimant has refused to produce the related purchase agreements.

Second, the Respondent rebuts the Claimant's argument that it made a contribution “in
services” to OTA through the French subsidiary Orascom Telecom Services Europe (“OTSE”)
and through Weather Investments.°®> For the Respondent, the alleged services performed by
OTSE are grounded solely on statements from one of the Claimant's witnesses (Mr. Michel
Hubert) and on one exhibit,°°° which is an incomplete document lacking any evidentiary

value.°°7 With regard to the alleged services rendered by Weather Investments between 2006
and 2010 (the Claimant's argument being that the Claimant made a payment of €2.48 million
to Weather Investments, which in turn provided services to its subsidiaries, including OTA),
the Respondent notes that the Claimant's annual reports do not specify the purpose of those
payments. The Claimant has thus not established that such payments were intended to
finance Weather Investments’ services to OTA.268

Third, the Claimant has not shown that it made any “reinvestments” within OTA pursuant to
the BIT.%®° In this respect, the Respondent contends that OTA’s earnings were not reinvested
in the local economy and on Algerian territory. The Respondent points to the minutes of the
shareholders meeting of OTA, which allegedly confirm that OTA’s shareholders voted for the
distribution of almost all of OTA’s returns as dividends.°”° Further, the minutes of the meetings
of the Claimant's corporate organs do not evidence any decision to reinvest dividends in
OTA.°" In addition, the Claimant cannot rely on the expenses incurred by OTA (“dépenses
effectuées par OTA’), as these expenses were necessary for OTA to operate and make profits
and are therefore not dividends which shareholders would have left in the company.?7*

Furthermore, the Claimant has not established that it exercised any effective control over
OTA. The Respondent contends that under Luxembourg law, if the Claimant had exercised
effective control, it should have filed consolidated annual accounts starting from 2005, which it
did not do.?”? The consolidated accounts drawn up from 2009 to 2011 were merely an attempt
to manufacture control ex post for purposes of this arbitration.°’4 Finally, the Claimant has not
proven that it has taken any decision relating to OTA’s activity in Algeria, as the minutes of its
meetings contain no reference to OTA or to disputes between OTA (or OTH) and the Algerian
authorities.27

b. The Claimant made no investment within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the
ICSID Convention

For the Respondent, the Claimant must show that it has made an “investment” under the
objective definition developed in the framework of the ICSID Convention. Such definition
provides for three elements: a contribution made for a certain duration at a risk.27° The
Respondent underscores that the Claimant does not dispute that an investment in the sense

of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention necessarily entails a contribution or “commitment of

resources”.377

As a general matter, the Respondent submits that the mere holding of shares in a company
does not involve a contribution pursuant to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. For these to be
a contribution, the shareholder must have committed resources when purchasing the shares
(or thereafter). It cannot benefit from a possible contribution made previously by the seller
(‘lactionnaire ... ne peut simplement se prévaloir d'une éventuelle contribution effectuée
auparavant par le cédanft’).5”° Moreover, the shareholder's contribution must be “substantial”
and effected on the host state’s territory or, at least, “with a view to and within the framework
of the project to be realized abroad” (“en vue et dans le cadre du projet a réaliser a
l'étranger’).379

The thrust of the Respondent's argument is that the Claimant has made no contribution on
Algerian territory, as the raison d’étre of its alleged payments was to acquire an Italian
company (through a variety of investment vehicles), not to invest in Algeria.%°° More
particularly, the Respondent makes the following observations in relation to each of the
Claimant's alleged “commitments of resources”.

First, in connection with the Claimant’s August 2005 issue of shares for a total value of
€3.5 billion, such issue cannot be regarded as a contribution, as its purpose was not to buy a
(very indirect) interest in OTA, but to fulfil a condition precedent (“condition suspensive”) for
the acquisition of Wind:38"

a. The issue of the shares constituted the last step in the restructuring of the Sawiris
family’s shareholding in OTH effected for the purposes of the Wind acquisition.°®* The
transaction involved a mere “paper exchange” (the Sawiris Entities subscribed the
entirety of the new shares issued by the Claimant in exchange of the shares they held in
Weather Investments), as was admitted by the Claimant's financial expert, Mr. Tolkien,

b. Such restructuring was economically neutral vis-a-vis OTA and Algeria.°® It did not
entail any cash flow in the direction or for the benefit of Algeria. Once again, the
Respondent maintains that the Claimant's financial expert conceded as much at the
Hearing.°*° It also argues that the Claimant's invocation of Gold Reserve is misplaced as

the latter considered the share swap under the applicable BIT, not under the ICSID
Convention.38

c. The financing obtained in the context of the restructuring was neutral vis-a-vis Algeria:
the “subordinated loan agreement” entered into by Mr. Sawiris was a mere accounting
exercise (“jeu d’écritures”) without economic substance.*®” The “collateral loans” granted
by Banca IMI in the amount of €1.2 billion were used by Weather Investments to finance
the acquisition of a 62.75% stake in Wind from Enel on 11 August 2005, and not to
invest in Algeria.2®*

Second, in connection with the contribution in cash of €294 million allegedly made by the
Claimant to Weather Investments, the Respondent observes that such payment was a
condition to obtain the collateral loans for the Wind acquisition.°®° Also that contribution was
thus used to finance the acquisition of 62.75% of the shares in Wind. Therefore, it cannot be
deemed a contribution in Algeria under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.°°°

 

the December 2006/January 2007 payments of €1.3 billion to purchase Weather
Investments shares from Enel and the Middle Eastern investors are no contribution either, as
their purpose was to complete the acquisition of Wind and not to acquire a new indirect
interest in OTH.°°' In addition, the purchase of shares from Enel was financed by third parties
and not by the Claimant, and it is not proven that the purchase of shares from the Middle
Eastern investors was financed by the Claimant.°%

Fourth, the other alleged contributions do not qualify as such under Article 25:5

 

a. For the reasons already explained above,°%* OTA’s alleged reinvestments cannot be
considered contributions.

b. The services rendered by Weather Investments, by OTSE and by persons empowered
by the Claimant are no contributions either.5°

Fifth, the Respondent disputes that the inclusion of OTA in a “stronger group” following the
restructuring may constitute a contribution, as the Claimant argues.°°° This argument is
unfounded legally and factually, as the acquisition of Wind entailed a “negative contribution”

towards Algeria.°°” The various companies created in the framework of the transaction were

341. — Sixth and finally, the Respondent highlights that the Claimant has not assumed any “risk” as
required by the objective notion of investment under Article 25. In support, it calls attention to
the decision of the High Court of Justice of London mentioning that the Sawiris “were able to
obtain control of Wind through [Weather Investments] with a minimum of cash” and to a
statement by Mr. Sawiris that he acquired Wind “for free”.4°°

c. The alleged contracts between OTA and MedCable are not investments of the
Claimant within the meaning of the BIT or the ICSID Convention

342. For the Respondent, shares in a company incorporated in the United Kingdom, such as
MedCable Ltd. (“MedCable”), do not fall within the definition of investment under Article 1(2) of
the BIT (which applies to companies incorporated in the host state).4°' As a result, so says
Algeria, the Claimant has changed its argument and now invokes certain purported contracts
between MedCable and OTA as assets of OTA (“un actif d’'OTA’).

343. To this changed argument, the Respondent objects that the existence and entry into effect of
these contracts is not proven:402

a. First, the so-called “Capacity Agreement IN”,4°? a service agreement between OTA and
MedCable of 17 December 2007, provides that it will become effective on the date of
conclusion of several so-called “Capacity Agreements OUT”.4% Since the Claimant has
only produced one Capacity Agreement OUT,‘ the Respondent requests that the
Tribunal draw adverse inferences against the Claimant.*° Further, the Capacity
Agreement OUT produced by the Claimant is to become effective on the conclusion of a
so-called “BF Lease Agreement”. This lease, produced with the Rejoinder,*” was itself
to become effective on the conclusion of a Consortium Agreement between MedCable
and the “Consortium Algérien de Télécommunications”. However, the Consortium

Agreement produced by the Claimant*°® was concluded between MedCable and OTA,
not the Consortium Algérien de Télécommunications. Therefore, so the Respondent
concludes, it is not established that the Capacity Agreement IN, as well as the related
agreements, have entered into force. #°9

b. Second, according to the Respondent, the Claimant has attempted to establish the
“right-of-use” or “IRU” over the cable (on which it relies in its briefs) only by reference to
the Mason expert report and to a short excerpt from an internal power point presentation
of OTA,4'° which documents are devoid of evidentiary value.4'' The Claimant has not
produced the contract(s) providing for such right of use.*1? The Respondent thus
requests that the Tribunal draw adverse inferences from the absence of these
contracts.413

Further, in reliance on a majority position in arbitral decisions,*'* the Respondent submits that
the property, contractual rights, and other assets of the company in which the investor is a
shareholder cannot constitute an “investment” pursuant to the BIT and the ICSID Convention,
because they are not assets of the investor.4'5

Finally, in the event that the Claimant were to succeed in establishing the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction ratione materiae under the BIT, it would then have to prove that the measures
interfering with the assets or contracts of the local company resulted in a loss of the value of
the investor's shares in the local company.*1°

The Claimant’s position

The Claimant maintains that it made an investment that qualifies for protection under both the
BIT (a) and the ICSID Convention (b). Specifically, the Claimant contends that OTMTI paid
€5.1 billion in cash and shares to acquire Weather Investments and with it, inter alia, its
indirect investment in OTA. The corporate restructuring of the Weather Group that enabled
this acquisition greatly benefited OTA, given the contributions in management, know-how,
procurement, and increased access to capital. In addition, the Claimant contends that OTA’s
reinvestment of €1.2 billion in earnings into Algeria after the Claimant gained control over the
company constitutes a further investment.

a. The Claimant made an investment within the meaning of the BIT

The Claimant asserts that it has made an investment within the meaning of the BIT. First, it
submits that under the express terms of the BIT, an indirect shareholding in an Algerian
company constitutes an investment.*'? The Respondent's argument that the indirect holding of
shares in OTA does not constitute an investment in the local economy or in the territory of
Algeria is contrary to the clear definition of “investment” in Article 1(2) of the BIT,*'® which
reads as follows:

The term ‘investments’ shall mean any kind of assets or any direct or
indirect contribution in cash, in kind or in services, invested or reinvested in
any sector of economic activity whatsoever.

The following shall more particularly, though not exclusively, be considered
as investments for the purposes of this Agreement:

[1

b) Shares, company shares, and any other form of participation, including

minority or indirect participation, in companies constituted in the territory of

either Contracting Party; [...]#1°
For the Claimant, OTMTI’s payment of €5.1 billion in cash and shares to acquire, inter alia, its
indirect investment in OTA falls within the broad language of the chapeau.*?° Furthermore,
OTA is a “compan[y] constituted in the territory of” Algeria and OTMTI acquired an “indirect”
participation for cash and shares, which comes within the assets mentioned in Article
1(2)(b).421

The Claimant rejects the Respondent's argument that the BIT does not protect the passive
holding of an indirect participation. The BIT does not require “active” involvement and protects
“minority or indirect” shareholding.*?? The Claimant also underscores that, even in the
absence of an express mention of indirect shareholdings, tribunals have consistently held that
indirect investments are protected under the applicable treaty.4?° Similarly, the acquisition of
an indirect interest after the initial contribution into the host state constitutes an investment
entitled to BIT protection.474

The Claimant also discards the Respondent's argument that it has made no investment on the
territory of Algeria within the meaning of the BIT as contrary to the express treaty terms.425

This argument would defeat the Treaty’s express references to “indirect” contributions,
“indirect” investments, reinvestments, and “indirect” shareholdings.*?® Numerous tribunals
have confirmed that a shareholding in a company that is active in the host state constitutes a
protected investment, irrespective of whether funds financing the local operations flow into the
host state or not.427

Second, the Claimant submits that the Respondent’s overarching focus on the reasons for

 

which the Claimant acquired its indirect shareholding in OTA is misguided, as subjective intent
and motivation are not germane to determining whether the Claimant made an investment
under the BIT.4?8 It is for the Tribunal to assess objectively whether an investment was made,
and no tribunal has ever held that a claimant's motivation is relevant to determine whether an
investment exists.42

In any event, the Claimant alleges that in acquiring Weather Investments’ shares, OTMTI
meant to bring Weather Investments’ assets, including OTA, under OTMTI’s ownership and

control. 43°

As is further explained below when discussing the Claimant's alleged contributions under the
meaning of the ICSID Convention, the Claimant contends that it paid €3.794 billion in cash
and shares in 2005 to acquire an indirect controlling participation in OTA.*%! The Claimant
acknowledges that “it acquired its indirect controlling shareholding in OTA in the context of
subsequently acquiring an indirect controlling shareholding in Wind Italy and that it used
shares of OTH as collateral to acquire Wind Italy”.4° However, it asserts that there can be no
dispute that it made an “investment” within the meaning of the BIT, when in August 2005 the
Sawiris Entities transferred their shares in Weather Investments to the Claimant, in return for
shares in OTMTI, for a total of €3.5 billion. OTMTI further contributed an amount of
approximately €294 million to Weather Investments to subscribe an increase in the capital of
Weather Investments through cash contributions.*8° The Claimant stresses that its bank
records confirm that it paid Weather Investments €294 million in cash to buy shares in
Weather Investments.*°4

The Claimant further explains that it subsequently increased its indirect stake in OTA through
additional acquisitions of shares of Weather Investments.**5 Whether these transactions were

79

linked to the Wind transaction, as Algeria contends, or not, is irrelevant to assess whether they
resulted in an investment under the BIT. For the Claimant, its acquisition of additional
shareholding in OTA through a purchase of further shares in Weather Investments was an
investment within the meaning of the BIT.49°

355. Third, to counter the Respondent's argument that the property, contractual rights, and
interests attached to the company OTA do not amount to an investment by the Claimant under
the BIT, the Claimant submits that the BIT protection extends to both the ownership of the
shares and of the assets of OTA.‘°” For the Claimant, any assets and contracts of OTA fall
within the specific definition of investment in the BIT (which includes a broad chapeau). Thus,
the property and contractual rights of OTA are covered by the protection which the BIT affords
to the Claimant.**° Tribunals routinely find that a claimant with a controlling shareholding has
standing to make claims for acts prejudicial to “the contractual rights of the company of which
it was a shareholder”,**9 and that the assets and the contractual rights of the company in the
host state controlled by the claimant are protected “investments” for purposes of the treaty.

356. The Claimant specifies that it does not claim that the Tribunal has jurisdiction on the basis of
its ownership of shares in MedCable. Rather, OTMTI’s investment under the BIT is its indirect
shareholding in OTA, as well as its ownership interest in OTA’s rights and assets.*4° OTA
leased and later purchased from MedCable the rights to use a submarine cable from Algiers
and Annaba in Algeria to Marseilles in France under the Mediterranean Sea (the cable itself is
also referred to as MedCable). Hence, OTA’s right to use that submarine cable, pursuant to
lease agreements with OTH’s wholly-owned subsidiary, MedCable, falls within the BIT
definition of “investments”.*#' According to the Claimant, OTA perfected its lease agreements
with MedCable on 17 December 2007. As these contracts were not covered by the
Respondent's document production request, any adverse inferences sought by the
Respondent in this respect should be denied. 447

357. ‘In any event, with its Rejoinder, the Claimant submitted the BF Lease Agreement, upon which

Hence, the Claimant submits that the Capacity IN Lease Agreement and the Capacity OUT
Lease Agreement became effective when OTA signed these agreements on 17 December
2007.444

Fourth and finally, the Claimant submits that it maintained control over its investment, OTA,

 

from 2005 until its exit through the sale of Weather Investments in April 2011.445 It exercised
its direct majority ownership to control Weather Investments; which in turn exercised its
majority ownership in OTH (through wholly-owned subsidiaries) to control OTH; which again
exercised its majority ownership (directly and through wholly-owned subsidiaries) to control
OTA.446

For the Claimant, investment tribunals have held that control over a corporation through
controlling shareholding is sufficient. Where such control exists, there is no need to look for
indicia of effective control.447 While certain arbitral tribunals may have considered other
elements to determine effective control over an entity in the absence of a controlling share
ownership, those cases are not relevant in the present circumstances, as the Claimant held an
indirect controlling shareholding in OTA.448

In addition, in respect of the Respondent's objection that the minutes of the OTMTI Board do
not discuss OTA, the Claimant emphasizes that Weather Investments served as the operative
entity for the Weather Group affiliates, including OTA, and that the Claimant routinely
exercised its authority to appoint the members of the Weather Investments Board.‘49
Discussions concerning business matters of the Weather Group appear in the minutes of the
shareholder and Board of Managers meetings and in the financial reports of Weather
Investments, rather than of the Claimant, with the Claimant controlling these decisions through
its control over Weather Investments.4°°

b. The Claimant made an investment within the meaning of the ICSID Convention

The Claimant further submits that its investment in OTA constitutes an “investment” under
Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.*5' First, the Claimant's shareholding in OTA, which
qualifies as an investment under the BIT, also constitutes an investment under the ICSID
Convention. ** In light of the absence of a definition of investment in the ICSID Convention, a

tribunal should look to the definition of “investment” in the BIT.45? As OTMTI's indirect
shareholding in OTA constitutes an “investment” under the BIT, it also meets the requirement
of an “investment” pursuant to the ICSID Convention.*® Tribunals have generally recognized
that the Salini criteria should be treated as non-binding, non-exclusive means of identifying
(rather than defining) an investment under the ICSID Convention.*° A tribunal would need
strong reasons to disregard the contracting states’ definition of investment in a BIT.45°
Because the definition of “investment” in the BLEU-Algeria BIT is consistent with an
understanding showed by numerous other states, there can be no doubt that OTMTI's
investment qualifies under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.*5”

Second, even if the Tribunal were minded to consider the Salini criteria in determining the
existence of an investment pursuant to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, OTMTI's
investment in OTA would clearly fulfill these criteria as identified by Algeria, namely a
contribution, a duration, and a certain risk.

The Claimant notes that there is no dispute about duration. Indeed, Algeria does not challenge
that requirement, nor could it, as OTMTI held its indirect shareholding in OTA for nearly six

years. 458

With respect to contribution, the Claimant alleges that it made substantial contributions in
cash, assets, services, know-how, and personnel in establishing and furthering its investment
in Algeria:4°°

e Asa first element of contribution, the Claimant made the following five contributions in the
aggregate amount of approximately €5.1 billion in cash and shares to acquire, inter alia,
its indirect shareholding in OTA:46°

i. In August 2005, the Claimant contributed €3.5 billion in shares to acquire Weather
Investments and, thereby, an indirect shareholding in OTA. For the Claimant a
contribution towards an investment may be made by issuing shares.**'

ii. Still, in August 2005, the Claimant paid €294 million in cash to acquire additional
Weather Investments shares. The Claimant’s bank records evidence this payment*

and the fact that the Claimant borrowed this amount is irrelevant, as the commitment

of borrowed capital may constitute a contribution.

iii. In 2006, the Claimant paid €248 million in cash to acquire additional Weather

Investments shares from Enel.

iv. In June 2008, the Claimant paid €1.025 billion in cash to acquire additional Weather
Investments shares, by repaying with interest a loan amounting to €962 million
previously taken from Enel.

v. The Claimant further made a €44.47 million cash payment to Middle Eastern
investors to buy more Weather Investments shares, thereby acquiring additional

indirect participation in OTA.

For the Claimant, the evidence refutes the Respondent's characterization of the
Claimant's acquisition of OTA as a mere “paper share exchange”, implying a lack of
value.*® The value of the Claimant's shares that were tendered for Weather Investments’
shares (and thus for indirect holding in OTH and OTA) was commensurate with the market
value of OTH at the time, which amounted to US$ 42 per share.*®4 The “Claimant paid an
amount equivalent to this fair market value when, as part of the restructuring of the
Weather Group, it engaged in a share-for-share exchange through which the Sawiris
family tendered OTH shares for Weather Investments shares and then Weather
Investments shares for [the] Claimant's shares”.4° The shares that the Claimant
contributed are assets and a contribution may take any form, including assets.*6° In
support, the Claimant invokes Gold Reserve v. Venezuela, a case in which the tribunal
upheld jurisdiction where the Canadian claimant had acquired indirect ownership in a
Venezuelan subsidiary through a restructuring involving a share-to-share swap with no
funds being exchanged in or moving through Venezuela.*®” An investment may be made
in the host state without a direct transfer of funds there, particularly if the transaction
accrues to the benefit of the state itself. In fact, requiring a direct flow of funds into the
host state would preclude a foreign investor from purchasing an existing investment from

another foreign investor. 4°

Moreover, the fact that the Weather Group assumed debt and that the OTH shares were
used as security in connection with the Wind transaction lacks relevance, as debt and

OTA earnings between 2005 and 2010, when the Claimant was OTA’s indirect controlling
shareholder.47° It cites to its expert Mr. Tolkien who stated that “[dJeclaring and paying
dividends after investments in assets have already been made does not alter the fact that
retained earnings were already being reinvested”.47' Further referring to O/ European v.
Venezuela, the Claimant asserts that a shareholder who does not collect the profits of its
company does make a monetary contribution to the company.472

e As a third element of contribution, the Claimant paid €2.48 million out-of-pocket to
Weather Investments between 2006 and 2010 and Weather Investments provided
financial assistance to the Weather Group companies, including OTA.47°

e As a fourth element, the Claimant also indirectly contributed services to OTA through
Weather Investments and OTSE. It is well established that the provision of a service
constitutes a contribution for the purposes of ascertaining the existence of an “investment”
under the ICSID Convention.*”

e As a fifth and final element, the Claimant contributed personnel and know-how to the
development of OTA’s market leadership in Algeria's telecommunications sector, in
particular through Mr. Sawiris.47> The Claimant alleges that it contributed to OTA’s
improved creditworthiness, access to international capital markets, significant
procurement savings and efficiencies, and inter-affiliate services and know-how, all of
which were made available as a result of the Claimant's restructuring of the Weather
Group.476

e In this context, the Claimant adds that the argument of a negative contribution is ill-
conceived. By acquiring Wind and restructuring the Weather Group, OTMTI gained a
foothold in developed as well as emerging markets when it became OTA’s controlling
shareholder, as a result of which OTA received the benefits of the Weather Group's
synergies and market expansion, including know-how, efficient managerial resource
allocation, increased access to capital, procurement advantages, and services.*””7 Among
these, the Claimant in particular stresses the provision of direct and indirect management

expertise to OTA;4”8 financing benefits (e.g., enhanced creditworthiness and borrowing
power for OTA, access to top-tier banks and international capital markets);4”? and
procurement savings (through the Claimant's networks of equipment providers and
bargaining power).48°

In respect of the third element of the notion of investment, the Claimant contends that OTMTI
bore the same risk by holding an indirect shareholding in OTA that any shareholder bears, i.e.,
the risk that the value of OTMTI’s shareholding may decline.**' It challenges Algeria's
argument that OTMTI did not bear any risk because intermediary companies were minimizing
the risk. While OTMTI held its economic interest in OTA through a chain of companies, any
change in OTA's value would flow through that chain as a function of the economic interest
held at each level. 482

Third and last, the Claimant contends that Algeria’s attempt to impose a subjective element as
part of the definition of investment under the ICSID Convention is untenable. Thereby, Algeria
seeks to transform an obiter dictum taken out-of-context from Quiborax v. Bolivia into a new
subjective factor for its “objective” test for an investment.*®? No tribunal has ever held that the
claimant’s subjective intent or motivation is relevant to assess the existence of an
investment.** In any event, the evidence shows that OTMTI’s motivation in acquiring Weather
Investments shares precisely included placing its assets, most notably OTA, under OTMTI’s
ownership and control.48>

Analysis

In this section, the Tribunal examines whether the Claimant made an investment under the
ICSID Convention and the BIT. To this end, the Tribunal will first set out the articulation
between the definitions of investment under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and under the
BIT (a). Thereafter, the Tribunal will assess whether the Claimant made any investments that
meet those definitions (b).

Articulation between the definitions of investment under Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention and in the BIT

Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention circumscribes the jurisdiction of the Centre as follows:

The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising
directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any
constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the
Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which
the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. [...]

Article 9 of the BIT, entitled “Settlement of investment disputes”, limits the Contracting Parties’
consent to investor-state arbitration to “any investment dispute”.*®° The definition of the term
investment is found in Article 1 of the BIT, which in pertinent part reads as follows:

For the purposes of this Agreement:

[1

2. The term “investments” shall mean any kind of assets or any direct or
indirect contribution in cash, in kind or in services, invested or reinvested in
any sector of economic activity whatsoever.

The following shall more particularly, though not exclusively, be considered
as investments for the purposes of this Agreement:

(a) Movable and immovable property as well as any other rights in rem,
such as mortgages, liens, pledges, usufructs and similar rights;

(b) Shares, company shares, and any other form of participation, including
minority or indirect participation, in companies constituted in the territory of
either Contracting Party;

(c) Bonds, claims and rights to any benefit having an economic value;

(d) Copyrights, industrial property rights, technical processes, registered
trade names and business assets;

(e) Concessions granted under public law or under contract (including
concessions for prospecting, cultivating, mining or development of natural
resources) in respect of rights directly resulting from agreements
concluded between the investor operating under a concession and the
authority granting the concession.

Any change in the legal form in which assets and capital have been
invested or reinvested shall not affect their status as investments for the
purposes of this Agreement.

It is undisputed that, for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction over this dispute, the Claimant must
establish that it has made an investment which is protected under both the BIT and the ICSID
Convention.“®” Starting from the ICSID Convention, it is equally beyond dispute that the ICSID

Convention does not define the term “investment”. In the Tribunal’s view, the absence of a
definition of “investment” under the ICSID Convention implies that the Contracting States
intended to give to the term its ordinary meaning under Article 31(1) of the VCLT as opposed
to a special meaning under Article 31(4) of the same treaty.*8® As held by a number of recent
investment awards, this ordinary meaning of the term is an objective one,*®° and comprises
the elements of (i) a contribution or allocation of resources, (ii) a duration; and (iii) risk, which
includes the expectation (albeit not necessarily fulfilled) of a commercial return.4#°° As noted by
the tribunal in Saba Fakes, these requirements “are both necessary and sufficient to define an
investment within the framework of the ICSID Convention”.4*"

371. The Tribunal considers that this “objective” or “inherent” meaning is also present in a bilateral
investment treaty’s definition of “investment”, as was underscored by the tribunal in KT
Asia.**? The BIT applicable in this case defines an investment in the first sentence of Article
1(2) as both an “asset” and a “contribution”.4° These two notions are in reality two sides of the
same coin, as “assets cannot be protected unless they result from contributions, and
contributions will not be protected unless they have actually produced the assets of which the
investor claims to have been deprived”.4%4 Or, in other words, the “contribution” refers to the
economic act of allocating resources and the “asset” to the legal result of such act.

372. As is customary in definitions of investment contained in bilateral investment treaties, the
BLEU-Algeria BIT then provides for a non-exhaustive list of “investments” protected under the
Treaty.*95 The listed items normally exhibit the hallmarks of an “investment” in the objective
sense seen above. But, if any of these items does not correspond to the inherent definition of
“investment”, the fact that it falls within one of the categories listed in Article 1(2) does not
transform it into an “investment”.*% In other words, the use of the term “investment” in both the
ICSID Convention and the BIT imports the same basic economic attributes of an investment
derived from the ordinary meaning of that term, which comprises a contribution or allocation of
resources, duration, and risk.

With those notions in mind, the Tribunal now turns to examining whether the Claimant made
an investment under the ICSID Convention and the BIT.

b. Did the Claimant make an investment within the meaning of the ICSID
Convention and the BIT?

While the Respondent concedes that OTH made an investment in Algeria,” it disputes that
the Claimant made an investment in the economy and on the territory of Algeria.

At the outset, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant's alleged investment is its indirect
shareholding in OTA, a company incorporated in Algeria, which held the GSM License granted
by the Algerian Government for a price exceeding US$ 700 million. The BIT includes, among
the non-exhaustive list of “investments”, “[s]hares, company shares, and any other form of
participation, including minority or indirect participation, in companies constituted in the
territory of either Contracting Party”. Accordingly, OTMTI’s investment fulfills that part of the
BIT definition. It thus remains to be seen whether it also meets the objective definition of
investment applicable under both the ICSID Convention and the BIT, as discussed above.

The Claimant does not deny that the acquisition of its indirect participation in OTA occurred
through a corporate restructuring and, more specifically, in the context of a broader set of
transactions, the main purpose of which was to acquire Wind and in which the OTH shares
were used as collateral. In this respect, the Respondent’s overarching objection is that the
raison d’étre of the Claimant's contributions towards the acquisition of OTA was to acquire
Wind, rather than to invest in Algeria. The Tribunal does not consider this objection well-taken.
The investor's motivations are irrelevant when assessing the existence of an investment in its
objective meaning under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and the BIT. Algeria's insistence
on a passage from Quiborax taken out of context is unhelpful. In that case, the tribunal did not
seek to elevate the raison d’étre to an independent requirement of the definition of investment,
but rather found that the claimant had made an investment irrespective of where the claimant
had paid for the shares in an intermediary company, and noted in obiter that the raison d’étre
for the payment was to acquire mining concessions in Bolivia.49 What matters for the
purposes of the Tribunal’s inquiry into the existence of an investment is whether the Claimant
acquired OTA by making a contribution of resources, which entailed a certain duration and
risk.

The acquisition of the Claimant's indirect stake in OTA occurred in different stages through a

number of complex transactions. Having carefully reviewed them, the Tribunal comes to the

497 See Tr. Day 5 (Respondent’s Closing), 134:21-134:23) (‘[...] OTH did carry out an initial investment; There’s
no dispute on that.”) and Tr. Day 1 (Respondent's Opening), 103:10-103:12 (‘We are not saying that the former
investors didn’t invest ... The investment is still there from OTH"). See also R-PHB 2, para. 78 ("II n'est pas
contesté par les Parties que, au début des années 2000, M. Naguib Sawiris et sa famille ont réalisé par le biais
de la société OTH un investissement sur le territoire algérien au nom et pour le compte de la société OTA,
prenant la forme de l'acquisition de la Licence GSM (et de la conclusion de la Convention d'investissement)",
(internal footnotes omitted).

498 Quiborax, para. 229.

conclusion that the Claimant has made at least the following contributions towards the

acquisition of OTA:

a. First, the Claimant has established that it paid €294 million in cash to subscribe Weather
Investments shares in August 2005, thereby increasing its indirect shareholding in OTA.
On 10 August 2005, Weather Investments approved a capital increase and the Claimant
(amongst other companies) subscribed directly to the share offering.4°° The payment of
this amount is proven by the Claimant's bank records®°° and the Respondent does not
deny that this payment was made.®°' The fact that the amount of the payment was
borrowed from the Sawiris Entities and later repaid does not change its nature of
“contribution”. Furthermore, for the reasons already mentioned, the fact that this
transaction was part of the acquisition of Wind is immaterial, the raison d’étre of this

contribution playing no role in this context.

b. Second, the Claimant paid €248 million in cash when it purchased an additional 16.1%
stake in Weather Investments from Enel. The Respondent's main objection in this
connection is that the Claimant did not make a direct cash payment to Enel, but directed
its subsidiaries, Weather Investments and WAHF, to pay Enel from a dividend payment
of €281 million that Weather Investments owed to the Claimant.5° The Tribunal agrees
with the Claimant’s expert Mr. Tolkien that “the satisfaction of OTMTI’s obligation to pay
cash to Enel for additional shares in Weather Investments by causing a dividend
payment, which was due to OTMTI and would otherwise have been received by OTMTI,
to be made to Enel was a legitimate corporate practice”.°°? Thus, this amount, too,
constitutes a contribution made by the Claimant.

c. Third, the €1.025 billion cash payment made in June 2008 to acquire additional Weather
Investments shares from Enel also constitutes a contribution which resulted in a further
(indirect) shareholding in OTA. This transaction consisted in the repayment of a loan with
interest.5° Initially, Algeria’s objection was that it “was not in a position to know whether
the Claimant has wholly repaid these loans, nor the details of these potential
repayments”.5°5 The Claimant then clarified that it had immediately repaid the bridge
loans by tendering shares to the private equity investors that provided the bridge loans to

the Claimant.5°° Faced with this explanation, Algeria argued that these amounts were
not paid by the Claimant, but by third parties. To this argument, the Claimant has
convincingly replied that it “repaid the loan of €962 million with interest — totaling
€1.025 billion — using proceeds that it obtained from the sale of shares to other
investors”.5°’ The Tribunal thus considers this to be a contribution made by the Claimant
towards the acquisition of OTA.

d. Finally, the Tribunal is further satisfied that the Claimant paid €44.47 million in cash to
acquire additional Weather Investments shares from the so-called “Middle Eastern
investors”, thereby further increasing its indirect participation in OTA.5°° The method of
financing of this amount with which the Respondent takes issue, is not relevant for the
purposes of determining whether the Claimant made a contribution.

Accordingly, it is established that the Claimant made contributions exceeding at least
€1.5 billion towards its acquisition of an indirect interest in OTA via the purchase of shares of
Weather Investments. The requirement for the existence of a contribution as an element of an
investment under the ICSID Convention and the BIT is thus fulfilled.

The requirement of duration does not appear disputed by the Respondent, and rightly so, as
the Claimant held its indirect shareholding in OTA for almost six years. With regard to the
element of risk, the Tribunal is equally satisfied that by acquiring and holding an indirect stake
in OTA the Claimant bore the risk inherent in holding shares, namely the risk that the value of
the shares may decline.

As a consequence, the three requirements for the existence of an investment, i.e. contribution,
duration, and risk, are all met. In other words, the Claimant made a number of successive
investments within the meaning of the ICSID Convention and the BIT.

Having reached this conclusion, there is no need to determine whether the following other
transactions also constitute an investment: (i) the Claimant’s initial acquisition of its indirect
shareholding in OTA in August 2005 through a share-to-share exchange between the
Claimant and Weather Investments; (ii) the Claimant's alleged contribution of US$ 1.2 billion
through “reinvested OTA earnings”; (iii) the €2.48 million alleged contributions from the
Claimant to Weather Investments between 2006 and 2010, in exchange for Weather
Investments’ financial assistance to the Weather Group companies; (iv) the Claimant's alleged
contribution in services to OTA through Weather Investments and OTSE; and (v) the
Claimant's alleged contribution in personnel and know-how to OTA. Similarly, it is not
determinative of jurisdiction whether the assets and rights of OTA qualify as investments of the
Claimant. Whatever the determination on these other alleged investments, it would not change

the conclusion that the Claimant made investments in Algeria that fall under the protection of
the BIT and the ICSID Convention.

The Respondent has raised a number of other objections in relation to the alleged lack of an
investment. First, Algeria appears to argue that the Claimant must have purchased shares
directly in Algeria for them to fall within the BIT’s definition of “investment”. The Tribunal
cannot follow this argument, which is not supported by the text of the BIT. What is required is
that the “investment” be located in the territory of Algeria — which is undoubtedly the case with
respect to OTA, the local company “constituted on the territory of one of the Contracting
Parties”. In fact, as was observed by the tribunal in Gold Reserve, requiring a flow of funds
directly into the host state would preclude a foreign investor from purchasing an existing
investment from another foreign investor, because the purchase price would necessarily be
paid to the foreign seller of the investment.5° In response to a question from the Tribunal at
the Hearing, the Respondent gave the following answer:

[If a buyer] buys from [a seller] a French company that has a subsidiary in
Algeria, the operation takes place in France; [the buyer] enters Algeria
because it buys from [the seller] a participation. Now, | don’t deny that it is
an investment in Algeria. [...]

The Tribunal has difficulty understanding why, in the Respondent's example, a third-party
purchaser of shares of a company that operates in the host state would make an investment in

the host state, but a related company purchasing the same shares through a corporate
restructuring would not.®'°

Second, the Respondent submits that the BIT excludes from its protection the “simple holding
of an indirect share”. Again, the Tribunal cannot agree. No “active” involvement is required
under the BIT, which protects both “minority or indirect” shareholding. Nor is there such a
requirement under the ICSID Convention. As noted by the tribunal in Phoenix,

Shares or other participation in the capital of a company are usually
considered as an investment. The Tribunal cannot accept the
Respondent's contention that “mere ownership of shares does not
automatically qualify as an “investment” under Article 25(1) of the ICSID
Convention.” [...] ICSID tribunals have not endorsed a distinction between
full owners and majority or even minority shareholders, or direct or indirect
control in the investment treaty, who necessarily play a less than decisive
role in corporate governance.*"'

509 Gold Reserve, Exh. CLA-276, paras. 261-262 (“According to the ordinary meaning of the words, ‘making an
investment in the territory of Venezuela’ does not require that there must be a movement of capital or other values
across Venezuelan borders. If such a condition were inferred it would mean that an existing investment in
Venezuela, owned or controlled by a non-Venezuelan entity, would not be protected by the BIT if it were acquired
by a third party, with cash or other consideration being paid outside Venezuela, even if the acquiring party then
invested funds into Venezuela to finance the activity of the acquired business. Clearly, this was not the intention
of the parties to the BIT and nor does it reflect the ordinary meaning of the definition”).

In conclusion, the Claimant's indirect shareholding in OTA constitutes an investment pursuant
to Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.

JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY OBJECTIONS IN RELATION TO THE CLAIMANT'S STATUS OF
INDIRECT SHAREHOLDER, THE OTH ARBITRATION AND SETTLEMENT, AND THE SALE OF THE
CLAIMANT’S INVESTMENT

The Respondent has raised a number of objections in relation to the Claimant's (former) status
as indirect investor and the parallel arbitral proceedings started by OTH. The characterization
of these objections in terms of jurisdiction or admissibility has somewhat changed in the
course of the proceedings. In sum, the Respondent maintains that the Tribunal has no
jurisdiction or that the claims should be declared inadmissible on the following grounds: First,
the Claimant is or was a “very indirect” shareholder which is “too far removed” from the
investment affected by the Respondent's measures (1); Second the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction

 

or the claims are inadmissible as a result of the concurrent proceedings launched by OTH
which resulted in a settlement between the parties to those proceedings (2); Third, the
Claimant sold its investment before filing the Request for Arbitration and has thus lost or
waived its right to bring arbitration proceedings against Algeria, which either deprives the
Tribunal of jurisdiction or entails the inadmissibility of the claims (3). The Tribunal will first set
out the Parties’ positions on all of these issues (1-3), and then proceed with its analysis (4).

Does the Respondent’s consent extend to “very indirect” shareholders that are “too far
removed” from the investment affected by the Respondent’s measures?

a. The Respondent’s position

The Respondent contends that the Claimant is (or was) an indirect shareholder in OTA “too far
removed” (trop éloigné) from the investment in OTA. It invokes the need to fix a “cut-off point”
in the corporate chain beyond which a tribunal lacks jurisdiction.

While the Respondent recognizes that past decisions have admitted claims by indirect
shareholders based on BITs in order to protect “the real party in interest’,®'? it points out that
arbitral tribunals and scholars have also insisted on the importance of limiting the number of
shareholders entitled to claim, especially taking into account the dangers associated with the
proliferation of arbitral proceedings based on the same facts commenced by different
shareholders.5'3

389. For the Respondent, a cut-off point is necessary in this case, as otherwise Algeria would be
exposed to the serious risk of multiple proceedings initiated by other shareholders invoking
their indirect shareholding in OTA and challenging the same measures.®"* In particular, Algeria
argues that (i) there was a large number of corporate entities between OTH and the Claimant;
(ii) between 2008-2011, around 20 investors held shares in Weather Investments; (iii) at about
the same time, around half of the share capital of OTH was traded on the Egyptian and
London stock exchanges, which could give rise to an unlimited number of transactions and
new shareholders.5'5

390. The Respondent submits that here, in addition to the OTH Arbitration which was brought
against Algeria and then settled, the risk of multiple proceedings arising out of the same facts,
with the ensuing possibility of conflicting outcomes and multiple recoveries, is aggravated by
the fact that Weather Investments has reserved its right to bring an arbitration against Algeria
by filing a notice of dispute under the Italy-Algeria BIT,5'® and OTA itself has reserved its rights
under the Investment Agreement, which provides for ICSID arbitration.°'”

391. Algeria continues observing that arbitral tribunals have recognized that the state’s consent to
arbitration does not extend to “very indirect” (trés indirects) shareholders which are too far
removed from the investment allegedly affected by the state’s measures.5'® To determine
whether a state’s consent extends to very indirect shareholders, a tribunal should consider a
number of factors, such as (i) whether the claimant was invited by the host state to participate
in the investment; (ii) whether the claimant controls the company which is the subject of the
investment; and (iii) in the case of a chain of companies, whether such chain was specifically
created for purposes of the investment.5!9

392. For Algeria, its consent to arbitrate does not extend to the Claimant for the following

reasons:520

a. The Claimant was created in 2005, i.e. after the investment was made in Algeria, and

b. The Claimant has not taken part in the negotiation and conclusion of the Investment
Agreement in 2001 between Algeria, OTH and Oratel (acting on behalf of OTA);

c. The corporate chain was constituted in 2005 in the context of the Wind acquisition, and
the “raison d’étre” of such transaction was to take over Wind, not to invest in Algeria;

d. At the end of 2008, when the challenged measures began, there were no less than 8
companies, on 5 different levels, inserted in the corporate chain between the Claimant
and OTA. Such a “remoteness” or distance (éloignement) between a claimant-indirect
shareholder and the locally incorporated company, which is the subject of the investment
as well as of the contested measures, has never been considered by any ICSID tribunal
to date;

e. The Claimant has not established that it was exercising effective control over OTA.

Moreover, the Respondent rebuts the Claimant's argument that the measures directly targeted
the Claimant. The only document which the Claimant addressed to Algeria between 2005 and
2010 is a letter dated 4 October 2010, in which the representatives of the Claimant and
VimpelCom informed the Algerian Prime Minister of the execution of the merger agreement
between the two companies.5*' Had the Claimant believed that the measures adopted
between 2008 and 2010 targeted OTMTI, it would have objected to such measures at the
relevant time, as was done by OTA, OTH and Weather Investments, but not by the
Claimant.522

b. The Claimant’s position

The Claimant submits that the Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione materiae, as Algeria consented
to arbitrate all disputes concerning the Claimant's investment.®°

According to the Claimant, Algeria is bound by the consent to arbitrate that it gave in the BIT,
which expressly extends to “minority or indirect” investors.5** The BIT defines “investments” to
include “[s]hares, holdings and any other forms of participation, even minority or indirect, in the
companies constituted on the territory of one of the Contracting Parties”.5*> Algeria offered to
arbitrate “[a]ny dispute relating to investments between a Contracting Party and an investor of
the other Contracting Party’5?° and OTMTI accepted this offer by filing its Request for
Arbitration. 5?”

The Claimant points to Société Générale v. Dominican Republic, where the claimant was six
corporate layers and seven different companies removed from the investment and the tribunal
nonetheless accepted jurisdiction based on the BIT’s broad definition of “investment”.5@° That
tribunal stated that the BIT’s inclusion of “minority or indirect” interests “necessarily implie[d]
that there may be one or several layers of intermediate companies or interests intervening
between the claimant and the investment”.5@° The Claimant underscores that there were five
corporate levels between OTMTI and OTA (two of which included wholly-owned subsidiaries);
that OTMTI indirectly owned shares in OTA; and actually controlled OTA.5°° The Claimant also
cites to other cases,**' including Mobil, where the tribunal upheld jurisdiction over an indirect
investment, holding that the BIT — which unlike the Treaty at issue here did not expressly
cover “indirect investments” — did not require that no companies be interposed between the
ultimate owner of the company and the investment.592

According to the Claimant, no tribunal has ever denied an indirect shareholder's claims based
on an asserted “cut-off point”, when the language of the treaty expressly covered indirect
investments.5%° The Claimant criticizes the Respondent's reliance on the obiter dictum in
Enron (stating that a “cut-off point” may be needed for an investor only “remotely connected”
to the investment). That dictum lacks legal foundation and the tribunal's statement that an
invitation by the state to participate in the investment can somehow create or reinforce privity
runs contrary to basic investment treaty principles.°* The Claimant also argues that the
criteria suggested by Algeria to determine a cut-off point®5 are not supported by legal
authority.59°

In any event, even if the Tribunal were to accept the theoretical possibility of a cut-off point
and the criteria proposed by Algeria, this would not bar jurisdiction here for the following

reasons:

a. OTMTI was the controlling shareholder of OTA holding a substantial 36% interest;5°”

Algeria invited OTMTI’s shareholders (the Sawiris family) to invest in Algeria without any
limits on corporate organization; if a company’s shareholders are not too remote to bring
aclaim, the company itself cannot be too remote either;538

The Respondent was aware that OTMTI owned and controlled OTA;599

Algeria dealt with Mr. Sawiris in connection with OTA in his capacity as Chairman of
Weather Investments and Chairman of OTH, positions he held as a result of OTMTI's
ownership of those entities;54°

Algeria did not object that U.S. private equity investors, who were equally removed from
OTA, were too remote to have their concerns addressed;54! and

It was Algeria's measures that compelled OTMTI to bring this claim rather than an entity
closer to OTA in the corporate chain.°4? In particular, it is because of the enactment of
the Supplementary Finance Act of 2009 and the Finance Law of 2010, and because of
the threats to expropriate OTA if its indirect ownership changed without Algeria’s express
consent, that OTMTI is the Claimant in this arbitration;54?

With regard to the Respondent’s argument that each of OTH, Weather Investments and
the Claimant would be permitted to bring a BIT claim under the Egypt-Algeria, Italy-
Algeria and BLEU-Algeria BITs respectively, but that they could not raise claims
simultaneously, the Claimant opposes that it had no control over OTH'’s initiation or
settlement of the OTH Arbitration, because OTH was no longer part of the Weather
Group of companies when it raised these claims.54+

Finally, the Claimant contends that it is unwarranted to apply an entirely new rule providing for
a cut-off point based on alleged policy concerns, i.e., the need to avoid multiple proceedings
arising out of the same facts.5*5 Algeria accepted the possibility of multiple arbitrations deriving
from the same facts by consenting to arbitration with minority or indirect investors.54 Algeria
did not include any limitations in the BIT to alleviate its purported policy concerns, such as a
limitation of consent to shareholders with a controlling interest, or direct shareholders, or
investors with which it signed investment agreements, or a denial-of-benefit clause.”

Furthermore, even a threat of multiple proceedings would not result in double recovery. If the
harm to different claimants is distinct, there is no risk of double recovery. If the harm is not

distinct, tribunals have tools at their disposal to guard against double recovery.54® Here, the
Claimant contends that its harm is distinct from the harm allegedly suffered by any other party
that has started arbitration against Algeria. Algeria's unlawful measures caused OTMTI to sell
its interest in OTA for a price far below the one which it would have obtained without these
measures. This harm is specific to OTMTI; no other party bringing claims against Algeria could
recover compensation for this damage.**° In any event, the mere possibility of double recovery
is not a ground for denying jurisdiction.5°°

401. Finally, there is no risk of double recovery in this instance, so says the Claimant, because it
did not benefit from the settlement with Algeria and because FNI’s acquisition of an interest in
OTA did not provide money to the Claimant nor did it compensate the harm for which the
Claimant seeks reparation here.55'

2. Objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction or the admissibility of the claims in relation to
the OTH Arbitration and the Settlement Agreement

a. The Respondent’s position

402. The Respondent first argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction or should declare the claims
inadmissible because there is no dispute between the Claimant and Algeria within the
meaning of Article 9 of the BIT (i). It further claims that OTH’s exercise of the right to bring
arbitration proceedings against Algeria deprived the Claimant of standing to pursue its claims
against the Respondent (ii) and renders its claims inadmissible. Moreover, Mr. Sawiris used
his group of companies to seek to maximize his chances of success by introducing several
arbitrations against the Respondent at different levels of the chain of companies, which is a
further ground for the inadmissibility of the claims under the doctrine of abuse of rights (iii).
Finally, the Tribunal should further decline jurisdiction or declare the claims inadmissible as a
result of the Settlement Agreement, which has resolved the disputes opposing OTA and OTH
to Algeria (iv).

i. There is no dispute between the Claimant and the Respondent under
Article 9 of the BIT

First, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over this dispute, which does
not fall within the type of disputes covered by Article 9 of the BIT.5°* The Respondent relies on
the definition of “dispute” in Mavrommatis — a “disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict
of legal views or interests between two persons”5? — and submits that a dispute requires a
certain level of communication between the investor and the state leading to a
disagreement.®°* Furthermore, for the Respondent, “the subject matter of the negotiations
should be the same as the dispute that is brought before” the tribunal.55>

The Respondent's position is that the dispute which the Claimant submitted to arbitration on
19 October 2012 is not a “dispute” between OTMTI and the Algerian state pursuant to Article 9
of the BIT,55° which reads as follows:

1. Any dispute relating to investments between a contracting party and an
investor of the other contracting party shall be the subject of a written
notification from the most diligent party.

As far as is possible, such a dispute shall be settled amicably between the
parties to the dispute.

2. Should there be no amicable settlement by direct arrangement between
the parties to the dispute or through conciliation by diplomatic means
during the six (6) months from the notification thereof, the dispute shall be
subject, at the request of one or other of the parties to the dispute, to
arbitration by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes (ICSID)

 

The Respondent advances various reasons in support of its argumentation. It contends that at
the time of the Request for Arbitration there was no dispute between the Parties about the
measures adopted between 2008 and 2010 in connection with OTA:

a. Between 2008 and 2010, the Claimant never criticized the measures adopted by Algeria
vis-a-vis OTA, nor did it make any reservation of rights in this respect;55”

b.

It is undisputed that there was no communication between the Parties before 20125°
(except for the Claimant's letter of 4 October 2010 advising Algeria of the merger of
OTMTI and VimpelCom);55°

OTA’s situation was not mentioned in any of the meetings of the Claimant's corporate
organs or in any of its annual reports;5®°

While Mr. Sawiris objected several times to Algeria's measures in his function as
representative of OTA and OTH,**' the minutes of the corporate organs of OTMTI evince
that the issue of OTA and OTH was raised for the first time at the meeting of the Board
of Managers of 18 October 2012 at 11 pm, i.e. on the eve of the filing of the Request for
Arbitration. At this meeting, Mr. Sawiris then asked the Board to ratify his decision to
commence arbitration proceedings against Algeria.56?

 

Second, the Respondent submits that there is no dispute between the Parties to this

arbitration in relation to the sale by OTMTI of its shareholding in Weather Investments to

VimpelCom:

a.

When the transaction closed, OTMTI expressed no reservations on the transaction and
did not assert that Algeria’s measures had caused it damage. To the contrary, Mr.
Sawiris repeatedly stated his satisfaction about the sale in the media;5°

At the time of the closing, OTMTI represented that there was no “action taken or to be
taken by Weather | or such Weather II Shareholder in connection with, or which seeks to
enjoin or obtain monetary damages in respect of, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby”;5&

There is no mention in the Notice of Dispute of 16 April 2012 of the sale to VimpelCom,
whereas in this arbitration the Claimant submits that “the core of [the] Claimant's case”
centers around the damage it suffered through Algeria’s measures which forced it to sell
its interest in OTA to VimpelCom.5® Thus, the alleged dispute which Mr. Sawiris notified
on 16 April 2012 on behalf of Weather II is not the one which gives rise to the claims
brought in this arbitration;5©>

d. Therefore, absent notification of a “dispute” arising from the sale of Weather Investments
to VimpelCom at a reduced price, the Parties could not attempt to reach an amicable
resolution of this “dispute” in accordance with Article 9(1) of the BIT.5°”

Third, the Respondent submits that, in the absence of any dispute between OTMTI and

Algeria, Mr. Sawiris decided to take over for himself and the Claimant (“a décidé de reprendre

a son compte (et pour le compte de Weather II)”) the disputes between OTA (and OTH) and
Algeria:

a. In his 16 April 2012 Notice of Dispute, Mr. Sawaris characterized his dispute with Algeria

“by reference” to the letters that OTA, OTH and Weather Investments had sent at the

time to the Algerian state, which referred to the measures impugned by these entities;5®

b. In its Request for Arbitration, OTMTI simply adopted the content of OTH’s Notice of
Arbitration in the OTH Arbitration. Similarly, the Claimant's Memorial presents several
similarities with OTH’s Statement of Claim in that arbitration.

Fourth, Mr. Sawiris has in reality introduced this arbitration on his own initiative and for

 

personal reasons, in order to avenge himself of Algeria and to claim damages which he

asserts to have suffered:

a. The examination of the minutes of the Claimant's Board of Managers and shareholders
meetings confirm that Mr. Sawiris did not consult the corporate organs about the filing of
the Notice of Dispute and that he communicated to the Board of Managers his decision
to file for arbitration mere hours before the filing;5”°

b. Mr. Sawiris has expressed his resentment against Algeria in the media; he blames the
state for having “broken his dream”. The personal character of this arbitration is further
confirmed by the claim for moral damage.*”"

Accordingly, continues the Respondent, the conditions of Article 9 of the BIT are not fulfilled.
Mr. Sawiris has not notified a dispute between the Claimant and Algeria5’? and the dispute
which he submits on behalf of OTMTI is not a “dispute [...] between a Contracting Party and
an investor of the other Contracting Party”.§”>

In conclusion, for the Respondent, the absence of a dispute between the Parties to this
arbitration on the day of the Notice of Dispute on 16 April 2012 deprives the Tribunal of
jurisdiction over the dispute subsequently raised in the Claimant's memorials.5” By contrast, if
the Tribunal were to consider that a dispute between the Parties existed then but that it was

not notified in accordance with Article 9(1) of the BIT, the claims arising from this dispute

would be inadmissible. 55

ii. OTH’s exercise of the right to start arbitration against Algeria deprived
the Claimant of standing to sue the Respondent

The Respondent contends that the Claimant's claims are inadmissible because the Claimant
lost standing to bring arbitration proceedings (intérét pour agir) against the Respondent, when
Mr. Sawiris decided to exercise OTH's right to arbitrate (droit d’agir) by submitting a Notice of
Dispute under the Egypt-Algeria BIT on 2 November 2010.576

From 2005 until 2011, when Weather Investments was sold to VimpelCom, so says the
Respondent, the Claimant and its subsidiaries formed a vertically integrated group of
companies (une chaine de sociétés verticalement intégrée), in which the Claimant held an
indirect controlling shareholding in OTA through a number of companies including Weather
Investments and OTH. The Claimant, in turn, was owned by the Sawiris Entities, whose
shareholders were certain trusts established for the benefit of Mr. Sawiris and his family.577
The Respondent contends that as the subsidiaries in the group, including Weather
Investments and OTH, were answerable to and controlled by OTMTI, the decisions taken by
the former must be opposable to the latter.578

The Respondent further argues that in 2005 each of the companies interposed between the
Sawiris Entities and OTA held a theoretical claim vis-a-vis Algeria, on different legal bases: (i)
OTA on the basis of the Investment Agreement; (ii) OTH on the basis of the Egypt-Algeria BIT;
(iii) Weather Investments on the basis of the Italy-Algeria BIT; and (iv) the Claimant on the
basis of the BLEU-Algeria BIT.5”°

According to the Respondent, Mr. Sawiris chose to crystallize the dispute between OTA and
Algeria at the level of OTA’s direct shareholder, namely OTH.58° From 2009 on, OTH started
challenging the legality and effect of the measures adopted vis-a-vis OTA with the Algerian
authorities. In particular on 2 November 2010, it notified the existence of a dispute on the
basis of the Egypt-Algeria BIT.5*' Subsequently, on 8 November 2010, Mr. Sawiris, this time
representing Weather Investments, notified the existence of a dispute under the Italy-Algeria

BIT.5®2 And finally, on 16 April 2012, Mr. Sawiris, acting as the Chairman of the Claimant,
notified the existence of a dispute under the BLEU-Algeria BIT.5®* Through these three
notices, Mr. Sawiris contested the legality and effect of the same measures in the name and

on behalf of three group companies.®8*

Mr. Sawiris’ choice to crystallize the dispute between OTA and Algeria at the level of OTH by
way of the first Notice of Dispute had the automatic effect (a eu mécaniquement pour effet), so
argues Algeria, that any other company in the chain, including the Claimant, lost standing to
sue (intérét pour agir) the Algerian state.5®° For the Respondent, the Claimant's argument that
OTH's Notice of Dispute has “no legal significance” and that it is OTH’s notice of 12 April 2012
that matters is ill-founded. In investment treaty arbitration, the notification of the existence of a
dispute constitutes the point of departure of any claim for damages grounded on a BIT.58°

The Respondent also argues that Mr. Sawiris’ choice to crystallize the dispute at the level of
OTH allowed the Claimant to be made whole (a permis a la Demanderesse d’étre remplie de
ses droits).5®” In the OTH Arbitration, OTH claimed that its damage corresponded to the loss
of value of its participation in OTA (/a perte de valeur totale de sa participation dans la société
OTA) caused by the measures adopted by the Algerian authorities. When Mr. Sawiris
exercised OTH's right to file a claim (droit d’agir) under the Egypt-Algeria BIT, he substituted in
OTH's assets the loss of value of the OTA shares with a claim for damages. Such claim
sought reparation for the diminution in value of OTH’s assets due to the loss in value of its
shares in OTA from the tribunal under the Egypt-Algeria BIT.5®° Hence, to the extent the direct
shareholder OTH was made whole by exercising its right to arbitration under the Egypt-Algeria
BIT, all companies placed in the chain between OTH and the Sawiris Entities, including the
Claimant, have been made whole, unless they incurred harm specific to their entity (en
labsence de préjudice propre).*®9

iii. Mr. Sawiris’ conduct in the name and on behalf of the Claimant
constitutes an abuse of rights
The Respondent further asserts that the claims must be dismissed under the doctrine of abuse
of rights.5°° Mr. Sawiris has sought to maximize his chances of success by introducing several
arbitrations against the Respondent at different levels of the chain of companies. In doing so,

he has abused the protection offered by Algeria to foreign investors.5°' This is particularly
unfair towards Algeria, as the claimants in the various proceedings need to succeed only once
for the alleged harm to be remedied. 5°

The Respondent claims that, when it entered into BITs with Belgium/Luxembourg, Italy and
Egypt, it did not intend to protect under different treaties shareholders who belonged to the

same group and disputed the same measures.®°°

For the Respondent, the Claimant’s argument that a state should be held to its offer to
arbitrate in any circumstance and whatever the investor's conduct, is contrary to case law
applying the doctrine of abuse of rights.5°* Here, the doctrine allows to limit the right of multiple
shareholders in the same chain to bring arbitrations in order to avoid the proliferation of
proceedings arising out of the same facts.5°

iv. The Tribunal should decline jurisdiction or declare the claims
inadmissible as a result of the Settlement Agreement between OTA, OTH and
Algeria
It is the Respondent's further argument that the Tribunal may not rule on a dispute which
ceased to exist because the parties to this dispute have settled it.

More specifically, on 18 April 2014, VimpelCom, OTH and the Algerian Fonds National
d'Investissement (the “FNI”) concluded a Share Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”), according
to which OTH (now GTH) sold a 51% stake in OTA to the FNI for a price of US$ 2.643
billion.5°° On the same day, OTH and Algeria suspended the OTH Arbitration in the wake of
the closing of the share purchase pursuant to Article 7.4(a) of the SPA.59”

In the following months, difficulties arose between the parties to the OTH Arbitration,59° which
culminated in OTH resuming the OTH Arbitration on 19 December 2014.59 Further
negotiations followed, leading to the closing of the share purchase between 28 and 30
January 2015.6° On 31 January 2015, the PCA Secretariat forwarded the parties’
“Renunciation Letter” to the PCA tribunal.®' In the Renunciation Letter, the parties to the OTH

Arbitration informed the tribunal that they had “finally settled their dispute”. The parties
requested the PCA tribunal to record the following terms in a consent award:

(1) all claims that have been raised in the Arbitration by GTH, on the one
hand, and the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, on the other
hand, have been finally settled;

(2) GTH, on the one hand, and the People's Democratic Republic of
Algeria, on the other hand, waive definitively and irrevocably all claims
that have been brought in the Arbitration and/or that could have been
brought in the Arbitration as at the date of signing of the share
purchase agreement (i.e., 18 April 2014) entered into between the
Fonds National d'Investissement, GTH and VimpelCom Ltd. (the
"SPA") with respect to facts that formed the basis of the claims raised
in the Arbitration, and further waive those claims that could have been
brought in the Arbitration as at the date of signing of the SPA on the
basis of the allegations of fact relating to the 3G license included in the
parties' written submissions in the Arbitration;

(3) This amicable settlement is concluded with no admission of guilt or
liability with respect to the claims that are waived by GTH and the
People's Democratic Republic of Algeria. [...]®°
423. On 12 March 2015, the PCA tribunal issued a consent award recording the settlement
agreement just quoted, which put an end to the OTH Arbitration.®* In accordance with Article
7.4(c) and (d) of the SPA, OTA has also put an end to its disputes vis-a-vis the Algerian public
administrations. °°5

424. In the Respondent's view, to allow a very indirect minority shareholder (or a former
shareholder) of OTA to request an arbitral tribunal to rule on a dispute involving the legality of
certain measures, which OTA and its parent company have decided to not further pursue,
would circumvent a direct arrangement between the parties to the dispute and run counter to
the BIT Contracting Parties’ intention.®° If such a course were admitted, a respondent state
would never settle a dispute amicably as it would always face the risk that other shareholders
circumvent the amicable settlement and bring proceedings over the (settled) dispute.”

ceased to exist.°® Algeria points to Azpetro! v. Azerbaijan, where the tribunal declined

jurisdiction after the parties had settled their dispute. Citing further to SAUR v. Argentina,
the Respondent maintains that a settlement agreement does affect the rights of the
shareholder controlling the subsidiary which entered into the settlement.®1°

The Respondent recognizes that, in this case, Mr. Sawiris sold OTMTI's shares in Weather
Investments to VimpelCom before the conclusion of the settlement agreement. However, it
insists that it was for OTMTI to negotiate a better deal with VimpelCom then. It cannot
complain now on the basis of the consideration received by OTA and OTH under the SPA."

Alternatively, the Respondent submits that the Settlement Agreement between OTA, OTH and
Algeria may be opposed to the Claimant, which renders the claims inadmissible.*'? Algeria
contends that the claims of the indirect shareholder (the Claimant) are identical to those of the
direct shareholder (OTH).®'? For the Respondent, both sets of claims are based on the same
measures®"* and the Claimant has raised the same claims as those originally brought by OTH
in the OTH Arbitration.6'5 More specifically, the Claimant's claims relating to the loss in value
of its indirect shareholding in OTA are necessarily contained in OTH'’s claim in the OTH
Arbitration, where OTH sought damages based on the reduction in value of its shares in
OTA.*'® The same is true of the claims concerning the dividends raised in the two arbitrations.
Indeed, the Claimant held an indirect stake in OTA through OTH, and thus any dividend
distributed by OTA to OTH would have been distributed further up by OTH to the Claimant.®'”

There are still other types of claims in this arbitration, so says the Respondent, which cannot
be considered by this Tribunal. For example, the claims for consequential damages allegedly
incurred by the “Weather Group” as a result of the need to refinance OTH cannot be invoked
by the Claimant, as OTH and Weather Investments (not the Claimant) provided the funds for
refinancing.*"® And the alleged “moral damage” connected to a reputational damage is made
in consideration of Mr. Sawiris’ reputation (not the Claimant’s).°'°

As a result, it is clear for the Respondent that the claims in the two arbitrations are identical.
The claims of the direct shareholder were settled in conditions which do not render the
transaction dubious or otherwise subject to criticism. That settlement has put an end to all the

disputes with OTA and OTH.®° Indeed, the settlement was entered into by OTH in its own
name and on behalf of OTA, OTH being the “historical” controlling shareholder of OTA, to
which the GSM License was granted in 2001 and which negotiated and concluded the
Investment Agreement in 2001. Furthermore, it was OTH which in 2009-2010 objected to the
measures taken vis-a-vis OTA and which sent the first Notice of Dispute on 2 November
2010.81

For the Respondent, the Claimant cannot invoke its status of former indirect shareholder of
OTA and OTH to establish jurisdiction and engage the Respondent's liability for disputes
opposing OTA and OTH to Algeria and, at the same time, pretend that the settlement of these
disputes is not opposable precisely because of its status of former shareholder.®*? The
amicable settlement must thus be opposed to the Claimant, °° especially as the Claimant does
not deny that it held a direct minority interest in OTH at the time of the conclusion and closing
of the SPA.®4

From the Respondent's viewpoint, the settlement was intended to finally resolve the disputes
of OTA and OTH with Algeria, in such as fashion that no other forum could rule on the legality
of the measures adopted by the Algerian authorities vis-a-vis OTA and OTH.®5 To allow
(former) direct and indirect shareholders of OTH to bring arbitration proceedings arising from
the same facts and requiring thus to review the legality of Algeria’s measures would in practice
nullify the settlement agreement.®° This would expose Algeria to the concrete risk of multiple
proceedings, considering the number of companies in the Weather Group and the fact that
OTH was a listed company. ®7

By contrast, opposing the settlement agreement to the Claimant would be in line with scholarly
views seeking to transpose domestic law principles on the limitations to shareholder's claims
within investment law.®28 Investment jurisprudence allowing indirect shareholders to claim for
indirect damages resulting from measures taken by the host state against the local company is
subject to criticism.®*° Rather than following this line, an investment treaty tribunal should
adopt the approach chosen by the International Court of Justice and carefully examine the
rules of municipal legal systems on shareholders’ claims. The Respondent refers to scholarly
writings of Zachary Douglas and others. °°

In reliance on generally accepted domestic rules, the Respondent submits that only claims for
damages resulting from a violation by the host state of the rights tied to the quality of direct
shareholder or of the commitments towards the shareholder (but not the local company) are
admissible. By contrast, shareholders may not claim for damages suffered by the local
company, which is the subject of the investment.®' This is the case even if the direct or
indirect shareholder invokes the loss of value of its shares in the local company as a result of
the host state’s measures. 2

In this case, the Respondent notes that the Claimant invokes the loss resulting from the
diminution of value of its indirect shareholding in OTA as a result of Algeria's allegedly
wrongful measures against OTA. However, the Respondent observes, only OTA could bring
claims for damages based on the loss of value of its assets (sur la perte de valeur de son

patrimoine), which claims it has settled. °°

Furthermore, the Respondent refutes the Claimant's submission that Algeria’s measures
damaged its right to receive dividends from 2009 to 2011. For the Respondent, that right only
belongs to OTA’s direct shareholders, such as OTH. Indirect shareholder have no entitlement
for these dividends; otherwise Algeria would be required to compensate twice both the direct
and indirect shareholders for the same damage.®* In this respect, the Respondent notes that
the Settlement Agreement provides as a condition precedent that OTA must effect a
distribution of its dividends to its direct shareholders, including OTH. Consequently, the claims

in this respect must be declared inadmissible. °°

b. The Claimant’s position

The Claimant submits that a dispute has existed between the Parties at all times since the
Claimant notified the Respondent on 16 April 2012 (i). Further, OTH’s commencement of
separate arbitration proceedings against the Respondent is irrelevant to the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction or the admissibility of the claims in this arbitration, and the Respondent's invocation
of the doctrine of abuse of rights is ill-founded (ii). Finally, the subsequent settlement of the
OTH Arbitration is equally without pertinence to this tribunal's jurisdiction and to the
admissibility of the claims before it (iii).

i. There is a dispute between the Claimant and the Respondent under
Article 9 of the BIT

For the Claimant, a dispute has existed between the Parties at all times since the Claimant's
notification on 16 April 2012.66

It is the Claimant’s submission that the standard for the existence of a dispute, which is set out
in Mavrommatis as well as in other ICJ and investment treaty cases, is met here. In particular,
on 16 April 2012, the Claimant put Algeria on notice that there was an investment dispute
between them under Article 9 of the BIT, arising out of a series of unlawful measures that the
Respondent took against the Claimant's investment in OTA from 2008 on.®7

The Claimant further alleges that it sent numerous additional letters to the Respondent during
the following six months, repeatedly underscoring its readiness to seek a settlement.®® On 20
September 2012, representatives for the Claimant and the Respondent met in Paris in an
attempt to resolve the dispute amicably. By 17 October 2012, six months had elapsed since
the Notice of Dispute of 16 April 2012 without an amicable solution being reached, and the
Claimant filed its Request for Arbitration on 19 October 2012.®?° For the Claimant, it is clear
that in correspondence and at the meeting of 20 September 2012, the Claimant specifically
notified the Respondent of the existence of a dispute.®°

The Claimant also stresses that the Notice of Dispute of 16 April 2012 was signed by Mr.
Sawiris in his capacity as Chairman of Weather II.°*' The Respondent's assertion that there is
no correspondence between the Parties to this arbitration prior to 2012 is unavailing, as the
existence of a dispute does not presuppose correspondence between the parties regarding
the state’s unlawful measures before the investor notifies the state of the dispute.

Addressing the Respondent's argument that the Claimant did not refer to the sale of Weather
Investments to VimpelCom in its Notice of Dispute, the Claimant draws attention to the
statement in the Notice of Dispute that Algeria's unlawful measures included “the interference
in, and thwarting of, the sale of OTH to the MTN Group in 2010 through inter alia, the
enactment of the 2009 Supplemental Finance Act”.*? The Claimant's significant losses then
crystallized with the below-market sale of Weather Investments to VimpelCom. 4

In any event, in its Request for Arbitration, so argues the Claimant, it specifically notified the
Respondent that “in light of the devastating financial impact of the Measures on OTA and its
stakeholders, [the Claimant] had no choice but to sell [...] a percentage of its indirect
shareholding in OTA to third parties, at a distressed price”.°*5 Investment treaty tribunals have
confirmed that a request for arbitration which sets forth the facts and legal arguments on which
the Claimant relies with respect to the parties’ rights and obligations under the applicable
treaty is sufficient to establish the existence of a dispute.®*°

Finally, according to the Claimant, the Respondent's objection that the dispute notified by Mr.
Sawiris (on behalf of OTMTI) on 16 April 2012 and the one before this Tribunal are not the
same® is both untimely, as it was raised by the Respondent for the very first time in its Post-
Hearing Brief, and devoid of merit. Investment tribunals have held that an investor is not
required to spell out its case in detail in the notice of dispute. It is sufficient for the notice to
inform the host state of a dispute which engages the state’s international responsibility under
the applicable treaty.°9 Tribunals have declined jurisdiction over claims only in the rare
circumstance where those claims were clearly separate and distinct from the matters raised in
the notice of dispute.®°° In this case, so argues the Claimant, it has not raised any new claim.
In its Request for Arbitration and Memorial on the Merits, it has merely explained the effect of
the unlawful measures described in the Notice of Dispute, which, it argues, crystallized in
losses of billions of dollars when the Claimant sold Weather Investments to VimpelCom.®!

ii, OTH’s of arbitration p i is irrelevant
to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction or the admissibility of the claims

 

 

The Claimant submits that OTH’s commencement of separate arbitration proceedings against
the Respondent is irrelevant to jurisdiction and admissibility in this arbitration.

First, it is the Claimant’s argument that OTH’s Notice of Dispute of 2 November 2010 has no
legal significance other than to fulfil the procedural requirements under the Algeria-Egypt
BIT.®©2 At the time when OTH commenced the OTH Arbitration on 12 April 2012, the Claimant
had sold its indirect controlling shareholding in OTH to VimpelCom, on whose board it never
had a seat. Hence, neither the Claimant nor Mr. Sawiris were involved in OTH's decision to
initiate the OTH Arbitration. 4

Further, the terms of the Respondent's consent as set forth in the BIT establish the scope of a
tribunal's jurisdiction. Here, according to the BIT, the Respondent's consent expressly extends
to any dispute with a Luxembourgish investor relating to that investor's minority or indirect
shareholding in an Algerian company.®> The Claimant contends that following the Claimant's
establishment of the vertically integrated Weather Group in 2005, every entity in the chain had
standing to submit claims against the Respondent arising out of the measures which the
Respondent took starting in 2008.%°

In the Claimant's view, where two entities in the same corporate chain bring parallel claims
against the host state relating to the same measures, the only issue is the risk of double
payment or recovery, which is not a bar to jurisdiction or admissibility.°°” The Respondent's
contrary assertion that the commencement of the OTH Arbitration deprived the remaining
affiliates in the Weather Group of standing to bring arbitration proceedings against the
Respondent is unsupported by legal authority. To the contrary, investment tribunals confirm
that indirect shareholders have standing to start arbitration against the host state, even if other
entities in the same corporate chain have commenced separate proceedings relating to the
same unlawful measures.

In the absence of limitations in the BIT restricting an indirect investor's right to pursue
arbitration against the host state, the commencement of the OTH Arbitration lacks any
relevance for purposes of jurisdiction and admissibility in the present proceedings. ©°

Finally, the Claimant challenges the Respondent's reliance on the doctrine of abuse of rights.
For the Claimant, this doctrine applies to situations where a company was incorporated after
the dispute arose and similar circumstances. Here, the Claimant was incorporated and
acquired its indirect controlling shareholding in OTA in 2005 — approximately three years
before the Respondent’s unlawful measures. Hence, there is no basis to argue that the
exercise of the Claimant’s right under the BIT to start arbitration constitutes an abuse of
rights.

Moreover, even assuming arguendo that the doctrine of abuse of rights could apply in the
context of parallel proceedings relating to the same unlawful measures, investment treaty
tribunals have repeatedly held that there must be extraordinary circumstances to justify a
denial of treaty rights under such doctrine.®*' Where two claimants with related economic
interests are not under common control, their insistence on conducting separate proceedings

cannot per se constitute an abuse of process.®® In this case, the Claimant and OTH were not
in a position to assert their respective claims against the Respondent in the same
proceedings, because the Claimant did not own or control OTH when OTH commenced
arbitration against the Respondent.® Indeed, so the Claimant argues, it could not bring its
claims lower in the chain, much less at the OTH level, because it had to sell the entire
Weather Group as a result of the Respondent's unlawful measures.®+

 

iii. The Settlement of the OTH Arbitration is irrelevant to jurisdiction and

admissibility
451. The Claimant contends that the settlement of the OTH Arbitration does not dispose of its
claims in this arbitration.

452. First, the Claimant contends that no action taken by either Party after the Request for
Arbitration can deprive this Tribunal of jurisdiction or render the claim inadmissible. Citing to
Vivendi Il v. Argentina, CSOB v. Slovak Republic as well as ICJ decisions, it maintains that
jurisdiction must be determined by reference to the date on which judicial proceedings are
instituted and that events taking place after that date do not affect a tribunal's jurisdiction. °°
Thus, any action by Algeria subsequent to the Claimant's Request for Arbitration of 12
October 2012 cannot deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction over the present claims or render
those claims inadmissible.°°”

453. Second, the Claimant submits that it is a non-party and non-privy to the SPA and is therefore
not bound by such agreement or the settlement of the OTH Arbitration.®® The fact that
separate legal entities not owned or controlled by the Claimant have settled their dispute with
Algeria by entering into an agreement with an investment fund owned and controlled by the

Claimant's claims and, consequently, would have no effect on the Tribunal’s jurisdiction or on
the inadmissibility of OTMTI’s claims.

Indeed, in the Claimant's opinion, the three conditions for res judicata, i.e. identity of parties,
identity of subject matter or relief sought, and identity of legal grounds or causes of actions,
are not satisfied. There is no identity of parties, as the Claimant is not a party to either the
OTH Arbitration or the Settlement Agreement, and Algeria is not a party to the Settlement
Agreement. There is no identity in the relief sought, as the relief sought in the PCA Arbitration
was in excess of US$ 16 billion, whereas approximately US$ 4 billion is sought by OTMTI in
this arbitration. Moreover, OTMTI seeks relief for losses that are unique to itself, i.e. the loss it
suffered from having to sell its shares in OTA (via a sale of Weather Investments) at a
depressed price due to Algeria's measures and the consequential losses it incurred as a result
of having to refinance due to Algeria's measures. Finally, there is no identity of causes of
action, as the OTH Arbitration involves a dispute under the Egypt-Algeria BIT, while this
arbitration arises under the BLEU-Algeria BIT.°7°

For the Claimant, the Respondent's invocation of Azpetrol v. Azerbaijan is inapposite, because
in that case the parties to the arbitration entered into settlement negotiations. In that context,
the tribunal reviewed the communications between the parties following the adjournment of
the proceedings, and found that the respondent had made an offer of settlement which was
“unequivocally accepted” by the claimants and that both parties “were bound by the settlement
agreement and neither side was free to withdraw”.°7' Unlike in that case, Algeria never
submitted a settlement offer to the Claimant and the Claimant never accepted any such

offer.672

Further, contrary to the situation in SAUR v. Argentina, where the claimant owned a controlling
interest in the local company that concluded a settlement agreement with the Argentinian
authorities, the Claimant here sold its indirect controlling interest in OTH to VimpelCom three
years before VimpelCom, OTH, and the FNI concluded the SPA.°7? In this context, the
Claimant alleges that (i) it owned less than one percent of the share capital of OTH and
VimpelCom at the time of the SPA; (ii) it did not own any shares in VimpelCom and owned
less than one percent of OTH’s share capital on 30 January 2015 when the FNI’s share
purchase of OTA’s shares from VimpelCom and OTH closed, and on 12 March 2015 when the
PCA tribunal issued the consent award terminating the OTH Arbitration.°”* Contrary to the

claimant in SAUR, OTMTI therefore did not obtain and could not have obtained compensation
from the share purchase transaction.”

In fact, the Claimant contends that it notified the Respondent in its Notice of Dispute that it
would not be bound by any settlement discussions between OTA, OTH, OTH’s shareholders,
and the Respondent.®’° Subsequently it again notified the Respondent on 15 May 2012 that
“Weather II is broadly aware that there are ongoing negotiations between Algeria and at least
some of OTA’s shareholders (not including Weather II) in relation to the forced sale of OTA”,
but that “these negotiations do not involve, nor do they bind, Weather II”.°’7 The Respondent
thus knew that its settlement discussions with OTH and VimpelCom would not bind the
Claimant or have any effect on the latter's claims more than two years before the conclusion of
the SPA.678

Third, there is no risk of double payment. As a preliminary matter, the Claimant submits that
the risk of double recovery is not a bar to jurisdiction or admissibility, but is a matter for the
merits, if at all relevant.679

Assuming arguendo that the risk of double payment or recovery could affect the admissibility
of the claims, the Claimant contends that the loss it suffered is distinct from the one which
OTH incurred, with the result that there can be no double payment or recovery. For the
Claimant, the Respondent caused it to suffer damages of more than US$ 4 billion, which were
not incurred by OTH. At the Hearing, the Respondent did not dispute that OTH did not claim
compensation for refinancing costs that the Claimant was compelled to incur as a
consequence of the Respondent's unlawful measures, or for payments that the Claimant
made to private equity investors following the forced sale of Weather Investments to
VimpelCom.®° Additionally, OTH did not sustain any loss from the collapse of the MTN deal or
the resulting sale of Weather Investments to VimpelCom, because OTH was part of the
company that was for sale.®! Moreover, the non-payment of dividends was also, so the
Claimant's expert Ms. Hardin confirmed, “a damage that was incurred only by the Claimant,
who had — based on its membership on the board of directors of OTH and its role as the
controlling shareholder — the ability to require a disbursement, at a minimum, of its share of
dividends from OTH that were paid up from OTA”.®? It is thus undisputed that “at least part” of
the losses for which the Claimant seeks compensation in this arbitration were not sustained by

675 Rejoinder, para. 282. The Claimant further argues that the Respondent did not rely on any legal doctrine such
as res judicata or collateral estoppel, as those doctrines are clearly inapplicable. See Rejoinder, paras. 285-292.

OTH and, consequently, raise no concern with respect to double payment or double

recovery. ®3

In any event, the Claimant alleges that Algeria never made any payment to the Claimant to
compensate the harm that the latter suffered as a result of the unlawful measures. The
Respondent did not compensate the Claimant by purchasing shares of OTA from VimpelCom,
which in fact benefited from the unlawful measures that forced the Claimant to sell its indirect
controlling shareholding in OTA at a significantly impaired price.®*4 In reality, the Respondent
never compensated any party for the harm inflicted through its unlawful measures. This is
confirmed by the SPA, which does not purport to provide compensation for the Respondent's
unlawful measures, but “sets forth the terms and conditions of the sale of 51% of the OTA
shares by GTH to the FNI (the ‘Transaction’)”, and specifies that the SPA was “concluded with
no admission of guilt or liability with respect to the claims that are waived by GTH and the
Algerian State”.®°5

Neither did Algeria make any payment to acquire the FNI’s majority shareholding in OTA as it
arises in particular from Ms. Hardin’s evidence. In fact, the Respondent retained US$ 986
million in unlawful tax reassessments and penalties that it seized from OTA in 2010 and 2011
(which the Claimant values at US$ 1.356 billion taking into account the time value of money); it
also obtained payment from OTA of US$ 1.1 billion in unwarranted foreign exchange fines;
and received approximately US$ 774 million in capital gains, withholding, and transfer
taxes.®6 Thus, the Claimant submits that while the Respondent purportedly purchased OTA’s
shares for US$ 2.643 billion, it in fact received a net inflow of cash totaling US$ 564 million to
acquire shares worth US$ 5.172 billion prior to the Respondent’s unlawful measures. In other
words, “the Algerian Government acquir[ed] a 51 percent stake in an entity worth $5.172
billion as at 15 April 2011 for essentially nothing”®*’ and there can therefore be no question of
double recovery. For the Claimant, Ms. Hardin’s analysis of the economic terms of the SPA
stands unrebutted.

Fourth and last, the Claimant insists that not a single tribunal has dismissed a claim on the
basis that a shareholder was entitled to claim only for so-called “direct” losses.®®° Citing to
Bogdanov v. Moldova, the Claimant submits that a shareholder's claim is not limited to the
damage directly affecting his or her rights as shareholder, but extends to losses affecting the
assets of the local company. ®°°

Because the Claimant, by virtue of its indirect controlling shareholding in OTA, qualifies as an
“investor” with “investments” under both the BIT and ICSID Convention, it may recover for any
damage suffered by its investment on account of Algeria’s breaches of its obligations under
the BIT. All of the Claimant's claims, including any claims “based on the alleged injury suffered
by OTA and its direct shareholder OTH” are therefore admissible. °°"

Jurisdiction and admissibility objections in relation to the Claimant’s sale of its
investment

a. The Respondent’s position

The Respondent contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because Algeria’s offer to
arbitrate was not addressed to the Claimant at the time of the Request for Arbitration, as the
Claimant no longer held its investment (i). Furthermore, the claims are inadmissible as the
Claimant sold or waived its right to bring arbitration proceedings against the Respondent when
it sold its investment to VimpelCom (ii).

i. Algeria’s offer to arbitrate was not addressed to the Claimant at the time
of the Request for Arbitration

For the Respondent, it is undisputed that the Claimant purported to accept Algeria’s offer to
arbitrate contained in the BIT when filing its Request for Arbitration of 19 October 2012.52
However, at that time, the Claimant held a “very indirect” interest in OTA which was equivalent
to 0.025% of the share capital, because it had sold almost all of its shares in VimpelCom
between February and September 2012. As it does not present the sale of its shares to
VimpelCom as a forced sale resulting from Algeria’s allegedly unlawful measures, the
Claimant must establish that it was still holding an investment at the time when it accepted the
offer to arbitrate under the BIT.®°? Because of its marginal shareholding in OTA at the time of
the Request for Arbitration, the BIT’s offer to arbitrate was no longer addressed to the
Claimant (“elle ne lui était plus adressée’), which could therefore not accept it.°% As a
consequence, the Tribunal must decline jurisdiction due to the Claimant's lack of consent to
arbitrate. ®°5

The Respondent does not dispute that a claimant must be an investor at the time of the
impugned acts. However, in order to benefit from the offer to arbitrate extended by Algeria, the
Claimant had to hold an investment at the time when it was in a position to accept the offer

pursuant to the Treaty (“au moment ou elle [la Défenderesse] était en mesure d’accepter ladite
offre selon les termes de I’Accord’).°°6

467. For the Respondent, decisions discussing the requirement that the investor hold the
investment at the time of the request for arbitration suggest that such requirement may only be
dispensed with in the event of a forced sale or expropriation of the investment.®°”

468. From a procedural point of view, the Respondent considers that this jurisdictional objection is
timely. Indeed, the Respondent had stated on several occasions in its briefs that the Claimant
had sold almost the entirety of its indirect interest in OTA on the date of the Request for
Arbitration.°°8 It is also timely because at the Hearing the Tribunal invited the Parties to
address the effect of the Claimant's residual stake in VimpelCom (0.025%) at the time of the
Request for Arbitration. 69

469. Alternatively, Algeria argues that by deciding to sell virtually all of its shares to VimpelCom
before 19 October 2012, the day of the Request for Arbitration in this arbitration, the Claimant
lost any standing (qualité pour agir) to proceed against Algeria.”

ii. Whether the Claimant sold or waived its right to bring arbitration
proceedings against the Respondent

470. It is the Respondent’s submission that the Claimant sold its right to bring arbitration
proceedings (droit d’agir) against Algeria when it sold its investment to VinpelCom. When a
shareholder relies on an investment consisting of an indirect participation in a local company,
the sale of that participation may, depending on the circumstances, entail the sale of the right
to bring arbitration proceedings.”°' The sale of the right to arbitrate may cause the
inadmissibility of the claims.’ In this context, the Respondent cites to E/ Paso, according to
which “the claim continues to exist, i.e., the right to demand compensation for the injury
suffered at the hands of the State remains — unless, of course, it can be shown that it was sold
with the investment”.’°3 In other words, at the time of the sale, the Claimant had lost its right to

The Respondent argues that in Daimler, which in the Respondent's view is the only case cited by the Claimant
where a tribunal was faced with a situation where the investment had been sold before the start of the arbitration,
the tribunal did not rule on the effects of such sale on the parties’ consent. See R-PHB 1, fn. 224, and R-PHB 2,

bring proceedings against Algeria (as a result of OTH’s exercise of such right). Under such
circumstances, the sales transaction could not revive a right that had ceased to exist.7°*

According to the Respondent, when the indirect shareholder in a chain of vertically integrated
companies — which has lost its standing to bring arbitration because one of its subsidiaries has
exercised such right’ — sells its shares in the company which has started arbitration, that
seller may contractually reserve for itself the benefit of the claim exercised by its subsidiary.7°°
Unless it does so, the claim exercised by the subsidiary will inure to the benefit of the buyer of

the shares. 707

From an economic point of view, the Respondent argues that on 2 November 2010, the date
of OTH’s Notice of Dispute, OTH’s assets comprised the claims for damages against Algeria
which claims increased the value of OTH. In other words, the price for the acquisition of OTH
paid by VimpelCom to Weather Investments reflected the value of the damage claims.7°° For
the Respondent, Mr. Sawiris admitted as much at the Hearing. ”°°

Finally, the Respondent notes that the Claimant has failed to produce the documents relating
to the 2011 sale of Weather Investments to VimpelCom, which would allow the Respondent
and the Tribunal to determine whether the Claimant has sold or waived its right to arbitrate
against Algeria.’'? In particular, the Respondent complains that the Claimant refused to
produce the minutes of the Board meetings of VimpelCom7"' and requests that the Tribunal
draw adverse inferences from that refusal.”'* The Respondent further observes that the SPA
does not reserve the Claimant's claims for damages vis-a-vis Algeria and that the Algeria Risk
Sharing Agreement did not do so either.”‘? As a consequence, the sale of Weather
Investments necessarily entailed the transfer to VimpelCom of the claim for damages
exercised by OTH.’'4 The Respondent also stresses that the Claimant acknowledged the
absence of any injury suffered at the time of the closing,”'® and subsequently omitted
mentioning a damage in the Notice of Dispute of 16 April 2012.71

In conclusion, it is the Respondent's case that, even if the Claimant had not lost its right to
start arbitration as a result of OTH’s exercise of such right, it has lost it as a result of the sale
of its investment to VimpelCom. This is especially so in the absence of harm specific to the

Claimant,”'” a matter which the Respondent has developed in connection with the relevance
of the Settlement Agreement.

b. The Claimant’s position

475. For the Claimant, the sale of the investment to VimpelCom does not deprive the Tribunal of its
jurisdiction (i). Furthermore, the claims are admissible as the Claimant neither waived nor sold
its right to bring arbitration proceedings against the Respondent when selling its investment to
VimpelCom (ii).

i. The sale of the Claimant’s investment does not deprive the Tribunal of
jurisdiction
476. As a procedural matter, the Claimant considers the objection grounded on lack of jurisdiction
because its indirect shareholding in OTA at the time of the Request for Arbitration was only
0.05% as untimely. Indeed, it was raised for the first time at the Hearing in violation of the
ICSID Arbitration Rules, which require that a jurisdictional objection be raised at the latest at
the time of the counter-memorial.”!®

477. On the merits, the Claimant views the objection as meritless. The relevant time to assess
whether there is a protected investment is the time of the treaty breach, at which time the
Claimant was holding its investment.7'9 In the Claimant's opinion, an investor need not
maintain ownership of its investment until it submits its claim to arbitration: were it otherwise,
no claimant could submit a claim to arbitration where the respondent state nationalized or
directly expropriated the claimant’s investment.”?° In any event, the Claimant alleges that it
sold its investment as a direct result of the Respondent's measures. 7!

ii. The Claimant neither waived nor sold its right to bring arbitration
proceedings against the Respondent

478. The Claimant argues that Algeria has failed to proffer any evidence to support the erroneous
speculation that the Claimant sold its right to bring proceedings against Algeria or waived its
right to claim compensation for any damages that it has incurred. 722

479. To the contrary, so says the Claimant, it has demonstrated that it never sold or waived its right
to initiate arbitration against the Respondent, and expressly retained that right in the Risk

Sharing Agreement that the Claimant and VimpelCom concluded on 15 April 2011.79 In the
Risk Sharing Agreement, the Claimant and VimpelCom agreed that both parties may bring
legal proceedings against the Respondent.’ It is clear that, in such a scenario, the Claimant
would bring claims for the harm that it already had suffered from the Respondent's unlawful
measures, whereas VimpelCom or one of its privies would bring claims for harm that “may
result” from actions that the Respondent had “threatened”.725

480. Furthermore, the Claimant underlines that the Risk Sharing Agreement provides that “Weather
Il and VimpelCom will act jointly with respect to the commencement, conduct and termination
of any Legal Proceedings’’?° and that “in case of disagreement relating to the
commencement, conduct and termination of any Legal Proceedings, Weather II’s decisions
shall prevail”.”2? The Risk Sharing Agreement also sets forth that, in the event of a settlement
between VimpelCom and Algeria, the Claimant would not be bound to terminate any pending
legal proceedings against the Respondent unless VimpelCom submitted a written settlement
offer and the Claimant accepted it (which has not occurred in this case).76

481. The Claimant also puts forward that it could not have sold its treaty claims to VimpelCom.
Doing so would have been impermissible treaty shopping, because VimpelCom did not have
any investment in Algeria at the time of the Respondent's unlawful measures and thus would
lack standing to file treaty claims relating to those measures. 79

482. Moreover, the Claimant considers the Respondent's speculation that the Claimant’s sale’s
price to VimpelCom reflected the value of OTH’s claims against the Respondent totaling
US$ 15 billion to be ill-conceived. The payment that the Claimant received clearly did not
include the value of OTH’s US$ 15 billion claim or otherwise remedy the billion-dollar harm
that the Claimant had incurred as a result of the Respondent's measures. 72°

483. The Claimant also highlights that several investment tribunals have confirmed that an
investor's choice to dispose of its investment does not amount to a waiver of the right to
initiate arbitration against the state and is irrelevant to the tribunal’s jurisdiction over claims
deriving from the state’s measures prior to such disposition. ”°'

VimpelCom’s undertaking to “provide reasonable assistance” to Algeria in this arbitration,
confirms that no minutes exist and that the Claimant retained its right to bring these arbitration

relevance of the OTH Arbitration

to the objections discussed in this section V.D, which assists in understanding the issues.

a. The Claimant was incorporated in 2005 and, as detailed above in the context of the
discussion of jurisdiction ratione materiae, started to acquire its investment that year.

b. The disputed measures taken by Algeria date back to the years 2008 to 2011. By way of
example, the tax assessments against OTA were issued between the end of 2008 and

early 2011; the dividend restrictions vis-a-vis OTA were enacted between the end of

 

2008 and the beginning of 2010; and the Bank of Algeria’s injunction restraining Algerian
banks from engaging in foreign banking transactions on behalf of OTA was issued on 15
April 2010.

c. On 2 November 2010, OTH notified Algeria of a dispute under the Egypt-Algeria BIT
through a formal “Notice of Dispute” which triggered the 6-month waiting period under
Article 7 of that treaty (the “OTH Notice of Dispute”).”9° The OTH Notice of Dispute was
signed by Mr. Sawiris as Executive Chairman of OTH.76

d. Less than a week later, on 8 November 2010, Weather Investments notified Algeria of a
dispute under the Italy-Algeria BIT through a formal “Notice of Dispute”, which triggered
the 6-month waiting period under Article 7 of that treaty (the “Weather Investments

Notice of Dispute”).”°7 The Weather Investments Notice of Dispute was also signed by
Mr. Sawiris as representative of Weather Investments.”

On 15 April 2011, the Claimant completed the sale of OTA to VimpelCom (through the
sale of Weather Investments).”°° The Tribunal understands that between 2011 and
2012, the Claimant held a residual indirect participation in OTA of around 9.4% (through
ownership of shares in VimpelCom).74°

On 12 April 2012, OTH followed up on the OTH Notice of Dispute by filing a Notice of
Arbitration against Algeria under the UNCITRAL Rules and the Egypt-Algeria BIT (the
“OTH Arbitration”).741

Two days later, on 14 April 2012, the Claimant in this arbitration notified Algeria of a
dispute under the BLEU-Algeria BIT through a formal “Notice of Dispute” which triggered
the 6-month waiting period under Article 9 of that treaty (“the Claimant's Notice of
Dispute”).”4? The Claimant's Notice of Dispute was signed by Mr. Sawiris as Chairman of
OTMTI.

On 19 October 2012, the Claimant filed its Request for Arbitration with ICSID under the
BLEU-Algeria BIT, thus following up on the Claimant's Notice of Dispute. The Tribunal
understands that at that point in time the Claimant owned an indirect interest in OTA
equivalent to 0.025%. 743

On 18 April 2014, the FNI, OTH and VimpelCom entered into an SPA, providing inter alia
for the settlement of the OTH Arbitration. 744

On 15 March 2015, the PCA tribunal in the OTH Arbitration recorded the parties’
settlement in a consent award.”

In this context, it is important to further examine the notifications of dispute sent by OTH,
Weather Investments, and the Claimant to Algeria. While the companies giving notice and the
investment treaties invoked are different, it is notable that the three notices concern the same

measures or events.

We write with considerable alarm at
recent developments in Algeria in relation
to Djezzy [...].

In particular, many of the incidents of
mistreatment since 2008 remain
unresolved despite the fact that we have
brought them to the Government's
attention through numerous letters (see
our correspondence to the Government
dated 17 August 2009, 23 November
2009, 28 March 2010, 27 May 2010, 1
July 2010 and 8 September 2010).

 

Reference is made to past
correspondence sent on behalf of
Weather Investments S.p.A (“Weather”)
and related meetings, including, inter alia,

Ll

(9) the joint letter from Weather
Investment S.a. r.l. and VimpelCom Ltd to
you, dated 4 October 2010;

and

(10) the various letters, from Orascom
Telecom Holding SAE (“OTH”) to the
Algerian Government, including OTH's
letters of 28 March 2010 and 2 November
2010 the OTH Notice of Dispute].

 

We write to give you notice of an
investment dispute between an investor
and the People's Democratic Republic of
Algeria (Algeria). The investor is Weather
Investments II S.a. r.l. (Weather Il), a
company incorporated in Luxembourg,
hereinafter referred to as the Investor.
The dispute arises out of certain
measures taken by Algeria in breach of
the protections provided to the Investor
under the [BLEU-Algeria BIT].

The dispute relates to the Investor's
significant investments in Djezzy, a
company incorporated in Algeria, through
the Investor's shareholdings in Orascom
Telecom Holding S.A.E. (OTH), a
company incorporated in Egypt, which
itself owns, directly or indirectly, 96.81%
of the shares in Djezzy.

As you are aware from the extensive
previous correspondence with OTH and
Djezzy, the dispute relates to an ongoing
campaign of measures (the Measures

directly or indirectly, which have
adversely affected - and continue to affect
adversely- the Investor's investments in
Algeria. These Measures were described
in detail in past correspondence from
OTH and its shareholders to Your
Excellency, including, for example, in
letters dated 2 November 2010 and 8
November 2010 [i.e. the OTH Notice of
Dispute and the Weather Investments
Notice of Dispute].

 

 

To recapitulate, these disputes concern a
series of unlawful actions, including
(amongst others, and without limitation):

+ the arbitrary injunction of 15 April 2010
by the Bank of Algeria restraining all
Algerian banks from engaging in any
foreign banking transactions on behalf of
Djezzy [OTA], which has had devastating
effects on both Djezzy and its
shareholders (including, amongst others,
the rapid deterioration of the network due
to the inability to import essential goods);

+ the subsequent threat of massive fines
proposed to be imposed on Djezzy as a
result of groundless allegations that it
breached Algerian foreign exchange
regulations;

+ the imposition of arbitrary and
unjustified tax reassessments and
penalties on Djezzy for the years 2004 -
2007 of more than USD 720 million;

 

We write to express our deep concern in
relation to the issues summarised in the
attached letter from OTH dated 2
November 2010 [i.e. the OTH Notice of
Dispute]. The catalogue of arbitrary and
unfair treatment that Djezzy and its
shareholders have been subjected to are
contrary to, inter alia, Articles 3. 4 and 5
of the [Italy-Algeria BIT].

These extreme actions have resulted in

very serious losses to Weather and its
shareholders.

 

As explained in that earlier
correspondence, the Measures - all of
which are unlawful, unjustified and
arbitrary - include, but are not limited to:

(a) the imposition of more than USD 950
million in unjustified tax reassessments
and penalties on Djezzy for the years
2004-2009;

(b) the blocking of Djezzy's payments of
dividends to its foreign shareholders
through the enactment of the Finance Act
2009 and the subsequent refusal to issue
dividend transfer clearance certificates;

(c) the failure to protect Djezzy during the
football riots and violence against
Djezzy's premises in November 2009;

(d) the Bank of Algeria's injunction of 15
April 2010 (which remains in effect
today), restraining all Algerian banks from
engaging in any foreign banking
transactions on behalf of Djezzy;

+ the blocking of the payment of dividends
to the foreign shareholders of Djezzy
through the enactment of the 2009
Finance Act and subsequent refusal to
issue clearance certificates,
notwithstanding that all taxes, including
the arbitrary and unfair taxes levied for
those years, have been paid (subject to
protest);

+ the arbitrary customs freeze on Djezzy's
importation of goods, which is crippling its
ability to acquire essential goods (such as
SIM cards) and network equipment;

+ the interference in, and thwarting of, the
sale of OTH to MTN (through, inter alia,
the enactment (at the same time) of the
2009 Supplemental Finance Act);

+ the interference with the rights of OTH
through the enactment of the 2010
Supplemental Finance Act to attempt to
grant Algeria preemption rights over
Djezzy in the event of a sale of OTH;

+ the arbitrary shutdown of Medcable and
VSAT networks on spurious national
security grounds;

+ the failure to protect Djezzy during the
football riots and violence against
Djezzy's premises in November 2009;

+ the disproportionate sanctions enacted
in the 2010 Supplemental Finance Act
which are plainly targeted at Djezzy;

+ the discriminatory ban on Djezzy

 

 

(e) the customs blockade imposed on
Djezzy, preventing it from importing
goods and network equipment essential
to the maintenance and stability of its
telecommunications network;

(f) the recent imposition of a US$1.3
billion fine on Djezzy as a result of
groundless allegations that it breached
Algerian foreign exchange regulations,
together with the threat of further massive
fines to be imposed on Djezzy in the
future;

(g) the improper and unlawful targeting of
Djezzy and OTH employees, including
the initiation of a number of criminal
investigations by the Bank of Algeria, and
the recent improper and unlawful criminal
sentence of imprisonment of an OTA
senior executive, together with false
allegations made to members of the
Algerian press;

(h) the interference in, and thwarting of,
the sale of OTH to the MTN Group in
2010 through, inter alia, the enactment of
the 2009 Supplemental Finance Act;

(i) the interference with OTH's rights
through the enactment of the 2010
Supplemental Finance Act in an attempt
to grant Algeria pre-emption rights over
Djezzy in the event of a sale of OTH;

advertising on Algerian state television;

+ the recent spurious criminal
investigation initiated by the Bank of
Algeria, including false allegations in the
press and unfair targeting of OTH
employees;

+ the unfair and arbitrary preliminary tax
reassessment for the years 2008 and
2009 amounting to USD 230 million
(following a tax audit initiated immediately
after the tax filing for 2009 in March
2010); and

+ the Government's publicised intent to
“nationalise" Djezzy and other press
statements, with a view to, amongst
others, derailing the transaction between
VimpelCom Ltd and Weather Investments
S.p.A.

The above-described measures are
contrary to, inter alia, Articles 3 and 6 of
the Investment Agreement of 5 August
2001 and international law, including,
inter alia, Articles 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the
[Egypt-Algeria BIT].

These extreme actions have already
caused losses of several billion US
dollars through the diminution in capital
value of Djezzy and other losses resulting
from the Government's unlawful conduct.
These additional losses include. inter alia
hundreds of millions of dollars in costs
incurred by Djezzy's shareholders when
raising emergency funds to deal with the

 

 

 

security grounds;

(k) the discriminatory ban on Djezzy
advertising on Algerian State television;

(|) the threat of unjustified sanctions as a
result of the transaction between
VimpelCom Ltd. and Wind Telecom
S.p.A, concluded in mid-2011;

(m) the blocking of Djezzy’s commercial
and marketing plans through: (i) refusal to
approve its promotions and services; and
(il) forcing Djezzy to withdraw certain
services, offers or promotions;

(n) discriminatory and preferential
treatment of Djezzy's competitors;

(0) conducting a campaign to discredit
Djezzy and OTH in Algeria, and
encouraging violence towards and
mistrust in these companies, their
employees and representatives;

(p) ongoing unilateral and unlawful
breaches of the 2001 Investment
Agreement between OTH and the
Algerian Investment Promotion, Support
and Monitoring Agency; and

(q) the culmination of this campaign by
Algeria against Djezzy, being an unlawful
attempted "forced sale" of all or part of
Djezzy to the Algerian State or a State
entity.[FN1]

[FN1] We understand that OTH and at
least some of OTH's shareholders agreed

DGE's unjustified tax reassessments and
the Government's ban on dividend
transfers out of Algeria. We draw your
attention to the fact that the shareholders
of OTH attempted to mitigate the losses
through a sale to MTN, notwithstanding
the fact that they did not wish to sell OTH
or Djezzy but had no choice in light of the
Government's unfair actions against
OTH's investment. This distressed sale
attempt had priced OTH's shareholding in
Djezzy at no less than USD 7.8 billion,
net of the wrongful tax reassessments,
and already at a significant undervalue
owing to the Government's prior unfair
treatment, but such attempted mitigation
was thwarted by the Government.

As a result of the Government's
interference, OTH and its shareholders
have incurred significant losses,
including, but not limited to, loss of
opportunities. The Government's recent
actions and public statements have also
had a detrimental effect on OTH's share
price, and have seriously impacted on
OTH's and its shareholders’ financial
obligations.

  

 

to participate in this "forced sale" process,
in the spirit of cooperation and in an
attempt to mitigate their losses, under
protest, reserving all of their rights, and
without prejudice to their position as
outlined in previous correspondence. We
also understand that OTH has recently
filed its own arbitration claim against
Algeria, pursuant to the Egypt-Algeria
bilateral investment treaty. For the
avoidance of doubt, the past or future
participation of OTH (and any of OTH's
other direct or indirect shareholders) in
the forced sale process was -and will
remain -without prejudice to the rights of
the Investor under the Treaty, including
the Investor's right to have recourse to
international arbitration if the dispute
notified herein is not resolved within the
six-month period of amicable negotiations
referred to herein. Any offer, proposal,
representation, heads of agreement, or
agreement which may be exchanged or
concluded between Algeria and OTH or
Djezzy (or with any of OTH's other direct
or indirect shareholders) shall not imply,
nor shall it be interpreted as, a
renunciation of any right of the Investor to
have recourse to any national or
international tribunal under Algerian
and/or international law

 

 

We have repeatedly sought to resolve
this dispute amicably for more than one
year. We opened formal negotiations with

 

Once again, we urge the Government to
cease all actions against Djezzy and its
shareholders, and allow Djezzy to operate

together, constitute clear breaches of
Algeria's obligations to the Investor under

the Government through meetings which |
held on 22 July 2009 with the Minister of
Finance. That meeting was followed by
further correspondence and discussions,
although most of our letters remain
unanswered. We also expressed our
willingness to enter into good faith
negotiations with the Government for the
sale of Djezzy, when left with no
alternative following the Government's
clear statements that it would exercise a
pre-emption right over any other sale (an
entitlement which we dispute as
expl[aJined above). [...]

In light of this, we are concerned that we
will be left with no choice but to seek
redress through international arbitration

[Egypt-Algeria] Treaty, without further
notice. [...]

the loss in value attributable to Algeria’s
unlawful conduct. In the meantime, we

pursuant to Article 8 of the [Italy-Algeria

the Treaty, and under international law
generally [...].

The Measures, for which Algeria is
responsible under the Treaty, and under
international law, have caused the
Investor to suffer significant economic
loss and damage.

Article 9 of the Treaty provides that any
dispute between a contracting party to the
Treaty and an investor from the other
contracting party, relating to investments
under the Treaty, should, if possible, be
resolved by amicable negotiation. In the
event that the dispute is not resolved
within six months from the time one party
notifies the other of its existence, the
investor may submit the dispute to
international arbitration.

Consequently, the Investor hereby
notifies Algeria of the commencement of
the six-month period of amicable
negotiations provided for in Article 9 of
the Treaty, and of its right, in the event
that the dispute is not amicably resolved
through negotiation, to commence
international arbitration against Algeria
before the International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes. [...]

In the event that these negotiation efforts
do not yield a solution within six months
of the date of today's letter, 16 October
2012, the Investor reserves all of its
tights, including the right to submit this

488. As is evident from the content of the three notices excerpted above, the three companies
complain of the same measures taken by Algeria. All three companies refer, by way of
example, to Algeria’s tax reassessments against OTA, the limitations imposed on OTA’s
payment of dividends to its foreign shareholders, the Bank of Algeria's Injunction affecting
OTA, the customs blockade imposed on OTA, the failure to protect OTA during the football
riots and violence against OTA’s premises, the shutdown of the Medcable and VSAT networks
on alleged national security grounds, and the advertising ban on OTA, in many instances even
using identical wording. 4° In the Tribunal’s view, while the parties to the dispute and the legal
bases for the claims (the BITs) are different, the dispute being notified in the three notices is
effectively one and the same.

489. Each subsequent notice makes this identity of the dispute clear, as it defines the dispute by
reference to the preceding notice(s). Thus, Weather Investments expressed its concern “in
relation to the issues summarised in the [OTH Notice of Dispute]”, which was attached to the
Weather Investments Notice of Dispute. The Claimant's Notice of Dispute, for its part, referred
to the dispute in the following terms: “the dispute relates to an ongoing campaign of measures
(the Measures) taken by Algeria in relation to Djezzy [OTA], directly or indirectly [...]. These
Measures were described in detail in past correspondence from OTH and its shareholders to
Your Excellency, including, for example, in [the OTH Notice of Dispute and the Weather
Investments Notice of Dispute]’.’° In other words, the reference to the description of the
dispute contained in the OTH Notice of Dispute undoubtedly shows that both Weather
Investments and, more importantly for these purposes, the Claimant considered the dispute to
be one and the same.75!

490. Moreover, the three notices were all sent by Mr. Sawiris. There is no controversy that at the
time when the OTH and Weather Investments Notices of Dispute were sent, Mr. Sawiris and
his family were the ultimate beneficial owners and Mr. Sawiris was the controlling shareholder
of these companies.”°* There is equally no dispute that the Weather Group constituted a
vertically integrated chain of companies, in which the companies higher up in the chain
controlled and directed the companies further down. As explained by Mr. Nasr, one of the

749 In case of the Weather Investments Notice of Dispute, the aggrieved investor simply incorporated by reference
the description of the issues made in the OTH Notice of Dispute. See Letter from Weather Investments to Algeria,
8 November 2010, Exh. R-13, p. 2 (referring to “the issues st is in the attached letter from OTH dated 2
November 2010 the OTH Notice of Dispute]”).
750 This was also confirmed by Mr. Sawiris at the Hearing:

[PROFESSOR GAILLARD]: So the dispute [in the Claimant's Notice of Dispute] is

described by reference to earlier letters, right? Which | leave aside their

characterisation as triggering letters or not. But that's the way you constructed the

letter, right?

[MR SAWIRIS] Yes. Yes.
Tr. Day 2, 167:9-13.
751 In view of the identity of the dispute, it is unsurprising that the subsequent Request for Arbitration filed in this
case presents similarities to the Notice of Arbitration in the OTH Arbitration, as is shown by Exh. R-54,
Comparative analysis of arbitration applications filed by OTH and Weather II against the Algerian State.
782 See e.g. Procedural Order No. 5, Annex A, Claimant's Redfern Schedule, Claimant's Comments, Request No.
4, p. 48 (describing Mr. Sawiris as the “Claimant's controlling shareholder’).

 

129

Claimant's key witnesses in this arbitration, who since the creation of the Weather Group
“oversaw investments by Weather Il and Weather Investments as Weather Investments’
Corporate Finance Officer”:75?

From Weather Il’s creation forward, OTH and its subsidiaries, and Wind
Italy and associated companies, were answerable to_and controlled by
Weather Il. The operative entity on many matters was Weather Investment,
which in turn was controlled by a majority of Board of Directors members
appointed by Weather II. The managerial control exercised by the top of
the Weather Group included, for instance, approval of OTH budgets and
business plans, encompassing profit and dividend use, investment, and
capital deployment. Operations in Algeria, including the ability to transfer
dividends upstream, continued to be successful in the years following the
creation of Weather Investments and Weather II.754

 

491. In its Counter-Memorial, the Claimant is equally clear in explaining the Weather Group's
structure and Mr. Sawiris’ role in it:

This control [of the Claimant over OTA] was “manifested most
fundamentally in voting the shares and in putting the parent company’s
people or team into place to operate the subsidiaries.” For example, Mr.
Naguib Sawiris was the Chairman of OTMTI’s Board, was voted by OTMTI
to be the Chair of the Weather Investments Board (as Algeria
acknowledges), and maintained his positions as Chairman of OTA and
Executive Chairman of OTH’s Board after OTMTI’s creation. OTMTI’s
control over OTA and the Weather Group is also clearly seen by its loss of
control following the sale of Weather Investments to VimpelCom, when Mr.
Sawiris lost his chairmanships of both Weather Investments and OTH.
Other employees of the Weather Group also were replaced following
OTMTI’s loss of control. It is thus very clear that “OTMTI controlled
OTA”.755

492. Thus, from 2005 until the Claimant's sale of OTA through the sale of Weather Investments in
April 2011, the Claimant asserts to have “exercised its direct majority ownership to control
Weather Investments, which similarly exercised its majority ownership in OTH (through wholly-
owned subsidiaries) to control OTH, which exercised its majority ownership (directly and
through wholly-owned subsidiaries) to control OTA”.’°6 As further confirmed by the Claimant's
corporate finance expert Mr. Tolkien, from 2005 to 2011, “at each link in the corporate chain,
OTMTI or its subsidiaries owned at least 50% of the voting shares of the next company in the

chain”.”57

493. For his part, at the Hearing, Mr. Sawiris explained his role in the Weather Group in the
following terms:

[W]hen | speak as Naguib, | speak for Weather Il, for Weather and
Orascom Telecom. | am the chairman across the board. So when | -- and |

am the guy who is managing. I’m not just a -- you know, and most of the

time | was chairman and chief executive officer. So when | speak, | speak

as a chairman of OTA, chairman of Weather; you can choose whatever

position you want to think. But | am also a shareholder, and | represent my

family’s interests also. So | have -- | am like the general assembly, you

know, because | own the 51% through my family, and | am the chairman

and | am chief executive officer. So if you want to say /’m everything, it's

true. 755
In other words, there is no doubt that, at the time when the dispute described in the two first
notices arose, the Claimant controlled OTH (and Weather Investments). There was no
situation of separate boards deciding independently. When OTH and Weather Investments
sent their notices of dispute, complaining that, as a result of Algeria's measures “OTH and its
shareholders have incurred significant losses”,’5° that the Government actions had “seriously
impacted on OTH's and its shareholders’ financial obligations”,”©° and caused “very serious
losses to Weather and its shareholders”,’*' those complaints were advanced by boards which
“were answerable to and controlled by [the Claimant]”.7°2

In the vertically integrated chain that constituted the Weather Group, several entities could in
theory at least bring arbitration proceedings against the Respondent. OTA could rely on the
ICSID clause in the Investment Agreement.’® OTH as direct foreign shareholders could
invoke the arbitration clause in the Algeria-Egypt BIT. Weather Investments as indirect foreign
shareholder could claim on the basis of the arbitration provision in the Algeria-Italy BIT. And
the Claimant, another indirect foreign investor, could start arbitration based on the Algeria-
BLEU BIT. In the case of the latter, the Treaty expressly affords protection to indirect
shareholding, i.e. investment that can be held through one or more intermediate companies. 7°*
In the Tribunal’s view, the existence of several legal foundations for arbitration does not
necessarily mean that the various entities in the shareholder chain could make use of the
existing arbitration clauses to assail the same measures and to recover the same economic
loss under any circumstances. Indeed, the purpose of investment treaty arbitration is to grant
full reparation for the injuries that a qualifying investor may have suffered as a result of a host
state’s wrongful measures. If the harm incurred by one entity in the chain is fully repaired in
one arbitration, the claims brought by other members of the vertical chain in other arbitral
proceedings may become inadmissible depending on the circumstances.

764 See Article 1(2) of the BIT. The Tribunal may dispense with determining whether it is appropriate to fix a cut-off
point beyond which an investor is “too far removed” to have a claim. Indeed, that determination would not change
the outcome in view of the conclusion that the claims are inadmissible on other grounds.

131

496. In the circumstances of the present dispute, the Tribunal finds that the claims are inadmissible
on several counts. In this framework, OTH’s Notice of Dispute assumes a decisive importance,
in itself and in combination with the subsequent events. On 2 November 2010, the Claimant
and its controlling shareholder, Mr. Sawiris, caused the corporate organs of OTH to crystallize
the dispute at the level of OTA’s direct investor. To the Tribunal, that choice is unsurprising:
OTH was the direct shareholder of OTA and was the entity that, up to that point in time, had
always contested the measures.’6° OTH was, moreover, the original investor which had been
awarded the GSM License (for itself and on behalf of OTA)7®° and had signed the Investment
Agreement with the Algerian Government (in its name and on behalf of OTA).7°7

497. Thus, on 2 November 2010, the legal protection that was available at the various levels of the
corporate chain was activated at the OTH level. By exercising its right to arbitrate against
Algeria, OTH placed itself in the position of being made whole for the alleged harm. Indeed, if
it succeeded on the merits, the harm caused by the litigious measures would be remedied.

498. To the extent OTH would have restored its company value through arbitration proceedings
under the BIT, all of the companies higher up in the corporate chain, including the Claimant,
would have been made whole as well. Indeed, their loss depends on the diminution in value of
their shares in OTH, which depends on the value of OTH (which in turn is a function of OTA’s
value). If the value of OTH is restored, then the shareholders of OTH suffer no loss, unless
they incurred a loss of their own which is independent of the value of OTH.

499. The Tribunal will thus review the losses that the Claimant alleges to have suffered as a result
of Algeria's measures, with a view to examining whether the Claimant requests relief for
losses that only itself suffered irrespective of the valuation of OTH. In this respect, OTMTI
contends that “at least part” of the losses for which it seeks compensation in this arbitration
were not sustained by OTH.7® In carrying out its analysis, the Tribunal has the benefit of the
Claimant's full memorial on the merits, the three expert reports presented by the Claimant's
expert on valuation and damages analysis (two of which were filed specifically in the
bifurcated phase dealing with the Respondent's preliminary objections), the extensive
discussion on these issues at the Hearing, including the cross-examination of the Claimant's
expert, as well as the record of the OTH Arbitration which has been produced in this
arbitration.

The Claimant requests compensation for the following heads of damages. First, it claims
“compensation for its realized losses on the sale of its investment’.”*° Second, it claims
“compensation for its share of the unlawfully blocked dividends”.’”° Third, it claims damages
due to payments made by the Claimant to private equity investors when it had to buy back
shares in Weather Investments before selling Weather Investments to VinpelCom.’7' Fourth,
the Claimant claims “compensation for consequential damages”.’”* Fifth and last, at least
initially, it also claimed moral damages.’”? The Tribunal considers these categories of claims
in turn.

The first category, the losses allegedly incurred on the sale of the investment, give rise to the
Claimant's main claim. While the Claimant’s Notice of Dispute did not contain any reference to
the sale of its investment to VimpelCom at an alleged “distressed price”, during the course of
the proceedings the “core of Claimant's case” became “that Respondent's measures caused
Claimant to sell its interest in OTA to VimpelCom, which purchased OTA at an impaired price
and, thus, benefitted from Respondent's unjust measures that had deeply reduced OTA’s
price”.’”4 The Claimant's expert refers to this category as the “[d]jamages due to a loss in value
of OTA which crystallized when Claimant sold Weather Investments to VimpelCom on 15 April
2011”,775 and quantified them in an amount in excess of US$ 2.349 billion.7”6 As is clear from
the Claimant's own pleadings and the testimony of its valuation and damages expert, this
head of damage is based on the alleged diminution of value of OTA. For example, the
Claimant asserts that:

Claimant's loss crystalized when it sold its interests in OTA to
VimpelCom—along with a wide portfolio of other assets to make the
acquisition of OTA manageable, from a risk perspective, to the buyer—on
15 April 2011 and suffered a realized capital loss on its share of the
investment amounting to approximately $2.349 billion. CRA [the Claimant's
quantum expert] determined Claimant's compensable damage from this
realized capital loss as Claimant’s share of the difference between (i) the
but-for value OTA would have had in the sale to VimpelCom, and (ii) the
actual value OTA can be estimated to have carried in the sale to
VimpelCom.

[1

Accordingly, the total damages relating to OTA’s loss in value, as reflected
in the divesture sale of OTA is the difference between the but-for value of
OTA ($10.142 billion) and its actual value ($3.6 billion)-i.e., $6.542 billion.
At the time of the sale to VimpelCom, Claimant held 71.74% of Weather

Investments, the entity (sold to VimpelCom) containing OTA and the
accompanying portfolio of assets. Claimant also indirectly held 51.7% of
OTH, which in turn held 96.81% of OTA. Accordingly, Claimant's total
indirect interest in OTA at the time of divestiture was 35.91%. Claimant's
damage relating to the loss in value of its indirect interest in OTA as a
direct result of Algeria's unlawful measures thus amounts to $2.349
billion.”77

The interconnection between the damage relating to the allegedly impaired price at which the
Claimant sold its investment and the alleged diminution of OTA’s shareholding value is further
explained by the Claimant in the following terms:

It was hardly surprising that the sales price obtained by Claimant for its
controlling interest in OTA was billions of dollars less than it would have
been had Algeria not taken the aforementioned series of unlawful acts
against OTA. /n addition to the lost share value, Claimant also suffered
damages from Algeria's unlawful prohibition on OTA’s repatriation of
dividends. [...]’78

 

The damages relating to the diminution in value of OTA were, in turn, also the main head of
damages claimed by OTH in the OTH Arbitration. In the OTH Arbitration, OTH asked the
tribunal to quantify “the diminution in value of OTH’s equity interest in OTA caused by the
measures (i.e. the counter-factual value of OTH’s equity interest as of the date of the
Tribunal’s award minus the actual value of that shareholding, if any, on that date)”.7”° OTH
claimed that its equity interest in OTA had been diminished as a consequence of the
measures taken by Algeria against OTA (which, as seen above, are those of which the
Claimant complains) and requested compensation in an amount between US$ 9.1 and 12.5

billion. 78°

The examination of the Claimant’s valuation and damages expert, Ms. Hardin, on the
relationship of this head of damages claimed by the Claimant and those claimed by OTH was
particularly enlightening:

[PROFESSOR GAILLARD]. Can you take your third report [...] here you
note that OTH in the PCA arbitration is claiming for: "The diminution in
value of OTH's shareholding in OTA, which was described as the
difference between the counter-factual value of OTH's equity interest in
OTA and the residual value of that shareholding, which OTH claimed was
zero ..." So | will focus on this value of zero. If as a matter of principles of
finance and damage theory, if OTH is right that the value of its ownership
in OTA is zero, it must mean that above it's also zero, if they are right;
because if OTH has an interest in OTA, the Algerian company, which is
zero, then the shareholder above has a value which indirectly is zero, and
then the shareholder even more above has a value which is still zero.
Right? [...] if you are asked to assume that OTA, the company, is worth
zero because of the measures -- but | am not asking you to take that as a
fact; | am just asking you to take that as a hypothetical -- if it's worth zero, it

506.

must mean that the shareholding of OTH in OTA is worth zero; and that, as
a result, any indirect shareholding above is worth zero as well, if you
accept my premise. Right? [...] And if that shareholding of OTH in OTA is
worth zero, then anything above is worth zero as well, right? The indirect
shareholding is -- it's axiomatic, isn't it? If the hypothetical is right, of
course.

A. The assumptions in this case are --
THE PRESIDENT: Can | try it a little bit differently.
A. Yes, go ahead.

THE PRESIDENT: If the value of OTA is zero, then the value held by OTH
as shares of OTA is zero, right; or not?

A. If you make an assumption --
THE PRESIDENT: No, no, the assumption is very simple.
A. The assumption is zero, that the value --

THE PRESIDENT: The value of OTA shares is zero. Then how much value
does OTH hold for the shares of OTA?

A. If the value of OTA is zero, then the 36% holding of Weather
Investments is zero, is also worth zero, if you're making that assumption,
100 --

THE PRESIDENT: So now you continue up the chain, and the value stays
zero as you go up the chain; is that what you're saying? | think that's what |
understood.

A. Yes, | think that would be accurate. 78!

The Tribunal concludes that the claim for damages “for the Claimant's realized losses on the
sale of its investment” concerns the same economic harm as OTH's claim for diminution in
value of its interest in OTA, which OTH raised in the OTH Arbitration.

A second category of damages for which the Claimant requests relief in this arbitration relates
to damages “for the Claimant's share of the unlawfully blocked OTA dividends”.’®? In this
respect, the Claimant has argued that “Algeria’s obstruction of Claimant's right to transfer
dividends from OTA to the Weather Group and other harmful measures are in breach of
Algeria’s obligations to Claimant under the BIT”.’®° It thus asks the Tribunal to “award
Claimant its proportional share of dividends that OTA would have transferred upstream had
Algeria not acted unlawfully”. It has quantified those damages at US$ 485.8 million.”°4 This
category of damages was also claimed by OTH in the OTH Arbitration, where the claimant
requested “OTH’s historical losses incurred as a result of the unlawful conduct up to the date

of the Tribunal’s award, (in the form of dividends wrongfully denied to OTH from 2009 onwards
and other related losses)”.785

Within a vertical chain of corporations, each entity may pay out dividends to its shareholder(s),
namely to the company or companies at the immediate higher echelon in the chain. Thus,
OTH would have received OTA dividends; Weather Capital would have received OTH's
dividends; Weather Investments would have received Weather Capital's dividends; and the
Claimant would have received Weather Investments’ dividends. Absent Algeria's allegedly
unlawful measures, the “blocked OTA” dividends would thus have been paid to OTH, and not
to the Claimant. This notwithstanding, the Claimant's expert, Ms. Hardin, has argued that the
damage relating to the unpaid dividends are “a damage that was incurred only by the
Claimant, who had — based on its membership on the board of directors of OTH and its role as
the controlling shareholder — the ability to require a disbursement, at a minimum, of its share
of dividends from OTH that were paid up from OTA”.”86 According to Ms. Hardin, by contrast
to the Claimant, “OTH did not sustain damages due to OTA’s withheld dividend payments
because it did not have ultimate control of those payments”, based on the theory that “a key
difference in this claim stems from the point of view of a controlling versus non-controlling
shareholder and the role of each type of shareholder for the company”.78”

The Tribunal is unable to follow this argument. It is undisputed that the Claimant itself was
controlled by other companies, April, OS and Cylo, whose shareholders were certain trusts
constituted to the benefit of Mr. Sawiris and his family.7®° If one were to follow Ms. Hardin's
theory, it would be those entities above the Claimant who would have had the ultimate
decision-making power in relation to any dividend paid by companies further down in the
chain. If this were so, then it would be the entities controlling the Claimant which suffered the
damage; the Claimant — like OTH in the Claimant's theory — would have incurred no damage
as it “did not have ultimate control of those payments” and would merely have transferred
them upstream. The Claimant's and its expert's views that only the Claimant suffered harm as
a result of the unpaid OTA dividends must thus be rejected. To the contrary, in the Tribunal's
view, the Claimant's claims for damages in relation to the dividends are identical to, and
necessarily contained in, OTH's claims in the OTH Arbitration. Absent Algeria’s allegedly
wrongful measures, any dividends would necessarily have been paid to the Claimant through
OTH.

Third, the Claimant claims “damages due to incremental payments that Claimant was
obligated to pay to certain private equity investors [...] because of the decrease in the value of

Weather Investments, of which Claimant was the majority owner”.’8° The Claimant contends
that, in order to effect the sale of Weather Investments to VimpelCom, it had to acquire
approximately 30% of the remaining shares of Weather investments from the company’s other
shareholders, as a result of change of control put options held by those other shareholders,
and sell this stake to VinpelCom at a lesser value.

510. The Tribunal considers that the claims in relation to this category of damages are inadmissible
because these alleged losses derive primarily from the presence of put options in an
agreement freely entered into by the Claimant. In addition, when the Claimant sold the
Weather Group to VimpelCom (via the sale of Weather Investments), the sales price must or
should have reflected any difference between the price paid by the Claimant to the Weather
Investments minority shareholders and the final purchase price paid to the Claimant by
VimpelCom.

511. Fourth, the Claimant seeks “consequential damages”, which comprise a number of sub-
categories. In Ms. Hardin's words, these concern the Claimant's “realized damages as a result
of incurring various costs in order to refinance its capital structure and prevent a collapse of
the Weather Group”.’°° Here again, these claims are inadmissible on several grounds.

512. The first ground is that the Claimant has not clearly alleged, let alone established, that it was
the Claimant, as opposed to other entities of the Weather Group, including OTH and Weather
Investments, which incurred these alleged losses.’*' Indeed, Ms. Hardin's first financial and
damages report, which discusses such “consequential damages” in greater detail,”°* treats
these losses as losses of Weather Investments and OTH, not the Claimant. With regard to

was ultimate parent, is causally linked to Algeria's unlawful acts” [...] “To avoid what in Karim Nasr’s words would
have been an ‘instant inferno’ in the Weather Group, OTH was compelled to obtain waivers from its financiers;
without these waivers, OTH would be thrown into default” [...] “WCSP1 [Weather Capital Special Purpose 1] had
to participate in the OTH Rights Issue - otherwise, WCSP1 would have suffered an event of default and collateral
call because the OTH shares it held would be worth substantially less after the OTH Rights Issue. To avoid its
own default, WCSP1 had to participate in the OTH Rights Issue in the same proportion as its shareholding in OTH

waivers, including, for instance, consent fees and increased margin requirements, as well as the Weather Group's
costs of renegotiating with OTH's financiers constitute compensable damage to Claimant” [...] “The costs OTH
incurred in seeking and obtaining the waivers from its financiers in 2010 are compensable damage, which CRA
calculates to be in the amount of $5.1 million” [...] “Claimant suffered damage relating to bridge loans taken at the

interference with OTA's ability to transfer dividends in 2009, compelling OTH to draw $150 million from other
bridge facilities” [...] “In April 2010, Algeria levied the Injunction on OTA’s bank accounts, preventing OTA from
making foreign currency payments. Consequently, as a direct consequence of Algeria's unlawful measures
against OTA, OTH was compelled to make payments on OTA’s behalf” (emphasis added, internal footnotes
omitted).

Weather Investments, Ms. Hardin states for instance that “[a]s a result of the lack of dividends
from OTA to Weather Investments and the potential risk of loan defaults due to tax
reassessments, Weather Investments had to undertake certain capital restructuring
transactions”;7°_ that “Weather Investments incurred significant transaction costs and
incremental interest costs associated with restructuring transactions at OTH, WCF, WCSP1
and WAHF entities”;7°* that “in June of 2008, the [sic] Weather Investments retired EUR 646
million of the WCSP1 Collateralized Notes. Later on, in April of 2010 Weather Investments
used proceeds from the PIK loan to retire additional EUR 150 million in principal”;7%> and that

payments obligations through bridge loans. But for the Algerian Measures, OTH would not have taken these loans
and would not have incurred resulting interest costs. OTH utilized two bridge loans totaling USD 500 million
during 2008. Proceeds from these loans were used to cover cash shortfall due to delay in transfer of dividends
from OTA to OTH. In 2009, as part of the Algerian Measures, the Algerian government allowed OTA to transfer
only 50 percent of total dividends which should have been paid in 2008. OTH entered in three bridge loans
totaling USD 150 million during this period. Proceeds from these loans were used to cover cash shortfall due to
delay in transfer of dividends from OTA to OTH" (ibid., paras. 253-255, internal footnotes omitted, emphasis
added).

the proceeds to pay down and cash collateralize the two OTH notes”, internal footnote omitted).

138

514. Notably, in Ms. Hardin's third report, filed after the Respondent had raised its jurisdiction and
admissibility objections, the wording in respect of these heads of damages changed to refer
indistinctly to the “Weather Group”.®°2

515. It is thus clear that consequential or refinancing losses, which may have been incurred as a
result of Algeria’s measures, were incurred by Weather Investments and OTH, and not by the
Claimant. Mr. Sawiris himself, when writing on behalf of OTH to the Algerian Minister of
Finance on 28 March 2010, confirmed that Algeria's tax reassessments and blockade of
dividends had forced OTH to search for funds as substitution for dividend income and that
“[t]herefore, OTH and its Italian parent company, Weather Investments, have had to raise
hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars in interim funding at a significant cost”.®° In line with those
statements, it is thus unsurprising that OTH made claims for financing losses and for costs
relating to the waivers in the OTH Arbitration.°°* To the extent those alleged losses were
incurred by OTH, they cannot be (re)claimed in this arbitration for the reasons discussed
above.

516. As a second reason for inadmissibility, assuming for the sake of the discussion that the
Claimant did sustain some of these losses “to prevent a collapse of the Weather Group”, these
losses must or should have been factored into the price when the Claimant sold Weather
Investments (which was below the Claimant in the corporate chain and held the other
companies forming the Weather Group) to VimpelCom. Indeed, assuming that the refinancing
was necessary to avoid the collapse of the Weather Group, these recapitalization contributions
increased the value of the group and thus of Weather Investments and such increase must or
should have been reflected in the sale’s price. This fact is also implicit in the Claimant's
valuation and damages expert’s statement that “OTH was the beneficiary of the actions
undertaken” to prevent the alleged “collapse of the Weather Group”.®° If OTH benefitted from
the refinancing measures undertaken to prevent the alleged collapse of the group, then the
value of OTH increased as a result and such increase must or should have been reflected
when OTH was sold (via the sale of its parent company) to VimpelCom.

517. — Fifth and last, in its Memorial, the Claimant initially requested moral damages for alleged
reputational losses, which were presented as “subject to further quantification”.®°° These

802 See, e.g., Hardin Third Expert Report, para. 3.2.21 (‘[i]n order to prevent a default of OTH, waivers needed to
be obtained from OTH's creditors. To obtain waivers for OTH debt, the Weather Group, on behalf of OTH, was

damages were not addressed in the Claimant's subsequent briefs on jurisdiction and
admissibility and were not discussed in the reports of the Claimant's damages expert. In
particular, they do not appear in Ms. Hardin’s third expert report in the section devoted to the
“damages that OTH did not sustain”.®°” In the closing submissions at the Hearing, this
category of damage was not further pursued either.®°° Nonetheless, in the absence of a formal
withdrawal of its initial requested relief, the Tribunal shall address the Claimant's claim for
moral damages. The Tribunal finds this claim inadmissible for the following reason. The
Claimant seeks to recover for reputational harm, if any, incurred either by OTH®9 or by Mr.
Sawiris and not by itself.21° In Mr. Sawiris’ own words, the Claimant is a mere holding
company which “has the sole purpose of owning and having a legal state and a tax status”,
whose activity “does not require a website”, inter alia because it does not wish to attract any
attention.8"' Under these circumstances, the claim for moral damages must be deemed
inadmissible.

518. In conclusion, despite the Claimant’s attempts to depict the damages claimed as
compensation for harm caused to itself, as opposed to OTH, the claims before the Tribunal in
reality seek reparation for losses covered by the requests for relief raised in the OTH
Arbitration or for losses that the Claimant (owned and managed by an experienced
businessman like Mr. Sawiris) must or should have factored into the sale of its investment to
VimpelCom. Under the circumstances, the Tribunal cannot but conclude that the claims are
inadmissible.

the private equity investors, were not incurred by OTH and were not claimed by OTH in its arbitration. As for the
other two heads of damages, there is a dispute between the parties as to whether the damages that we claim as
a result of the forced sale and for the loss of dividends, whether they are the same damages that OTH claimed in
its arbitration”).

b. The of the ig) the FNI, OTH and
VimpelCom

The settlement agreement of 18 April 2014 between the Algerian FNI, OTH (whose name at
that time had changed to GTH) and VimpelCom confirms and reinforces the conclusions thus
reached. The settlement provides for the sale of 51% of OTA’s shares to the FNI. In that
context, the parties to the share purchase agreement also put an end to all disputes opposing
OTA and OTH to Algeria.*'? On 18 April 2014, the day of the signing of the settlement
agreement, OTH and the Republic of Algeria suspended the OTH Arbitration pending the
closing of the transaction, pursuant to Article 7.4(a) of the settlement agreement.®"?

Specifically, the settlement agreement provides that at closing, OTA, OTH and Algeria would
put an end to their disputes before the Algerian domestic courts and the OTH Arbitration. In
particular:

a. Pursuant to Article 7.4(b) of the settlement agreement, “all claims that have been raised
in the [OTH] Arbitration by [OTH], on the one hand, and the Algerian State, on the other
hand, have been finally settled; [OTH], on the one hand, and the Algerian State, on the
other hand, waive definitively and irrevocably all claims that have been brought in the
Arbitration and/or that could have been brought in the Arbitration as at the date of
signing of this Agreement with respect to facts that formed the basis of the claims raised
in the Arbitration [...]”;

b. Pursuant to Article 7.4(c) (entitled “Bank of Algeria Dispute”), OTH undertook to procure
that OTA discontinue and waive all disputes before the Algerian courts in relation to
alleged breaches of Algerian exchange regulations and the actions of the Bank of
Algeria;

c. Pursuant to Article 7.4(d) (entitled “Tax Disputes”), OTH undertook to procure that OTA
discontinue and waive all disputes before the Algerian courts in relation to the tax
reassessments.

The settlement further specifically addresses and resolves certain disputed issues also raised
in this arbitration and discussed above, such as the distribution of the blocked OTA dividends.
Thus, for example, the settlement provides as “condition suspensive” to the acquisition by the
FNI of the majority of OTA’s shares that OTA must effect a dividend distribution to its direct
shareholders (amongst which OTH).®'4

After the closing of the share purchase (which occurred on 30 January 2015), OTA, OTH and
Algeria finally put an end to the domestic courts and arbitral proceedings, waiving all their
claims. In particular, OTA put an end to all disputes which it had with the Algerian authorities

and withdrew on 31 January 2015 from the proceedings before the Algerian courts.8'5 On the
same day, OTH and Algeria addressed the “Renunciation Letter” informing the PCA tribunal in
the OTH Arbitration that they had “finally settled their dispute referred to arbitration” in that
proceeding.®"® On 12 March 2015, the PCA tribunal issued a consent award recording the
above agreement between the parties, which put an end to the OTH Arbitration.®°1”

There is no allegation by the Claimant that the settlement was made in suspicious
circumstances (such as that it was forced by Algeria upon OTH or was entered into by OTH’s
board in collusion with Algeria). Moreover, it comes as no surprise that it was entered into,
inter alia, by OTH who also undertook a number of obligations on behalf of OTA. As already
mentioned, OTH was the “historical” controlling shareholder of OTA, to which the GSM
License was granted in 2001 (in the name and on behalf of OTA)®'® and which negotiated and
concluded the Investment Agreement in 2001 (in the name and on behalf of OTA).8'9
Furthermore, it was OTH which in 2009-2010 objected to the measures taken vis-a-vis OTA
and which sent the first Notice of Dispute on 2 November 2010. At all times, OTH was and
remained the direct and controlling shareholder of OTA.®”° For all of those reasons, it was thus
entirely logical for Algeria to negotiate with that foreign investor in the vertically integrated
chain of companies.

In these circumstances, the Claimant cannot bring claims in this arbitration that OTH decided
to settle, as the settlement clearly resolved the dispute that the Claimant has brought before
this Tribunal as is shown by the comparison of the notices of disputes above. The existence of
a settlement agreement does not change the Tribunal’s conclusions in relation to the OTH
Arbitration, as the settlement stands in lieu of the investment treaty tribunal’s award which
would have been forthcoming in that arbitration. The settlement agreement puts an end to the
dispute arising from Algeria's measures in the same manner as the award would have ended
the dispute. In the absence of harm which it incurred itself to the exclusion of OTH, the
Claimant cannot take over the dispute that OTH has settled. In this respect, the content of the
settlement, whether beneficial or detrimental to OTH/OTA, is irrelevant. What matters is that
the claims arising from Algeria's measures have ceased to exist due to the settlement
agreement.

Acontrary conclusion would lead to unreasonable results. Indeed, if, despite a valid settlement
reached between the host state and the direct foreign shareholder of the local company

affected by the disputed measures (also acting on behalf of the local company), an indirect
shareholder could bring or continue separate investment claims in relation to the same facts
and measures, a respondent state may well never settle a dispute amicably. Indeed,
depending on the investment’s ownership structure, it would face the risk that other
shareholders, present and future, direct and indirect, involved in the dispute or not, could take
over the settled dispute. In those circumstances, the provisions of investment treaties which
invariably encourage the amicable settlement of a dispute between a state and foreign
investors as a preliminary step to the commencement of arbitration proceedings, ®*' may well
remain dead letter.

In conclusion, the settlement agreement entered into between the Algerian FNI, OTH and
VimpelCom confirms that the Claimant's claims are inadmissible.

c. The relevance of the sale of the Claimant’s investment

The Claimant argues that the settlement agreement is not opposable to it, among other
reasons because it sold its indirect controlling shareholding in OTH to VimpelCom three years
before the settlement. The Tribunal cannot follow this argument. The fact that the Claimant
sold its investment does not change the conclusions reached above. If anything, it reinforces
them.

First of all, in the event that the Claimant had decided to remain in control of its investment
and OTH had been successful in the OTH Arbitration (a procedure that the Claimant caused
OTH to put in motion by causing OTH to send the OTH Notice of Dispute), the Claimant would
have had an award rendered in respect of OTH. In the same vein, it would have had the
settlement agreement entered into by OTH. In the absence of harm it has suffered itself as
opposed to OTH, any separate claims brought by the Claimant based on the same measures
would have been inadmissible if it had remained in control of its investment. This being so, the
sale of the investment cannot bestow on the seller more rights than it would have had if it had
remained as a shareholder.

Second, when selling its investment, the Claimant could have carved out from the scope of the
sale and reserved for itself the benefit of OTH’s claim against Algeria. Absent such a carve
out, the claim exercised by a subsidiary will benefit the buyer of the shares. In this case, by
selling the shares in a company granting control over OTH (Weather Investments), the
Claimant sold the claim that was attached to the shares in OTH.

This point was accepted by Mr. Sawiris at the Hearing:

Q. So you accept that you didn't need to sell OTH's claim or OTA's claim
when you sold the shares; it goes with the shares, right?

A. Yes.®2

dispute:

PROFESSOR GAILLARD: So as a businessman, if you sell a company
which has a big claim in it, the company is worth more than if you sell the
company with no claim in it, right?

MR. SAWIRIS: Yes, of course.

Q. Right. So in this particular case, you sold to VimpelCom a company -- or
the shares giving control of a company, OTH, which had a big claim
against Algeria; correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And that, by necessity, has an impact on the price at which you sell the
company; correct?

A. Should be, yes. 873

The same fact was acknowledged by the Claimant's financial and damages
Hardin:

PROFESSOR GAILLARD: And my next question, which is the question I'm
asking now, is: when you sell the shares, just the shares -- with no
contract, just the shares -- do you take into account when you value the
company, as a matter of methodology, do you take into account the claims
which exist in this company? Right? So it's a simple question; it can be
answered by yes or no.

A. No, it can't, actually.

Q. I'm not going to ask you to evaluate a company like this, which we don't
know anything about. As a matter of methodology, I'm just asking you
whether, when you sell shares which represent the control of a company,
you would sell them --

THE PRESIDENT: | find the question about a sale too close to a legal
question. But let me ask it differently. When you value a company, do you
take into account the claims as part of the assets that you value when you
set a value on the company?

A. Certainly when you're valuing a company, you look at these things. But
as far as the assets, you have to understand what's going to the new

seek redress for Algeria’s measures in relation to which OTH had already notified Algeria of a

company and what's not going. | mean, there are potentials for carve-outs,
that kind of thing. It's seldom a simple issue.

THE PRESIDENT: Obviously. Assume no carve-out, nothing special, just
you value a company. Do you take the claims into account?

A. | would take the claims into account inasmuch as | understood who was

going to end up with those claims, yes.°4
This being so, the Parties disagree whether the Claimant retained the right to bring arbitration
proceedings against Algeria arising from the events for which OTH had given notice of a
dispute in the so-called “Algerian Risk Sharing Agreement’ entered into between the Claimant
and VimpelCom on 15 April 201 1.825

The Tribunal is unable to find anything in the Algerian Risk Sharing Agreement that would
support the view that the Claimant reserved its claim in relation to past measures, i.e. the
measures that had occurred until April 2011 and which, as already noted several times, were
the subject of all three notifications of dispute. By contrast, a plain reading of the agreement
shows that the latter allocates risk concerning possible future events.

In particular, the Risk Sharing Agreement purports to address the scenario in which Algeria
were to acquire shares of OTA. The recitals make this clear by expressing the object and
purpose of the agreement in the following terms:

  

“B. The Algerian Government has jated several actions against OTA
and threatened to acquire shares of OTA”

“C. The Parties wish to hereby confirm certain agreements relating to

allocation of risks that may result from the actions referred to in B”.®6
Other clauses in the agreement confirm that the agreement only relates to uncertain measures
lying in the future, and not to past measures.®” Pursuant to the Risk Sharing Agreement, in
the event that Algeria had decided to acquire OTA after the sale of the investment by the
Claimant to VimpelCom, a mechanism was provided whereby either party owed the other a
certain amount of compensation depending on whether the price paid by Algeria was higher or
lower than certain price ranges. Importantly, this mechanism of compensation could only be

Recitals (emphasis added).

87 See e.g., Algerian Risk Sharing Agreement by and between VimpelCom and Weather II, 15 April 2011, Exh.
C-230, Section 1 (defining “Loss of Control Triggering Event” as follows: “the loss by OTH of title or control in
respect of a controlling stake in the share capital of OTA or the loss of all or substantially all of OTA’s assets as a
result of any action by the Algerian Government ... For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of the definition of
Loss of Control Triggering Event, the termination or revocation of OTA’s GSM licence, or the related frequency
permissions, as a result of any action by the Algerian Government, shall constitute the loss of substantially all of
OTA’s assets. provided that such termination or ion has become final and _no! in Algeria”,
emphasis added).

145

triggered by VimpelCom®S and was provided for a limited period of 6 months.®9 It is
undisputed between the Parties that this mechanism was never activated and thus lapsed.®°

537. Thus, the Risk Sharing Agreement is not concerned with selling or retaining the right to sue for
existing losses in relation to past measures. Therefore, the Tribunal’s conclusions that the
claim exercised by OTH was transferred to the buyer with the transfer of the shares is
unaffected by the content of the Risk Sharing Agreement.

538. In sum, the Claimant's sale of its investment does not affect the Tribunal’s conclusion on the
inadmissibility of the Claimant's claims reached above.

d. Whether the initiation of these proceedings also constitutes an abuse of rights

539. In addition to the reasons discussed above, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant's pursuit of its

claims in these proceedings constitutes an abuse of rights under the circumstances.

540. _ It is undeniable that “the doctrine of abuse has a role to play in the context of certain forms of
conduct in investment arbitration”, as Prof. Dolzer, the Claimant's international law expert,
recognized at the Hearing.®*! The doctrine of abuse of rights prohibits the exercise of a right
for purposes other than those for which the right was established. So far, the doctrine has
found application in investment jurisprudence mainly in situations where an investment was
restructured to attract BIT protection at a time when a dispute with the host state had arisen or
was foreseeable.®* No such situation is present here, as the restructuring of the Weather
Group resulting in the Claimant's acquisition of the investment occurred in 2005, long before
any dispute with Algeria was foreseeable.

541. However, as a “general principle applicable in international law as well as in municipal law”, °°?
the prohibition of abuse of rights may equally apply in contexts other than the one just
mentioned. Indeed, in the words of Sir Hersch Lauterpacht, “there is no legal right, however

828 See Algerian Risk Sharing Agreement by and between VimpelCom and Weather II, 15 April 2011, Exh. C-230,
Section 2 (“VimpelCom shall have the option at any time and at its sole discretion, from the Closing Date to the
six month anniversary of the Closing Date, to implement the Algerian Risk Sharing Mechanism with Weather II by
sending a written notification to that effect to Weather Il. If VimpelCom has not sent such written notification to
Weather II within such period, the Algerian Risk Sharing Mechanism shall not apply.”).

well established, which could not, in some circumstances, be refused recognition on the
ground that it has been abused”.

In particular, an investor who controls several entities in a vertical chain of companies may
commit an abuse if it seeks to impugn the same host state measures and claims for the same
harm at various levels of the chain in reliance on several investment treaties concluded by the
host state.®5 It goes without saying that structuring an investment through several layers of
corporate entities in different states is not illegitimate. Indeed, the structure may well pursue
legitimate corporate, tax, or pre-dispute BIT nationality planning purposes. In the field of
investment treaties, the existence of a vertical corporate chain and of treaty protection
covering “indirect” investments implies that several entities in the chain may claim treaty
protection, especially where a host state has entered into several investment treaties. In other
words, several corporate entities in the chain may be in a position to bring an arbitration
against the host state in relation to the same investment. This possibility, however, does not
mean that the host state has accepted to be sued multiple times by various entities under the
same control that are part of the vertical chain in relation to the same investment, the same
measures and the same harm.

In the Tribunal’s opinion, this conclusion derives from the purpose of investment treaties,
which is to promote the economic development of the host state and to protect the
investments made by foreigners that are expected to contribute to such development. If the
protection is sought at one level of the vertical chain, and in particular at the first level of
foreign shareholding, that purpose is fulfilled.®°° The purpose is not served by allowing other
entities in the vertical chain controlled by the same shareholder to seek protection for the
same harm inflicted on the investment. Quite to the contrary, such additional protection would
give rise to a risk of multiple recoveries and conflicting decisions, not to speak of the waste of
resources that multiple proceedings involve. The occurrence of such risks would conflict with
the promotion of economic development in circumstances where the protection of the
investment is already triggered. Thus, where multiple treaties offer entities in a vertical chain
similar procedural rights of access to an arbitral forum and comparable substantive
guarantees, the initiation of multiple proceedings to recover for essentially the same economic
harm would entail the exercise of rights for purposes that are alien to those for which these
rights were established.

With these considerations in mind, the Tribunal reverts to the facts of this case. At the
Hearing, Mr. Sawiris himself recognized that he used the protection granted by Algeria in the

834 Hersch Lauterpacht, The Development of International Law by the International Court (1958), p. 164, also cited
in Mobil, Jurisdiction, para. 172.

835 One could also refer to Rachel S. Grynberg, Stephen M. Grynberg, Miriam Z. Grynberg and RSM Production
Company v. Grenada, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/6, Award, 10 December 2010, Exh. RL-75, which although in a
different context (treaty claims v. contract claims) and based on a different legal theory (collateral estoppel or
issue preclusion known to common law jurisdictions), essentially relies on the same rationale of avoiding that
claims involving the same economic damage be adjudged twice.

836 This conclusion is without prejudice to the treaty protection that may be available to non-controlling, minority
shareholders.

different treaties at the various layers of the chain, for strategic reasons depending on the
circumstances:

[MR. SAWIRIS:] So when | was defending the interests of Orascom

Telecom [Holding] [OTH] only, we would use the Egyptian treaty, because

that’s the instance now that is corresponding, and it’s the direct. [...] Then

when things start to go worse, you say, “Listen, guys, it’s not go to end up

there. There is an Italian treaty, so the mother company can go”. Then

when | sell under the gun — and again | come to the different nature of my

claim [...] | used the Luxembourg treaty. 897
Indeed, as explained by Mr. Sawiris, the Claimant first caused one of its subsidiaries, OTH, to
bring claims against Algeria. Then, it caused a different subsidiary in the chain, Weather
Investments, to threaten to bring a different arbitration in relation to the same dispute. Finally —
after selling the investment — it pursued yet another investment treaty proceeding in its own
name for the same investment (its past shareholding in OTA) in relation to the same host state
measures and the same harm. Doing so, the Claimant availed itself of the existence of various
treaties at different levels of the vertical corporate chain using its rights to treaty arbitration and
substantive protection in a manner that conflicts with the purposes of such rights and of
investment treaties. For the Tribunal, this conduct must be viewed as an abuse of the system
of investment protection, which constitutes a further ground for the inadmissibility of the
Claimant's claims and precludes the Tribunal from exercising its jurisdiction over this dispute.

e. Conclusive remarks

The Tribunal wishes to stress that the analysis carried out above concerns the admissibility of
the claims for which relief is sought in this arbitration, as opposed to the merits of the claims in
terms of liability or quantum. Furthermore, the Tribunal’s conclusions on the inadmissibility of
the claims are the result of the peculiar facts of the case, in which (i) the group of companies
of which the Claimant was part was organized as a vertical chain; (ii) the entities in the chain
were under the control of the same shareholder; (iii) the measures complained of by the
various entities in the chain were the same and thus the dispute notified to Algeria by those
entities was in essence identical; and (iv) the damage claimed by the various entities was, in
its economic essence, the same.

It is true that tribunals in the past have adopted different approaches in relation to
constellations that may show some similarities with the present case. In particular, the
tribunals in CME v. Czech Republic and Lauder v. Czech Republic allowed the claims under
different investment treaties to proceed, despite the fact that both sets of proceedings were
based on the same facts and sought reparation for the same harm. The tribunals then reached
contradicting outcomes, which was one of the reasons for which these decisions attracted
wide criticism. This said, these cases should be placed in the context of their procedural
history, in which the respondent had refused several offers to consolidate or otherwise

837 Tr, Day 2, 189:21-190:13.

coordinate proceedings.®°* Moreover, it cannot be denied that in the fifteen years that have
followed those cases, the investment treaty jurisprudence has evolved, including on the
application of the principle of abuse of rights (or abuse of process), as was recalled above.
The resort to such principle has allowed tribunals to apply investment treaties in such a
manner as to avoid consequences unforeseen by their drafters and at odds with the very
purposes underlying the conclusion of those treaties.

In conclusion, for the reasons set out above, the Claimant's claims are inadmissible and the
Tribunal is precluded from exercising jurisdiction over this dispute. Given this holding, the
Tribunal can dispense with examining the other objections presented by Algeria and
summarized in section V.D.1-3 above, as a determination on those objections would not

WHETHER THE ACTS OF ENTV ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO ALGERIA

The Respondent’s position

The Respondent contends that the acts of the state-owned television provider ENTV (also
referred to as EPTV by the Respondent) are not attributable to Algeria.®°° ENTV is not an
organ of the state pursuant to Article 4 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility,*4° nor can it
be considered an entity exercising elements of governmental authority under Article 5 of the
ILC Articles.®" It cannot be deemed either to have acted on the instructions of, or under the
direction or control of the Algerian state pursuant to Article 8 of the ILC Articles. ®4*

For the Respondent, questions of attribution concern jurisdiction and not the merits.°° The
Respondent invokes Hamester v. Ghana, where the tribunal noted that “the question of
attribution looks more like a jurisdictional question’.°44 The Respondent notes that the
Hamester tribunal decided to deal with attribution at the merits stage solely for practical

reasons. ®45

551. The Respondent further argues that arbitral tribunals have confirmed that the issue of
attribution must be examined at the jurisdictional stage where it may be resolved “based upon
a limited enquiry” or has been sufficiently discussed by the parties.°4°

552. In this case, the attribution of the acts of ENTV to Algeria does not require the review of a
large number of documents and can thus be easily dealt with.®4” For these reasons, the
Respondent requests that the Tribunal decline jurisdiction over the claims involving acts of
ENTV.848

2. The Claimant’s position

553. The Claimant's position is that the objection concerning the attribution of ENTV’s actions
pertains to the merits of the dispute and not to jurisdiction or admissibility, unless it is “manifest
that the entity involved had no link whatsoever with the State”.649

554. In this case, the Claimant submits, the evidence shows that ENTV is a state-owned entity with
close financial and operational ties with the state. It is, therefore, appropriate to deal with the
attribution of ENTV’s acts with the merits of the dispute in order to allow an in-depth analysis
of all of the parameters of its relationship with the state.®° This is the more so as the
assessment of the Respondent's responsibility for ENTV's conduct as a matter of international
law will require a careful examination of many documents in their proper context.®"

555. In these circumstances, the Claimant concludes that the Tribunal cannot decide this issue on
the basis of the Parties’ submissions on preliminary objections without the benefit of further
pleadings and evidence. The Tribunal should thus postpone this issue until the merits
phase. 82

Analysis

In light of the Tribunal’s conclusion reached in section V.D.4 above according to which the
Claimant's claims are inadmissible, the Tribunal can dispense with resolving this additional
objection, as a determination on this point would not change the outcome of the case.

WHETHER THE TRIBUNAL HAS JURISDICTION OVER THE CONTRACT CLAIMS BASED ON THE
INVESTMENT AGREEMENT

The Respondent’s position

The Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the Claimant's “purely
contractual claims” relating to the Investment Agreement.®°3

As a preliminary matter, the Respondent submits that it is generally accepted that a BIT
tribunal has no jurisdiction over a pure contract claim.*** This applies to the claims based on
the tax reassessments initiated against OTA and the suspension of OTA’s bank domiciliation
by the Bank of Algeria, which are manifestly grounded on the obligations contained in the
Investment Agreement.®>

Specifically, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over these claims for three main reasons. First, the
parties to the Investment Agreement, i.e. OTA and the Respondent, have finally settled the
contract claims arising out of the Investment Agreement.®°° Second, the Tribunal’s jurisdiction
does not extend to breaches of a contract to which the Claimant is not a party.®°” Third, as the
Respondent further explains in its separate admissibility objection, the claims cannot fall within
the umbrella clause invoked by the Claimant, be it the one contained in the Treaty or an
umbrella clause of a different investment treaty made applicable by operation of the Treaty’s
MEN clause. Indeed, an umbrella clause only covers contract obligations entered into with the
foreign investor itself, and not with a subsidiary.

The Claimant’s position

The Claimant submits that each of its claims in connection with the Investment Agreement is
for a violation of a provision of the BIT.

The Claimant does not dispute that a treaty tribunal has no jurisdiction over contract breaches
that do not at the same time constitute breaches of the substantive standards of the BIT.®&@
However, the claims in relation to the Investment Agreement are for violations of the
Respondent's umbrella clause obligations under Article 2(3) of the Algeria-Denmark bilateral

investment treaty via the MFN clause in Article 10 of the BIT, as well as for violations of the
Claimant's legitimate expectations with respect to the Investment Agreement as protected by
the fair and equitable treatment standard in the BIT.®59

The Claimant observes that investment tribunals have repeatedly held that an umbrella clause
elevates contract claims to treaty claims.®©° The umbrella clause in Article 2(3) of the Algeria-
Denmark bilateral investment treaty covers “any obligation [the state] may have entered into
with regard to investments of investors”. The Respondent's obligations under the Investment
Agreement thus falls within the scope of the umbrella clause with the result that any breach of
the Investment Agreement constitutes a breach of the BIT.

The Claimant maintains that it is also well established that contractual commitments
undertaken by the state may give rise to legitimate expectations protected under international
law.8°? As the Respondent's measures in violation of the Investment Agreement frustrated the
Claimant's legitimate expectations, they amount to a breach of the FET standard guaranteed
in Article 3(1) of the BIT.®°

Furthermore, the Respondent's argument that tribunals generally refuse to exercise
jurisdiction over breaches of contract to which an entity other than the claimant is a named
party is incorrect. The Claimant cites to Continental Casualty v. Argentina and EDF v.
Argentina for the proposition that an umbrella clause may extend to contract obligations
entered with persons or entities other than the foreign investor itself.°6*

Finally, the Respondent's position according to which the claims arising from the Investment
Agreement have been settled by the parties to that agreement, i.e, OTA and Algeria, is
unavailing, as the Claimant is not privy to that settlement. In addition, the Claimant seeks
compensation for harm that was not suffered by OTA or OTH and could therefore not have
been remedied by any settlement concluded between OTA or OTH and the Respondent. ®>

Analysis

In light of the Tribunal’s conclusion reached in section V.D.4 above pursuant to which the
claims before it are inadmissible, the Tribunal may dispense with resolving this additional
objection, as a determination on this point would not change the outcome of the case.

WHETHER THE CLAIMANT'S UMBRELLA CLAUSE CLAIMS ARE ADMISSIBLE

The Respondent’s position

The Respondent argues that the umbrella clause claims in relation to the Investment
Agreement, the GSM License, and the Investment Code are inadmissible.

The Respondent first submits that the umbrella clause contained in Article 8(2) of the BIT only
applies to commitments made by one of the Contracting Parties to the investors of the other
Contracting Parties. In other words, the umbrella clause in Article 8(2) protects specific as
opposed to general commitments.®* It is also limited to commitments made to the investor
itself, rather than to its subsidiary or its investment.®8

Algeria bases its argumentation on the wording of Article 8 of the BIT, entitled “specific
agreements”, which reads as follows:

1. Investments made pursuant to a specific agreement concluded between
one Contracting Party and investors of the other Party shall be governed
by the provisions both of this Agreement and of the specific agreement.

2. Each Contracting Party shall at all times ensure respect for the
commitments which it has made to investors of the other Contracting
Party. 862
The Respondent invokes investment awards, among which Burlington, for the proposition that
the scope of an umbrella clause thus phrased does not extend to non-signatories to the

specific agreement.®”°

In this case, neither the Investment Code (which is an instrument of general nature, and does
not entail a specific commitment)®’' nor the Investment Agreement and the GSM License
(which were signed with and granted to OTA) fall within the scope of the umbrella clause in
Article 8(2) of the BIT.®72

Moreover, it is the Respondent's submission that the Claimant is not entitled to rely upon the
MEN clause in Article 10 of the BIT to invoke the allegedly more favorable umbrella clause in
the Algeria-Denmark bilateral investment treaty.®”? It considers that the scope of the MFN
clause in Article 10 of the BIT is limited to “treatment of investments [...] in the territory of the
other Party” and contends that “this restrictive language” distinguishes Article 10 from the MFN

clauses at issue in those cases in which tribunals have allowed the use of an MFN clause to

import a substantive obligation in a different treaty.°”4

The Claimant’s position

The Claimant submits that it is entitled to rely upon the MFN clause in Article 10 of the BIT to
invoke more favorable standards of protection in other investment treaties concluded by
Algeria, including in particular the umbrella clause in Article 2(3) of the Algeria-Denmark

bilateral investment treaty.®75

For the Claimant, the question whether the MFN clause in Article 10 of the BIT applies to
umbrella clause obligations is one of treaty interpretation and depends upon the specific terms
of the relevant treaty.87° The Claimant underscores that the Respondent omits crucial
language in Article 10 of the BIT, which provides as follows:

In all matters relating to the treatment of investments, investors of each

Contracting Party shall enjoy most-favoured-nation treatment in the

territory of the other Party.°7”
Numerous tribunals have held, so says the Claimant, that the ordinary meaning of the terms
“all matters” points to a broad interpretation. The reference to “all matters concerning the
treatment of investments” confirms that the scope of application of Article 10 extends to all
substantive standards in the BIT, including the umbrella clause in Article 8(2).°78

Analysis

In light of the Tribunal’s conclusion reached in section V.D.4 above according to which the
claims in this arbitration are inadmissible, the Tribunal may dispense with resolving this
additional objection, as a determination on this point would not change the outcome of the

case.

COSTS

Both Parties request an award of costs in respect of the legal fees and expenses and the
costs incurred in connection with this proceeding and have filed submissions quantifying their
fees and costs.°”9

The Claimant’s legal fees and expenses, including expert fees and costs, amount to US$
20,673,811.30, out of which US$ 10,144,900.68 were incurred in respect of the phase of the
proceedings dealing with the Respondent's jurisdiction and admissibility objections (the
“preliminary phase”).®®° In addition, the Claimant has advanced US$ 674,975.00 on account of
the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal and the ICSID administrative fees and
expenses. The Claimant requests that the Tribunal order the Respondent to bear all of the
Claimant's costs incurred during the preliminary phase of this proceeding. °°

The Respondent has incurred legal fees and expenses in the amount of US$ 5,685,622.02
and expert fees and costs in the amount of €116,764.32.%? In addition, it has advanced US$
674,975.00 on account of the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal and the
ICSID administrative fees and expenses. The Respondent seeks an award of the entirety of
these costs.®83

The Claimant argues that a costs award is warranted because a prevailing party is entitled to
such an award under the principle of costs follow the event and because the Respondent has
conducted the arbitration in a manner which has led to delay and increased costs. In
particular, the Claimant contends that the Tribunal should take into account the following
factors in allocating costs in favor of the Claimant: (i) The Respondent repeatedly expanded
the scope of the preliminary phase of these proceedings by raising new objections, even as
late as in its Post-Hearing Brief;®* (ii) the Respondent made numerous far-reaching document
requests, which greatly increased the Claimant's costs;®° and (iii) the Respondent failed to
comply with the Tribunal’s orders granting the Claimant's document requests.*®° The Claimant
submits that in light of the history and the nature of the preliminary phase of this proceeding,
its costs are reasonable and “not significantly higher than the costs Respondent incurred
during the same period”. °°”

For its part, the Respondent argues that the Claimant should bear all costs incurred by the
Respondent on the basis of the “nature of the preliminary objections raised by the
Respondent” and “the conduct adopted by the Claimant throughout the proceeding”.®° In
particular, the Respondent contends that, in allocating costs in favor of the Respondent, the
Tribunal should take into account the Claimant's conduct in the negotiation of Procedural
Order No. 1, the document production phase, and the negotiation of the confidentiality
agreement. 889

Under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, “the Tribunal shall, except as the parties
otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the
proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of
the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be
paid”. This provision establishes the Tribunal's discretion in allocating ICSID arbitration costs
and the Parties’ costs, including legal fees.

Two approaches have been adopted by ICSID tribunals in awarding costs. The first consists in
apportioning ICSID costs in equal shares and ruling that each party shall bear its own costs.
The second applies the principle “costs follow the event”, such that the losing party bears the
costs of the proceedings, including those of the other party, or that the parties share in the

costs proportionately to their success or failure.

In reaching its decision on costs in this case, the Tribunal has in particular considered the
following circumstances. First, the outcome of the case is ultimately favorable to the
Respondent, as the Tribunal has decided that all of the Claimant's claims are inadmissible.
Second, the Tribunal has also found that the Claimant's pursuit of the claims in this arbitration
amounts to an abuse of rights. These two reasons justify that at least a significant proportion
of the overall costs be borne by the Claimant. At the same time, the Claimant has prevailed on
the Respondent's objections on ratione personae and ratione materiae jurisdiction.
Considering the length of the submissions and the time devoted at the Hearing to those two
objections, the costs incurred in relation to these two objections were certainly significant.
While these objections were not frivolous and the Respondent was entitled to raise them, they
were ultimately rejected, and it is thus fair that the outcome of such objections be taken into

consideration in the Tribunal’s decision on cost allocation.

For the foregoing reasons, in the exercise of its discretion under Article 61(2) of the ICSID
Convention, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to apportion the costs in the following
manner. First, the Claimant shall pay the entirety of the costs of the proceedings, i-e., the fees
and expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal and the ICSID costs. The Claimant shall thus reimburse
the advances that the Respondent has made to ICSID. In this latter respect, it is noted that the

ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a statement of the case account in due course.

Second, the Claimant shall pay 50% of the fees and expenses which the Respondent has
incurred in connection with this arbitration, i.e. US$ 2,842,811.01 plus €58,382.16. In this
respect, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent's costs appear reasonable considering

the complexity of the case.

LANGUAGES OF THIS AWARD

In accordance with Section 8 of Procedural Order No. 1, the Tribunal renders this Award in
both English and French. This being so, it notes that English is the language in which this
Award was originally drafted. Hence, in the event of any discrepancy between the two
versions, the English version must be deemed to reflect the meaning intended by the Tribunal.

DECISION
For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:

a. The claims raised in this arbitration are inadmissible and the Tribunal is precluded from
exercising jurisdiction over this dispute;

b. The Claimant shall reimburse to the Respondent the amounts which the Respondent has
deposited with ICSID for the costs of the arbitration;

c. The Claimant shall pay US$ 2,842,811.01 plus €58,382.16 to the Respondent, as a
contribution to the legal fees and other expenses which the Respondent incurred in

connection with the arbitration;

d. All other requests for relief are dismissed.
