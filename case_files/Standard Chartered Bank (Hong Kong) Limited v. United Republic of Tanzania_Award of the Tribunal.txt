Understanding signed between Mechmar and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water Energy and
Minerals dated 27 August 1994; with Mechmar contributing 70% of the paid-up capital and
VIP contributing 30% of the paid-up capital for which “cash [USD 300,000 was] to be advanced

and maintain the Facility. The Implementation Agreement is governed by Tanzanian law and

contains an ICSID arbitration clause.®

The GoT also agreed to execute a guarantee, attached as Schedule 1 to the Implementation
Agreement (“Guarantee”), undertaking to pay to IPTL any sums owed by TANESCO under
the PPA should TANESCO failed to pay.?

(3) Facility Agreement

IPTL raised the majority of the funds by means of a loan provided by a consortium of foreign
lenders (several Malaysian banks) under the “Loan Facility Agreement relating to the 100 MW
Tegeta Power Project” dated 28 June 1997 (“Facility Agreement”).!° The loan was to be
repaid from the cash flows generated by IPTL under the PPA. The Facility Agreement

contained a non-exclusive English jurisdiction clause and was governed by English law.1!

(4) Security Deed

By Security Deed dated 28 June 1997 (“Security Deed”),!2 IPTL assigned all its present and
future rights, title and interest in and to the Assigned Contracts (which included the PPA and
the Implementation Agreement) to the lenders’ nominated Security Agent as security for the
loan. The Security Deed contained a non-exclusive English jurisdiction clause and was subject

to English law.13

(5) Shareholder Support Deed

By a “Shareholder Support Deed”!* dated 28 June 1997, Mechmar and VIP agreed to
subscribe to the shareholders’ funds of IPTL and bound themselves not to sell, transfer or
otherwise dispose the Shareholders’ Funds and undertook, inter alia, not to take any action

(6) Charge of Shares

By a “Charge of Shares” dated 28 June 1997, Mechmar and VIP charged their shares in IPTL
to the Security Agent as security for the loan and agreed that, in an “Event of Default” under
the Facility Agreement, the shareholders would cease to be authorised to exercise rights with
respect to the shares, and the Security Agent alone would be entitled to exercise such rights.
The Charge of Shares contained a non-exclusive English jurisdiction clause and was governed

by Tanzanian law.!5

(7) Lenders and Security Agents

The original lenders were a consortium of Malaysian banks.1¢ The Facility Agreement and the

other related documents were restructured between 1999 and 2005.17

In 2001 and 2003, IPTL and Danaharta Managers (L) Ltd (“Danaharta”) (which had
succeeded the Malaysian banks under the Facility Agreement) restructured the loan due
under the Facility Agreement into two new loans (“Term Loan 1” and “Term Loan 2”)
(collectively referred to as the “Loan” or “Term Loans” or “Loans”). These loans globally

amounted to USD 120 million.18

In August 2005, SCB HK acquired the Loan and related security from Danaharta under a “Sale

INTERNATIONAL PROCEEDINGS, TANZANIAN COURT PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER DISPUTES
(4) ICSID 1 Proceedings”°

On 25 November 1998, TANESCO commenced ICSID arbitration proceedings against IPTL
under the PPA, claiming that it was entitled to terminate the PPA on account of breaches by
IPTL, and sought for the tariff to be adjusted (“ICSID 1 Proceedings”).?!

The tribunal in the ICSID 1 proceedings (“ICSID 1 Tribunal”) upheld the PPA as a “valid and
effective contract,” but also ruled that IPTL could not recover certain costs incurred during
the construction phase through the tariff charges under the PPA. The ICSID 1 Award issued
on 12 July 200122 incorporated a financial model (Appendix F annexed to the ICSID 1 Award),
which was in accordance with the parties’ agreement and “was to act as the method for
calculating the tariff payments to be made by Tanesco to IPTL following the commencement of

commercial operations” under the PPA.23

(2) Shareholder Dispute and Winding Up Petition2*

After the ICSID 1 Award, disputes arose between VIP and Mechmar relating to the attribution
of the construction costs that the ICSID 1 Tribunal had decided were not recoverable. On 25
February 2002, VIP filed a petition with Tanzanian courts seeking the winding up of IPTL,
among other things, on the ground that IPTL was being “run as an incorporated partnership
(quasi-partnership)” (“Winding Up Petition”).2° IPTL applied to stay and dismiss this
petition. Mechmar commenced an arbitration under the rules of the LCIA pursuant to the
terms of the PSA. The tribunal in the LCIA arbitration ordered VIP to discontinue the Winding
Up Petition in its final award dated 26 August 2003 (“LCIA Award”).26 Mechmar then filed an

application before the High Court of Tanzania seeking enforcement of the LCIA Award, and

this application was eventually dismissed with “costs for Mechmar’s failure to prosecute its
case” on 31 October 2008.27

(3) Tariff Dispute2*

On 5 July 2006, GoT, IPTL and the Bank of Tanzania (“BoT”) (as the Escrow Agent) entered
into an Escrow Agreement, which established an account for GoT to pay into (“Escrow
Account”)? and maintain a two-months equivalent of tariff payments due to IPTL under the

PPA as GoT’s fulfilment of its obligation to provide security.

Following certain tariff disputes between TANESCO and IPTL, as from May 2007 (“Tariff
Dispute”), TANESCO stopped making tariff payments under the PPA and instead made

payments into the Escrow Account.2°

(4) Interpretation Proceedings and the Revised Administration Petition?!

In June 2008, IPTL started proceedings seeking an interpretation of the ICSID 1 Award
pursuant to Article 50 of the ICSID Convention (“Interpretation Proceedings”), which were
ultimately discontinued on 19 August 2010, following various events.?2 The Claimant sought
to intervene in the Interpretation Proceedings, but its efforts (so it contends) were frustrated
by the actions of TANESCO and GoT, which conspired with Mechmar to purchase the
Mechmar Shares in return for Mechmar withdrawing the Interpretation Proceedings.?3 This
is contested by the Respondent.** In this context, the Claimant filed two applications with the
High Court of Tanzania for the appointment of an administrator to IPTL; the first
administration petition was allowed by Mihayo J’s Ruling35 and Mihayo J’s Ruling was

overturned by the Court of Appeal in its Ruling of 9 April 200936 and then the second petition

25. On 15 December 2008, SCB HK appointed a receiver over VIP’s shares in IPTL,38 and later

appointed a receiver over Mechmar’s shares in IPTL.39

(5) Interim PPA“

26. On 16 December 2008, the High Court of Tanzania appointed the “Administrator
General/Official Receiver”, Mr T Rugonzibwa as the provisional liquidator (“First Provisional
Liquidator” or “First PL”) of IPTL pursuant to the Winding Up Petition.*1 In October or
November 2009, the First PL resumed operation of the Power Plant in response to power
shortages in Tanzania. The First PL on behalf of IPTL entered into an interim power purchase
agreement with TANESCO (“Interim PPA”) on 5 February 2010.*2

(6) PPA Arbitration*?

27. Following the discontinuation of the Interpretation Proceedings on 19 August 2010, the
Claimant initiated ICSID proceedings on 15 September 2010 against TANESCO to recover
sums under the PPA in its capacity as assignee of the PPA (“PPA Arbitration”). The tribunal
in the PPA Arbitration (“PPA Tribunal”) issued its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability on
12 February 2014 (“PPA Decision’”),** and in its Final Award dated 12 September 2016
(‘PPA Award”)45 found, among other things, that “payment out of the Escrow Account to
IPTL/ PAP did not discharge TANESCO’s obligation to SCB HK under the PPA” and ordered

(7) Proceedings in Malaysia and in the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”)*°

29. In August 2010, SCB HK filed proceedings in Malaysia seeking interim relief against Mechmar
alleging that Mechmar had breached the Charge of Shares and “threatened to sell the Subject
Shares [Mechmar Shares] to the Government of Tanzania.”5° The High Court of Malaya
(‘Malaysian Court”) issued an interlocutory injunction restraining Mechmar from
transferring the Mechmar Shares.5! Mechmar’s legal representatives informed SCB HK that
the Mechmar Shares were sold by Mechmar on 9 September 2010.52 Pursuant to an Ex parte
Injunction Order by the Malaysian Court5? ordering Mechmar to furnish documents regarding
the sale of Mechmar Shares, it produced the Share Sale Agreement dated 9 September 2010
entered between Mechmar and Piper Link Investments Ltd (“Piper Link”) (a company

incorporated in BVI).

30. Ms Martha Renju, in her capacity as receiver of shares of IPTL, then applied for and obtained
an ex parte order in BVI against Piper Link to deliver the share certificates to the High Court
of the BVI (“BVI Court”) and to take no further steps to transfer, dispose of or otherwise deal

with the Mechmar Shares pending trial.5+

(8) Winding Up Order and Setting Aside**

On 15 July 2011, the High Court of Tanzania ordered the winding-up of IPTL (“Winding Up
Order”) on the application of VIP’s 2002 petition (see paragraph 21 above) and appointed
the “Administrator General/]Official Receiver, Mr Philip Saliboko as the “Liquidator” of
IPTL.57

After the Winding Up Order, the Claimant, submitted a proof of debt to the Liquidator wherein
it stated, among other things, that it was owed by IPTL a sum of “US$ 125,970,570.67 for
monies advanced pursuant to the [...] loan Agreement [...] (including interest) together with
insurance premia and enforcement costs [...]’;58 and referred to “Security” documents
(including the Charge of Shares and Security Deed) which it highlighted secured “all monies,
debts and liabilities” owed by IPTL to it.59 Pricewaterhouse Coopers produced a report dated
March 2012 (“PwC Report”)® in its advice to the Liquidator, in which they confirmed the
validity of the loan, and made their conclusions on SCB HK’s security, including that SCB HK
“is a valid creditor of IPTL.”*! The Parties dispute the consequences of the PwC Report's

conclusions.®

On 17 December 2012, the Winding Up Order was set aside®? by the Tanzanian Court of
Appeal.** The Court declared all proceedings (viz. proceedings in Misc. Civil Cause No 49 of
2002 and Misc. Civil Cause No. 243 of 2003) a “nullity”; rulings and orders made therein
relating to VIP’s Winding Up Petition that post-dated the Claimant’s Revised Administration
Petition were “...quashed and set aside”, and ordered that Claimant's Revised Administration

Petition be heard expeditiously by the High Court of Tanzania. Consequently, IPTL reverted

On 9 April 2013, Mr Lutema served a petition on behalf of Mechmar to enforce the LCIA
Award (“Lutema Petition”)° and sought the discontinuance of Misc. Civil Cause No. 49 and
Misc. Civil Cause No. 254 of 2003.57 The Lutema Petition and the Revised Administration
Petition were consolidated on 3 May 2013.6 On 5 May 2013, Utamwa J in his Order dated 7

been acting for and representing Mechmar in various court proceedings in Tanzania.
Mechmar’s liquidators informed Mr Lutema that only the liquidators had authority to act for
Mechmar. 7! Mechmar’s liquidators’? obtained, on 16 April 2013, directions from the
Malaysian Court (High Court of Malaya) that they had sole power to act on behalf of

dated 15 August 201375 entered between VIP and PAP for the sale of VIP’s 30% shareholding
in IPTL to PAP (“VIP-PAP-SPA”), and on 30 August 2013 VIP also tendered before the High

Court the draft terms of order to be made by the Court.”

On 5 September 2013, Utamwa J granted this application and ordered inter alia that all of
IPTL’s affairs, including the PPA and the control of the Facility, be transferred to PAP
(‘Utamwa J Order”).7”7 The Utamwa J Order was rendered in the proceedings Misc. Civil
Cause Nos. 49 of 2002 and 254 of 2003 that corresponded to IPTL’s Winding Up Petition and
an application to set aside the LCIA Award, both commenced by VIP, and to which the

Claimant was not party to either of those two proceedings.78

The Utamwa J Order is one of the principal matters relied on by the Claimant in this
arbitration to support its claim relating to expropriation. The Claimant contends that the
reasoning is “inexplicable” and that the proceeding leading up to it was “unjust”, for several
reasons: (i) it was made without notice to interested parties; (ii) it was made without giving
the interested parties an opportunity to be heard; (iii) it was made in disregard of the Court
of Appeal’s judgment of 17 December 2012 described above; (iv) it was inconsistent with
Utamwa J’s own earlier order dated 5 June 2013; (v) it was made pursuant to the VIP-PAP-
SPA notwithstanding the fact that the assertion in the VIP-PAP-SPA that PAP purchased the
Mechmar Shares in 2011 was contrary to the evidence; (vi) it was made with the express
consent of the Second PL, who was on notice of SCB HK’s rights; and (vii) it did not explain
the legal basis on which control of IPTL and its assets could be passed to PAP on the

application of VIP (as minority shareholder), without reference to SCB HK’s rights.79

The Respondent rejects these contentions.®° According to the Respondent, SCB HK, despite
not being a party to Misc. Civil Cause Nos. 49 of 2002 and 254 of 2003, was put on notice and
granted an opportunity to monitor the proceedings and, if it had wished to do so, file a

petition to intervene in those proceedings and counter VIP’s application to withdraw the

In December 2013, Standard Chartered Bank Malaysia Berhad and SCB HK started

confirmation of the validity of SCB HK’s loan to IPTL and of its security over that loan.

IPTL, VIP and PAP raised jurisdictional challenges, which were rejected by Flaux J, and on 16
November 2016,%3 Flaux J declared inter alia that: (i) the Facility Agreement, Security Deed,
Shareholder Support Deed, and Charge of Shares were valid; (ii) Standard Chartered Bank
Malaysia Berhad had been the Facility Agent since 21 October 2005; (iii) SCB HK had been
the Security Agent since 4 December 2009; and (iv) all the rights, title and interest of the
banks under the Facility Agreement, the Security Deed, the Shareholder Support Deed and
the Charge of Shares became vested in SCB HK with effect from 17 August 2005 “as assignee
of Danaharta pursuant to the Deed of Assignment [...]; and with effect from 25% October 2005,

as sole Bank pursuant to the Novation Notice.”®*

Post-2013 IPTL EvENTS

(4) PAP’s Registration as Owner of Mechmar’s Shareholding in IPTL

On 6 September 2013, PAP replaced the board of directors of IPTL with its own nominees
(including Mr Sethi) as “First Directors Post Provision Liquidation” and transferred VIP’s 30%
shareholding and Mechmar’s 70% shareholding to itself. This was registered with the

Business Registrations and Licensing Agency of Tanzania (“BRELA”).85

(2) Payment of the Funds Held in the Escrow Account to PAP

44, In October 2013, TANESCO and IPTL entered into a settlement agreement with regard to the
Tariff Dispute.8¢

45. On 21 October 2013, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Energy and Minerals (“PS
MEM”), on behalf of the Government of Tanzania and IPTL (controlled by PAP) entered into
an “Agreement for Delivery of Funds to [IPTL]’.8”

46. On 28 November and 6 December 2013, the funds of the Escrow Account were transferred to
PAP.®8 The Claimant contends that PAP used USD 75 million of the funds obtained from the
Escrow Account to pay VIP’s 30% shareholding in IPTL instead of using it to satisfy
TANESCO’s payment obligations to SCB HK under the PPA and to pay down the loan.®°

(3) Investigations in Tanzania

47. The actions of the GoT and TANESCO led to a number of investigations in Tanzania, including
a report submitted by the Auditor General to the Speaker’s office of the Tanzanian Parliament
on 14 November 2014 (“CAG Report”)! and a report by the Public Accounts Committee on
17 November 2014 (“PAC Report”).°2 The Parties dispute the evidentiary relevance of these

reports and interpret their contents differently.°3

remained undischarged.°*

Facility Agreement, which as at the date of these Post-Hearing
Submissions is US$187,269,605; and

vii. an order that, to the extent not covered by the relief granted under
point vi above, the United Republic of Tanzania pay the cost of these

September 2018 requests the Tribunal to:

(i) decline to exercise jurisdiction in the present case;

(ii) to the extent that the Tribunal proceeds to examine the merits of the
case, dismiss Claimant's claims in their entirety;

(iii) declare that Respondent owes no damages or compensation to
Claimant; and

(iv) order Claimant to pay the totality of costs relating to this
Arbitration.

JURISDICTION

The Respondent raises several grounds to challenge the Claimant’s standing in this
arbitration. It says firstly that the Claimant lacks capacity to make any claim as it is neither a
legal assignee under the Implementation Agreement (discussed at paragraphs 57 to 106
below) nor has it satisfied the requirements of Tanzanian law as a statutory assignee
(discussed at paragraphs 107 to 175 below). It also asserts that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction
ratione personae and ratione materiae under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention (discussed at

paragraphs 176 to 252 below).

THE CLAIMANT'S STATUS AS A LEGAL ASSIGNEE

The Claimant brings its claim against the Respondent as the assignee of IPTL's rights under
the Implementation Agreement, which rights it submits were assigned to the Security Agent
(now the Claimant) pursuant to the Security Deed. The Claimant argues that, as the statutory
assignee of IPTL’s rights under the Implementation Agreement, it can step into the shoes of

IPTL and directly enforce IPTL's rights against the Respondent.

The Respondent raises two main grounds of challenge in this respect. First, it argues that the
assignment is ineffective as the IPTL did not obtain the Respondent’s consent to the initial
and successive assignments of IPTL’s rights, as required under Article 15 of the
Implementation Agreement.1 This is described by the Respondent as the “Contractual
Assignment’ issue. Second, the Respondent argues that the Claimant is not a valid assignee
under Tanzanian Law, as the Claimant is not a statutory assignee for failing to comply with
the requirements contemplated under the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 (“Judicature
Act 1873”)'°! in each of the successive assignments. The Respondent terms this as the
“Statutory Assignment’ issue. Third, the Respondent raises the “non-registration” issue as to
whether the assignment of the rights to the Implementation Agreement was a registrable
charge and the impact of its undisputed non-registration. Fourth, the Respondent submits
that the assignment was made void by reason of it being a disposition of property after

commencement of IPTL’s winding up proceedings, or the “Winding-up Issue.” 10

Asummary of the Parties’ arguments and the Tribunal’s analysis on these issues are set out

below.

(4) Contractual Assignment

Articles 15.1 and 15.2(a) of the Implementation Agreement” provide as follows:
15.1 Assignment

No assignment or transfer by a Party of this Agreement or such Party’s
rights or obligations hereunder shall be effective without the prior
written consent of the other Party.

15.2 Creation of Security

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 15.1, for the purpose of
financing the construction and operation of the Facility, the Company
may, upon prior written approval of the GOT, whose consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, assign or create a security interest to the
Lenders pursuant to the Financing Documents in, its rights and interests
under or pursuant to:

@ this Agreement;

(ii) any agreement included within the Security Package;

(iii) the Facility;

(iv) the Site;

@) the movable property and intellectual property of the Company;
or

(vi) the revenues or any of the rights or assets of the Company.

a. Parties’ Submissions

The Respondent contends that it has never provided either its “prior written consent”
pursuant to Article 15.1 of the Implementation Agreement or its “prior written approval”
pursuant to Article 15.2 of the Implementation Agreement, to any of the purported
assignments of the Implementation Agreement, and that therefore SCB HK is not a valid
assignee of IPTL’s rights under the Implementation Agreement. Further, the Respondent
submits that if properly construed, Articles 15.1 and 15.2 of the Implementation Agreement
both expressly require consent, with the consequence that lack of consent invalidates an
assignment.105 Also, the Respondent argues that the failure to obtain such consent renders
any assignment ineffective as against GoT.1°% The Respondent rejects the Claimant's
contentions that it had been estopped from asserting that no prior consent was given when
it maintained silence when notified of the assignment to the Lenders in 1997. In its view, GoT
had no “duty to speak”, and, in any event, estoppel could only be personal to “the parties and
their privies”. SCB HK therefore could not take the benefit of an estoppel.!°7 The Respondent
also rejects the Claimant's assertion that that Article 15.2(a) should be interpreted as a mere

undertaking not to assign, the breach of which would only result in damages.108

The Respondent relies, inter alia, on Linden Gardens Trust Limited v Lenesta Sludge Disposals
Limited, [1994] 1 AC 85 (“Linden Gardens”),'° which sets out four possible effects of a
contractual prohibition on assignments, depending on the construction of the clause in
question. This could be: “(i) a mere personal undertaking having no effect on the validity of the
assignment, with a breach sounding only in damages; (ii) a stipulation that the assignment is to
be ineffective against the debtor without affecting relations between assignor and assignee inter
se; (iii) a purported bar even on the transfer of ownership of the right or its fruits as between
assignor and assignee; or (iv) a stipulation, the breach of which is to entitle the debtor not

merely to recover damages but to terminate the contract.”110

The Respondent places emphasis on Lord Browne-Wilkinson’s observation in Linden Gardens
that categories (i) and (iv) are “very unlikely to occur’!!! in support of its contention that
Article 15.2(a) is nota mere undertaking not to assign. It takes the view that it would be unfair
to interpret Article 15.2(a) as an undertaking not to assign, because breach of such a
provision would be unlikely to lead to any recoverable damage, allowing the Claimant to

breach the provision with little risk of consequences.112

The Respondent argues that the commercial reason for a prohibition on an assignment of a
contract is that a contracting party has a genuine commercial interest in knowing the identity
of the party who can decide to sue him. Where a party is a sovereign State, this interest
amounts to a matter of national security and public policy.1!3 The Respondent would have a
genuine and legitimate interest in, and concern about, the identity, nature and nationality of
its contractual counterparties, particularly in relation to a power generation project such as

the Facility.114

In addition, according to the Respondent, the Respondent was not a party to and had no

negotiating power over the provisions of the Security Deed and the other financing

documents. The Respondent submits that the only effective protection for the Respondent to
be able to control future assignments and to protect itself in that review and approval process
was the inclusion of the provisions of Article 15.1 and 15.2(a) of the Implementation
Agreement.1'5 In light of this, the Respondent argues that Article 15.2 should be construed

such that lack of consent by the Respondent will invalidate an assignment.

Furthermore, even in the absence of an express term to obtain consent with every
assignment, this requirement can be impliedly read into Article 15.2(a) of the
Implementation Agreement. In the Respondent's view, every time a private party enters into
a contract with a “sovereign in relation to major infrastructure public utilities projects, it is
implied in the negotiations and the final agreements that the counterparty would not change

without the sovereign’s approval.” 116

The Respondent is of the view that its consent was never sought for the assignment made in
1997 to the original Malaysian lenders.1!? Consequently, it asserts that any subsequent
assignments by the lenders could also not be effective. The Respondent also submits that in
any event, all subsequent assignments were ineffective since the Respondent’s consent was
not sought for each of these.118 As a result, it argues the Claimant has no standing to invoke
the arbitration clause of the Implementation Agreement."9 Further, it submits that the
Claimant does not meet the contractual requirements of a Security Agent, particularly under
Clause 22(H)?2° of the Loan Facility Agreement.!2! According to the Respondent, the result is
that IPTL is the only entity capable of initiating arbitration proceedings against the

Respondent under the Implementation Agreement.

Finally, the Respondent argues that even if Article 15.2(a) of the Implementation Agreement
does not require its consent for the transfer of an existing security interest to a successor

Security Agent, the Claimant would still not be entitled to invoke the arbitration clause of the

Implementation Agreement, since the word “Lender” is neither mentioned in the arbitration
clause itself, nor in the definition of “Parties” or “Company.” In addition, the Respondent refers
to Article 24.6122 of the Implementation Agreement, which it submits expressly states that
the agreement “shall not confer any right of suit or action whatsoever on any third party, except
for the specific rights granted to the Lenders pursuant to Articles 15.2, 18.2 and 19.4.”123 It
points out that none of these provisions confer on the “Lender” any right to submit disputes

to arbitration.124

The Claimant relies on Linden Gardens as well, but argues that Article 15.2(a) of the
Implementation Agreement, on its proper construction, is an undertaking not to assign
without prior consent, breach of which sounds in damages. It distinguishes Article 15.2(a)
from Article 15.1, noting that Article 15.1 explicitly states that "[nJo assignment [...] shall be
effective" without prior consent while Article 15.2(a) does not use such language. In the
Claimant’s view, if Article 15.2(a) was intended to render assignments ineffective in the same
manner as Article 15.1, the Parties would be expected to have used the same explicit

language. Hence, it argues that Article 15.2(a) must be an undertaking not to assign. 125

Further, the Claimant submits that Article 15.2(a) of the Implementation Agreement does not
only restrict the assignment of (and creation of security interests in respect of) the
Implementation Agreement, it also applies to contracts to which the Respondent is nota party
to (such as the PPA and the Facility Agreement) and to noncontractual property of IPTL (such
as the Site, Facility, movable property and intellectual property). The Claimant contends that,
as a matter of law, Article 15.2(a) cannot render such assignments invalid; the most that
Article 15.2(a) can do is render IPTL liable to pay damages for breach of contract in respect
of such assignments. This according to the Claimant indicates that Article 15.2(a) must have
been intended to operate as an undertaking not to assign, rather than as a prohibition on

assignment.126

The Claimant points out!27 that GoT had been given Notice of Assignment of the
Implementation Agreement to the Security Agent in 1997, and that GoT (by the Ministry of
Water, Energy and Minerals) had acknowledged the same by, amongst others, countersigning
on the Notice of Assignment in the form essentially as contemplated in the Security Deed,128
thus constituting an estoppel or waiver!29 of the need for “prior” written consent. The
Claimant contends that the same conduct may give rise to a waiver or estoppel and that the
distinction between waiver and estoppel is more theoretical than real. In this regard, the
Claimant cited in support the English Court of Appeal decisions in Brikom Investments Ltd v

Carr!39 and Business Environment Bow Lane Ltd v Deanwater Estates Ltd.131

As for the Respondent's interest in controlling the identity of lenders in light of broader public
policy concerns, the Claimant contends that these alleged concerns are subjective and after-
the-event statements of the Respondent's motivations in agreeing to Article 15.2(a) of the
Implementation Agreement. It notes IPTL’s conflicting subjective interest - that of having the
ability to raise finance (including providing security) with minimal interference from the
Respondent - and takes the view that the construction of Article 15.2(a) depends on the
objective intention as to what the Parties agreed, as evidenced by the language of Article
15.2(a).132

Additionally, the Claimant argues that the fact that the PPA permitted its assignment to
lenders without prior consent shows that the identity of the lenders to the project as a whole
was not critical to GoT and TANESCO. This is particularly since the PPA was negotiated in the
presence of GoT representatives.133 Further, the Claimant argues that Article 15.2(a) of the
Implementation Agreement cannot operate to invalidate the assignment of contracts to
which GoT is not a party. According to the Claimant, regardless of whether Article 15.2(a)

operates as an undertaking not to assign or a prohibition on assignment in respect of the

Implementation Agreement, it cannot prevent the lenders from taking control of the Facility
pursuant to security granted by IPTL to the lenders in respect of the PPA, the Site and the
Facility. In the Claimant's view, the argument that Article 15.2(a) of the Implementation
Agreement must be interpreted as a prohibition on assignment in order to control the
identity of the lenders is misconceived, because the provision, however it is interpreted,

cannot achieve that outcome.134

Further, the Claimant argues that, as a matter of general principle, there is no reason why a
breach of an undertaking not to assign would be unlikely to lead to recoverable damages, and
hence this should not be a reason to not construe Article 15.2 as an undertaking not to assign.
In the present case, it so happens that the Respondent demonstrated by its conduct in 1997
that it would have given prior consent to the assignment had it been requested, so there is no

loss and hence no recoverable damages.135

The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s contention that every time a private party contracts
with a sovereign in relation to major infrastructure public utilities projects, there is an
implied term that the counterparty will not change without the sovereign's approval. It notes
that the Respondent has provided no expert evidence or authority in support of this, nor any
explanation of how this satisfies recognised tests for the implication of terms. Further, since
Articles 15.1 and 15.2(a) already expressly address the assignment of the Implementation

Agreement, there is no room to imply a further consent requirement into the contract. 136

Finally, the Claimant takes the view that no consent is required for subsequent
assignments,'37 and that it meets the contractual requirements of a Security Agent.138 As for
the Respondent’s argument that the assignee cannot invoke the arbitration clause because
the arbitration clause refers only to "Parties" and does not refer to the "Lenders", according
to the Claimant, this argument is wrong and reflects a misunderstanding of the law of
assignment. The Claimant submits that the effect of a statutory assignment is that the
assignee (SCB HK) becomes the legal owner of the benefit of the assigned contract and is

entitled to exercise the assignor’s rights under the contract, including the right to invoke the

clause only refers to the assignor and does not mention the assignee, because the assignee is
stepping into the shoes of the assignor.139
b. Tribunal’s Analysis
(@) From Original Lenders to Danaharta
The Implementation Agreement was entered into by GoT as part of the package of incentives

and assurances that GoT had given to IPTL to undertake the Project.

On 28 June 1997, IPTL and a syndicate of Malaysian banks entered into the Facility
Agreement.!#0 IPTL was the borrower of the USD 105,000,000 Loan Facility Agreement
relating to the 100 MW Tegata Power Project.

The banks under the Facility Agreement were:

i, Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Berhad, Kuala Lumpur (“BBMB”);

ii. Sime Bank Berhad, Kuala Lumpur (“Sime Bank”);

iii, BBMB International Bank (L) Ltd, Labuan (“BBMB International”); and
iv. SIME International Bank (L) Ltd, Labuan (“Sime International”).

BBMB was the Facility Agent and Sime Bank Berhad (Singapore Main Office) (“Sime

Singapore”) was the Security Agent.!41

A Security Deed!#2 was simultaneously executed under which IPTL assigned to the Security
Agent “all its present and future right, title and interest in and to the Assigned Contracts [...]’.

Amongst the Assigned Contracts was the Implementation Agreement.143

The Parties do not dispute that no “prior” written consent was given by GoT to assign any of

IPTL's rights under the Implementation Agreement.

On 3 October 1997, the Notice of Assignment of the Implementation Agreement was given

and acknowledged by the Ministry of Water, Energy and Minerals.14+

The Respondent had, in its Post-Hearing Brief, remarked #5 that how Danaharta had acquired

its interest in the Implementation Agreement needed to be explained before the Claimant

could stake its claim as the assignee of the Implementation Agreement.

To address this, the Tribunal has examined the documents submitted and ascertained that:

iii.

On 11 January 1999, the Sime International underwent a name change to Danaharta
Managers (L) Ltd.146

On 30 June 1999, pursuant to the Order of the High Court of Malaya at Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia,1*? the entire banking business of Sime Bank Berhard, in Malaysia, Brunei,
Thailand, Singapore and other countries, pursuant to a merger agreement between
Sime Bank Berhad and RHB Bank Berhad (“RHB Bank”), was transferred to RHB
Bank. The order has the effect of transferring the rights under the Implementation

Agreement, and the office of Security Agent (then Sime Singapore), to RHB Bank.

On 3 September 1999, pursuant to the Order of the High Court of Malaya at Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia,!*8 the court approved a scheme of transfer, under which certain
assets and liabilities of BBMB, its shares in subsidiaries and associated companies
(other than its Islamic banking business) were transferred to the Bank of Commerce
(M) Berhad (“BOC”) such that any BBMB instrument shall be construed as and have
effect as if for any reference therein to BBMB there was substituted with a reference

to BOC.

iv. By Novation Notice,!*9 signed by Danaharta and BBMB International on 1 September
1999, and by BBMB as Facility Agent on 15 September 1999, BBMB International's

interest in the Facility Agreement was novated to Danaharta.15°

v. On 30 September 1999, BOC was renamed as Bumiputra-Commerce Bank Berhad

(‘Bumiputra-Commerce’).151

vi. By Novation Notice signed by Danaharta (as New Bank) on 11 July 2001, and by RHB
Bank (Singapore Branch) as existing bank and by Bumiputra-Commerce as Facility
Agent on 16 July 2001,152 the interest of RHB Bank in the Facility Agreement was
confirmed as having been novated to Danaharta. RHB Bank (Singapore Branch) (Sime
Singapore, renamed following the 29 June 1999 Order!53) remained the Security

Agent. 154

Through these arrangements, Danaharta eventually had become by July 2001 the sole Bank
and lender under the Facility Agreement, with Bumiputra-Commerce (formerly BBMB)
remaining as the Facility Agent and RHB Bank Singapore) (formerly Sime Singapore) as

Security Agent.

It is clear to the Tribunal that Danaharta (formerly Sime International) was not a stranger to
this transaction nor to GoT. It was an original lender (a “Bank” and “Secured Creditor” as
defined in the Facility Agreement which definitions are adopted by the Security Deed) 155
which had subsequently acquired the interests of all the other banks and novated all the
rights of the other RHB Banks (formerly Sime Bank and Bumiputra-Commerce (formerly
BBMB)). There is no doubt in the Tribunal’s mind that Danaharta acquired the full legal and
beneficial title including the rights under the Security Deed and the assets represented

thereunder, such as the Implementation Agreement.

(ii) From Danaharta to SCB HK

By a Sale and Purchase Agreement dated 4 August 2005,15¢ Danaharta agreed to sell and the
Claimant agreed to purchase for USD 76.1 million, the assets set out in the agreement,
representing the loans and interests outstanding due from IPTL and the associated security.
Upon completion of the Sale and Purchase Agreement, Danaharta executed a Deed of
Assignment (“2005 Deed”) in favour of the Claimant on 17 August 2005.15? The

Implementation Agreement was among the “Asset Documentation” assigned to the Claimant.

By a Novation Notice15* signed by the Claimant as the “New Bank” on 11 August 2005 and by
Danaharta on 17 August 2005, the Claimant became the sole Bank under the Facility

Agreement. RHB Bank Singapore remained the Security Agent.

By letter dated 22 September 2005,15° Bumiputra-Commerce resigned from the role of
Facility Agent and Standard Chartered Bank (Malaysia) Berhad agreed and signed the same
letter on 17 October 2005 taking on the role as Facility Agent.

By letter dated 29 October 2009,!® the Claimant removed RHB Bank Singapore as Security
Agent and appointed Standard Chartered Bank Malaysia Berhad, in its stead. On 4 December
2009, the Claimant became the Security Agent.161

The validity of the Facility Agreement and Security Deed, the transfer of rights and liabilities
under the Facility Agreement and the liability of IPTL under it to the Claimant have been the
subject matter before the English High Court!® and resolved in favour of the Claimant in Case
CL-2013-000411 with the holding that the “Security Deed has become and is enforceable in
accordance with the terms of the Security Deed” and that IPTL was indebted to the Claimant in

the sum of USD 168.8 million.

The issue of the assignability of the Implementation Agreement stands independently from
the English Court’s ruling on the validity and enforceability of the Facility Agreement and the

Security Deed.

(iii) Prior Written Consent for First Assignment

The Respondent's first objection is that no “prior written consent” was first obtained when
the parties entered into the Security Deed purporting to assign the Implementation
Agreement. It urges the Tribunal to take cognizance of the fact that the Respondent as a
sovereign State, should be made aware of and be given the opportunity to know who they

would be dealing with as a matter of national security and public policy.

As such, “prior” written consent is mandatory. The Tribunal has some sympathy with the
submission that GoT has a legitimate interest in knowing the assignee and the purpose or
need for such an assignment. In this regard, the Tribunal takes the view that such a concern
is fully addressed in Article 15.1 of the Implementation Agreement where any purported

assignment would be rendered ineffective unless “prior written consent” was given.

The words of Article 15.1 of the Implementation Agreement are clear. It is a prohibition that,
absent prior written consent, “[nJo assignment or transfer [...] of this Agreement” or the “rights
or obligation” under it “shall be effective.” The words clearly require that to effect a valid
assignment or transfer rights and obligations under the Implementation Agreement the
“other Party[’s]” prior written consent must be obtained. By this wording, GoT was assured
that it would not be dealing with any Party other than IPTL or such other person that GoT
approved, thus safe-guarding GoT’s national and security interest, as it has urged upon the

Tribunal.

Article 15.2 of the Implementation Agreement however, creates the exception, that
“Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 15.1[...]”, “the Company” (viz. IPTL), could “for the
purpose of financing the construction and operation of the Facility [...] assign or create a
security interest to the Lenders pursuant to the Financing Documents in, its rights and
interests under or pursuant to” inter alia, the Implementation Agreement, if IPTL had

obtained “prior written consent.”

It is clear from Article 15.2, that GoT accepted that IPTL would need financing for the Facility

and had, by this provision, agreed that for that purpose, IPTL could “assign or create a security

35

interest” in favour of its “Lenders” subject only to IPTL having obtained “prior written consent”

from GoT.

96. It is common ground that no “prior” written consent was given. It could not, however, be

disputed that “written consent” was subsequently given in the form of:

i, Notice of Assignment dated 3 October 199716 given by IPTL and Sime Bank Berhard
Singapore which was signed by the Ministry of Water, Energy and Minerals. In it GoT

“acknowledge[d] the receipt of the Notice of Assignment” and agreed -

“not [to] terminate the IMA [i.e. Implementation Agreement] except as
provided in Article 19.4 of the IMA,”

and

“send to the Security Agent, a copy of any notice required to be given to
IPTL pursuant to Articles 19.1 and 19.2 of the IMA.”

ii. Letter from the Minister of Finance dated 13 October 1997165 addressed to IPTL and
copied to the Prime Minister, Minister of Energy and Minerals, Minister-Planning,

Attorney-General, Chief Secretary, and MD TANESCO expressing that -

a

“In accordance with Article 15.2 of the Implementation Agreement,
all relevant authorities will agree to the execution of the
assignments of the Implementation Agreement, the Power Purchase
Agreement, the Licence and consents relating to the Project.”

b) “Unless you have been notified in writing by us to the contrary, all
Project agreements, approvals, licences and consents executed
between the Government and IPTL or granted to IPTL remain in full
force and effect.”
iii, Diplomatic Note dated 28 October 1997166 from the Tanzanian Ministry of Foreign
Affairs to the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs re-affirming GoT’s position set out
in (ii)(a) and (b) above.

97. These acknowledgments of GoT clearly recognise that it consented to the assignment of the

Implementation Agreement. The acknowledgements constitute both consent to the

164 HB/H/021/315: Notice of Assignment, 3 October 1997.
165 HB/H/022/316-317: Letter from Daniel Yona, Minister of Finance, to IPTL, 13 October 1997.

Malaysia, 28 October 1997.

99.

assignment and the relinquishment of the right to require prior consent. The consent is given
by GoT with express reference to Article 15.2 of the Implementation Agreement, and thus in
contemplation of the requirement of prior consent. This, in the Tribunal’s view, amounts to a
waiver by GoT of the lack of prior written consent. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the

absence of prior written consent by GoT is not fatal to the validity of the assignment.

The Respondent submits that even if the Tribunal should so find, the Claimant may not rely
upon an estoppel, because, under Tanzanian law, estoppel is personal to the representee and
may not be relied upon by an assignee. In its view, “SCB HK could not take an assignment of
the benefit of an estoppel.” As pointed by the Claimant this position was incorrectly taken. The
case cited by the Respondent!¢” to support its contention was not one concerned with
whether estoppel could be relied upon by an assignee on a representation made to the
assignor. In that case, the court was dealing with a lessee who had wanted to assign the lease
to a third-party and had meanwhile permitted the intended assignee to occupy and use the
premises and paying rent directly to the lessor. It was said that by accepting the rents, the
lessor had represented to the lessee that the third party was the assignee and would therefore
be estopped from denying that there was a valid assignment. This was rejected by the court.
In doing so the court made the statement that an “estoppel by representation is personal to the
parties” in accepting the rent payments made by the third-party it could not have made any
representation to the lessee. There was in that case no assignment to be found much less any
suggestion that it was a decision to the effect that an assignee could not take the benefit of an
estoppel. In this arbitration, however, it was GoT who had signed and acknowledged the
Notice of Assignment and returned it to the lender’s Security Agent. GoT could not now be

permitted to go back to say that it could not be relied on by the assignee.

In any event, even if it could be said that estoppel could not be established because estoppel
could be said to operate in favour of the original representee, the Tribunal nevertheless finds
that the consent of GoT given by its signing of the Notice of Assignment amounts to a waiver
of any lack of prior consent. It could not then be permitted to rely on any lack of prior written
notice to vitiate the consent expressly given. Such a waiver subsists notwithstanding any

subsequent assignment.168

(iv) Prior Written Consent for Successive Assignments

The Respondent’s second argument under the Contractual Assignment issue is that the
requirement for prior written approval was not obtained between 1997 and 2005 “for each
of the successive assignments.” It is the Respondent's case that the Implementation Agreement
is structured on the basis that IPTL’s rights might be successively assigned but that each
assignment requires prior written approval to be effective. In support of this, the Respondent
cited in its Post-Hearing Brief!% the case of Barbados Trust Company Ltd v Bank of Zambia
and Bank of America‘”® to suggest that a similar provision in that case had been interpreted
to require each and any subsequent assignment by each of the banks to first obtain “prior
written consent.” The Tribunal notes however that the specific provision in that case was
worded differently in that it required -

(A) Each Bank may at any time and from time to time assign all or any

part of its rights and benefits in respect of the Facility to any one or more

banks or other financial institutions (an “Assignee”), provided that any

such assignment may only be effected if [...] the prior written consent

thereto of the Borrower shall have been obtained (such consent not to

be unreasonably withheld and to be deemed to have been given if no

reply is received from the Borrower within fifteen days after the giving
of a request for consent by a Bank) [...].17*

The Tribunal notes that the issue before the English court related primarily to the
requirement for a request being made and “deemed consent” following a period of lapse. The
court was not dealing with the need for successive consents. In addition, the intervening
assignments were made to and by non-financial institutions in breach of the contractual
restrictions. There is, therefore, no useful analogical reasoning that can be drawn from that

decision to assist the case before this Tribunal.

In the Tribunal’s view, Article 15.2 of the Implementation Agreement must be construed by
the plain words and in its functional role as an exception to the prohibition set out in Article

15.1 of the Implementation Agreement. Article 15.2 sets out:

i, the purpose for which an assignment is to be allowed as - “financing the construction

and operation of the Facility”;

along with Respondent's PHB).

106.

ii. the permissible assignees: the “Lenders pursuant to the Financing Documents”; and

iii, the party required to seek consent: “the Company” (viz. IPTL was to be the borrower

under the Financing Documents).

It appears clear to the Tribunal that Article 15.2 of the Implementation Agreement
specifically made an exception for IPTL to “assign or create a security interest” as required
under the Financing Documents. To avail itself of this right to assign, IPTL must satisfy the

elements listed in paragraph 102(i) to (iii) above.

The Respondent has argued that the Implementation Agreement is designed so that IPTL’s
rights might be assigned on multiple occasions on the basis that the definition of “Company”
includes not only IPTL but also “its permitted successors and assigns.” Thus, when this
provision states that “the Company” may assign “upon prior written approval of the GOT,” this
ability, and this restriction on that ability applies to any entity that is a successor or assignee,
which had first obtained the rights through a permitted assignment. The Respondent’s
argument, however, ignores the definition of “Lenders” in the Implementation Agreement,
which is defined as “the lenders party to the Financing Documents, together with their

successors and assigns” 172 (with no “permitted” preceding the term).

In this context, the Tribunal’s view is that any subsequent assignment by the banks would be
an assignment by the banks qua lender holding the rights and interest of the Implementation
Agreement qua lender under the Security Deed and not as a “permitted assignee” of the
Company as GoT has asserted. It follows that any subsequent assignment by the original
banks to other banks would not require any further consent from GoT. In other words, the
carve out in Article 15.2 of the Implementation Agreement is that once the lenders acquire
rights, the lenders do not have to secure further approvals from the parties to validly transfer

their rights.

Counsel for the Parties spent much time on the consequences of non-compliance with the
“prior written consent” requirement under Article 15.2 of the Implementation Agreement,
arguing whether the same merely sounds in damages or would render any such assignment
invalid or ineffective against GoT. Interesting observations have been made in particular to

the English House of Lord’s decision in Linden Gardens. In view of the Tribunal’s finding that

172 HB/C/005/192-267 at pg. 196: Unsigned copy of Implementation Agreement (including Schedules), 8 June 1995.

39

107.

108.

the assignment of the Implementation Agreement received express written consent from GoT
under Article 15.2, the consequences for non-compliance with the prior consent requirement

under Article 15.2 of the Implementation Agreement requires no further determination.

(2) Statutory Assignment under Tanzanian Law

The Respondent has raised several grounds upon which it relies to challenge the validity of
the assignment in favour of the Claimant under the laws of Tanzania. These are discussed
under the following sub-heads: (a) requirements of the Judicature Act 1873; (b) notice of
assignment; (c) status of the Security Agent; (d) non-registration of charge in violation of
Section 79 of the Companies Ordinance; and (e) disposition in winding-up in breach of Section

172 of the Companies Ordinance.

a. Requirements of the Judicature Act 1873
(i) Parties’ Submissions
Clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed provides:!73

3.2 Assignments: The Borrower [IPTL] with full title guarantee and as
continuing security for the payment and discharge of all Liabilities
hereby assigns to the Security Agent [now SCB HK] for the benefit of the
Secured Creditors:

3.2.1 all its present and future right, title and interest in and to the
Assigned Contracts, including all moneys which at any time may be or
become payable to the Borrower pursuant thereto and the net proceeds
of any claims, awards and judgements which may at any time be
receivable or received by the Borrower pursuant thereto; [...]

The Parties are in agreement?” that the assignment of the Implementation Agreement to the
Security Agent pursuant to Clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed must comply with the
requirements of Section 25(6)175 of the Judicature Act 1873, the legislation applicable to

statutory assignments in Tanzania.176

176 Due to its enactment prior to 22 July 1920.

40

110.

111.

112.

The Respondent argues that the security interest created by Clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed
is not absolute as it is by way of charge only and, therefore, does not operate to transfer any
proprietary interest.177 Furthermore, it submits that on a proper construction of the Security
Deed, various provisions including Clauses 4.1, 4.2 to 4.6, 5.4.4, 9.3, 11 and 12 indicate that

the assignment was by way of charge only.!78

The Respondent also contends that the activities of IPTL demonstrate that the Security Deed
does not provide for more than a charge. In particular, IPTL continued to run its activities, to
issue invoices to and to collect payments from TANESCO for years after the execution of the
Security Deed,!”? actively participated in the ICSID 1 arbitration against TANESCO,
commenced the Interpretation Proceedings against TANESCO, and attempted to bring claims
against GoT under the Guarantee.!8° According to the Respondent, case law demonstrates
that an assignor maintaining its rights under the assigned contract up until the moment when
it defaults on its obligations vis-d-vis the assignee is a “typical example of non-absolute

assignment.” 181

The Respondent also refutes the Claimant’s attempt to rely on the PPA Decision, as the
Claimant has noted that the tribunal in the PPA Arbitration ruled that Clause 3.2.1 of the
Security Deed constitutes a valid statutory assignment,!®? and that counsel for TANESCO
expressly conceded likewise.183 The Respondent contends that this decision is wrong because
the PPA Tribunal disregarded key passages of the relevant authorities and TANESCO's expert
evidence. It maintains that the exchange between counsel for TANESCO and the PPA Tribunal
was unclear, that counsel did not concede, or did not intend to concede, the point, and that

the PPA Tribunal should not have reached its decision on the basis of this unclear exchange.18

Finally, the Respondent argues that the notice requirement was not satisfied as there are
doubts as to the authenticity of the Notice of Assignment, and the Notice of Assignment was

contradicted by various activities of IPTL as stated in paragraph 111 above.185

The Claimant contests the Respondent's construction of the Security Deed, taking the view
that various provisions of the Security Deed are indicative of an absolute assignment, while
others do not indicate that the assignment is by way of charge only.1® In particular, the
Claimant contends that the Respondent’s arguments are based on a misapprehension that,
because IPTL remains responsible for performing the assigned contract, the assignment was
not absolute. The Claimant draws a distinction between the transfer of the benefit of a
contract (an assignment) and the transfer of the benefits and burdens of the contract (a
novation).!87 Further, the Claimant contends that the Respondent fails to distinguish between
provisions of the Security Deed which relate specifically to assigned contracts, and general

provisions that relate to the broader variety of security created by the Security Deed.188

The Claimant disagrees that the activities of IPTL demonstrate that the security interest
created by Clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed is by way of charge only. In its view, the nature
of the assignment under the Security Deed is a matter of construction. Further, it submits that

post-contractual conduct is irrelevant to the construction of the contract.1®°

In any event, in the Claimant’s view, the conduct relied upon by the Respondent is not
inconsistent with an absolute assignment. The fact that IPTL may have carried out the
mechanical process of invoicing and collecting payments under the PPA does not mean that
the Security Agent was not the legal owner of the rights under the PPA. As for the ICSID 1
arbitration, that was brought by TANESCO against IPTL on the basis that IPTL was in default
of its obligations under the PPA. The Claimant submits that this was appropriate as IPTL
remained party to the PPA and was responsible for performing its obligations under the

PPA,190

Similarly, the Claimant contends that as the Interpretation Proceedings were to interpret the
ICSID 1 Award between TANESCO and IPTL, it was appropriate for the interpretation request
to be made by IPTL. As for IPTL's conduct in respect of the Guarantee, the Claimant asserts
that this has no bearing on the contracts assigned under the Security Deed, and the Claimant
has not sought to bring a claim against the Respondent under the Guarantee.!%! Finally, even
if post-assignment conduct was relevant, the Claimant submits that, none of the conduct

related to the assignment of the Implementation Agreement.1%2

As for the PPA Tribunal’s decision, the Claimant contends that it was a reasoned, robust and
correct decision.!3 According to the Claimant, the PPA Tribunal did not ignore relevant
authorities or expert evidence, and TANESCO also clearly conceded that the assignment was
a statutory assignment.!% Finally, the Claimant rejects the Respondent’s doubts as to the
authenticity of the Notice of Assignment as baseless, and maintains that the requirement of
notice was satisfied. The Claimant also notes that there is no requirement under the
Judicature Act 1873 that the notice be countersigned or acknowledged by the counterparty to

the assigned contract.195

(ii) Tribunal’s Analysis
Section 25(6) of the Judicature Act 18731 provides that:

Any absolute assignment, by writing under the hand of the assignor (not
purporting to be by way of charge only), of any debt or other legal chose
in action, of which express notice in writing shall have been given to the
debtor, trustee, or other person from whom the assignor would have
been entitled to receive or claim such debt or chose in action, shall be,
and be deemed to have been effectual in law (subject to all equities
which would have been entitled to priority over the right of the assignee
if this Act had not passed,) to pass and transfer the legal right to such
debt or chose in action from the date of such notice, and all legal and
other remedies for the same, and the power to give a good discharge for
the same, without the concurrence of the assignor: Provided always,
that if the debtor, trustee, or other person liable in respect of such debt
or chose in action shall have had notice that such assignment is disputed
by the assignor or any one claiming under him, or of any other opposing
or conflicting claims to such debt or chose in action, he shall be entitled,

if he think fit, to call upon the several persons making claim thereto to
interplead concerning the same, or he may, if he think fit, pay the same
into the High Court of Justice under and in conformity with the
provisions of the Acts for the relief of trustees.

The Respondent’s submission is that Tanzanian law requires that a statutory assignment
must comply with the requirements under Section 25(6) of the Judicature Act 1873 and that
“any absolute assignment [...] of any debt or other legal chose in action” must be: (i) an absolute
assignment and not a mere charge; (ii) in writing; (iii) signed by the assignor; and with (iv)

express notice to the debtor.

The Respondent asserts that the assignment of the Implementation Agreement under the
Security Deed was (i) not absolute but by way of charge only; and (ii) that there was no

express notice given to that effect.

The Tribunal notes that it cannot be disputed that in order to determine whether an
assignment is absolute or by way of charge only, one must analyse by the words of the written

assignment, in this case by the Security Deed.

In examining the Security Deed, the Tribunal notes that Clause 3.11%” of the Security Deed
indeed creates “charges in favour of the Security Agent [...].” Further, Clauses 1.1, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1
(3) of the Security Deed provide as follows -

1.1 “Assigned Contracts” means the EPC Contract, the EPC Performance
Bond, the O&M Contract, the O&M (Sub) Guarantee, the FSA, the FSA
Performance Bond, the IMA, the PPA and all Consents and the Licence.

3.1.3 by way of first fixed charge:
(i) all Book Debts;

(ii) all its present and future Permitted Investments, Rights attaching or
relating to Permitted Investments and all Assets hereafter belonging to

(iii) all its present and future goodwill and uncalled capital for the time

Assigned Contracts, including all moneys which at any time may be or
become payable to the Borrower pursuant thereto and the net proceeds
of any claims, awards and judgements which may at any time be
receivable or received by the Borrower pursuant thereto;

3.2.2.all its present and future right, title and interest in and to all
insurances and all proceeds in respect of Insurances and all benefits
thereof (including all claims of whatsoever nature relating thereto and
returns of premiums in respect thereof);

3.2.3. all its present and future Rights in relation to its Real Property
(except those charged by Clauses 3.1.1), including all Rights against all
past, present and future undertenants of its Real Property and their
respective guarantors and/or sureties; and

3.2.4. all its present and future Right, title and interest in and to the
Bank Accounts.

3.3 Ranking: The floating Charge created by Clause 3.1.4 shall rank
behind all the fixed Charges created by or pursuant to this Security Deed
but shall rank in priority to any other security hereafter created by the

45

124.

125.

126.

Borrower except for security permitted by Clause 4.2 and except for
security ranking in priority in accordance with Clause 9.3.5.

[ul

4.1(3) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof the Security Agent
shall not by virtue of the Security created by or pursuant to this Security
Deed be or become obliged or liable under or in respect of the Secured
Property or any part thereof:

(a) to perform or observe any of the obligations of the Borrower
hereunder;

(b) to make any payment or any enquiry in connection therewith; or

(c) to present or file any claim or take any other action to collect or
enforce any payment due to the Borrower or, by virtue, of the Security
created by or pursuant to this Security Deed, to the Security Agent.

There can be no dispute that Clause 3.1 of the Security Deed is intended to create a charge
over the Assets which when so charged constitutes the “Charged Assets” as defined in Clause
1.1., Clause 3.3 further provides for the ranking of the charges referred to in Clauses 3.1, 4.2

and 9.3.5.

The Security Deed thus makes a clear distinction between the charges created in relation to
the “Assets” as described in Clause 3.1 and the assignment created under Clause 3.2, which
uses the term “assigns” without any condition or qualification of “all its present and future
right, title and interest in and to the Assigned Contracts.” The term “Assigned Contracts” as
defined falls outside the scope of Assets contemplated under Clause 3.1. On a plain reading,
the Tribunal is satisfied that Clause 3.2 creates an absolute assignment and not an assignment

by way of charge only.

The Respondent in its Post-Hearing Brief also submitted that Clause 4.1(3)(c) of the Security
Deed was a “retention of rights by IPTL including the right to bring claims” as another
indication that the assignment was not absolute but one by way of charge. In the Tribunal’s
view this is incorrect. Clause 4.1(3)(c) is not a retention of right in favour of IPTL. It is instead
a reservation that, notwithstanding the assignment, the Security Agent is under no obligation
to take action to present or file claims against any other party. It does not, however, deprive

the assignee of the right to do so if it so wishes.

46

127. The Tribunal also does not agree that the mere fact that the Security Deed provides for the
continuing performance by IPTL of the “Assigned Contracts” supports the Respondent's
suggestion that the assignment could not be an absolute one. Such an argument ignores the
very attribute of an assignment as transferring rights and not burdens and obligations. The
Tribunal is satisfied that there is nothing in the Security Deed that qualifies or limits in any
manner the assignment of the Assigned Contracts (which by definition include the

Implementation Agreement).

b. Notice of Assignment

128. There can no longer be any argument that notice was not given by the Security Agent in a
formal Notice of Assignment of the Implementation Agreement under the Security Deed as it
was acknowledged by the GoT.!98 The Respondent could argue that there is a requirement
that at each and every step in the chain of assignments, leading to and concluding with the
2005 Deed from Danaharta to SCB HK, must comply with the requirement of notice to the
Government. The Respondent submits that a notice sent to the Government after the 2005
Deed would not only need to notify the Government of the details of that assignment, but also
of any earlier steps which had not previously been expressly notified. It also cites in support
the decision of the English Court of Appeal in E Pellas v Neptune Marine? to argue for “each
successive assignment [had] to comply with the 1873 Act.”20 In that case, the assignor of an
insurance policy taken out by the insured, had sued the insurer for the proceeds after the
perils insured had occurred. The insured had incurred unpaid premiums due on other
policies taken out with the insurer and sought to set-off these amounts against the sum due
to the assignee. The Court of Appeal rejected the plea of set-off even though the insurer
argued that it was prejudiced by lack of notice of the assignment prior to extending the credit
to the insured. Admittedly, the court was concerned with the Policies of Marine Insurance Act
1868 rather than the Judicature Act 1873. The court did nevertheless say in obiter, that - “[t/he
plaintiffs cannot succeed as assignees of a debt or chose in action pursuant to the Supreme Court

of Judicature Act, 1873, s. 25, sub-s. 6, because the defendants have had no notice of the

198 HB/H/021/315: Notice of Assignment, 3 October 1997.

133.

assignments [...].”2° Still, there is nothing in the statement to suggest that the each and every

assignment must require a separate notice of assignment.

GoT also quoted Lord Denning’s statement in WF Harrison & Co Ltd v Burke?°2 as support -

[T]he notice in writing of the assignment is an essential part of the
transfer of title to the debt, and, as such, the requirements of [Section
136 of] the [Law of Property] Act [1925] must be strictly complied with,
and the notice itself, I think, must be strictly accurate - accurate in
particular in regard to the date which is given for the assignment; and
even though it is only one day out, as in this case, the notice of
assignment is bad.

The Tribunal agrees with GoT that the mischief which the Judicature Act 1873 targeted was a
debtor faced with claims by assignees it did not know; the “key requirement is the full

knowledge of the debtor so as to avoid confusion.”203

The Claimant had at the hearing pointed out that GoT was notified of the Claimant’s interest
at the latest by 17 December 20092 when it informed GoT that -
SCB HK has also been assigned the Implementation Agreement dated 8

June 1995 (the “Implementation Agreement”) entered into between
IPTL and the Government of Tanzania (“GOT”).

The Respondent then took the position that this notice made no mention of when the rights
to the Implementation Agreement had left Sime Bank, or any details in between and therefore

fell short of the notice required under the Judicature Act 1873.

The Claimant had also tendered its letter of 3 December 2013205 in which it notified GoT of
the occurrence of certain “Events of Default” under the Implementation Agreement and in
particular that -

By a Security Deed dated 28 June 1997, IPTL assigned all of its present

and future right, title and interest in and to the Implementation

Agreement to the Security Agent in connection with a US$ 105,000,000
Loan Facility Agreement provided to IPTL by a consortium of foreign

lenders. The GoT was given notice of the assignment on 3 October 1997,
which the GoT acknowledged. Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong)
Limited (“SCB HK”) is now the Security Agent, having acquired the loan
(and related security) from the previous lenders in 2005. SCB HK is
therefore entitled (as assignee) to exercise all rights and remedies
granted to IPTL under the Implementation Agreement.

The Respondent maintained that this letter still left it confused as to how SCB HK is supposed
to have acquired the rights under the Implementation Agreement and that there was no

mention of the assignment from Sime Bank to RHB Bank.

From these documents, it is clear to the Tribunal that GoT had, at the very latest, since 3
December 2013 (if not by 17 December 2009) been aware that the Claimant asserted its
interest in the Implementation Agreement as assignee and the GoT could not therefore
complain that it did not know or had no notice of who the assignee was nor should it be
confused by any possible adverse claim by any competing claimant under the

Implementation Agreement. In fact, GoT has not identified any competing claim.

c Status of the Security Agent

The Respondent had also raised the fact that the Security Agent was changed from Sime
Singapore to RHB Bank Singapore and then to the Claimant. The Tribunal notes that (as
discussed in paragraph 82(ii) above), there was in fact no entity change from Sime Singapore
to RHB Bank Singapore. It was the re-naming of Sime to RHB following a merger sanctioned
by the Malaysian High Court. The change in entity of the Security Agent also did not occur in
2005 following the sale by Danaharta to SCB HK.296

This then led GoT to argue that when Danaharta assigned the rights to SCB HK, Danaharta did
not and could not have assigned its role as Security Agent to SCB HK. The Respondent further
argues that “RHB remained the Security Agent until 29 October 2009, when it was removed from
such position by SCB HK” and SCB HK became the Security Agent on 4 November 2009 by
naming itself as the Security Agent.207 The Tribunal notes that this letter2°* was not

communicated to GoT.

In this regard, the Tribunal notes that the Implementation Agreement was signed by Sime
Singapore as the Security Agent, but it was expressly described as -
[...] in its capacity as Security Agent under the Facility Agreement (the

“Security Agent”) which expression includes any successor appointed as
Security Agent.209

The role of the Security Agent as spelt out in Article 22 of the Facility Agreement2!° is
described as that of an “agent and principal” only. In other words, the Security Agent’s role is
merely to hold the security only on behalf of the principal lenders, following the sale by
Danaharta to SCB HK, the sole lender was SCB HK. According to Article 22(H) of the Facility
Agreement,2!! the right to appoint and remove the Security Agent lies with the “Majority
Banks”,?12 which by 2009 was only SCB HK and no other. In the Tribunal’s view, the change
of Security Agent from RHB Bank Singapore to SCB HK does not impact upon the right of SCB
HK as the assignee as Lender under the Facility Agreement and the assignee of the rights

under the Implementation Agreement.

The Tribunal is satisfied that:

i, the Notice of Assignment of 3 October 1997213 was sufficient notice to GoT of the
assignment by IPTL of the Implementation Agreement to the lenders and the Security
Agent;

ii. the subsequent notices of SCB HK on 17 December 2009214 and 3 December 2013245
to GoT were sufficient to inform GoT of the Claimant's interest as sole lender and
Security Agent referred to under the Implementation Agreement; and

iii, the assignment made under Clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed is in the nature of an
absolute assignment and not by way of a charge, compliant with the Section 25(6) of

the Judicature Act 1873.

d. Non-Registration of Charge under Section 79 of the Companies
Ordinance 1921

(i) Parties’ Submissions

It is common ground that the assignment of the Implementation Agreement to the Security
Agent under Clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed was not registered with BRELA as a charge
under Section 79 of the Companies Ordinance 1921 (Tanzania). However, the Parties disagree
as to the requirement for such registration, as well as, the effect of the non-registration on

the validity of the assignment of the Implementation Agreement.

Sections 79(1) and (2) of the Companies Ordinance 1921 (Tanzania) states as follows:

(1) Subject to the provisions of this Part of this Act, every charge created
after the fixed date by a company registered in Tanzania and being a
charge to which this section applies shall, so far as any security on the
company’s property or undertaking is conferred thereby, be void
against the liquidator and any creditor of the company, unless the
prescribed particulars of the charge, together with the instrument, if
any, by which the charge is created or evidenced, or a copy thereof
verified in the prescribed manner are delivered to or received by the
Registrar for registration in manner required by this Act within forty
two days after date of its creation, but without prejudice to any contract
or obligation for repayment of the money thereby secured, and when a
charge becomes void under this section the money secured thereby shall
immediately become payable.

(2) This section applies to the following charges -
(a) a charge for the purpose of securing any issue of debentures;
(b) a charge on uncalled share capital of the company;

(c) a charge created or evidenced by an instrument which, if executed
by an individual, would require registration as a bill of sale;

(d) a charge on immovable property wherever situate, or any interest
therein;

(e) a charge on book debts of the company;
(f) a floating charge on the undertaking or property of the company;

(g) a charge on calls made but not paid;

51

143.

144,

145.

(h) a charge ona ship or any share ina ship;

(@ a charge on goodwill, a patent or a licence under a patent, on a
trademark or on a copyright or a licence under a copyright. [...]246

The Respondent argues that even if the Tribunal were to hold that Clause 3.2.1 of the Security
Deed effects a statutory assignment, the security interest created is void under Tanzanian law
as it was not registered as required under Section 79 of the Companies Ordinance 1921
(Tanzania). It contends that this interpretation is confirmed by the PwC Report relied on by

the Claimant.2!7

The Respondent relies on the wording of Section 79, as well as Tanzanian case law, in
particular the decision of the Court of Appeal of Tanzania in Shinyanga Regional Trading
Company Limited and Another v National Bank of Commerce (“Shinyanga’”),?!* to support the
contention that the failure to register a registrable charge voids it not only against liquidator

or secured creditor, but against any creditor.219

The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s contention that Shinyanga was decided per incuriam.
It notes that stare decisis is an essential feature of Tanzanian law, and points out that in the
similar case of Marungu Sisal Estate Limited v CRDB Bank Limited (“Marungu’”),22° no appeal
was made to the Court of Appeal on the basis that Shinyanga had been decided per
incuriam.2?! It urges the Tribunal not to give weight to Flaux J’s view that Shinyanga was
decided per incuriam, because until the Court of Appeal of Tanzania overrules Shinyanga, the
interpretation of Tanzanian law is that that decision is binding law in Tanzania.222 Further,
any concessions made by TANESCO’s counsel in the PPA Arbitration on this point were made

in passing, and in any event, the Respondent is not bound by them.223

The Respondent is also of the view that the assignment of the Implementation Agreement
was a charge on book debts that should have been registered under Section 79 of the
Companies Ordinance 1921 (Tanzania). The Respondent asserts that as the PPA was held by
the PPA Tribunal to amount to a charge on book debts, the Implementation Agreement is
likewise registrable, because the two agreements were designed to work together and form
one and the same transaction. Further, the Respondent contends that the PPA Tribunal found
that Clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed as a whole needed to be registered under Section 79 of
the Companies Ordinance 1921 (Tanzania). Additionally, the fact that the Security Deed has a
separate provision addressing the assignment of insurance contracts, according to the
Respondent, indicates that the Implementation Agreement is not a contingent contract but a
book debt.224 Finally, due to the integrated nature of the Security Deed, the Respondent
submits that it is not possible to sever valid charges, if any, from charges that are invalid for

want of registration.225

Alternatively, the Respondent submits that, if the Tribunal finds that such security should be
granted relative effect despite its lack of registration, the Respondent contends that such
effect is confined to the relationship between the Claimant and IPTL and that the Claimant is

unable to derive any rights therefrom vis-d-vis GoT.

The Claimant argues that the assignment of the Implementation Agreement was not a charge
on book debts within the meaning of Section 79(2) of the Companies Ordinance 1921
(Tanzania) and was not required to be registered. While the PPA might be regarded as
entailing a book debt due to the expectation of capacity payments, this is not the case for the
Implementation Agreement. Rather, the Implementation Agreement is a contingent contract
insofar as payments only become due from the Respondent as damages or compensation, in
the event that the protections guaranteed by the Respondent are breached. 226 Although both
agreements are part of a suite of project agreements, they are fundamentally distinct in
nature.227 The security created by the assignment of the Implementation Agreement was not

a charge on book debts. Further, it asserts that the Respondent’s reliance on the PPA

224 HB/A/005/604-827: Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 191.

225 HB/A/005/604-827: Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 192.

53

149.

150.

Tribunal’s ruling is misplaced, as the PPA Tribunal did not decide that all security created by

Clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed was registrable.228

The Claimant also submits that to the extent that Clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed created
other charges which were registrable, and assuming that those charges are invalid for want
of registration,22° those invalid charges may be severed from the valid charge in respect of
the assignment of the Implementation Agreement. Further, the Claimant submits that this
was the position taken in the PPA Decision and is supported by pre-reception English
authority (binding as a matter of Tanzanian law), and subsequent English and Australian
cases. In the Claimant’s view, the principle of severability applies even when security is
created in the same instrument, arises in respect of the same project, and relates to the same
underlying property. This according to the Claimant is reinforced by the language of Section
79(1) of the Companies Ordinance 1921 (Tanzania), which distinguishes between the
“charge”, which will be void against the liquidator or secured creditor, and the "instrument...

by which the charge is created or evidenced, which is not so voided.” 230

Alternatively, the Claimant submits that even if the assignment of the Implementation
Agreement was required to be registered, or even if the charge created by the assignment of
the Implementation Agreement cannot be severed from charges that required registration,
the effect of non-registration is not to invalidate the charge against the whole world.
According to the Claimant, Section 79 of the Companies Ordinance 1921 (Tanzania) only
operates to invalidate registrable but unregistered charges against a_ liquidator,
administrator or secured creditor. It argues that this is clear from the plain language of
Section 79 and supported by English authorities.23! As IPTL was not in liquidation, and there
was no secured creditor with an interest in the benefit of the “Assigned Contracts”, the charges
created by Clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed remain valid. Further, it asserts that no reliance
can be placed by the Respondent on the position in the PwC Report on this point, because at

the time the Report was issued, a Liquidator had been appointed over IPTL.252

The Claimant also argues that the decision in Shinyanga is per incuriam, as it does not
properly reflect Tanzanian law, and the Tribunal is entitled not to apply it.233 The decision
ignores the plain language of the legislation, and it was made without reference to binding
pre-reception date authorities and other persuasive authorities, and nor is it supported by
Marungu. According to the Claimant, Flaux J correctly rejected the Shinyanga decision, and
the PPA Tribunal correctly held that the unregistered charge remained valid in the absence
of a liquidator. Additionally, TANESCO’s counsel did in fact concede that a failure to register
a registrable charge would not invalidate the charge unless the company was in

liquidation.23+

(ii) Tribunal’s Analysis
On the basis of the Tribunal’s finding that the assignment made under Clause 3.2.1 of the
Security Deed is in the nature of an absolute assignment and not by way of a charge, this
question requires no further consideration. However, as the Parties have debated this issue

extensively, the Tribunal will proceed to deal with them in the following paragraphs.

The key question that requires the Tribunal’s determination is whether the assignment of the
Implementation Agreement, even if it amounts to a charge only, is a “charge to which Section

79(2)” of the Companies Ordinance 1921 (Tanzania) applies.

From the list enumerated in Section 79(2), only the descriptive of “book debts” appears to be

the closest possible category into which the Implementation Agreement could fall into.

Under the Implementation Agreement, the bundle of rights that have been promised by the

GoT to IPTL could be described as follows:235

i. Article V: The “exclusive right to design, finance, insure, construct, complete, own,
operate, and maintain the Facility in accordance with the terms and conditions

contained in this Agreement and the Laws of Tanzania”.

ii. Article VII: Support of GoT to:
a) obtain consents from regulatory agencies;
b) use its good offices to support IPTL’s performance of its obligations;

235 HB/C/005/192-267: Unsigned copy of Implementation Agreement (including Schedules),8 June 1995.

55

157.

c) attach non-discriminatory terms and conditions to the issuance or renewal of

any of the Consents as are in accordance with the Laws of Tanzania;

d) take actions as are reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances to
ensure that IPTL receives the fiscal incentives, concessions, financial
arrangements, and any other benefits provided under the “Policy Framework’.

iii, Article IX (9.7): Avoiding “Double Jeopardy” - “Settlement or waiver in writing by

TANESCO of any dispute or breach under the Power Purchase Agreement shall be

binding on the GOT with respect to the identical issue or claim.”

iv. Article XI: Assistance with immigration controls.

v. Article XIII: Entitlement for imports and exports of items needed.

vi. Article XIV: Consent to open and operate Foreign Currency Accounts.

vii. Article XVI: Assurances against discriminatory actions, expropriation, compulsory

acquisition and nationalisation of capital or assets of IPTL.
viii. | Article XVII (17.7): Special compensation for Force Majeure events.
ix. Article XVIII: Tax exemptions.
xX. Article XXII_ and Schedule 1: Undertaking to Guarantee.
xi. Article XXIV (24.10): “Most Favoured Nation” treatment.

The concept of a “book debt” normally refers to the money received or receivable in the
ordinary course of business of a company. These would normally include, among others, any
money or receivables for sale of services or goods, proceeds of dispositions, or, hire, bank
balances, in cash or cash equivalent and so forth. An assignment of a long-term contract for
the sale of power under the PPA would no doubt give rise to receivables and constitute book
debts. It is, however, rather implausible to suggest the bundle of rights and privileges and
promises of support set out in the Implementation Agreement are “book debts” contemplated
under Section 79 of the Companies Ordinance 1921 (Tanzania). None of the evidence or
arguments show in what manner the rights given by GoT under the Implementation

Agreement are akin to receivables and could constitute “book debts”.

On first principles even if the assignment of the Implementation Agreement constitutes some
form of “charge”, it is nevertheless not a charge of a “book debt” or any other kind of charge
under Section 79(2) of the Companies Ordinance 1921 (Tanzania). There is accordingly no

requirement for the “charge” to be registered. It follows that there is no need for the

56

consideration of whether a failure to register would render the same void against GoT or only

against the liquidator.

e Breach of Section 172 of the Companies Ordinance
(i) Parties’ Submissions

158. The Respondent argues that that the transfer of the loan from Danaharta to SCB HK in 2005

was invalid, because it breached Section 172 of the Companies Ordinance 1921 (Tanzania).

159. Section 172 of the Companies Ordinance 1921 (Tanzania) states that:236

172. Avoidance of dispositions of property, etc, after
commencement of winding up
In a winding up by the court, any disposition of the property of the
company, including actionable claims, and any transfer of shares, or
alteration in the status of the members of the company, made after the
commencement of the winding up, shall, unless the court otherwise
orders, be void.
160. According to the Respondent, this provision prohibits the transfer of assets and interests,
including actionable claims, of a company undergoing winding up proceedings. Any such

transfer is null and void if performed without the leave of the High Court of Tanzania.

161. The Respondent argues that since IPTL was in winding up proceedings at the time of the
purported acquisition of the loan by the Claimant from Danaharta, and the permission of the
High Court of Tanzania was not sought regarding this acquisition, the transfer is null and void.
The High Court has continuous supervisory powers once a winding up petition has been
commenced, and permission for any disposition must be obtained while the winding up
proceedings are ongoing, and not merely after the court has declared the company wound up.
The Respondent submits that this interpretation of Section 172 was also put forward by
Martha Renju in proceedings in the British Virgin Islands in 2010. Further, it asserts that
Danaharta and the Claimant were warned that the transfer of the loan to SCB HK in 2005

could be invalidated by Section 172 but chose to ignore such advice.237

162. The Respondent also contends that the transfer of the loan was an “actionable claim” covered
by Section 172, as it comprised a right to bring a claim as security for a loan granted in favour

of a company. It further takes the view that the validity of the transfer of the loan is not a

164.

question to be governed by English law (the law applicable to the Facility Agreement). As the
“transfer took effect in Tanzania with respect to security for a loan granted in favour of a
Tanzanian company which was undergoing winding up proceedings in Tanzania, permission
from the High Court of Tanzania overseeing those winding up proceedings was a necessary

requisite.”238

The Claimant argues that IPTL was not in winding up within the meaning of Section 172 read
with Section 174 of the Companies Ordinance 1921 (Tanzania) when the Term Loans were
transferred from Danaharta to the Claimant in 2005. Section 174 governs the time of

commencement of the winding up order, and states as follows:

174. Commencement of winding up by the court

(1) Where before the presentation of a petition for the winding up of a
company by the court a resolution has been passed by the company for
voluntary winding up, the winding up of the company shall be deemed
to have commenced at the time of the passing of the resolution, and
unless the court, on proof of fraud or mistake, thinks fit otherwise to
direct, all proceedings taken in the voluntary winding up shall be
deemed to have been validly taken.

(2) In any other case, the winding up of a company by the court shall be

deemed to commence at the time of the presentation of the petition for

the winding up.
The Claimant contends that, according to commentary on equivalent provisions of English
insolvency legislation, this provision operates retrospectively to invalidate property
dispositions made after the winding up petition is presented in the event a winding up order
is made. 239 Where no such order has been made, property dispositions are not invalidated.
In the present case, according to the Claimant, as the Tanzanian Court of Appeal ultimately
quashed the Winding Up Order, the transfer from Danaharta to the Claimant was not
invalidated. The Claimant points out that this was also the conclusion reached by Flaux J.240
Further, it submits that to the extent that Martha Renju took the position stated by the

Respondent, that was incorrect, and in any event, not dispositive of the claim before the BVI

Court. Further, the Claimant disagrees that any such warning of the invalidity of the loan as

asserted by the Respondent was in fact given.241

The Claimant also notes that, from a policy perspective, a provision which invalidated
dispositions made where no winding up order is ultimately made would be pointless as there
would be no need to preserve assets for a pari passu distribution to creditor. Such a provision
would be unjust as companies presented with a winding up petition (however groundless)
would be effectively paralysed by the threat of having perfectly legitimate transactions

invalidated, even if the winding up petition is later dismissed or withdrawn.242

In the Claimant’s view, the transfer of the loan from Danaharta to SCB HK in 2005 was the
transfer ofa liability of IPTL, not the transfer of property of IPTL. The transfer thus fell outside
the prohibition on dispositions under Section 172. This it submits was the conclusion reached
in the PwC Report and by Flaux J. Further the Claimant asserts that to the extent that the
Respondent is implying that "actionable claims" include the Claimant's right to bring a claim
in its capacity as Security Agent as the assignee of the legal benefit of the Implementation
Agreement, this is not relevant as the disposition by IPTL of the legal benefit of the
Implementation Agreement to the Security Agent occurred in 1997 by way of the statutory
assignment. From then onwards, the benefit of the contract was no longer part of the property
of IPTL. The disposition in 1997, made some 5 years before the Winding Up Petition was filed

in 2002, was not a disposition made during the winding up of IPTL.243

In any event, the Claimant contends that Section 172 of the Companies Ordinance 1921
(Tanzania) cannot invalidate the transfer of the loan from Danaharta to SCB HK because the
validity of the transfer is not governed by Tanzanian law. It argues that the Facility Agreement
is governed by English law, and the validity of the transfer is thus also governed by English
law. It also states that pursuant to the non-exclusive jurisdiction clause in the Facility
Agreement, Flaux J determined that the transfer of the loan is governed by English law, which

recognised the transfer as valid.24+

169.

Finally, the Claimant notes the irony in the Respondent's purportedly improper recognition
of the alleged sale of the Mechmar Shares to PAP when, on its own case, Section 172 would
have invalidated the transfer. The VIP-PAP SPA alleged that PAP had purchased the Mechmar
Shares from Piper Link in 2011,245 and the SPA was countersigned by Mr Saliboko in his
capacity as Second Provisional Liquidator of IPTL. Section 172 expressly applies to “any
transfer of shares”, and the purported transfer allegedly took place after the Winding Up
Petition was filed in 2002 but before the Winding Up Order was quashed in 2012 (or
withdrawn in 2013). Mr Saliboko recognised the purported transfer of the Mechmar Shares,
but refused to recognise the transfer of the loan, even though both would have been invalid
according to the Respondent's interpretation of Section 172. The Claimant alleges that the
contradictory position taken by Mr Saliboko and the Respondent “highlights the cynicism and

expediency of their stance on the issue.”246

(ii) Tribunal’s Analysis

It is not in dispute between the Parties that a Winding Up Petition was filed against IPTL in
February 2002. The Winding Up Order was made against IPTL on 15 July 2011 by the
Tanzanian High Court (Kaijage J).247 That order for winding-up was, however, set aside by the
Court of Appeal on 17 December 201224 and finally withdrawn by the petitioner VIP on 26
August 2013.249 It is the Respondent’s case that the transfer from Danaharta to SCB HK took
place in 2005 after the commencement of the winding up proceedings and during such
proceedings and as such is rendered null and void under Section 172 of the Companies
Ordinance 1921 (Tanzania), as it was made without the permission of the Tanzanian High
Court. In its view, it matters not that the Winding Up Order was eventually set aside or that
the Winding Up Petition was withdrawn, as Section 172 of the Companies Ordinance 1921
(Tanzania) prohibits any disposition immediately following the commencement of winding-

up proceedings with no express exceptions save for dispositions made with leave of court.

245 Which the Claimant says was impossible, because the Claimant had successfully enforced its Charge of Shares in respect
of the Mechmar Shares in the Malaysian and BVI Courts in 2010 and 2011.

of SCB HK, 26 August 2013 and 27 August 2013.

60

171.

172.

The Tribunal accepts that the scheme contemplated under the winding up provisions of the
Companies Ordinance 1921 (Tanzania) is that when a winding up order is made it enjoys
efficacy to avoid dispositions made after the commencement of the winding-up proceedings.
The intent of the scheme is to avoid the preferential treatment of certain creditors. But when
no winding up order is made and the petition is eventually withdrawn, dispositions are not
rendered void because there remain no proceedings in place that have that effect and any
permission that was needed from the Court is no longer required. Similarly, if an order is
made but subsequently set aside then dispositions made even during the period of the
winding-up would not be rendered void because upon the setting aside of the order, there is

no legal entailment that remains giving rise to the disposition being void.

In any event, the Tribunal also does not accept that the loans constituted under the Facility
Agreement are “the property of the company”. Far from being an asset, they constitute
liabilities of IPTL and would not in the least impact other creditors. The loan remains a
liability of the company and could not become a “right to bring a claim as security for a loan
granted in favour of a company”. Such a right is embodied in the Implementation Agreement
and could be the basis of an “actionable claim” but that had already been assigned absolutely,

to the lenders/banks in 1997, much before the Winding Up Petition was filed.

(3) Tribunal’s Finding on the Claimant's Status as Legal Assignee

The terms of the Implementation Agreement permit IPTL to “assign or create a security
interest” in favour of its “Lenders” subject only to IPTL having obtained “prior written consent”
from GoT. Although no “prior” written consent was given, the consent was subsequently
given on 3 October 1997 and acknowledged by the signature of its Ministry of Water, Energy
and Minerals on the Notice of Assignment of the Implementation Agreement,25° and by the
letter from its Minister of Finance of 13 October 1997 addressed to IPTL, which was copied
to the Prime Minister, Minister of Energy and Minerals, Minister-Planning, Attorney-General,
Chief Secretary, and MD TANESCO confirming its agreement to “the execution of the
assignments of the Implementation Agreement [...]’.251 The Tribunal therefore finds that

consent was given and the requirement for “prior” consent was accordingly waived.

250 HB/H/021/315: Notice of Assignment, 3 October 1997.
251 HB/H/022/316-317: Letter from Daniel Yona, Minister of Finance, to IPTL, 13 October 1997.

61

173.

174.

175.

176.

The Tribunal also holds that the requirement for consent from GoT for the original banks to
assign their interest in the Implementation Agreement is not required under Article 15.2 of
the Implementation Agreement as any subsequent assignment by the banks would be an

assignment by the banks qua the lender and not as a “permitted assignee” of the Company.

The Tribunal is satisfied that while Clause 3.1 of the Security Deed creates “charges”, Clause
3.2 thereof assigns to the Security Agent for the benefit of the Secured Creditors without any
condition or qualification of “all its present and future right, title and interest in and to the
Assigned Contracts” (which definition includes the Implementation Agreement). The
assignment is an absolute one not an assignment by way of charge only. The notice of such
assignment in relation to the Implementation Agreement was given by the Security Agent on
behalf of the lenders and acknowledged by GoT. GoT was also notified by the Claimant as
successor lender of its interest at the very latest in December 2009 and could not therefore
claim that it was unaware of the Claimant's claims as under the Implementation Agreement.
Any change in the Security Agent has no impact upon the right of SCB HK as the assignee as
Lender under the Facility Agreement and the assignee of the rights under the Implementation

Agreement.

The assignment is an absolute one and not merely a charge as such it falls outside the
requirement for registration under the Section 79(2) of the Companies Ordinance 1921
(Tanzania). As the Winding Up Order made by Kaijage J was subsequently set aside by the
Court of Appeal and then eventually withdrawn, the rights of SCB HK under the
Implementation Agreement could not be affected and remain actionable. All said, the
Tribunal finds that the Claimant (SCB HK) has all the rights under the Implementation
Agreement assigned to it by Danaharta (as the successor in title of the Lenders) and
accordingly has the title and interest to pursue its claims against GoT for any breach of the

Implementation Agreement in its own name.

JURISDICTION UNDER ARTICLE 25 OF THE ICSID CONVENTION

The Respondent contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention on two grounds: (1) the Claimant is not a “National of another Contracting State”;

and (2) the Claimant does not have an “investment.”

62

177.

178.

179.

180.

(4) National of Another Contracting State
a. Parties’ Submissions

The Respondent’s response in relation to the Claimant’s assertion that the Claimant's
nationality should be considered for the purpose of “diversity of nationalities” under Article
25 of the ICSID Convention, is that it did not consent to the assignment of IPTL’s rights under
the Implementation Agreement and so the Claimant is not in fact the statutory assignee of
IPTL pursuant to the Implementation Agreement. Accordingly, it follows then that the
Claimant has no right to bring this arbitration in its own name. According to the Respondent,
in any case, the Implementation Agreement does not permit lenders to bring an arbitration,
and the only nationality that should be considered would be as provided under Article 21.2

of the Implementation Agreement is IPTL’s nationality.252

The Respondent further contends that under Article 21.2 of the Implementation Agreement
(ie. the arbitration clause), the Parties agreed that IPTL would be treated as a foreign entity
as long as a foreign investor holds at least 35% of its voting stock. In its view, the question of
nationality which must be assessed at the “time of expressing consent to arbitration (i.e. when
signing the Implementation Agreement)” as well as when the request for arbitration was made
in the case.253 It also asserts that as IPTL is now fully owned and controlled by a Tanzanian
entity, namely PAP,254 ICSID’s jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention could not

be invoked as IPTL, as a Tanzanian national, is not “a national of another contracting State.” 255

The Claimant says that it is an entity incorporated in Hong Kong and thus is a national of the
People’s Republic of China (a contracting State to the ICSID Convention). Further, it also
argues as the Claimant is bringing this claim as the assignee of IPTL’s rights under the
Implementation Agreement, it is the Claimant's nationality, and not IPTL’s nationality, that is

relevant.25¢

The Claimant submits that “foreign control” under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention is

in “objective condition” and “must be viewed on its own particular context, on the basis of all of

the facts and circumstances.”25? The Claimant adds that in any case, even though IPTL is a
Tanzanian corporation, it would still fulfil this requirement because Article 25(2)(b) of the
ICSID Convention extends the meaning of “National of another Contracting State” to include
“[...] any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute
..on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated
as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.” The Claimant
submits that pursuant to Article 21.1 of the Implementation Agreement the parties to the
Implementation Agreement made such an agreement wherein it was set out that “/fJor
purposes of consenting to the jurisdiction of the Convention, the Parties agree that the Company
is a foreign controlled entity unless the amount of the voting stock in the Company held by
Foreign Investors should decrease to less than thirty-five (35) percent of the outstanding voting

stock of the Company.”258

The Claimant also points out that, Mechmar, a Malaysian entity, owns 70% of the shares in
IPTL. It is the Claimant's position that the transfer of the affairs of IPTL and the sums in the
Escrow Account to PAP on the basis that PAP had purchased the Mechmar Shares was illegal
and fraudulent. Any assertion by the Respondent that PAP has any valid interest in IPTL
would be extraordinary as it would permit the Respondent to rely on its own wrongdoing.?°9
In response, the Respondent says that PAP was recognised as IPTL’s sole shareholder as per
Utamwa J’s Order which took “judicial notice” of the VIP-PAP- SPA and transferred all affairs
of IPTL to PAP. If the Tribunal accepts the Respondent's argument that Utama J’s Order is
effective, then IPTL would be under complete Tanzanian control for reasons that cannot be
attributed to the Respondent and the Tribunal would then not have jurisdiction to assess the
Claimant’s claims against it for the alleged violations, including the release of the Escrow

Account.260

b. Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal has discussed in paragraphs 172 to 175 above and reached the finding that the

Claimant is the legal assignee of the Implementation Agreement. It follows that the Claimant

is entitled to enforce the rights thereunder in its own name. Being a Chinese entity, it is

indisputably a “National of another Contracting State.”

In any event, as could be seen from the discussion in paragraphs 349 to 353 below, the
Tribunal has found that the Order of Utamwa J of 5 September 2013 directing that control of
IPTL, including the IPTL Power Plant, be handed to PAP had been made in curious
circumstances, with no regard to the registered shareholder Mechmar or the consequences

of permitting PAP to have control of the disposition of the Escrow Account.

The Tribunal finds that the Claimant satisfies the requirement of a “National of another

Contracting State”, namely China.

(2) Whether the Dispute Arises out of an “Investment” within the Meaning of
Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention

a. Applicable Test for Determining the Meaning of Investment
(i) Parties’ Submissions

The Respondent's case is that the Claimant does not have a qualifying “investment” within the
objective meaning of investment for the purposes of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.
According to the Respondent, the Claimant merely purports to have acquired accounts
receivables after the Facility was contracted for and built. The acquisition of the loan did not
involve any expectation of receiving an economic return beyond the mere repayment of the
loan with interest. The Respondent characterises the Claimant as a “speculative debt-hunter”
and argues that speculative activities ought not to fall within the jurisdiction of an ICSID
tribunal.2¢ In the Respondent's view, the nature of the dispute does not arise “directly out of

an investment.”

The Respondent refers to the “Salini test” or “Salini criteria” (as set out in Salini v
Morocco)?®2 to suggest that there are essential characteristics for the notion of an
“investment” under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention that all must be met to establish
jurisdiction, which include “(1) the investor’s participation in the risks of the transaction; (2) a

contribution to the host State’s economic development.”2°3 The Respondent argues that these
conditions are not fulfilled in the present case and the purported acquisition of Term Loans
1 and 2 in 2005 does not constitute investment as per the objective criteria, and therefore

there is no investment within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.26+

187. The Respondent also refers inter alia to the decision on jurisdiction in Consortium R.F.C.C. v
Royaume du Maroc? to support its argument that the Parties cannot substitute the objective
requirements of an investment under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.26¢ The
Respondent also refers to the Report of the Executive Directors on the ICSID Convention,
which it submits indicates that the Parties’ consent alone is not sufficient to establish

jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention.267

188. The Claimant's position is that the Salini Test has no basis in the actual text of Article 25(1) of
the ICSID Convention. The Salini Test cannot override party agreement for defining what
constitutes an investment, even though it may be used to define the “outer limits” of what an
investment means under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. It submits that the principal
legal framework to determine the existence of an investment should be the will of the Parties
as set forth in the bilateral investment treaty or investment contract. It refers to the decision
of Pantechniki S.A. Contractors & Engineers v Republic of Albania,?® to support its argument
that the Respondent’s approach based on the Salini Test can increase the risk of arbitrary and
subjective value judgments by a Tribunal.2©° The Claimant asserts that, at its highest, the
Salini Test is an exemplary list of the typical features of an investment and not a mandatory
checklist. The Claimant contends that several ICSID tribunals had refused to apply the Salini

Test or have applied it in modified forms.27°

The Claimant argues that the loan constitutes an investment pursuant to Article 25 of the
ICSID Convention. Moreover, in the absence of a definition of “investment” in Article 25(1) of
the ICSID Convention, the tribunals in the cases Fedax N.V. v Republic of Venezuela?7!
(“Fedax”) and Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, A.S. v Slovak Republic2?2 (““CSOB’) and Alpha
Projektholding GMBH v Ukraine2’3 referred to the Parties’ definition of investment in the
relevant “consent-giving” instrument (the bilateral investment treaty), which it submits is the
proper test. The Claimant also rejected the Respondent characterising it as a “debt-hunter” by
stating that this allegation goes to admissibility and is irrelevant to the jurisdictional issue of

what constitutes an investment.274

According to the Claimant, the scope of its “investment” for purposes of ICSID Convention
Article 25 could be made out from analysing the terms of the Implementation Agreement
showing that the Project, the financing of the Project and related security granted in relation

to it, form part of the overall investment.275

Additionally, the Claimant contends that the Parties included an ICSID arbitration clause in
the agreement with the clear expectation that disputes under the Implementation Agreement
would relate to a qualifying “investment” under the ICSID Convention. The Claimant points
out that the Parties to the Implementation Agreement anticipated that the successors and
assigns of the original lenders could become parties to the Implementation Agreement,

including the ICSID arbitration clause.276

(ii) Tribunal’s Analysis

The Claimant has submitted that the Tribunal should apply a “subjective” test to consider if
the Parties had under the terms of the Implementation Agreement accepted that the subject

matter is an “investment”, whereas the Respondent submits that the Tribunal must also apply

in “objective” test to ascertain if the elements of an investment exist in order to establish

jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.

On the subjective test, the Claimant relies on the Respondent’s expressed consent in the
Implementation Agreement to submit any dispute to ICSID277 under the ICSID Rules. Such a
position is supported by several arbitral tribunals, which took the view that the consent of
the State party as to what constitutes an investment is of primary importance. The tribunal
in CSOB278 put it succinctly:

66[...] an important element in determining whether a dispute qualifies

as an investment under the Convention in any given case is the specific

consent given by the Parties. The Parties’ acceptance of the Centre’s

jurisdiction with respect to the rights and obligations arising out of their

agreement therefore creates a strong presumption that they considered
their transaction to be an investment within the meaning of the ICSID
Convention.

67. The Tribunal must accordingly attach considerable significance to
the reference made in Article 7 of the Consolidation Agreement to the
BIT and thus to the ICSID arbitration clause contained therein (Article
8). The Parties’ acceptance of the relevance and applicability of the BIT
to the C lidation Agreement expresses their view that the latter
transaction relates to an investment within the meaning of the BIT. The
contrary conclusion would deprive the reference to the BIT in Article 7
of the Consolidation Agreement of its meaning or effet utile.

The Tribunal notes, however, that the Parties’ consent as reflected in the contract, while of
great importance, could not be the only test and is not conclusive in resolving the issue of
whether there is jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. The subject matter of
the dispute must nevertheless still be an investment as contemplated by the ICSID
Convention and consent by the Parties alone could not subject an ordinary commercial
transaction or political dispute or non-legal dispute to ICSID for resolution. This is expressed
in the Report by the Executive Directors on the Convention on the Settlement of Investment
Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States 279 —

25. While consent of the parties is an essential prerequisite for the
jurisdiction of the Centre, consent alone will not suffice to bring a

dispute within its jurisdiction. In keeping with the purpose of the
Convention, the jurisdiction of the Centre is further limited by reference
to the nature of the dispute and the parties thereto.

The Tribunal therefore accepts that for this aspect of jurisdictional competence two
requirements must be met. First, that the subject matter of the dispute constitutes an
investment within the meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. Second, that the Parties

consented to such a dispute being submitted to ICSID and its Arbitration Rules.

With regard to the second part of the test, the Tribunal has little doubt that the parties to the
Implementation Agreement had considered that the activity it was related to (being the
construction and financing of the Facility) was an “investment” at the time it was entered into
as they had expressly agreed to have all disputes arising thereunder to be submitted to ICSID
and under the ICSID Arbitration Rules. The Tribunal is of the view that the second part of the

test is satisfied.

The first part of the test requires a consideration of the elements that constitute an activity
as an “investment” within the meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.
b. Elements of an “Investment” under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention
(@) Salini Test

The Tribunal notes that the Salini Test has indeed received a mixed following. For example, it
was followed in Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v Islamic Republic of Pakistan;?®
Jan de Nul N.V. and Dredging International N.V. v Arab Republic of Egypt;28: and Ioannis

Kardassopoulos v Republic of Georgia.282

— In Abaclat and others v Argentina, the tribunal declined to follow the Salini Test and
suggested that it should “/...] not serve to create a limit, which the Convention itself nor the

Contracting Parties to a specific BIT intended to create.”283

— In Biwater Gauff v Tanzania, the tribunal remarked that “These criteria are not fixed or
mandatory as a matter of law. They do not appear in the ICSID Convention [...] it is doubtful

that arbitral tribunals sitting in individual cases should impose one such definition [...].” 28+

— In Philip Morris Brand Sarl and others v Oriental Republic of Uruguay, the tribunal said,
“These criteria should not play a role in the Tribunal’s analysis of whether an investment

exists, much less to serve as a jurisdictional requirement.” 285

— In MNSS B.V. and Recupero Credito Acciaio N.V. v Montenegro (“MNSS B.V. v
Montenegro”), the tribunal more generously suggested that the “[...] elements of the Salini
test need to be considered flexibly and as a whole in the context of the specific facts of an

investment operation.”?8°

200. The Tribunal agrees with the observations of the recent ICSID decisions, that the Salini Test
is a reformulation of the criteria set out by the tribunals in Fedax28” and CSOB,?88 with the
additional requirement that there should be some economic contribution to the host country.
These Salini factors are not to be taken as prescriptive or dispositive but merely as indicative
of typical elements that the Tribunal could consider in determining whether the subject
matter from which the dispute has arisen is an “investment” contemplated by the ICSID
Convention. This flexible approach is consistent with the objective of ICSID Convention as set

out in the Executive Director’s Report -

Nature of Dispute

26. Article 25(1) requires that the dispute must be a “legal dispute
arising directly out of an investment.” The expression “legal dispute” has
been used to make clear that while conflicts of rights are within the
jurisdiction of the Centre, mere conflicts of interests are not. The dispute
must concern the existence or scope of a legal right or obligation, or the
nature or extent of the reparation to be made for breach of a legal
obligation.

27. No attempt was made to define the term “investment” given the
essential requirement of consent by the parties, and the mechanism
through which Contracting States can make known in advance, if they
so desire, the classes of disputes which they would or would not consider
submitting to the Centre (Article 25(4)).2®

It is the Respondent's case that the Claimant had not made an investment as contemplated by
Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, alleging that: the Claimant assumed no operational risk,
was involved in a transitory manner, did not make a substantial contribution and its
involvement did not contribute to the economic development of Tanzania. In the
Respondent's view, the Claimant's only link to the Facility was its acquisition of a “purported

claim to accounts receivables” long after the Facility was financed and built.29°

Before any discussion of whether these elements have been satisfied, it is necessary to recall
the nature of the transaction and the dispute that had arisen.
a. Nature of the Transaction
@ Parties’ Submissions
The Claimant contends that the Article 25(1) ICSID Convention “investment” requirement is

met by the following elements:

i. IPTL’s investment in the Facility;
ii. the Claimant’s loan to IPTL to finance the construction of the Facility;
iii, IPTL’s shares, over which the Claimant has exercised its right under the Charge of

Shares to appoint a receiver; and

204.

iv. the contractual rights under the Implementation Agreement, the PPA and other

agreements assigned by IPTL to its lenders as security for the loan.29!

The Claimant submits that it is widely accepted that a loan will constitute an investment when
it contributes or is closely related to an economic venture comprising an investment and
relies on several cases to support this proposition, including Fedax N.V. v Republic of
Venezuela,2°2 Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, AS. v Slovak Republic,223 MNSS B.V. v
Montenegro2%* and Alpha Projektholding GMBH v Ukraine.2°5 Further, the Claimant asserts
that in the present case, the loan was essential to the construction of the Facility, as without
the loan, the Facility would not have been built and the Facility was itself a significant project

intended by the Respondent to develop Tanzania’s infrastructure.2°6

The Claimant also points out that the Respondent admitted in its Memorial in the “BIT
Arbitration” proceedings (viz. Standard Chartered Bank v United Republic of Tanzania, 1CSID
Case No. ARB/10/12) that the original loan was an investment in Tanzania for the purposes
of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. Further it submits that the PPA Tribunal also dealt
with the same issue and decided that it was satisfied that there was an investment by virtue
of the Claimant’s purchase of the debt under the loans to IPTL and assigning of the rights

under the relevant agreements.?°”

The Claimant submits that the fact that the loan was transferred does not change its nature

as an investment in the hands of the new lender and relies on various legal authorities

including Fedax v Venezuela,2°* MNSS v Montenegro2®? and Abaclat v Argentina? to support

this contention.30

207. In its Reply, the Claimant refers to the decision in African Holding v DRC2°2 to say that an
assignment does not change the nature of the original investment and that once an
investment has been acquired there is no further investment needed to be made to retain its
nature. The Claimant submits that the assignment of a loan is an assignment of economic
value of the work done and not paid, and the status of a loan as an investment is constant.303
It disagrees with the Respondent's suggestion that a mere transfer of a lender would deprive
it of its status as an investment, despite the expressed provision in the Implementation

Agreement recognising such transfer or assignment.3o*

208. The Respondent counters that the essence of the Claimant's claim is a claim for the repayment
of the debt owed by IPTL, which the Claimant has dressed up as a frivolous discrimination
and expropriation claim under the Implementation Agreement. Such a claim does not arise
out of the Facility as investment because ultimately it is based on the Loan Facility Agreement
between IPTL and the consortium of Malaysian banks which was acquired by the Claimant.
Thus, it submits that the link to the Facility is too remote and irrelevant and could not clothe

the Claimant as having been exposed to the risks attendant to the Facility.3°

209. Further, the Respondent submits that the form and nature of the Claimant's activity does not
constitute an investment under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. The Respondent
contends that, ina memorandum of July 1996,30¢ Mr Patrick Rutabanzibwa (as Commissioner

for Energy and Petroleum Affairs) wrote that the Facility itself did not contribute to the

economic development of Tanzania and it also argues that what was needed in Tanzania at
the time the Facility was contracted for, financed and built, was an emergency power project

and not an onerous medium-term project.3°7

The Respondent argues that: first, the cases referred to by the Claimant in paragraph 204
above are not related to Article 25(1) ICSID Convention, but to the definition of “investment”
in the relevant bilateral investment treaty applicable in each case; and second, that the cases
relied upon by the Claimant recognize that a loan in itself is not an investment under the ICSID
Convention if it is not linked to a process of value creation, or if it does not contribute
substantially to the development of the host State. According to the Respondent, the
Claimant’s purported acquisition of Term Loans 1 and 2 is not a loan that would constitute

in “investment”, because it is not linked to a process of value creation as it is purely a

commercial operation not different to those made by financial institutions.398

The Respondent says that any alleged admission or statement that was made in the BIT
Arbitration was in the context of analysis concerning the bilateral investment treaty between
Tanzania and the United Kingdom, and therefore it is not relevant to the present case.30
Further, the Respondent submits that the PPA Tribunal did not engage in analysis of the

specific characteristics of an investment and therefore is not useful for the present case.31°

The Respondent contends that all the cases cited by the Claimant are inapposite to the facts
of the present case.3!1 Further the Respondent asserts that the Claimant relies upon the
expansive definitions of investment following the approach of Fedax v Venezuela, which has

since been criticised by other tribunals and commentators.3!2

Gi) Tribunal’s Analysis

As a Starting point, the Tribunal takes the view that the construction and operation of an

infrastructure project,3!3 such as the Facility in Tanzania, is an investment, notwithstanding

313 The Respondent's reference to Mihaly v Sri Lanka to suggest that even in a power plant project may not always be an
“investment” is inappropriate. In that case, the parties were merely in the negotiation stages and no agreement was
eventually entered into. HB/G/094/9597-9615: Mihaly International Corporation v Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri

that a senior member of the Tanzanian Government thought at one stage that the Facility did
not contribute to the economic development of Tanzania. The provision of electricity from
the Facility in the face of power shortages qualifies as an investment. Whether, in hindsight,
that investment was optimal or could have been structured differently cannot alter its

qualification as an investment.

The main thrust of the Respondent's arguments lies on the fact that:

i the Claimant was not the original Lender under the Financing Documents and the
Implementation Agreement;

ii. the purchase of the Loan by the Claimant was not an investment; and therefore

iii, the assignment of any security created, including the rights under the

Implementation Agreement could not be pursued by an ICSID arbitration.

The most critical issue that requires consideration is whether the purchase of the Loan by the
Claimant in the circumstances of the case is in the nature of an “investment.” This then
requires an examination of whether there exists in this transaction, the various elements of
risk, substantial contribution, minimum duration and arguably, economic development of
Tanzania.

b, Risk

Gi) Parties’ Submissions

The Respondent suggests that the Claimant had assumed no “operational risk’314 for when
they took over the Loans, the Facility was already constructed and operating. In the
Respondent's view, any risks attendant on the Loans were borne by the original lenders, as
they were then exposed to the uncertainty as to whether the Facility would be completed
before any income stream could flow. What the Claimant had assumed, according to the
Respondent, was merely a “commercial risk” which exists in any transaction, and which in
this case would be further ameliorated by the security which it enjoyed over the Facility and

outcome in taking over the loan “did not go beyond the prospect of receiving an economic

return through the repayment of the money loaned with interest’315 and was nothing more

than an exchange, with no value creation for the Facility.316

217. The Claimant, on the other hand, argues that under the PPA, TANESCO agreed to pay IPTL the
tariff stipulated in the PPA. It was envisaged that the loan would be repaid from the cash flows
generated by IPTL under the PPA. The economic success of the Project was dependent upon
IPTL receiving regular payments from TANESCO, and the support and non-interference of the
Respondent. The Claimant therefore assumed not just the risk of non-payment of the debt,

but also the risk of the success or failure of the Facility.317

Gi) Tribunal’s Analysis

218. The concept of “commercial risk” has been distinguished from “investment risk” by the

tribunal in Romak v Uzbekistan*18 in the following way -

229. All economic activity entails a certain degree of risk. As such, all
contracts - including contracts that do not constitute an investment -
carry the risk of non-performance. However, this kind of risk is pure
commercial, counterparty risk, or, otherwise stated, the risk of doing
business generally. It is therefore not an element that is_useful for the
purpose of distinguishing between an investment and a commercial
transaction.

230. An “investment risk” entails a different kind of alea, a situation in
which the investor cannot be sure of a return on his investment, and may
not know the amount he will end up spending, even if all relevant
counterparties discharge their contractual obligations. Where there is

“risk” of this sort, the investor simply cannot predict the outcome of the

transaction.

219. These remarks were adopted by an ICSID tribunal in Postovd Banka v Greece?!9 which re-

stated the term “investment risk” as “operational risk” and added that such is “not a

commercial risk or a sovereign risk”320 and expressed the view that its distinction is that an
“operational risk” means that “profits are not ascertained but depend on the success or failure
of the economic venture concerned [...].”321 In that case, the tribunal had found that the “Greek
Government Bonds” were issued for economically unproductive activity viz. for financing
government operations, to meet general budgetary purposes and repaying government debts

and no “operational risk” was present.

The Tribunal accepts that loans and financial instruments standing alone without any link to
some economic venture intended to provide for the improvement of the State’s development
would not be considered an “investment.” It follows that an assignment of loans merely as an
income stream unconnected to any investment is not an “investment” in international

investment law.322

Arbitral tribunals have on several occasions held that loans and financial facilities (whether
in the form of direct loans, bonds or notes) issued by or undertaken in the context of financing

an investment would qualify as investments under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.323

There is no doubt in the Tribunal’s mind that there were clearly investment risks when the
original Lenders extended the Loan to IPTL to finance the construction and operation of the
Facility and that they had accepted those risks. What the Respondent contends is that the
Claimant not being the original Lender, is not in a position to say that it carried any risk akin

to that of the original Lenders.

On first principles, the Respondent's suggestion ignores the fact that the Claimant has staked
its claim as the assignee of the Loan and the lawful assignee under the Implementation
Agreement (which the Tribunal has found in its favour - see paragraph 172 above). As

assignee, the Claimant stepped into the shoes of the original Lenders. And as assignee the

Claimant became entitled to the rights of the original lenders, it also assumed the risks of the
original Lenders. Much like the assignment of the loan in MNSS B.V. v Montenegro,324 the
assignment of the loan changed the creditor under the Loan Agreement and the beneficiary
under the Implementation Agreement but not the nature of the transaction. The substance of
the Facility remains the same. The link between the Loan and the Implementation Agreement
to the Facility and its continuing operations has not been broken. The risks undertaken by
the original Lenders are now borne by the Claimant because the original Lender could not or
would not be in a position to do so. Although the construction of the Facility was completed,
the Claimant carries the continuing risks of the operation. There was no certainty that the
Facility would run smoothly, or that the power generated would yield the projected revenue
that could repay the outstanding loans. The risk of TANESCO not paying the tariffs and IPTL
not being able to make the Power Plant available; and the political risk of interference by the
Respondent with the Project, are not “ordinary commercial risk.” These risks subsequent to

the assignment were clearly borne by the Claimant.

The Tribunal recognises that it is possible that the right of investment protection could be
abused by a speculative debt hunter. An illustration of such an abuse can be seen in Phoenix
Action Ltd v Czech Republic3?5 where the claimant purchased two insolvent companies that
were embroiled in litigation not for any economic activity but for the sole purpose of bringing
international litigation against the Czech Republic. The tribunal rightly declined jurisdiction

as it found that “the whole ‘investment’ was an artificial transaction to gain access to ICSID.”326

The Tribunal does not accept the Respondent's characterisation of the Claimant. The
Claimant acquired the Loans from the original Malaysian banks following a re-structuring
initiated by the Malaysian banking authority. The Claimant was the sole bidder willing to take
over the Term Loan 1 (USD 92.547 million)32” and Term Loan 2 (8.236 million)328 and paid

USD 76.1 million32° on terms that it provided no recourse against the original Lender or the
vendor. The fact that the Claimant had paid less than the principal outstanding due is in itself
no basis to suggest that it was a “no risk” venture. The original loans were in fact re-structured
in the hands of Danaharta to give the borrower more time to make repayment and a forgiving
of part of the accrued interest, as well enabling the repayment of the outstanding due by IPTL
to the Engineering Procurement and Construction (“EPC”) contractor, Wartsila NSD

Nederland B.V.330

The Respondent's suggestion that the Claimant's expectation of receiving an economic return
through the repayment of the money loaned with interest is indicative that it is a normal
commercial transaction with usual commercial risks and nothing more, fails to account for
the risks assumed in granting, maintaining and restructuring the loans in relation to the

establishment and maintenance of the Facility.

The fact that the sale assets were described by the purchaser as “distressed” in fact indicates
that the Claimant would be exposed to a higher risk than the original Lender. With no
recourse to the original Lender,33! the Claimant assumed all the attendant risks and
obligations from the original Lender associated with the Facility as spelt out in the Sale and
Purchase Agreement thus:

5. Assumption of Obligations

To the extent that the Vendor shall have obligations remaining to be
performed under the Asset Documentation after the Closing Date as
disclosed in writing by the Vendor or as contained and disclosed in the
Accounts Information relating to the Sale Asset and/or to the extent
there are any claims against and/or liabilities on the part of the Vendor
in respect of or in connection with the Sale Assets on or after the Closing
Date, the Purchaser hereby agrees to perform all such obligations and
will indemnify the Vendor and each of their officers, directors,
employees and advisors (“a Vendor Party") and hold each of them
harmless from and against any liability to or claim of liability by any
third party on account of the failure of such obligations to be
performed.332

329 The amount paid by the Claimant for was close to the asset valuation made by Danaharta’s financial advisors of USD 77.4
million. See HB/H/059/ 851-866 at pgs. 862-863: CIMB Ltd Credit Report, 30 August 2004; HB/C/013/535-5511 at pg. 550:

Unlike the claimant in Phoenix Action Ltd v Czech Republic, who did nothing other than initiate
ICSID arbitration shortly after it made the “investment”, the Claimant here was obliged and
was fully engaged in undertaking the obligations as the Lender to IPTL by honouring its
obligations to IPTL and the Facility. IPTL continued to make principal and interest
repayments until April 2007 when it went into default.333 During that same period, GoT
engaged the Claimant through its Tanzanian branch officers for the possibility of GoT taking
over the loans from the Claimant3* and a “pretrade agreement” was said to have been signed

off with GoT.335

In doing so, the Claimant carried the burden of the original Lender and it would be incorrect
to term it as speculative debt. The original loans were required to build and maintain the
Facility. The Facility provided a necessary public good. These loans entailed risk. That risk
was borne by the original Lender and assumed by the Claimant. That suffices to establish that

the Claimant’s acquisition of the loans qualifies as an investment.

The Tribunal is therefore satisfied that the Claimant was fully exposed to the investment risk
inherent in this transaction.

¢, Substantial Contribution

The Respondent says that there is no substantial contribution element as that requires
contribution of technical know-how, equipment and services, which are absent in the present

case.336

The Tribunal notes that the Claimant's involvement in taking over the loans from Danaharta
was made known to GoT more than one year before it occurred. In his report to the PS MEM
reported that he was approached by SCB HK and informed of the Malaysian Government's
intention to close Danaharta’s operations and to find a taker for the loan accounts of IPTL. He
reported that he had agreed to give support for such a move by SCB HK in exchange for a
reduction in IPTL’s capacity charge following the re-financing. SCB HK then subsequently
reported that a USD 200,000 per month reduction would be possible for a few years.

According to the report, GoT intended to approach the Malaysian Government for assistance.

GoT itself was also looking at ways to take over the Facility and had broached the possibility
of funding from the World Bank:

20. During the negotiations for the Emergency Power Supply Project
which were held with the World Bank in April-May, 2004, the Tanzania
delegation to those negotiations formally requested the World Bank's
assistance in buying out or otherwise dealing with IPTL's lenders and
shareholders so that the burden of the project's capacity charges can be
reduced. The World Bank ruled out the possibility of providing funds
with which the Government could purchase the IPTL plant, but
undertook to look into whether it could identify risk mitigation
arrangements and funding sources which could help address the
problem. The World Bank undertook to discuss with its affiliates MIGA
and IFC to this end, and revert to the Government.337

233. The report recommended that GoT support SCB’s bid to take over the Loan -

19. Standard Bank has suggested that the Government allows the re-
financing of IPTL’s debt to proceed as a first step. After a few years,
when (i) TANESCO’s ability to pay both IPTL and Songas has been
demonstrated and (ii) the IPTL shareholders’ respective rights have
been confirmed by the courts, perceived risks about IPTL will diminish
and it may be possible to do another re-financing as a second step which
would result in a more significant reduction in the capacity charge. It
is evident that the perceived risks currently surrounding IPTL are a
hindrance to negotiating a meaningful reduction in the capacity charge.

[ul

26. [...] (ii) The Ministry should respond positively to Standard Bank's
proposals for re-financing IPTL in two phases (as described in
paragraph 19 above) but (a) seek more time to contact the Malaysian
government and (b) require the re-financing arrangements to
anticipate a second phase which may involve the purchase of the IPTL
plant and the possible participation of other financiers including the
World Bank or its affiliates.338

234. There is no doubt that GoT viewed SCB HK’s involvement as positive and necessary. There
was need for more power generation. GoT wanted a reduction in the capacity charge, but at
a reduced cost and IPTL was under-capitalised. GoT had hoped to take control of the Facility

or for someone to take over the role of the Lenders. While it is true that the money paid by

237.

SCB HK did not go directly into the Facility, but to Danaharta, SCB HK’s involvement brought
stability and enabled the Facility to continue operating. All this occurred at a time when
TANESCO had disputes with IPTL, had delayed, withheld or threatened to withhold payment
to IPTL, thereby triggering possible default.339 Danaharta could have recalled the loan or
refused to re-structure the same. GoT saw the need for SCB HK to take over the loan to enable
it to gain time to consider other possible options including funding from the World Bank to

take over thereafter.

Unlike the case of Phoenix Action Ltd v Czech Republic, the Claimant here had paid a
discounted but nevertheless substantial sum (USD 76 million) to take over the loans from
Danaharta. By doing so, IPTL did not need to seek alternative funding and could continue to
operate the Facility. In the Tribunal’s view, these facts indicate that the Claimant made a
substantial contribution to the Project and to the Respondent.

d, Minimum Duration

The Tribunal notes that the Claimant had taken over a commitment to maintain the Loans for
a period of up to 10 years. The Facility was intended to be operational for more than 20 years.
Such duration is not short by any measure. The Respondent argues however that the Claimant
“could have sold its debt through a financial transaction” and that the Claimant had admitted
through its witness Mr Casson that it had attempted to do so, albeit unsuccessfully. The
Respondent submits that the Claimant's commitment fails the “non-transitory commitment”

to the host State.

The Tribunal finds such a criticism quite misplaced. The nature of the Project and the long-
term financing arrangement speak for themselves. Mr Casson indeed said that he was in
discussion with Mr Sethi and had signed a Memorandum of Agreement on 25 November 2011
for an exit from the loan for a discounted sum of USD 75 million (when the amount
outstanding then was USD 128 million). It was however clear from his witness statement>0
and oral testimony3*! that Mr Casson had decided to exit when he felt frustrated by the
discriminatory treatment meted out to SCB HK rather than executing what SCB HK had

always planned to do so. In his report seeking approval for this arrangement, he stated:

241.

From the negotiation with Sethi, SCB has signed a Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA) on 24 November, on a non-binding basis and subject
to credit approval to pencil down a proposal for a one-off payment of
US$75m for the Bank to exit the loan SCB will then withdraw
international arbitrations against GOT and TANESCO. The Bank has
been advised the MOA has shown to GOT and the Attorney General by
Sethi to request time for finalizing settlement, instead of liquidating

 

[ul

Regarding to settlement risk, it is uncertain to access the availability of
the escrow amount of US$85m, otherwise, how GOT secure sufficient
funding for settlement. Local contacts advise TANESCO may inject more
to top up escrow funds for a global settlement.342

Quite clearly this was an attempt to resolve the disputes with the other parties globally so
that the Claimant could get out of the difficulties they found themselves in over the years
(from 2005 to 2011), and not an indication that the Claimant had only intended a transitory

holding of the loan portfolio.

The Tribunal is satisfied that the Claimant’s commitment was non-transitory.
e. Contribution to the Economic Development of Host State

This factor is one of the more controversial of the elements suggested by the Salini tribunal.
As expressed earlier, the Tribunal shares the view articulated by tribunals in recent cases that
this element is not a strict requirement but will nevertheless consider this feature as

presented by the Respondent.

Contribution to the host State’s economic development is of course the desired outcome of
any foreign investment and the basis for the promotion of foreign investment underlying of

the ICSID Convention. As one author reasoned -

Hence, investments not devoted to productive purposes, such as those
undertaken for speculative purposes and those that do not develop the
productive resources of the host State without positive impact on the
productivity or increase the standards of living or labor conditions,
could be considered to be beyond the outer limits of ICSID.3#3

The Respondent submits that what is required to be shown is not whether the Facility or the
original loan that funded the facility contributed to the economic development of the host
State, but rather whether the Claimant’s purported acquisition of the Term Loans 1 and 2

made such contribution and added to Tanzania’s economic development.

The Respondent sets out the circumstances under which the Claimant made the acquisition
from Danaharta, a Malaysian Government owned asset management company created to
remove non-performing loans. It contends that the purchase provided no benefit to the
Respondent State. Rather it was a simple commercial transaction with only the recovery of
money in mind. The Respondent points out that there was not a single drawdown by IPTL
after the Claimant became the sole lender to underscore the point that SCB HK brought with

it no economic benefit to Tanzania.34+

The Respondent has repeatedly described the Claimant as “nothing more than a speculative
and bad faith endeavour which did not contribute to the economic development of
Tanzaniaf...].”345 It submits that had SCB HK not bought the loans from Danaharta it “would
not have entailed a disruption of the Facility” as at the time of acquiring the loan the Facility
“had already been financed and built and was already operating”,3“¢ it therefore reasoned
that the Claimant did not “primarily and directly” contribute to the economic development of
Tanzania.3#7 The Respondent has also pleaded that the Claimant's acquisition of the loan

outside Tanzania was evidence of the speculative nature of the Claimant's activities.348

As stated earlier, the Tribunal notes that the original loans were re-structured when IPTL had
difficulty meeting repayments, due to TANESCO’s challenging the calculation of the capacity
charges and in delaying or withholding making such payments to IPTL. The acquisition of the
loan by SCB HK from Danaharta assured IPTL, TANESCO and GoT of the continuing
availability of financial support for the operation of the Facility. The support of GoT for SCB
HK’s taking over of the loans from Danaharta is in the Tribunal’s view the acceptance by GoT

that SCB HK’s involvement would contribute to the economic development of Tanzania. SCB

incorrect. No member of the Tribunal made any such suggestion.

HK’s support in taking over and maintaining the availability of the loans was even more

critical when GoT realized that its hope of World Bank funding was not forthcoming.

The Tribunal is satisfied that far from being a speculative transaction, SCB HK stepped in
when no others would. If the element of contribution to economic development is required

to be shown, the Claimant has satisfied the same.

c Alternative Arbitral Forum in the Implementation Agreement
(i) Parties’ Submissions

The Respondent in its Counter-Memorial adds to its challenge that the presence of the ICC
arbitration clause in Article 21.2 of the Implementation Agreement reinforces the notion that

the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention in this case.349

Article 21.2 of the Implementation Agreement provides after the reference to ICSID
arbitration that -

.. If for any reason the Dispute cannot be settled in accordance with the

ICSID Rules, whether if the GOT fails to implement the Convention, or if

the Company should not be agreed to be a foreign controlled entity, or

if the request for arbitration proceedings is not registered by the Centre,

or if the Centre fails or refuses to take jurisdiction over such Dispute, or

otherwise, any Dispute shall be finally settled by arbitration under the

Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the

"ICC Rules") by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with
the ICC Rules.

The Respondent submits that the provision of such an alternative arbitral forum was included
because the Parties had doubts as to whether their transaction would qualify as an
investment, especially in view of the possibility that the rights could be assigned, upon
approval of the Respondent, to other entities.35° The Claimant responds that there is a
hierarchy established in Article 21.2 of the Implementation Agreement between the “/JCSID

arbitration clause and the ICC arbitration clause” wherein the former applies to any dispute

252.

or difference between the Parties and the latter is “subsidiary” and applicable only when for

any reason the Dispute cannot be settled by ICSID Rules.35!

(ii) Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal agrees that parties have made this proviso in anticipation that certain disputes
may not fall within the general jurisdiction of ICSID and, if that should happen, those should
then be referred to ICC arbitration. The text of the proviso sets out the various scenarios
contemplated by the parties namely, viz. Tanzania fails to implement the ICSID Convention,
or if IPTLis nota foreign-controlled entity, or if ICSID fails to register the dispute or a tribunal
refuses to take jurisdiction. There is, however, no room to infer by reverse reasoning that the
parties have by making such a proviso accepted or anticipated that an assignment of rights
would trigger a reference to the alternative arbitral forum. The Tribunal’s reading is simple,
the proviso is an expression of the parties’ intention to have their disputes referred to
institutional arbitration and not to a national court such that if for any reason this Tribunal
declined jurisdiction, the Claimant would be at liberty to seek relief from the alternative
forum. The proviso in Article 21.2 of the Implementation Agreement does not therefore add

support the Respondent’s argument in any manner.

(3) Tribunal’s Decision on Jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention

Following the Tribunal’s consideration of the various elements of the Claimant's undertaking,
including maintaining the loans for the benefit of IPTL and the Facility, the Tribunal finds that
this is a legal dispute arising out of an investment and that it has jurisdiction under Article 25
of the ICSID Convention. Neither the Project, nor its individual elements, ceased to be an
investment merely because the identity of the Lender under the Facility Agreement has
changed or that no further drawdown of funds were made following the transfer. The fact is
that the Facility continued to enjoy the use of the funds earlier disbursed following the change
of the Lender. The Tribunal is also satisfied that the Claimant is the rightful party to maintain
such claim as an absolute assignee who is entitled to enforce the rights thereunder in its own

name. Being a Chinese entity, it is indisputably a “National of another Contracting State.”

In these circumstances, the Tribunal therefore holds that the ratione personae and ratione

materiae jurisdiction elements under Article 25 of the Convention are fully satisfied.

LIABILITY

EXPROPRIATION CLAIM UNDER ARTICLE 16 OF THE IMPLEMENTATION AGREEMENT

The Claimant's claim for expropriation hinges on the undertaking given by GoT in Article 16

of the Implementation Agreement.

Under Article 16.1 of the Implementation Agreement, GoT is expressly prohibited from

certain specific actions, namely:

16.1 Assurance Against Discriminatory Action

The GOT shall not take any discriminatory action which materially and
adversely affects the Project or the performance of the Company's
obligations or the enjoyment of its rights or the interests of the Investors
under the Security Package or expropriate or, except as hereinafter
provided, acquire the Facility or the Company, whether in whole or in
part. Nothing in the foregoing shall apply to any actions taken by the
GOT, TANESCO, or any Governmental Authority pursuant to their
respective rights and obligations arising under this Agreement, the
Power Purchase Agreement and the other documents comprising the
Security Package.352
Under Article 16.2 of the Implementation Agreement, GoT undertook not to expropriate or

nationalise the assets of the IPTL:

16.2 Acquisition of Shares or Assets

Subject to Article 20. 1, the GOT undertakes to the Company that neither
it_nor TANESCO or any Governmental Authority will expropriate,
compulsorily acquire, nationalise, or otherwise compulsorily procure

any Ordinary Share Capital or assets of the Company [...].353
(4) Scope of Expropriation Under Article 16.2 of the Implementation Agreement
a. Parties’ Submissions
The Claimant submits that the term “expropriate” in Article 16.2 of the Implementation
Agreement should be given the meaning as understood under international investment law.
According to the Claimant, the term must be read in the context of the factual background,

including that: (i) the Implementation Agreement was part of a suite of agreements entered

into to support a significant foreign investment in Tanzanian infrastructure; (ii) the purpose
of the Implementation Agreement was to provide investment protection to IPTL and its debt
and equity investors; (iii) the language of Article 16.2 of the Implementation Agreement is
broad and there is no definition of “expropriation”, albeit there is a prohibition of the same by
any “Governmental Authority”, which is defined by Article 1.1. of the PPA, and could include
executive, legislative, administrative or judicial acts; and (iv) as there is an ICSID arbitration
clause, there was an intent that the term “expropriate” would have the meaning attributed to
it by ICSID tribunals.35+

The Claimant similarly submits that the Parties’ agreement on the meaning of “expropriate”
under the Implementation Agreement is not prohibited by Tanzanian Law, and expropriation
can have a meaning independent of the statutory protection in Section 22 of The Tanzanian
Investment Act, 1997. Furthermore, according to the Claimant, claims for indirect, creeping
expropriation and measures tantamount to expropriation are contemplated by The
Tanzanian Investment Act, 1997 and the National Investment (Promotion and Protection) Act,
1990, as they reference investment treaties, which commonly encompass such broad notions
of expropriation.355 Moreover, the Claimant underscores that it is not bringing a claim under
domestic legislation, so the only matter that the Tribunal needs to determine is the meaning

of “expropriation” under the Implementation Agreement.35¢

The Claimant submits, in the alternative, that even if Article 16.2 is construed to give the term
“expropriate” a narrow meaning, the Tribunal should nonetheless consider international
investment law protections against expropriation, which the Claimant contends cannot be
disregarded.357 As support for this premise, the Claimant cites Caratube v Kazakhstan, for
example, where the tribunal concluded that protections under international investment law

could not be ignored even when parties have chosen domestic law to apply.358

With respect to the elements of expropriation, citing prior ICSID cases,35° the Claimant
submits that expropriation does not require a benefit to accrue to the State.3°° Moreover, the
Claimant contends that judicial acts may constitute expropriation. The Claimant submits that
Article 16.2 of the Implementation Agreement anticipates expropriation through judicial acts
as it explicitly prohibits expropriation by any “Government Authority”, which, according to

Article 1.1 of the PPA, includes any “court, judicial or administrative body.” 361

In the Claimant's view, the test for judicial expropriation is the same as any other form of
expropriation: expropriation occurs when the act complained of results in a substantial
deprivation of a property right or benefit of a property right.362 The Claimant underscores
that the expropriation standard is distinct from a denial of justice and that there is
consequently no requirement for judicial acts to be “tainted by a denial of justice.”3©3 Similarly,
the Claimant contends that there is no requirement to exhaust local remedies before pursuing

a claim for expropriation by the judiciary.36+

With regard to the Respondent's argument that the Claimant did not possess property rights
that could be subject to expropriation, the Claimant explains that the Implementation
Agreement is different from a bilateral investment treaty and that its claims are not for any
property rights which it or Mechmar holds. Rather the Claimant is claiming a breach of the
contractual undertaking not to expropriate the Ordinary Share Capital and assets of IPTL as

listed in Article 16.2 of the Implementation Agreement.365

GoT submits that Article 16.2 of the Implementation Agreement is subject to Tanzanian law,
and it must therefore be interpreted and construed in accordance with Tanzanian law.366
Under the Law of Tanzania, the concept of “expropriation” is limited to a form of “lawful

expropriation, enacted through a legislative act, entailing a dispossession of the expropriated

party and a correspondent taking of the property by the State against compensation of the
expropriated party”.37 Moreover, although the Claimant argues that the definition of
“Governmental Authority” in the Implementation Agreement includes any “court, judicial or
administrative body”, this definition must still be interpreted in light of Tanzanian law, which

does not recognize judicial expropriation.3

263. GoT says that the Constitution of Tanzania protects personal rights to property, and that
special Tanzanian laws in particular Section 22 of The Tanzania Investment Act, 1997 and
Section 28 of the National Investment (Promotion and Protection) Act, 1990 speak only to this
form of legal expropriation and no other form such as “indirect, judicial or creeping
expropriation to the benefit of third private parties and with no benefit whatsoever accruing to

the State.”369

264. The provisions relied upon by the Respondent are:

i National Investment (Promotion and Protection) Act, 1990, Section 28:

28.-(1) No approved enterprise, or any property belonging to any person
shall be compulsorily taken Possession of, and no interest in a right over
such enterprise or property shall be compulsorily acquired except for
public interest and after due process of the law.37°

ii. The Tanzania Investment Act, 1997, Section 22:371

22(1) [...] (a) no business enterprise shall be nationalised or
expropriated by the Government, and

(b) no person who owns, whether wholly or in part, the capital of any
business enterprise shall be compelled by law to cede his interest in the
capital to any other person.

(2) There shall not be any acquisition, whether wholly or in part of a
business enterprise to which this Act applies by the State unless the

acquisition is under the due process of law which makes provision for -
(a) payment of fair adequate and prompt compensation [...]

The Respondent further refutes the Claimant’s submission that Section 23 of The Tanzania
Investment Act, 1997, which references bilateral investment treaties, was meant to
incorporate the wider concept of expropriation under those instruments as that provision
merely states the obvious: that investors with bilateral investment treaties have access to
arbitration; but Section 23 does not purport to incorporate the bilateral investment treaties

definition of expropriation.372

The Respondent submits that Article 16.2, read with Article 20.1 of the Implementation
Agreement, presupposes a direct taking of the Facility by GoT373 and that in all such cases,
compensation would be payable by GoT in accordance with the formulae set out in Schedule
2 thereof, which corresponds with the value of the Facility taken over. GoT concedes that
there is no specific reference to a “transfer of the Facility” to GoT specified under Article
20.1(d) of the Implementation Agreement (“expropriation”), but says that it would be unfair
to GoT to have to pay compensation for the value of the Facility without the transfer of the
Facility to GoT and therefore it must be inferred that GoT must have already acquired the
Facility. It therefore concludes that in all situations, GoT must have directly acquired
possession of the Facility, viz. that GoT has taken over the Facility or acquired shares in IPTL,
neither of which have in fact occurred as the Facility remains owned by IPTL, a private legal

entity.374

The Respondent also submits that because the compensation for expropriation, which is
under row 4 of Schedule 2 of the Implementation Agreement, is less than compensation for
contractual breaches under Row 2 of Schedule 2, the remedy contemplated under Article
20.1(d) of the Implementation Agreement must be a reference to “lawful expropriation”
otherwise “it would make no sense for the Government to escape the obligation to pay a higher

compensation as ordinarily due in case of breaches of the Implementation Agreement.”375

The Respondent objects to the Claimant’s attempt to incorporate international law, ignoring
the specific applicable law clause that designates Tanzanian law. The Respondent counters
that scholars have confirmed international law cannot be imported where there is a specific
municipal law in the contract. Moreover, the Respondent points out that in addition to the
ICSID clause, there is also an ICC clause in the contract.3”° The Respondent similarly rejects
the Claimant’s argument based on Article 42 of the ICSID Convention to take into account
international law, as this provision only applies where there is no party agreement, and in
this case the Parties agreed to the application of Tanzanian law.3”? The Respondent argues

that not taking Tanzanian law into account would be a ground for annulment.378

In addition, the Respondent contends that even under an international law standard, the
Claimant's case fails as the State has not received either a direct or indirect benefit from the
alleged expropriation. The Respondent further argues that another flawed aspect of the
Claimant’s case is that the Claimant only holds security rights, which do not constitute

property rights that can be expropriated.379

The Respondent submits that even if international investment law were applicable, the
Claimant’s case on judicial expropriation would fail as its case relates only to a few judicial
decisions, not to the judiciary as a whole.2®° In the Respondent’s view, under international
law, for a judicial act to constitute expropriation it “cannot simply be illegal but the
proceedings leading up to said act must amount to denial of justice’, which necessitates the
exhaustion of local remedies.38! Moreover, the Respondent asserts that there can be no
judicial expropriation when the “frustrations suffered by the investors in local courts were due

to their own procedural errors”, which the Respondent submits is the case here.382

b. Tribunal'’s Analysis

271. The term “expropriate” was used twice in Article 16 of the Implementation Agreement, but it
has not been specifically defined. As the Implementation Agreement is expressly subject to
Tanzanian law,3®3 the Tribunal has some difficulty accepting the logic of GoT’s argument, that
Tanzanian law recognises only legal expropriation with compensation and therefore what
was allegedly done by GoT could not be “expropriation” as contemplated in Article 16 of the
Implementation Agreement. In other words, GoT appears to contend that Article 16 of the
Implementation Agreement is an undertaking by GoT not to expropriate legally and not a
prohibition against expropriating illegally. Perhaps, realising the strained logic in its
submission, the Respondent subsequently accepted that “/t/his does not mean that cases of
unlawful expropriation would be unable to give rise to the Government's liability but simply that
IPTL or its valid assignees would have no action under the Implementation Agreement for any

event of unlawful expropriation [...].”38+

272. The Tribunal does not consider it plausible that the parties would have entered into the
Implementation Agreement with protections for IPTL that went no further than lawful
expropriation under Tanzanian law. In the Tribunal’s view, this argument is obviously flawed

and must be rejected.

273. The Constitution of Tanzania provides in Article 24 that -

(1) Every person is entitled to own property, and has a right to the
protection of his property held in accordance with the law.

(2) Subject to the provisions of subarticle (1), it shall be unlawful for any
person to be deprived of his property for the purposes of nationalization
or any other purposes without the authority of law which makes
provision for fair and adequate compensation. 385

274. The Constitutional position is that to deprive someone of its property, whether for purposes
of “nationalization or any other purposes”, “fair and adequate compensation” must be provided
to the person so deprived. This overarching protection is extended to foreign businesses

under specific Tanzanian legislation (viz. The Tanzania Investment Act, 1997 and National

Investment (Promotion and Protection) Act, 1990), which provide that “no interest in a right
over such [...] property shall be compulsorily acquired [...]” and any acquisition of a “business”
[...] “whether wholly or in part’, of a foreigner by GoT is permitted3®6 only after due process
of law and with adequate compensation being given. The law also expressly provides
protection for an investor against being “compelled by law to cede his interest in the capital to
any other person.”387 This means that any form of interference with the rights of foreign
investors, whether by dispossessing or disempowering them of their lawful exercise over the
investment or related security, would be unlawful expropriation and expressly prohibited.
The granting of protection to foreign investment is in the interest of Tanzania. GoT’s
acceptance of the prohibition against expropriation (which it is in any event legally bound
not to do under Tanzanian law) under Article 16.1 of the Implementation Agreement and its
undertaking not to expropriate under Article 16.2 of the Implementation Agreement, do not
violate and is in fact fully consistent and compliant with the Tanzanian Constitution and the

investment laws.

The Preamble in the Implementation Agreement sets out clearly that it was given to
encourage the public-private sectors’ cooperation to build the Facility for generating
electricity for the national grid. The Implementation Agreement speaks of foreign investors,
lenders, foreign currency, etc. The reference by GoT, to the use of the notion of “expropriation”
in The Tanzania Investment Act, 1997 and the National Investment (Promotion and Protection)
Act, 1990 shows that the term is intended as a protection against compulsory acquisition
given in relation to foreign investments in Tanzania. Both pieces of legislation make specific
reference to ICSID. In the Tribunal’s view, both Tanzanian legislations are clearly intended to
reflect what is usually understood and accepted in international law, in particular in the
application of the ICSID Convention and investment treaties, which was the context in which
these laws on foreign investment were enacted. Similarly, the term “expropriate” as used in
the text of Article 16, not being qualified in any manner must be given it ordinary meaning

viz. it includes both direct and indirect expropriation as understood in international law.

386 This requirement under the National Investment (Promotion and Protection) Act 1990, Section 28 was omitted under
the later The Tanzania Investment Act 1997, Section 22; HB/G/182/13157-13193 at pgs. 13178-13179: The National
Investment (Promotion and Protection Act) (Tanzania), Part V, 19 June 1990; HB/G/176/12866-12886 at pg. 12881: The

The right to be protected against expropriation in the international context is a right given by
host States to ensure foreign investors enjoy protection against involuntary deprivation or
dispossession of an investor’s property or property rights. Expropriation may be expressly
permitted and thereby lawful if it is made pursuant to Tanzanian law, for public purposes,
and subject to due process and adequate compensation. The clearest example of a direct
expropriation is when a host State takes over the project, the facility, or its management
directly and runs it as a State enterprise; or when the host State compulsorily acquires the
controlling shares of the investor company. Expropriation can also be achieved indirectly,
where no actual outright seizure or taking of property by the State occurs but actions
attributable to a host State (whether directly or indirectly) result in the investor being
deprived of the “economic value of the investment or deprive the owner of its ability to manage,

use or control its property in a meaningful way.”388

There is a body of decisions both in ICSID and non-ICSID investor-State arbitrations relating
to claims for indirect expropriation. Many of these arose from a change to the regulatory
regime of the host State that negatively impacted the investment at issue.3®° In essence, to
establish expropriation, the Claimant needs only show that the rights that it would otherwise
enjoy have been substantially impacted or that it has been deprived of control over or access
to the economic use of its investment. There is also no requirement that GoT must have
directly acquired possession of the Facility, by itself taking over the Facility or the shares in
IPTL. Tanzanian law recognises that “expropriation” could be founded upon the actions of

GoT which lead to the acquisition by “any other person.”3

The Respondent, in its argument against indirect expropriation, takes the view that
expropriation must only mean expropriation by GoT executed by way of an act of the
legislature and that therefore the actions or omissions of all other arms of the State, whether
the judiciary or government linked entities could never be attributable to the GoT. In the first

place, nothing in the Tanzanian Constitution supports the suggestion that expropriation

could only take place by way of a Tanzanian legislation. In the Tribunal’s view, there is no
justification for this limitation. The State is compendious and may act through different
agencies which actions are nevertheless attributable to the State because these actions carry
out State functions. The acts of the State must necessarily include the acts of organs of State,
the executive and judicial arms of the State and any entity given public powers to act on behalf
of the State. The Tanzanian Constitution also does not exclude any specific arm of government

the judiciary as a possible player in the act of expropriation.

The Tribunal does not disagree with the Respondent that the judiciary should not be
implicated, or its acts be described as “judicial expropriation” simply because judicial
decisions were taken in error or may be considered aberrant. However, judicial decisions that
permit the actions or inactions of other branches of the State and which deprive the investor
of its, property or property rights, can still amount to expropriation. While denial of justice
could in some case result in expropriation, it does not follow that judicial expropriation could

only occur if there is denial of justice.

As for other possible actors in the alleged expropriation, the Respondent has pointed out that
the Administrator General and Official Receiver’s office when acting in its capacity as
liquidator (provisional or otherwise) or receiver was acting as an agent of the company in or
pending liquidation. That is indeed the proper role. However, the office of the Administrator
General and Official Receiver remains an arm of GoT; it is at all times a part of the Ministry of
Justice and Constitutional Affairs. Insofar as discharging its duties in the interest of the
company in liquidation, it is expected to hold a high standard of integrity and impartiality. If
the office of the Administrator General and Official Receiver acts beyond the boundaries
granted by the law, such improper acts could not be attributable to the Company as its
principal. The Administrator General and Official Receiver must be liable for its own actions
and not that of the Company. This is all the more so if it acted in a manner that favoured the
GoT to the detriment of other persons with an interest in the company in liquidation. The
Respondent cannot hide behind the argument that the Administrator General and Official

Receiver was merely acting as an agent of the company.

In this context, the Tribunal notes that the undertaking given against expropriation under

Article 16.2 of the Implementation Agreement is made in respect of the actions of “GOT”,

96

282.

283.

284.

“TANESCO’, or “any Governmental Authority”, The term “Governmental Authority”3°! is defined
as -

Any state, municipal or local government or regulatory department,

body, political subdivision, commission, instrumentality, agency,

ministry, court, judicial or administrative body, taxing authority or

other relevant authority having jurisdiction over either Party, the

Facility.
There is no question that the office of the Administrator General and Official Receiver is a
Government Authority, which could exercise authority over the parties. Its action or inaction

beyond that permitted by law must therefore be attributable to GoT.

The Respondent's submission that the Claimant has no property interest but merely security
rights is also quite misplaced. Firstly, the Claimant is not claiming a breach of the Constitution
where the term “property” is used. The Claimant's claim is based on the contractual terms of
Article 16 under which GoT, is prohibited from expropriating or acquiring the Facility or IPTL,
and undertook that it (and TANESCO, and any Government Authority) would not
“expropriate, compulsorily acquire, nationalise, or otherwise compulsorily procure any
Ordinary Share Capital or assets of the Company.” The Claimant’s interest in the Facility and
shares of the IPTL may have come through the Security Package. That itself does not mean
the Claimant’s interest are merely security rights and not property rights. The Claimant as
absolute assignee has all the rights in and of IPTL and IPTL’s assets for which the Respondent
undertook not to expropriate or compulsorily acquire or otherwise procure. There is no

question that these are property rights and not mere security rights.

The Tribunal therefore holds that the contractual prohibition in Article 16 of the
Implementation Agreement against expropriation and the undertaking not to expropriate
given by GoT are compliant and consonant with the Tanzanian Constitution. The Respondent
is therefore bound by its terms not to do anything which would deprive the Claimant's
interest in IPTL and the assets of IPTL. Whether the Respondent through its various
“instrumentality, agency, ministry, court, judicial or administrative body” acted in a manner
that amount to a breach of Article 16 is a matter of fact that the Tribunal needs to hereafter

examine.

(2) Claimant's Expropriation Allegations

In the discussion that follows, the Tribunal will consider the allegations made against GoT
that the Claimant asserts are steps which either individually or collectively violate the

prohibition against expropriation.

The principal actors identified by the Claimant that had roles in this regard were:
i TANESCO;
ii. the Tanzanian courts (particularly the actions of Utamwa J in handing down the

Utamwa J Order);

iii, the provisional liquidators appointed over IPTL and the Administrator General;
iv. BRELA;

v. the Minister of Energy and Minerals and the PS MEM;

vi. the Attorney General; and

vii. the Bank of Tanzania.

The Respondent on the other hand says that the real parties involved in the entire affair were
several different entities, mostly private ones, such as IPTL, VIP, Mechmar, PAP and others,
but not the Government.3%2 Additionally, the Respondent submits that as a factual matter
neither IPTL nor SCB HK was ever nationalised or expropriated by the Government. IPTL has
always been a private company and its rights and assets have remained with its shareholders,
albeit they have changed. In addition, the Respondent submits that the Tariff Dispute was
eventually negotiated between TANESCO and IPTL, the Escrow Account was released upon
IPTL’s instructions, the top up payments were paid to IPTL, and the Facility remained in

IPTL's possession.393

The Claimant lists the following actions as constituting expropriation of the Facility, IPTL's

by SCB HK, following the Utamwa J Order, concerning its rights over IPTL's Ordinary
Share Capital. This was followed by BRELA's subsequent registration of PAP as the
owner of all of the shares in IPTL, which constitutes an expropriation of IPTL's

Ordinary Share Capital.

289. The Respondent submits that there was no breach of Article 16.2 of the Implementation

Agreement. In summary, the Respondent disputes the Claimant’s expropriation claims as

follows:

IPTL's rights under the PPA: payments under the PPA were delayed by
TANESCO’s decision to dispute invoices issued by IPTL. This decision was
justified by IPTL overcharging TANESCO, as eventually recognised by
the PPA Tribunal. In not pursuing the Interpretation Proceedings
(which were eventually withdrawn by Mechmar) the first provisional
liquidator of IPTL, Mr Rugonzibwa (even assuming that he may be
considered a Government official in his function as provisional
liquidator, which is denied), exercised his discretion as granted to him
by the law. In any case, TANESCO and IPTL eventually reached an
agreement to end the Tariff Dispute and restore payments to IPTL,
which now renders Claimant’s complaint in this respect moot and
untimely.

The Ordinary Share Capital of IPTL: This was transferred by Mechmar
and VIP, the original shareholders of IPTL, to PAP. To the extent that
said transfers violated SCB HK’s rights as a secured creditor, VIP and
Mechmar are the entities responsible for said violation. To the extent
that the Utamwa J Order recognised said transfers, SCB HK did not take
the necessary actions to counter said finding or to have its rights
otherwise judicially recognised in Tanzania and is thus now barred from

395 See para. 39 above.

bringing a claim of expropriation by the judiciary. Furthermore,
Claimant cannot complain about Mr Saliboko, the second provisional
liquidator of IPTL (assuming that he may be considered a Government
official in his function as provisional liquidator, which is denied)
countersigning the VIP/PAP SPA as Mr Saliboko was entitled to have
doubts on SCB HK’s standing as a secured creditor, given that the PwC
Report noted that the Security Deed had not been registered or stamped
at BRELA. In any case, as provisional liquidator, Mr Saliboko’s actions
were subject to the scrutiny of the High Court of Tanzania, before which
Claimant failed to adequately challenge them. Finally, Claimant can
neither complain about Government officials or BRELA recognising the
transfer of the Ordinary Share Capital of IPTL as they could not reverse
the findings of the judiciary made through the Utamwa J Order.

The Facility: The same considerations made with respect to the Utamwa
J Order in relation to the transfer of the Ordinary Share Capital of IPTL
apply to the transfer of the Facility to PAP.

IPTL’s interest in the Escrow Account and top-up payments: further to
the Utamwa J Order transferring the affairs of IPTL to PAP and to
TANESCO and IPTL reaching an agreement for the release of the Escrow
Account funds, the Government could not refuse to transfer said funds
to IPTL. While the Escrow Agreement expressly prohibits payments
being made to creditors of IPTL (such as SCB HK) - and contains no such
prohibition with respect to shareholders or managers of IPTL - the
Government released the funds on the basis of IPTL’s instructions. The
Government played no role with respect to the top-up payments, which
were agreed exclusively between TANESCO and IPTL in October 2013
and were directly paid by TANESCO to IPTL in the years thereafter.3©

(@) Tribunal’s Analysis

The ICSID 1 Award3%’ resolved some of the initial disputes between IPTL and TANESCO by
incorporating a new financial model agreed to by TANESCO and IPTL, which would be used
by the parties to calculate the capacity and energy tariffs after the start of commercial
operation. The ICSID 1 Tribunal also trimmed down certain costs incurred and ordered them
to be borne by IPTL.

Differences between Mechmar and VIP thereafter arose when VIP took the position that
Mechmar should bear the additional expenses disallowed to be recoverable by the ICSID 1
Tribunal, instead of accounting for them as expenses to be borne by IPTL. This led to VIP
petitioning for the liquidation of IPTL in the Tanzanian High Court%* on 25 February 2002.
Against this background, Mechmar commenced the LCIA Arbitration based on the PSA of 28
September 1994, and eventually obtained the LCIA Award?” directing VIP to discontinue its
Petition for Winding Up and application for appointment of a provisional liquidator in Misc.

Civil Cause No. 49 of 2002 before the Tanzanian courts.

Meanwhile, TANESCO began payment of the tariffs following the commencement of
commercial operations of the Facility in 2001. But in 2004, TANESCO started raising issue
over certain tariff payments. TANESCO continued paying IPTL on the urging of GoT.*° These
payments flowed down to enable repayments of the loan by IPTL (first to Danaharta and later

to SCB HK). TANESCO stopped doing so in May 2007.

In May 2007, TANESCO raised the issue of Mechmar's contribution to the capital of IPTL
which was made principally by way of a shareholder loan rather than paid-up share capital.
TANESCO argued that this was inconsistent with the PPA and the ICSID 1 Award. TANESCO

however made payments to the Escrow Account.

The differences between IPTL and TANESCO relating to the tariff payment led IPTL (the
majority shareholders Mechmar were supported by SCB HK) in June 2008, to commence the
Interpretation Proceedings under Article 50 of the ICSID Convention in relation to the ICSID
1 Award. IPTL’s action was challenged by TANESCO as lacking a valid corporate act on the
basis that VIP had not authorised the commencement of the Interpretation Proceedings.
Mechmar sought to rely on its LCIA Award to assert its authority to maintain the
Interpretation Proceedings. The LCIA Award was never given effect, and, although an
application for setting aside was made in September 2003 and an application for enforcement

was made in November 2004, they were not heard until 31 October 2008 when the LCIA

Award was eventually refused enforcement by Oriyo J**! on the basis that Mechmar had not

complied with the court’s direction to serve submissions as directed earlier.

In November 2008, to establish IPTL’s position to pursue the Interpretation Proceedings, SCB
HK applied to the Tanzanian courts to restrain VIP from continuing the Winding Up

proceedings against IPTL.*°2 This application was never heard.

On 15 December 2008, in the exercise of its power granted to it under the Charge of Shares,
SCB HK appointed a receiver over VIP's shares in IPTL to order use of those shares to vote in

favour of continuation of the Interpretation Proceedings.*03

On 16 December 2008, the Receiver appointed for the VIP Shares applied to the High Court
of Tanzania in the same Misc. Civil Cause No. 49 of 2002 asking that “the petition for the
winding up, and the application for the appointment of a provisional liquidator [...be]

withdrawn and/or abandoned.” *%*+

On that same day, 16 December 2008, which was also the day the tribunal in the
Interpretation Proceedings was set to sit to hear the Parties in London, the High Court of
Tanzania (Oriyo J)*°5 dismissed IPTL’s application for a stay, granted VIP’s application for the
appointment of a provisional liquidator and appointed the Administrator General /Official
Receiver as First PL. The written decision of Oriyo J does not suggest any hearing was held
before the matters were decided. In relation to the stay application, the Learned Judge, while
accepting that the application for appointment of a provisional liquidator should not be
decided before considering IPTL’s application for stay of the proceedings, went on to dismiss
the application for stay saying it “does not serve any useful purpose”:*°6

[..] It will be unfair to determine the petition to wind up IPTL before its

applications for stay is determined. However, due to intervening factors

since March, 2002 to date, a decisions on application for stay may not

serve any useful purpose [...] And as correctly stated by the applicant

the application for stay of proceedings has been overtaken by events and
is now redundant. It has become obsolete; it does not serve any useful

purpose. In the circumstances, the application for stay of proceedings
pending arbitration is accordingly dismissed. [...].

 

It is unclear what circumstances convinced Oriyo J that the stay application could serve no
useful purpose. What is clear is that the LCIA Award though not enforced remains a valid
arbitral award, unless it had been set aside by the court of the seat of arbitration (viz. the
English courts). It should be noted that in her decision of October 2008, Oriyo J did not in fact
set aside the award, because she took the view that “[hJaving dismissed the Petition to Enforce

Award, the application to set aside the Award is rendered obsolete.” *°”

In relation to VIP’s application for a provisional liquidator, Oriyo J stressed that Mechmar and
IPTL’s written submissions were “limited to points of law” and “have not countered the
affidavits in the petition by the applicant; those averments stand uncontroverted and are
accordingly adopted by the court.” Relying on that, the court ruling appeared to have accepted
that:

On the degree of urgency; its relevancy here cannot be overstated

because the oppressive acts, fraud, etc of Mechmar against VIP has been

in a continuous process since 2001; that is, for a period of over seven
years [...]

The need for the appointment of a Provisional Liquidator pending
winding up has in no doubt been adequately established by VIP through
the affidavits of James Burchard Rugemalira filed on 25.2.2002 and
24,9.2003. [...].408

The court also remarked that the appointment of a provisional liquidator is justified in the
public interest in that:

It is intended to serve interests of groups like those doing business with
IPTL including TANESCO and the government of Tanzania.*°?

Urgency, potential detriment and public interest are of course sound factors that should be
considered by a court to appoint a provisional liquidator. It is curious that Oriyo J did not in
her written decision explain what had informed her of the sudden urgency that prompted her

to revive an application made in 2002 and relying on affidavits made some five years ago to

hold that an immediate appointment would be necessary and in the public interest without
calling upon the parties involved to be heard substantively.*!° In making this observation, the
Tribunal is assuming that the application*!! by the VIP Share Receiver made on the same day
was received by the court after the release of the Learned Judge’s decision. If the situation
was, otherwise, a further question arises as to why the Learned Judge did not consider the
application for the withdrawal of the provisional liquidator application and the abandonment

of the liquidation petition.

The appointment of the First PL halted the Interpretation Proceedings scheduled for 16
December 2008, as the authority to maintain any action on behalf of IPTL rested with the
First PL. As provisional liquidator, the First PL’s duty is to gather in and safeguard the assets
of IPTL. On this understanding, SCB HK wrote to the First PL seeking his consent to continue
the Interpretation Proceedings, as well as an undertaking to bear the costs incurred in doing
so and only seeking to recover them from IPTL in the event a favourable decision be made in
IPTL’s favour.*!? This was followed up on 8 January 2009 by SCB HK’s lawyers*!3 repeating
the same request and offering similar costs outlay. No response was forthcoming from the

First PL.

On the application of SCB HK on 23 January 2009, the Tanzanian High Court made an order
for the appointment of an Administrator for IPTL on 27 January 2009.*1* Unlike a provisional
liquidator, whose role is to preserve assets for creditors in anticipation of liquidation, the role
of an Administrator is to attempt a possible rescue of the company. Mihayo J saw a “new
ground” in Tanzanian company law through an Administrator, in that it would give IPTL an
opportunity to navigate on a new and firm direction. The Learned Judge was conscious that
such an order would dislodge the order made by Oriyo J appointing the First PL -

But what has taxed my mind a great deal is whether my granting of the

prayer for appointing an administrator has the effect of torpedoing,

cancel[lJing or over ruling my sister Judge which powers I do not have. I

am aware that Oriyo, J. was seeking to protect the assets of the Company

without more. An application like the present one was not before the
court then. After giving the question serious thought, in my considered

“10 HB/H/106/1147-1149: Email from Joe Casson to Wilman Leung, 16 December 2008 - It appears that Oriyo J did ask for
parties to attend on 16 December 2008 (based on the Claimant's understanding, it was to schedule a hearing of the
applications, but the judge instead delivered her decision).

opinion, this court has if it grants the application, an opportunity to take
matters further in a positive way, by rescuing the company. Under the
provisions of section 250 of the Act, an administration order protects a
company from its creditors and also protects the creditors. [...]

Iam persuaded that the powers as provided are far more than those of
a provisional liquidator and are capable of rescuing the company and
protecting the creditors. This means the 100mw the company is capable
of generating, and was actually generating, will not go down the
drain.415

Mihayo J made his order without hearing the First PL, a procedural error that led to the First
PL’s complaint to the Chief Justice and placed the matter suo motu on revision to the Court of

Appeal, which heard the same on 19 March 2009.

On 24 March 2009, the Administrator confirmed his instruction for the Interpretation
Proceedings to proceed.*!¢ The tribunal in the Interpretation Proceedings decided then to
proceed. However, on 9 April 2009, the Court of Appeal made its ruling revoking the
appointment of the Administrator. In doing so, it roundly condemned Mihayo J for failing to
hear the First PL and IPTL before making the order appointing the Administrator: “/...] there

can be no equal justice when one, for no compulsive reason, is condemned unheard.” *17

On 15 April 2009, the First PL informed the tribunal in the Interpretation Proceedings to stay

the proceedings.*!®

On 17 September 2009, SCB HK re-applied*!? for the appointment of an administrator. This

matter remained unheard and was eventually withdrawn in 2013.

In December 2009, SCB HK sought to intervene directly in the Interpretation Proceedings,
exercising its rights as assignee of the PPA pursuant to the Security Deed. The Interpretation

Proceedings did not proceed much further save for the challenge brought against Judge

Brower, who resigned and was replaced by Mr Makhdoom Ali Khan on 23 April 2010.42° Mr
Rokison, the president of the tribunal was also challenged on 25 June 2010 and the

proceedings were thereby suspended.

The ICSID public case record‘?! shows that IPTL requested the discontinuance of the
Interpretation Proceedings on 7 July 2010,422 to which TANESCO agreed on 13 July 2010.423
The ICSID 1 Interpretation Proceeding finally ended on 19 August 2010 by the discontinuance

order of the tribunal.

SCB HK relies upon this sequence of litigation to show that TANESCO, GoT officials and the
Tanzanian courts acted to frustrate IPTL’s efforts to progress the Interpretation
Proceedings.*2+ The Tribunal will consider whether these interventions sought to deprive

IPTL or SCB HK of their investment or their rights in the investment.

Although TANESCO failed to terminate the PPA in the ICSID 1 arbitration, it succeeded in
reducing the cost of the project from USD 163.5 million to USD 127.2 million, with a senior
debt of USD 89 million (further reduced to USD 85.3 million) and the remainder
(approximately USD 38 million) in equity.*25 This impacts the calculation of the tariff. The
ICSID 1 Award also disallowed certain EPC costs, thereby reducing the EPC costs from USD
114 million to USD 98 million.*6 This had the impact of reducing the capacity charges payable
by TANESCO. The ICSID 1 Award was based on a financial model of 70% debt and 30%
shareholders’ equity. Upon realising that IPTL’s shareholding had been financed largely by
shareholders’ loans, TANESCO took the position that it could not be bound by the formula for

the calculation of the capacity charges as agreed.

In the Tribunal’s view, whatever the merits of TANESCO’s position, TANESCO did appear to
have a concern that permitting a review of the ICSID 1 Award in the Interpretation

Proceedings risked weakening its bargaining position to insist on a reduction of capacity

charges. Adopting a litigation or negotiation strategy to protect one’s economic financial or
commercial interest is the right of any party. The various challenges launched by TANESCO
to the Interpretation Proceedings against IPTL’s standing, refusing SCB HK’s participation as
intervener and disqualification challenges against members of the tribunal may seem
unhelpful and obstructionist, nevertheless they were part of their litigation strategy. This

alone, does not deprive IPTL of the benefits of its investment.

The only government official implicated in this scenario was the First PL. SCB HK’s complaint
is that he did nothing to progress the Interpretation Proceedings and had frustrated attempts
to move the Interpretation Proceedings even when SCB HK had offered to fund the
proceedings on a cost-recovery basis should IPTL succeed against TANESCO. No explanation
was forthcoming from the First PL to explain the position he had taken. It is the duty of the
provisional liquidator, to gather in and preserve the assets of IPTL. Why then the inaction?
Counsel for GoT suggested that the First PL must have considered that the potential benefits
to be gained in the Interpretation Proceedings were outweighed by the costs of continuing
them and the risk that they could be unsuccessful. SCB HK’s offer that it would bear the costs
and seek costs recovery only upon successful recovery from TANESCO would appear to have
taken away much of the risk. Arguably, if IPTL failed in the Interpretation Proceedings, there
could be cost exposure, but failing to take up SCB HK’s invitation to discuss funding would
appear to be imprudent. It is unexplained why no steps were taken to protect the interests of
IPTL.

Unlike TANESCO which was protecting its own financial interest, the First PL has the primary
responsibility of preserving the assets of IPTL. SCB HK, as a substantial creditor and successor
lender, is an investor protected under the Implementation Agreement. The First PL’s inaction
could well have put the investor at risk. However, it is uncertain and somewhat speculative
to suggest that had the First PL decided to proceed with the Interpretation Proceedings, the
outcome would be one that favours the IPTL. As such, the Tribunal is not prepared to hold

that this lapse by the First PL is sufficient to meet the threshold of expropriation.

Looking then at the role of the courts, the Tribunal does find Oriyo J’s refusal of the stay of
the liquidation proceeding and the application for the appointment of the provisional
liquidator, troubling. Oriyo J came to a view that was not explained and perhaps inexplicable:
that the stay application no longer served any purpose and was obsolete; that the

appointment ofa provisional liquidator was urgent; and that it would be in the public interest

107

319.

(with specific mention of TANESCO and the Government) to appoint a provisional liquidator.
She did so without calling upon any of the parties concerned to address her. In doing so, Oriyo
J did exactly (if not more) than what the Court of Appeal said in its judgment of 9 April 2009427
with regard to Mihayo J’s order appointing the administrator. Oriyo J was fully aware that the
interested parties were all represented and yet did not call upon them to address her. Instead
she chose to make a decision on the same day that she had scheduled a meeting for directions.
It appears too coincidental that the judge decided to deliver her decision on the day (16
December 2008) the share receivers appointed over VIP (the petitioner for liquidation and
for appointment ofa provisional liquidator) applied to withdraw the Petition and application,
which was also the same day the Interpretation Proceedings were scheduled to begin in

London.

Oriyo J’s primary justification for the order appointing the provisional liquidator lacked
substance and was flawed in procedure and the appointment of a provisional liquidator had

a direct impact on IPTL as a going concern.

The Court of Appeal was of course correct to have set aside Mihayo J’s order appointing the
Administrator for breach of due process. The Court of Appeal however declined to consider
the merits of the application to appoint the administrator, and simply said that there were
“no compelling reasons to discuss the remaining issues” relating to the appointment of an
administrator, suggesting that if parties still wished to pursue such an appointment, they
could do so in the High Court. SCB HK then filed a new application*?8 on 17 September 2009
in Misc. Cause 112 of 2009 for the appointment of an administrator, serving it on the
Provisional Liquidator of IPTL, VIP, IPTL and the creditors of IPTL. This application was noted
by the court on several occasions (e.g. Kaijage J on 6 November 2009,42° 9 February 2011,430

The Tribunal accepts that divergence of views by the courts is to be expected and is very much
part of the legal system in many jurisdictions. Poor decisions or decisions without proper
justifications do not rise to the standard of expropriation. With regard to the actions and
inaction of the Tanzanian courts in relation to attempts by the Claimant to revive the ICSID 1
Award by the Interpretation Proceedings, the Tribunal finds that the Tanzanian judiciary as

a whole, had not acted to deprive IPTL or SCB HK of the economic value of their investments.

(i) PPA Arbitration

SCB HK’s inability to proceed with the Interpretation Proceedings to resolve IPTL’s
differences with the capacity charges and tariff payments as set out in paragraphs 293 to 312
above, led SCB HK (as IPTL’s assignee) to commence the PPA Arbitration in September 2010.
The PPA Arbitration was concerned with issues of IPTL’s actual “equity” participation, the
tariff calculations and the amount outstanding due to the IPTL. These were finally disposed
by the PPA Decision in February 2014,*35 the PPA Award in September 2016436 and confirmed

by the ad hoc Annulment Committee in 2018.37

Numerous adverse findings were made by the tribunal in the PPA Decision*3 and in the PPA
Award, and TANESCO was eventually found liable for not making payments of the tariff to
IPTL and SCB HK.

The Tribunal has considered the PPA Decision and the PPA Award and noted that while there

were allegations and suggestions that through some improper dealings GoT “took over

control” of the Facility,*3° the disputes were essentially contractual in nature and, in fact, the
PPA Tribunal was rightly conscious that an expropriation claim would not be within its
jurisdiction.4#° The case that TANESCO offered as the basis of its refusal to make payment to
IPTL and SCB HK was found by the PPA Tribunal to be wrong and not sufficient to absolve it
from its liability to SCB HK. Standing alone, the factual background that gave rise to those
disputes and the findings**! of liability in respect of payments due under the PPA could not,
in the Tribunal’s view, sustain a claim for expropriation or discrimination against SCB HK by
GoT. The fact that TANESCO had not honoured the PPA Award, on its own would also not
constitute an expropriatory act as they were but mere commercial disputes and/or non-

compliance with obligations under the contract or award.

(ii) Sale of Mechmar Shares and control of IPTL

At a meeting on 8 June 201042 with the PS MEM of Tanzania, Mr David Kitundu Jairo at his
office, SCB HK's legal counsel, Mr Charles Morrison, and Mr Joseph Wesley Casson were
informed that Mechmar had approached GoT to sell its majority shareholding in IPTL, and
that GoT had decided to buy the shares. Mr Jairo requested that Mr Morrison and Mr Casson

439 HB/D/004/367-479: PPA Decision,12 February 2014, para. 72: “Around October 2009, according to the Claimant, the
GoT took control of the power plant, and the PL and TANESCO entered into an interim PPA on February 5, 2010 (the “Interim
PPA”). According to the Claimant, “[t]he PL has not properly accounted for monies received pursuant to the interim operation
of the Plant. Despite repeated requests by SCB HK, the PL has failed to disclose detailed accounts reflecting the current state of
IPTL’s finances.”

440 HB/D/004/367-479: PPA Decision, 12 February 2014, paras. 247-248 -

“247. The issue of expropriation is a matter between SCB HK and the GoT, not between
SCB HK and TANESCO, and it has been the subject of a separate ICSID arbitration
between SCB and the Government of Tanzania. The GoT is not a party to the present
arbitration nor has the question of expropriation been placed before this Tribunal. Thus,
the Tribunal is not in a position to determine whether and at what date any
expropriation might have taken place or fix a date for the determination of loss relying
on an expropriation date as the effective date for limiting any damages claim for breach
of the PPA.

248. In sum, the Tribunal is able to determine whether there has been a breach of the
PPA and what loss flows from that breach. And, the loss it can determine includes all
losses resulting from that breach. It cannot fix a limit on those losses on the basis of an
expropriation claim that has not been placed before it and it is not in a position to
decide. Any claim that the acts of a third party have the effect of suspending either IPTL
or TANESCO’s obligation to perform the PPA would have to be made on the basis of the
PPA itself; in other words, it would have to be pleaded on the basis of an express
contractual term (such as a force majeure clause) or an equivalent doctrine under the
applicable law of the PPA. No such claim has been made by the Respondent.”

441 HB/D/005/480-586 at pgs. 584-585: PPA Award, 12 September 2016, para. 414 - The Tribunal ordered payment to and
release of the Escrow Account did not discharge TANESCO’s liability under the PPA; payments to PAP-controlled IPTL after
August 2013 did not discharge amount due; adjudged that TANESCO was to pay USD 148.4 million plus interest to SCB HK
under the PPA.

attend a meeting with himself and Datuk Baharuden Bin Abd Majid, representing Mechmar,
to discuss the Charge of Shares and determine who had the right to sell the 70% of shares in
IPTL held by Mechmar to the GoT. A meeting with Datuk Baharuden was held the next day in
which Mr Nimrod Mkono and Mr Karel Daele, lawyers for the GoT,**3 were also present. Mr
Casson and Mr Morrison reminded all that Mechmar Shares in IPTL were charged to SCB HK
and that a receiver had been appointed, and it was acknowledged in Mechmar’s Annual
Report that:

On 3rd February, 2009, SCBHK exercised its lien over the Company’s

shares in IPTL and appointed a Receiver & Manager over these said

shares. As such, the Company also lost control to govern the on-going

legal proceedings against TANESCO and the Government of Tanzania in
the capacity of a shareholder of IPTL.***

Meanwhile on 7 July 2010, Datuk Baharuden wrote to ICSID withdrawing the Interpretation
Proceedings on behalf of IPTL.*45 On 13 July 2010, TANESCO confirmed that it had no

objection to the discontinuance.*#6

On 19 July 2010, SCB HK wrote to Mr Jairo, setting out SCB HK’s security interest in the
Mechmar Shares, reiterating its position that sale of the Mechmar Shares could not be made
by Mechmar but by the Receiver.*47 On that same day, ICSID informed SCB HK of the
withdrawal of the Interpretation Proceedings by IPTL and invited comments to be received
by 23 July 2010.4#8 It is SCB HK’s case that it was unaware that Mechmar had initiated the
withdrawal of the Interpretation Proceedings. Mr Casson said that he thought it was the First
PL who had instigated the withdrawal.*#? The communication from ICSID to SCB HK indeed
made no mention of who initiated the “discontinuation” of the proceedings. The

Interpretation Proceedings came to an end on 19 August 2010.

The fact that GoT was in discussions to purchase the Mechmar Shares in or around July 2010

cannot be denied. In its letter of 11 August 2010 to the PS MEM, Mechmar referred to the

earlier discussions and stating “as desired by you” (Mr Jairo), submitted its proposal to sell its
stake of 70 % shares together with an assignment of its loan under its Shareholders Loan
Agreement to IPTL to GoT and promising that:

Mechmar Corp will take such steps and execute such documents or may

be required to assuage the concerns of the Government of Tanzania in

relation to claims of other parties. Mechmar Corp will also give an

irrevocable undertaking to co-operate and assist the Government of
Tanzania as well as TANESCO in resisting and defending against an
such claims and to assert its own claims.*5°

Mr Jairo then wrote to the Attorney-General and, referring to the specific undertaking made
by Mechmar set out in paragraph 327 above, sought advice to -

draw up a negotiation strategy for GOT's approval to be used in the
negotiations with Mechmar Corp for the final buying of the shares.*51

GoT was therefore on full notice*5? and aware of the interests of SCB HK in the Mechmar

Shares and was clearly intent on acquiring the Mechmar Shares.

With no assurance from Mechmar that it would not proceed with the intended sale, SCB HK
commenced court proceedings in Malaysia on 9 August 2010, to enforce its charge over the
Mechmar Shares. SCB HK’s application for an interim injunction to prevent Mechmar from
selling the Mechmar Shares was granted on 4 October 2010.*53 The court also ordered that
the share certificates be delivered to SCB HK within 7 days from date of the order. However,
on 12 October 2010, Mechmar’s solicitors informed SCB HK that Mechmar had sold its shares
in IPTL on 9 September 2010 and delivered the share certificates to the (undisclosed)

purchaser i.e., while the injunction application was pending.*5+

Following another order of the Malaysian Court (High Court of Malaya) on 19 October

2010,455 Mechmar disclosed that the Mechmar Shares were sold to Piper Link Investments

USD 6 million, with USD 1.2 million paid as a deposit.

332. By letter dated 2 November 2010, Mechmar’s solicitors disclosed a letter from a Mr Issa
Mohamed Al Rawahy, who was said to be the “owner” of Piper Link explaining that the sum
of USD 1.2 million supposed to have been paid as deposit by Piper Link was “paid to my good
friend Mr. Omar Mohamed AlBusaidy of Dubai for introducing us [...].”*57

333. SCB HK obtained an order from the High Court of Malaya on 8 November 2010458 appointing
“Receivers” of Mechmar. On the same day, Ms Renju commenced action as Share Receiver of
IPTL in the BVI Court and obtained an ex-parte freezing order*®® against Piper Link to deliver
the share certificates to the BVI Court and to take no steps to dispose of the shares pending a

trial of the action. The shares were eventually delivered to the BVI Court by Piper Link.*6°

334. Martha Renju obtained a final summary judgment from the BVI Court on 11 April 201146! and
the court ordered the release of the share certificates to Martha Renju forthwith. On 20 April
2011, Mr Casson informed the PS MEM of the outcome in the BVI Court (enclosing a copy of
the judgement) and copied the same to the Minister for Energy and Minerals and sought an
audience with the PS MEM.‘¢2 From these events, the Mechmar Shares reached the hands of

SCB HK in April 2011 and PS MEM and the Minister were so informed.

authorised by them and no other.*6*

336. It should also be recalled that the holder of the other 30% of the shareholding in IPTL was
VIP, who had executed by deed under seal a Charge of Shares over the same to the Security
Agent for the benefit of the secured creditors on 28 June 1997.65 The Security Agent, RHB
Bank, for and on behalf of the successor lender, SCB HK, had on 15 December 2008 appointed
a receiver over the shares pursuant to its power under the Charge of Shares and the

appointment was notified in the register of VIP on 19 December 2008.*6¢

337. By the VIP-PAP-SPA dated 15 August 2013, VIP purported to have sold to PAP its 30% shares
in IPTL for USD 75 million.*6? The VIP-PAP-SPA in its preamble cited a litany of events relating
to VIP’s claim that “SCB”468 had interfered in VIP’s winding-up proceedings which it said had
caused VIP loss and damage amounting to USD 465 million and that both VIP and PAP had
reached “the conclusion that SCB is not a Creditor of IPTL’*6° and had therefore decided to
resolve their differences by VIP selling its 30% stake in IPTL to PAP without prejudice to VIP’s

claim against SCB for more than USD 485 million.47°

338. The VIP-PAP- SPA also mentioned that-

(t) PAP has represented and warranted to VIP that it indirectly bought
MECHM[A]R's Shares in IPTL from PIPER LINKS INVESTMENTS
LIMITED as a bonafide purchaser since the year 2011 and that
transaction was not only sanctioned but validated by MECHMAR; and
SCBHK being cognizant of that fact, several times signed Agreements

PAP for US$ 75.0million the debt which SCBHK purports that it is owed
by IPTL. 471

The VIP-PAP-SPA however seems to acknowledge that the “rightful owner of MECHMAR’S
70% Shares in IPTL” still required to be resolved.*72 The VIP-PAP-SPA was signed on behalf
of PAP by Harbinder Singh Sethi as its Managing Director and Manraj Singh Bharya as its
Director. The VIP-PAP-SPA was “/w]Jitnessed and [e]ndorsed” by the Mr Philip Saliboko, the

Official Receiver and Provisional Liquidator of IPTL. 473

From the documents disclosed, the Tribunal notes that there were two documents that have

traced PAP’s claim to the Mechmar Shares viz:

i, Agreement for Sale of Shares between Piper Link and Mr Sethi dated 21 October
2010;474 and

ii. Deed of Assignment of Shares between Piper Link and PAP dated 21 October 2011.475

Mr Issa Al Rawahy signed both these documents on behalf of Piper Link even though an
injunction against the sale by Mechmar of its IPTL shares to Piper Link was issued on 4
October 2010 by the Malaysian Court (High Court of Malaya)*7¢ and the share certificates
were said to have already been surrendered to the BVI Court and subsequently into the hands
of SCB HK in April 2011 (see paragraphs 332 to 334 above) following the judgment having

been granted against Mechmar.

On any interpretation of these documents and the factual scenario surrounding their
execution, Piper Link could have no title to the Mechmar Shares sold, transferred or assigned
to PAP or Mr Sethi. That said, it could not be suggested that GoT was working in concert with
Mr Sethi or PAP in the VIP-PAP-SPA. Standing alone, this transaction did not directly involve
the GoT and could not be said to have committed any breach of Article 16 of the

Implementation Agreement.

(iii) ~The UtamwaJ Order*7”

The Winding up Petition, Misc. Civil Cause No. 49 of 2002 brought by VIP against IPTL, came
before Utamwa J on 3 and 5 September 2013 on the application made by VIP applying for a
withdrawal of the petition seeking winding-up of IPTL in the following terms:

1. That this court marks the petition as duly withdrawn with no order
as to costs.

2. That the appointment of the Provisional Liquidator be terminated.

3. That the Provisional Liquidator shall hand over all the affairs of IPTL
including the IPTL Power Plant (the plant) to PAP, which has committed
to pay off all legitimate Creditors of IPTL and to expand the plant
capacity to about 500 MW and sale power to TANESCO at a Tariff of
between Us Cents 6 and 8/Unit in the shortest possible time after taking
over in the public interests.

4. That parties are free to commence new independent claims in any
court with competent jurisdiction against any party should they fail to
reach amicable settlement out of court on any issue which arose in IPTL.

5. That the court has taken judicial notice of the agreement between VIP
and PAP.478

The application was supported by the provisional liquidator and “Mechmar’” as understood
by the court (represented by Mr Lutema, “Lutema/Mechmar’). It should be noted that prior
to this application, the provisional liquidator had made arrangements to pay off some
creditors mostly the lawyers (including those who were representing or represented VIP,
IPTL and Lutema/Mechmar) and other service providers,*”? but excluded SCB HK from the
arrangement. The payments were expected to be made from the monies being released from

the Escrow Account held at the BoT.

Based on the written ruling made by Utamwa J, there was general consensus that the
withdrawal of the winding-up petition should be permitted, except that an objection was
raised by Law Associates who said that the release/discharge of the Second PL should be

allowed only after all their fees are paid in full from the Escrow Account and for other

restraining orders. The court recorded Mechmar’s liquidators as not opposing the
withdrawal but objecting to the other prayers sought, as VIP and PAP had no mandate to

execute the agreement and prayed for the orders.

Utamwa J in his ruling dealt primarily with the objections raised by Law Associates about the
outstanding legal fees owed and the prayer for injunction against BoT, until these fees were
paid, and that the Second PL be restrained from handing over IPTL to PAP. The judge disposed
of the objection on the procedural footing that the application was made under the wrong
rule, was fatal and could not be cured. The court added that the creditors would, in any event,
not be prejudiced as the withdrawal of the winding up would not mean that creditors have
no recourse as on the contrary, the arrangement permitted parties to take action to pursue

their claims.

In relation to the Mechmar’s liquidators’ objection, the court ruled that they lacked locus
standi as their application to intervene was not before the court, and even if it was, no order
having been made permitting their intervention, they could not be heard in relation to

objections to any of the prayers sought.

Having understood the underlying history that led to this application to withdraw the
petition, the Tribunal has sympathy for granting the withdrawal. With the winding-up
petition out of the way, the long-standing matters relating to IPTL would come to an end and
the Facility would then be able to operate. But the real issue lies not with the withdrawal of
the winding-up petition of IPTL. The most disturbing aspect of the decision is that the court

had sanctioned the share transfer and allowed the Facility to be transferred to PAP.

Utamwa J's decision that the Mechmar’s liquidators had no standing and could not be heard
is inexplicable. There is no clearer principle common to all corporate insolvency law than that
when a company is in liquidation, the liquidator stands in the shoes of the company in
liquidation. This was the law applied to IPTL when it was in liquidation, hence the First PL,
the Liquidator and lastly the Second PL were heard as the voice of IPTL. Yet, Utamwa J seemed
to have ignored Mechmar’s liquidators who had been expressly given the direction by the

Malaysian Court to represent the interest of Mechmar in Tanzania.

Utamwa J was given a copy of the draft order of the prayers sought in advance and
presumably the supporting documents which included the VIP-PAP SPA. He would have

noted that that very document pointed to a dispute as to 70% of the ownership of the shares

117

351.

352.

353.

354,

in IPTL (see the preamble (s) and (z )) , yet he took “judicial notice” of the same and ordered
that “all the affairs of IPTL including the IPTL Power Plant (the plant) be handed over to PAP”.
By doing so, the court sanctioned the handing over of IPTL and the Facility to PAP. This order
was subsequently interpreted as including the monies held in the Escrow Account, which

were also to be released to PAP.

Quite clearly Utamwa|J either failed to read or simply chose to ignore the contents or consider
the implications of such an order. Even a cursory glance at the VIP-PAP-SPA would have
shown that there was another interest that the court ought to have been concerned about,
that is the interests of SCB HK, the successor lenders of the Facility as well as the majority

shareholders, Mechmar’s liquidators.

Unfortunately, Utamwa J denied SCB HK and Mechmar’s liquidators any speaking rights; and
instead purportedly taking “judicial notice” of the VIP-PAP-SPA arrangement and proceeded
to adopt the draft order crafted by the Second PL, VIP, Lutema/Mechmar to open wide the
door for PAP to enter IPTL without restrictions to do whatever PAP had planned. In doing so,
the court effectively shut out all of SCB HK’s rights and interest in the Facility and deprived it

of its right to control IPTL, and its interest in the investment.

In the Tribunal’s view, the Utamwa J Order was quite a thoughtless and reckless act made
without regard to the consequences that would follow. This had the immediate effect of
imperilling SCB HK’s economic rights and control over the Facility and assets assigned to it
by IPTL. SCB HK and Mechmar’s liquidators were left out as if they had no interest and no
contribution to the Facility, save only to witness the subsequent emptying of the Escrow
Account. The Utamwa J Order had gone beyond merely being a wrong judicial decision, rather

it is an egregious error amounting to abject failure of justice.

c Release of the Escrow Account Funds

The Respondent does not dispute the facts relied upon by the Claimant and how the funds
from the Escrow Account were released and eventually dissipated. It nevertheless relies on
the following to deny any responsibility for the losses allegedly suffered by SCB HK by stating
that:

i. the decision to settle the Tariff Dispute was triggered by the Utamwa J Order;

118

355.

356.

ii. once the Tariff Dispute was settled, the relevant Governmental Authorities could not

resist the release of the funds in the Escrow Account;#2°

iii. the Escrow funds were released to IPTL and it was for IPTL to repay creditors; ‘8
iv. IPTL’s non-payment of SCB HK was beyond GoT’s control; #82
v. it had been advised to satisfy itself that PAP had acquired Mechmar’s shares and was

given an indemnity by IPTL against adverse claims; *#3

vi. the Attorney-General’ advice that “Any decision to release the Tegeta Escrow Account
is safeguarded, protected and cushioned by the decision of the High Court (Utamwa,
yee

vii. the funds from the Escrow Account were released to IPTL and therefore there could
not be any expropriation; and

viii. the responsibility for the losses allegedly suffered by the Claimant lies with Mr Sethi
who after receiving the funds failed to settle with SCB HK. Further, that Mr Sethi was

not an agent of the GoT.*85

As the Tribunal has earlier remarked, the Utamwa J Order opened the door wide for PAP (and
Mr Sethi its Managing Director) to do whatever it liked, and PAP/Mr Sethi moved in very
quickly.

Mr Sethi convened a “first board [of directors] meeting” on 6 September 2013 and confirmed
himself and a Dr Magesvaran Subramaniam and Mr Manraj Singh Bharya as directors. Mrs
Leong Oi Mooi was removed as the company secretary and replaced with Mr Joseph
Makandege. The minutes also sought to confirm that the transfers of VIP’s 3 shares and
Mechmar’s 7 shares in IPTL be confirmed. In relation to the Mechmar Shares, the minutes
recorded that the transfer was from Mechmar to Piper Link and then on to PAP. The minutes
declared that the effect of the Utamwa J Order was that “The IPTL Power Plant and all other
IPTL properties and assets legally became vested to NOBODY ELSE but PAP.” #86

Mr Saliboko (Official Receiver/Provisional Liquidator of IPTL) handed control of IPTL to
PAP/Sethi on 10 September 2013.487

On 13 September 2013,488 IPTL (Mr Sethi) wrote to TANESCO demanding payment of all

outstanding monies owed to IPTL and the release of the funds in the Escrow Account.

On 16 September 2013, PS MEM (then Mr E. C. Maswi) sought advice from the Attorney -
General on PAP’s request “to release the money in the [...] Escrow Account to PAP’489 and
received a reply on the same day that as the Utamwa J Order was not appealed against and
there was no injunction against compliance, the Escrow Account should be handed over
subject to resolving the “Invoice Notice” dispute. The Attorney-General also advised that
GoT’s “Guarantee under the PPA should be re-negotiated given the changed circumstances and

the risks that it potentially expose the Government.”4°°

On 20 September 2013, PS MEM (then Mr E. C. Maswi), informed Mr Sethi that the Escrow
Account would be released subject to “Submission of evidence that you have legally purchased
70% shares of Mechmar in IPTL [..].”491

On 18 September 2013, IPTL (Mr Sethi) wrote to TANESCO appealing for release of the funds

from the Escrow Account and to pend any claims until later.49?

On 19 September 2013, the TANESCO board discussed the release and decided to hold the

release until the claims due to TANESCO had been sorted out.193

GoT did indeed set up a team of officials from Ministry of Minerals and Energy, Ministry of
Finance (“MOF”), Attorney General Chambers, TANESCO and the BoT (the “GoT team”). They

met for 5 days and submitted a report on 30 September 2013 to the Permanent Secretary

Treasury.‘ In its report the team observed that:

i. PAP had yet to register its ownership of the VIP shares with BRELA, because PAP had
yet to pay for the same in full;

ii. there was a potential claim by SCB HK;

iii. SCB HK was not a party to the “Compromise Agreement’ ;*°5

iv. there were pending actions commenced by IPTL Administrator Receiver, Martha

Renju in Commercial Case No. 123 of 20134% seeking declaration of SCB HK’s interest

and injunction restraining releasing assets in the Escrow Account and seeking control

of the IPTL Power plant;
v. SCB HK had no plausible claims;
vi. Martha Renju’s documents were executed outside Tanzania and would be

inadmissible as evidence; and
vii. IPTL (Mr Sethi) had agreed to consider a 10-15% discount off TANESCO’s outstanding
debts.

Based on these observations, the GoT team took the view that the SCB HK and Martha Renju’s
claims were unlikely to succeed. The GoT team’s concerns were focused only on any possible
exposure to GoT when the monies were released to PAP-controlled IPTL. They concluded
with the recommendation that GoT, BoT and TANESCO be freed from any obligation after the
release of the Escrow Account and to re-negotiate the PPA on “PAP’s commitment in terms [of]

generation and pricing [...].”497

The GoT team that was tasked to consider the validity of the sale of the Mechmar’s 70%
shares to PAP, simply stated that the “Share Purchase Agreement of [the] IPTL Shares, (30 per
cent of the VIP and 70 per cent of Mechmar) has been executed.” 4°8 Attached to the report was

a copy of the Deed of Assignment of Shares dated 21 October 2011.49 The report made no
mention of the fact that the Malaysian Court had prior to that date issued several orders
relating to Mechmar, particularly against the disposal of its 70% shares in IPTL. These orders
included an injunction5° (which SCB HK had forwarded to PS MEM on 14 October 2010)5
and an order appointing “Receivers” made on 8 November 2010.5°2 It was also well known
that Mechmar was eventually ordered to be wound up and liquidators were appointed by the
Malaysian Court. The orders and court actions in the BVI Court were not mentioned despite
the fact that on 20 April 2011,5°3 PS MEM was informed of the BVI Court judgment of 11 April
2011 that had ordered the Mechmar Shares be returned to SCB HK.

The GoT team had no reason to disregard the orders made by the Malaysian Court in relation
to Mechmar, a Malaysian company, but instead took the view that they were inadmissible in
Tanzania. This is an incomprehensible position to take. The ability of Mechmar (in
liquidation) to execute a sale of its assets must necessarily be dependent upon its ability
under Malaysian law and the directions of the Malaysian courts. As regards the BVI Court

ruling, the GoT team’s silence is indeed baffling.

The team’s confidence that SCB HK had no plausible claim is clearly misplaced. Unfortunately,
the GoT team was not alone. The Attorney-General*"* too took a similarly disdaining view in

much stronger terms:

On the issue of indemnity against futuristic claims against the
Government, I do earnestly think, that is farfetched and illusory. Talking
about on-going wrangles, none of them will negate what has already
been decided by the High Court (Utamwa J). I am thus of the firm view
that the only issue of substance relates only to funds in ‘permitted
investment.’ This is the issue given that TANESCO invoices and other
claims are out of the way.

Strangely, the final push to release the Escrow Account seems to have come from the
Attorney-General, who saw this as an opportunity to negotiate out of its guarantee or take
unilateral action. In his words “[t/he soonest this is done the best” since-

The government should not be seen to be waffling in implementing what

the court decided. This decision saves wider public interests that the

never-ending wrangles over funds in escrow account. Any decision to

release the Tegeta Escrow Account is safeguarded, protected and

cushioned by the decision of the High Court (Utamwa, J). There is no
obstruction or injunction to deal with the account as of now.

[ul

The Government should use this golden opportunity to disentangle
herself from unwarranted litigation. The High Court has given us a
summons of relief. We should act now instead of acting as a devil's
Advocate. Time is of essence.

The Attorney-General’s advice taken on its face urged the immediate “[t/ime is of essence”
direction for the release of the Escrow Account, dismissing SCB HK’s interest as totally
“illusory”. He also ignored the question of whether PAP owned Mechmar’s 70% shares in
IPTL. He was content to hide under the cover of the Utamwa J Order and to do so before

anything that changed this situation occurred.

The Tribunal could understand why GoT saw the “golden opportunity” to extricate itself from
what they perceived as a difficult situation and a problematic project which it had guaranteed
and committed to but doing so by ignoring the rights of SCB HK and imperilling its investment
must necessarily entail consequences. With Utamwa J’s Order opening the door, and the
Attorney-General pointing the way that it could hide behind that door, there was no longer

any impediment against the PAP-controlled IPTL from putting its hands on the funds.

The Attorney-General had also assured GoT that the “corporate veil” of IPTL could justify its
action. In this regard, the Attorney-General probably thought that so long as the escrow funds
were released to “/PTL”, regardless who was in control, GoT would be free from any adverse
claims by other creditors, in particular SCB HK. This same line was followed by GoT’s counsel

in this arbitration.

The Attorney-General’s advice and view was unfortunate and had emboldened the other GoT

officials to hasten the release of the funds, despite a pending application for stay of execution

of the Utamwa J Order by SCB HK,°°S for order against preventing Martha Renju from taking
possession of IPTL assets in Commercial Case No 100 of 20135% and for an order not to

release funds from the Escrow Account in Commercial Case 123 of 2013 by Martha Renju.507

Following further negotiations, TANESCO, IPTL (PAP controlled) and GoT (through PS MEM)
agreed to release the full sum in the Escrow Account and to pay a negotiated discounted top-

up amount of USD 45,485,719.97 or US$ 79,049,724.50.508

In the Tribunal’s view, the steps which GoT took, as set out in paragraphs 358 to 373 above,
were taken to minimise its exposure to possible adverse claims. None of them could justify
depriving SCB HK of its investment. The actions of GoT officials facilitated the transfer of
control in IPTL to PAP, viz. by the Second PL entering into the Compromise Agreement,
endorsing the VIP-PAP-SPA, and appearing before Utamwa J to consent to the adoption of the
draft order presented by VIP and PAP. The Attorney-General then, relying on Utamwa J's
“judicial notice” of the VIP-PAP-SPA, saw the “golden opportunity” to extricate itself from the
guarantees and assurances given to the Project and directed that the Escrow Account be
released “soonest.” The end result is that the Escrow Account was emptied in haste and paid

to PAP-controlled IPTL.

GoT having facilitated the taking-over of IPTL by PAP cannot now be permitted to say that
the release of the funds to IPTL discharges GoT and TANESCO’s responsibility. GoT knew well
that the funds did not go into IPTL but into the account of PAP. This is evidenced by the very
terms of the “AGREEMENT FOR DELIVERY OF FUNDS TO INDEPENDENT POWER TANZANIA
LIMITED,”5°9 where the funds were directed to be sent to PAP’s bank account and not to IPTL:

Swift Code: UNILTZTZ

Mr Sethi eventually directed BoT on 28 November 20135° to transfer the monies from the
Escrow Account directly to the PAP Account in Stanbic Bank-

Account Name: Pan Africa Power Solutions (T) Ltd
TZS account number: 9120000125294
USD account number: 9120000125324
Swift Code SBICTZTX
In that same letter, he asked that all the Treasury Bills held in the BoT Escrow Account be

transferred to “PAN AFRICA POWER SOLUTIONS (T) LTD c/o IPTL”.

The fact that GoT was fully mindful that by recognising that paying to a PAP-controlled IPTL
GoT would be subject to the potential exposure to SCB HK is reflected in the Deed of
Indemnity executed by PAP-controlled IPTL in favour of GoT as condition precedent for the
release, which in part started unequivocally in its preamble that -

The Government and the Escrow Agent being cautious of the pending

and potential disputes against IPTL in connection with the escrow

monies including the remnants of the Standard Chartered Hong Kong's

claims pending in Courts, are minded to have the Government and the

Escrow Agent indemnified by IPTL against all present and future claims,

charges, actions, proceedings that may arise against or may be

submitted to the Government consequent upon the release and payment
of the funds in the Tegeta Escrow Account to IPTL.5!"

Having accepted this risk and the mitigation thereof offered by the PAP-controlled IPTL
indemnity, GoT should not now be heard to say that that it has no responsibility, merely by
saying that the monies were paid to IPTL and not PAP. The transfer to PAP’s account was
done with the full knowledge of GoT, TANESCO and the BoT. GoT cannot deny that it knew
that the monies did not reach IPTL, but PAP’s account. To suggest that GoT did not obtain
direct or indirect benefit from the arrangement ignores the fact that GoT had, through this
scheme, extricated itself (or so it believed) from its obligations under the Implementation
Agreement and, at the same time, its national electricity grid managed by TANESCO was then

able to deal with the PAP-controlled IPTL to resolve their claims to its advantage.

(3) Tribunal’s Decision on Expropriation

The Tribunal therefore finds that GoT, through MEM, TANESCO, Utamwa J, the Attorney-
General and BoT, facilitated the improper transfer of control of IPTL to PAP and/or Mr Sethi,
without due regard to the interests of IPTL and SCB HK as successor lender and assignee
pursuant to the Implementation Agreement. Utamwa J most injudiciously decided to “take
judicial notice” of the illicit and fictitious sale of Mechmar Shares in IPTL and recklessly
ordered IPTL and the Power Plant to be handed to PAP. GoT through its agencies, as stated
above, further aided and abetted the improper release of the Escrow Account, disregarding
the legitimate interest of IPTL and SCB HK as successor lender and assignee, by enabling PAP
and Sethi to receive the full release of the monies and assets in the Escrow Account thereby
depriving IPTL and SCB HK of the right to properly exercise their rights of control and
economic benefits of their investment. Such acts are clear acts of expropriation expressly
prohibited, and to which GoT had solemnly promised to abide by under Article 16 of the
Implementation Agreement. The Tribunal therefore find that GoT is in breach of Article 16.2

of the Implementation Agreement.

DISCRIMINATION CLAIM UNDER ARTICLE 16.1 OF THE IMPLEMENTATION AGREEMENT

The basis of the Claimant’s discrimination claim is Article 16.1 of the Implementation

Agreement, which provides as follows:

The GOT shall not take any discriminatory action which materially and
adversely affects the Project or the performance of [IPTL's] obligations
or the enjoyment of its rights or the interests of the Investors under the
Security Package or expropriate or, except as hereinafter provided,
acquire the Facility or [IPTL], whether in whole or in part. Nothing in
the foregoing shall apply to any actions taken by the GOT, TANESCO, or
any Governmental Authority pursuant to their respective rights and
obligations arising under this Agreement, the Power Purchase
Agreement and the other documents comprising the Security
Package.512

The Claimant claims that the Respondent breached Article 16.1 of the Implementation

Agreement in:

512 HB/C/005/192-267: Unsigned copy of Implementation Agreement (including Schedules), 8 June 1995.

126

“favouring PAP and VIP (IPTL's minority shareholder)”, which are “two Tanzanian
entities [...] over Mechmar (IPTL's majority shareholder)” and the Claimant which was
“(IPTL's lender and secured creditor)”;53 and

“favouring IPTL when it wrongly came into Tanzanian hands, while mistreating IPTL

when it was legitimately owned/controlled by foreign entities” .51+

383. The Claimant argues that the Respondent's discriminatory actions materially and adversely

affected the Project and performance of IPTL’s obligations, the enjoyment of IPTL’s rights and

the Investor’s interests under the Security Package. Further, that those actions of the

Respondent led to IPTL’s inability to discharge the PPA Award and IPTL could not

consequently earn and apply income that would otherwise be earned pursuant to the PPA

from September 2013, which in turn could then be applied to reduce its loan outstanding

under the Facility Agreement which, as of August 2018, stood at over USD 187 million.515

384. The Respondent asserts that the Claimant’s claim is devoid of merit. It submits that the

Claimant’s case does not meet the requirements of Article 16.1516 arguing that:

iii.

only IPTL can bring a claim under Article 16.1;

any purported discriminatory action must be between companies with similar
projects;

the discriminatory action must issue from the “Government” and not any other
“Governmental Authority”; 517

a discriminatory intent is required, which is absent in the present case;5!8 and

there was no evidence that any of the alleged acts caused material and adverse effects
on IPTL.

(4) Is SCB HK Entitled to Bring a Discrimination Claim under Article 16.1 of the
Implementation Agreement?

a. Parties’ Submissions

The Respondent maintains that the undertaking against discrimination given under Article
16.1 is addressed to IPTL, and IPTL is, as such, the only party that can benefit from the
protection given. The Respondent argues that this position is confirmed by Article 24.6 of the
Implementation Agreement, which excludes third party beneficiaries, and Article 16.1 is not

among the exceptions stated in the provision.5!9

Article 24.6 of the Implementation Agreement reads:

24.6 No Third Party Beneficiaries

This Agreement shall not confer any right of suit or action whatsoever
on any third party, except for the specific rights granted to the Lenders
pursuant to Articles 15.2, 18.2 and 19.4, 520

The Respondent states that the Claimant cannot rely on the second part of Article 16.1 of the
Implementation Agreement, including the wording “Investors under the Security Package”, as
only IPTL could bring an action and investors cannot bring an action in their own name. Any
other approach would be an excessively wide interpretation of the meaning of discrimination
in this provision. Furthermore, even if investors could bring an action based on this wording,
the Claimant could still not bring an action as it is not an investor or shareholder of IPTL and
does not have standing to bring an action on behalf of IPTL. The Respondent submits that
only IPTL can bring a claim for breaches under Article 16.1 of the Implementation Agreement
related to the Project which are contended for by the Claimant, including the performance of
IPTL's obligations, the enjoyment of IPTL’s rights or the investors interests under the Security

Package.521

b. Tribunal’s Analysis

Consistent with the Tribunal’s finding that the Claimant is the lawful assignee under Article
15.2 of the Implementation Agreement and has title and interest to pursue its claims against

GoT for any breach of the Implementation Agreement in its own name [see paragraph 172

519 Respondent's PHB, para. 132.

520 HB/C/005/192-267 at pg. 250: Unsigned copy of Implementation Agreement (including Schedules), 8 June 1995
(emphasis in original).

521 Respondent's PHB, para. 133.

128

389.

390.

391.

above], the Respondent’s argument that the Claimant cannot claim protection against

discrimination must fail.

The Respondent's argument reads into Article 16.1 of the Implementation Agreement that
any discriminatory action must be directed against IPTL. Article 16.1 of the Implementation
Agreement is not limited in this way. The prohibition concerns actions of the GoT that could
affect or impact “the Project or the performance of [IPTL's] obligations or [...] the interests of
the Investors under the Security Package.” This must therefore mean that persons apart from
IPTL, viz. IPTL’s actual shareholders, lenders and investors under the Security Package whose

interests are materially and adversely affected by GoT’s actions, are included.

In any event, Article 24.6 of the Implementation Agreement itself specifically creates the
exception for “specific rights granted to the Lenders pursuant to Articles 15.2, [...]” which
means that Lenders are not the “third party” intended under it and as such are not prohibited
from exercising their specific security rights created under the Implementation Agreement,
of which Article 16.1 of the Implementation Agreement is one. The Tribunal therefore finds
that the Claimant as assignee and lender, is entitled to seek the benefit of GoT’s undertaking
against discrimination specifically created under Article 16.1 of the Implementation

Agreement.

(2) Does the Discriminatory Action Require a Comparator?
a. Parties’ Submissions

The Respondent’s argument is that to sustain an action for discrimination, a comparison with
an entity discriminated against is necessary and that this approach is confirmed by
contractual interpretation and international law, which provides that such comparison must
be done with other similar projects or categories or companies in “like circumstances.” 522 The
Respondent submits that on a plain analysis of the ordinary meaning of Article 16.1 of the
Implementation Agreement, the discriminatory action intended is not to cover discrimination
that as between shareholders, lenders or investors, but rather between companies with

similar projects or similar circumstances.523

522 Respondent's PHB, para. 134; Respondent's Reply PHB, para. 88; HB/A/003/144-370 at pgs. 291-297: Respondent's
Counter-Memorial; HB/A/005/604-827 at pgs. 767-771: Respondent's Rejoinder.

129

392.

394,

395.

The Respondent says that the Claimant’s theory that the Respondent favoured VIP and PAP
over Mechmar and the Claimant, and favoured IPTL when under PAP’s control compared to
IPTL under Mechmar'’ s control, is not within the scope of the discrimination contemplated in

Article 16.1 of the Implementation Agreement.

Further, the Respondent contends, such discrimination must mean the imposition of
obligations, conditions or standards that are unduly and materially more onerous than those
persons in like circumstances. In support of this, the Respondent refers to (i) the World
Bank’s Model Implementation Agreement which contains a similar clause to Article 16.1 of
the Implementation Agreement; (ii) other implementation agreements; and _ (iii)
international investment case law generally, including LG&E Energy Corp and others v
Argentina,24 wherein the tribunal decided that for a measure to be discriminatory it must be

inter alia “that is not taken under similar circumstances against another national” 525

The Claimant’s position is that there is no such qualification in Article 16.1 of the
Implementation Agreement that the discriminatory action must be directed against IPTL
itself or that it must be between similar projects, and that there is no requirement that
discrimination must relate to IPTL vis-a-vis competitors. It submits that the only qualification
is that the discriminatory action must materially and adversely affect certain matters relating
to IPTL and the Project, which shows that the objective of the provision is to protect IPTL.526
Further, the Claimant argues that the description of “discrimination” in other implementation
agreements or the World Bank’s Model Implementation Agreement is not relevant to the
inquiry of what discrimination means in the Implementation Agreement, as both contain

inclusive, rather than exhaustive descriptions of discriminatory action.

b. Tribunal'’s Analysis

The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that in order for conduct to be considered
discriminatory, there must be a comparator that permits comparison against which the
suspect conduct can be measured. The conduct that is discriminatory is a separate matter

from the consequences of such conduct. Thus, discrimination ordinarily requires that another

Liability, 3 October 2006.

397.

person, in like circumstances, has been given more favourable treatment. If IPTL as a
company was treated less favourably than other companies in like circumstances during that
same period, such would generally constitute discrimination. In LG&E Energy Corp and others
v Argentina,27 a dispute arose out of a bilateral investment treaty between the United States
and Argentina, which provided that "[nJeither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or
discriminatory measures the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition,
expansion, or disposal of investments."528 The claimants in that case had complained that they
“received treatment different from that accorded to similarly situated public utilities, including

electricity and water distribution companies.”529

The Tribunal does not agree with the Claimant’s suggestion that “discrimination” in the
context of this Implementation Agreement, requires only the qualification that the
discriminatory action “materially and adversely affects the Project or the performance of the
Company's obligations or the enjoyment of its rights or the interests of the Investors under the
Security Package”. In other words, according to the Claimant, there need not be a comparative
disadvantage, so long as it could be shown that GoT had taken action which could cause IPTL
(viz. its assigns as we have so found) to suffer “materially and adversely”. This would collapse
the discriminatory conduct and its effects and is not warranted on a reading of the provision.
In the Tribunal’s view, the requirement for “material and adverse” effect is a separate
requirement of liability. The action taken by GoT must first be discriminatory, and only if such
discriminatory action gives rise to material and adverse effect could it sustain a cause for

breach of the undertaking.

As observed earlier, Article 16.1 of the Implementation Agreement extends its application to
all persons who might be affected by actions of GoT in their enjoyment of the rights and
interest in the Project or IPTL or the Security Package. The Tribunal does not therefore accept
the Respondent’s argument that the discrimination under Article 16.1 of the Implementation
Agreement is limited to IPTL alone. In any event, the manner of treatment meted out by GoT

to IPTL when it was under the control of foreign entities (IPTL’s shareholders and the

Claimant) and when it became a PAP-controlled IPTL also needs to be considered.53° The
primary purpose of GoT giving the undertaking against discrimination was to assure the
Investor (including the Lenders) that their interest would not be affected by any
discriminatory action taken by GoT. How GoT treated IPTL before and after the change of
control, are the best signs of whether GoT had complied with its undertaking not to take
discriminatory action which could adversely affect the interests of the Project, the

performance of the Company, the Investor and the Lenders.

(3) Meaning of the Reference to “GOT” in Article 16.1 of the Implementation
Agreement
a. Parties’ Submissions

The Respondent argues that Article 16.1 of the Implementation Agreement contemplates

only acts of the Respondent as it refers to “GOT” and not the actions of any other

“Governmental Authority.”531

The Implementation Agreement at Article 1 provides:

“Governmental Authority" bears the meaning attributable thereto in the
Power Purchase Agreement.

The PPA provides the definition of “Governmental Authority” at Article 1.1 as: 532

“Governmental Authority": Any state, municipal or local government or
regulatory department, body, political subdivision, commission,
instrumentality, agency, ministry, court, judicial or administrative body,
taxing authority or other relevant authority having jurisdiction over
either Party, the Facility.
The Respondent therefore argues that the Claimant’s complaint against the acts of the

Tanzanian Courts and First PL and Second PL cannot be attributed to the GoT.533

The Claimant's response to this is that the definition of “Government of Tanzania” is narrower

than “Governmental Authority” as defined in Article 1.1 of the PPA and the issue is which

530 See paras. 412, 423 and 427 to 429 below.

132

403.

elements of “Governmental Authority” fall within the meaning of “GOT’.53+ It says that the
ordinary meaning of the term “government” would include acts by the judicial, executive and
legislative branches of the Respondent, including acts by the Tanzanian Courts, First PL,
Second PL, other government officials involved in the release of the funds in the Escrow
Account.535 Alternatively, the Claimant submits that even if the words “Government of the
United Republic of Tanzania” do not include the judicial branch, they should at the minimum
cover the executive branch of the national government and this is clear from the references
in the Implementation Agreement to the “GOT” such as Article XI536 (granting immigration
approvals), Article XII537 (controlling and directing security forces), Article 18.4538
(confirming the grant of tax exemptions) and Article 24.7539 (waiving sovereign immunity).
The Claimant submits that this is relevant as the key discriminatory actions were carried out

by executive authorities.54°

b. Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal has little hesitation in disagreeing with the position taken on behalf of the
Respondent. The term “Government” is not specifically defined in the Implementation
Agreement, and it is generally understood that the term is the embodiment of the entire
administration of a State and has generally the authority to act on behalf of the State and not
limited to constitutional arms of government, viz. the legislature, the executive and the
judiciary (see discussion earlier in paragraphs 280 to 281). The Implementation Agreement
was in fact signed by the GoT “acting through its Ministry of Water, Energy and Minerals”. It
was then signed on its behalf by the Principal Secretary of the “Ministry of Water, Energy and
Minerals”. By using the term “Governmental Authority” and ascribing to it the specific meaning
given to it in the PPA, the Government has expressly intended to act through the
Governmental Authority so defined, which include the actions of the Office of the
Administrator General and Official Receiver, “court”, and “judicial” arms of the Government.

Their actions or inactions must be attributable to the GoT.

(4) Intention to Discriminate
a. Parties’ Submissions

404. The Respondent has also suggested that for GoT’s actions to be considered discriminatory, it
must be shown to have been done with such intent. It referred to the LG&E Energy Corp and
Others v ArgentinaS*! where the tribunal stated at paragraph 146: 542
[I]n order to establish when a measure is discriminatory, there must be
(@ an_intentional treatment (ii) in favor of a national (iii) against a

foreign investor, and (iv) that is not taken under similar circumstances
against another national.

405. The Claimant, on the other hand, submits that Article 16.1 of the Implementation Agreement
does not require subjective intent to discriminate. It only requires that the action be
discriminatory. It points out that the element of intent was held by some other tribunals as
not to be essential.5*3 As to the Respondent's reliance on LG&E Energy Corp and others v
Argentina, the Claimant points out that the tribunal there had preceded the portion quoted
by the Respondent, at paragraph 146, by stating that discriminatory effect may also

constitute a discriminatory measure viz.:

146. In the context of investment treaties, and the obligation thereunder
not to discriminate against foreign investors, a measure is considered
discriminatory if the intent of the measure is to discriminate or if the
measure has a discriminatory effect.54*

406. The Claimant nevertheless asserts that GoT’s actions were in fact intentional as it knew that
the Claimant was a secured lender and that the Escrow Account should have been used to pay

the PPA Award and reduce IPTL’s debt, but wrongfully preferred PAP and VIP’s interests.545

b. Tribunal’s Analysis

There appears weak support from other tribunals for the proposition that intention to
disfavour or discriminate is an essential element to establish less favourable treatment or
discrimination. The tribunal in LG&E Energy Corp and others v Argentina, as correctly pointed
out by the Claimant, did not take the position that intention is an essential element to
discriminate. Other cases, suggest that “intent is not necessarily decisive’5*6 and in one case,
the absence of intention to disfavour a party but “to favor newcomers and preserve [their]
jobs[...], the result is still [...] a violation [...] [if] the effect [...] was a discriminatory and
unreasonable measure ”.547 In another case, an act done not “with the intent of discriminating
against” another is discriminatory so long the party seeking such redress has “received less

favourable treatment” than that accorded to another.548

The Tribunal takes the view that Article 16.1 of the Implementation Agreement does not
support a requirement of intent; what is addressed is the discriminatory action and its
consequences. Intent is a distinct element and one that is burdensome to prove and should

not be readily implied since it would reduce the scope of protection without explicit mention.

The question of whether it is a breach of the Respondent’s undertaking requires a
consideration of the impact each of the alleged discriminatory actions. This requires a factual
inquiry of the four specific complaints raised by the Claimant which it says are discriminatory
actions by applying the aforesaid tests. The Tribunal will consider each of these complaints
and see if any of these are discriminatory actions, and, if so, consider whether they “materially
and adversely affects the Project or the performance of the Company's obligations or the

enjoyment of its rights or the interests of the Investors under the Security Package.”

(5) The Factual Basis of the Discrimination Claim: Alleged Discriminatory Actions

The Claimant alleges four categories of discriminatory actions. The facts of each of them have
been narrated in the earlier discussion on the Claimant's claim for expropriation. The

Tribunal will in this section make brief reference to the same for the purpose of considering

this issue of whether they amount to discriminatory actions and if so, the material impact on

the Project, IPTL and the Claimant.

a. The Respondent Frustrated the Pursuit by IPTL of the Interpretation
Proceedings**°

(i) Parties’ Submissions

The Claimant alleges that Oriyo J and the First PL discriminated against the Claimant and
Mechmar in favour of VIP (which is a Tanzanian entity) by taking steps which frustrated the
continuation of the Interpretation Proceedings. More specifically, this relates to Oriyo J's
decision of 16 December 2008 to dismiss IPTL’s stay application as being “f...] redundant”

and stated that “[i]t has become obsolete; it does not serve any useful purpose.” 55°

The Claimant says that the Interpretation Proceedings were supported by Mechmar but
opposed by VIP. By the order refusing the stay application and appointing the First PL, Oriyo
J discriminated against Mechmar as she vested the power over IPTL to the First PL, who acted
in accordance with VIP’s wishes and declined to continue the Interpretation Proceedings.
According to the Claimant, the inability to continue the Interpretation Proceedings materially
and adversely affected IPTL's enjoyment of its rights under the PPA as they prevented the
Tariff Dispute from being resolved, which consequently prevented payments to be made

under the PPA and thus preventing IPTL's debts from being reduced.55!

The Respondent however argues that the First PL acted in his capacity as provisional
liquidator of the company and as such his actions cannot be attributed to the Respondent.
Furthermore, the withdrawal of the Interpretation Proceedings was initiated by Mechmar.
The Respondent adds that the Interpretation Proceedings were not “easy straightforward”
proceedings and would not have “quickly resolved” the Tariff Dispute and as such no material
and adverse effect could be derived from the discontinuation of the Interpretation
Proceedings. In its view, the First PL had taken a rational decision by balancing the cost of the

proceedings and the risks of an unsuccessful outcome.%52

(ii) Tribunal’s Analysis
414. The Tribunal recalls its discussion on Oriyo J’s decision [see paragraphs 299 to 303 above]
and its observations that the judge’s decision was unclear as to what had convinced her that
the stay application could serve no useful purpose, and she could have on a date fixed for the
hearing of an application for a stay of those proceedings; instead, she proceeded to make a
substantive order appointing a provisional liquidator, relying on affidavits filed by VIP some
five years earlier, and to hold that an immediate appointment would be necessary and in the
public interest without calling upon the parties involved to be heard substantively. Oriyo J

tried to justify her reliance on those affidavits by saying that -

For reasons not on record it is apparent that the first and second
respondents did not file any counter affidavits to oppose the petition for
winding up IPTL. [...]

As stated earlier, the 1% and 24 respondents do not have much by way
of affidavits in reply/opposition; so their written submissions are
limited to points of law. Otherwise they are mere statements from the
bar. Since the respondents have not countered the affidavits in the
petition by the applicant; those averments stand uncontroverted and
are accordingly adopted by the court.553

415. On the merits of the application, Oriyo J also appeared to have taken the view that fraud had

been committed by Mechmar and continuing viz. -

On the degree of urgency; its relevancy here cannot be overstated
because the oppressive acts, fraud, etc of Mechmar against VIP has been
in a continuous process since 2001; that is, for a period of over seven
years. [...]

The need for the appointment of a Provisional Liquidator pending
winding up has in no doubt been adequately established by VIP through
the affidavits of James Burchard Rugemalira filed on 25.2.2002 and
24.9.2003. And on the basis of the said affidavits, both VIP and IPTL (the
company) stand to suffer irretrievably if a Provisional Liquidator is not
appointed. But for Mechmar; if the appointment of a Provisional
Liquidator is not immediately made; it does not stand to suffer or lose
anything except prolong the period of corporate waste, diversion of
funds, conversion of ass[e]ts, fraud, deadlock etc.55+

421.

Even more unintelligible was Oriyo J’s observation that the appointment of a provisional
liquidator would serve the interests of some others including TANESCO viz. -

On the issue of public interest considerations; it calls for urgent action

towards appointment of a Provisional Liquidator. It is intended to serve

interests of groups like those doing business with IPTL including
TANESCO and the government of Tanzania.555

Bearing in mind that IPTL’s application for a stay of the petition was to enable IPTL to proceed
in the Interpretation Proceedings in an attempt to seek further compensation from TANESCO

under the PPA, Oriyo J’s reasoning is indeed difficult to comprehend.

Taking a generous view of the thinking behind Oriyo J’s decision, the Tribunal would say that
the decision of 16 December 2008 is both puzzling and inexplicable. Her actions suggested

that she was distracted by other unexplained considerations.

The immediate consequence of Oriyo J’s decision was that the Interpretation Proceedings did
not proceed on the day it was set for hearing. The First PL decided not to proceed further
despite SCB HK’s repeated offers to undertake to bear the costs incurred in doing so and only

to seek recovery from IPTL in the event a favourable decision be made in IPTL’s favour.55¢

As for the complaint made against the First PL’s decision not to proceed with the
Interpretation Proceedings, the Tribunal finds it curious that the First PL did not respond to
the Claimant’s offer to fund the Interpretation Proceedings. To the extent that there is a
possibility (whatever may be the probability) of recovery of more compensation for IPTL,
and its creditors from TANESCO, it would appear that the First PL should have considered the

offer.

The Tribunal notes, however, that it could not be said that if the Interpretation Proceedings
had proceeded, the outcome would have been a favourable one for IPTL. There is every
possibility that the PPA Tribunal might have made an interpretative ruling in favour of IPTL,
or for TANESCO or made “no order”. In other words, there is nothing before this Tribunal to
enable it to foresee the likely outcome of the Interpretation Proceedings. There is no evidence

to support any suggestion that the Claimant or Mechmar or IPTL had suffered any loss or had

been “materially and adversely affected”. With this burden undischarged by the Claimant, the
Tribunal cannot find that consequences of the actions complained of were detrimental within

the meaning of Article 16.1 of the Implementation Agreement.

b. The Respondent Procured the Power Plant to be Operated by the First PL
under the Interim PPA

(i) Parties’ Submissions

The Claimant alleges that the First PL had through various actions favoured VIP over the
Claimant and Mechmar. These actions include resuming operations of the power plant under
the Interim PPA in July 2009 under the directions of the Respondent, as well as entering the
Interim PPA, which covered only running costs and prejudiced IPTL’s ability to maintain the
Facility at its highest standards, and prevented IPTL from having means to provide a return
to Mechmar (which was the majority shareholder) and repay the debt owed to the

Claimant.557

The Claimant argues that these actions materially and adversely affected the ownership,
operation of the Power Plant, and therefore the Project, IPTL’s enjoyment of its rights to full
payment under the PPA, and the Claimant’s and Mechmar’s interests under the Security

Package.558

The Respondent’s response is that the emergency measures to restore operations in the
Facility taken by the First PL were within his authority and were made in order to preserve
IPTL’s assets, and that none of the measures operated in favour of VIP but rather were taken

solely in the interest of IPTL.55°

(ii) Tribunal’s Analysis
The Tribunal sees little basis for the Claimant’s complaint. Entering into an arrangement to
operate the plant to generate power for TANESCO could not of itself be favouring any party.
IPTL was under an obligation to operate the Plant to generate power. Even without the
imposition of the First PL, and even when the parties were in disagreement over how the
tariffs and expenses had to be calculated, IPTL, whether under the control of the original

shareholders or the Claimant, would have the duty to operate it, whether to generate positive

revenue or mitigate losses. In any case, VIP as a shareholder of IPTL stands in the same
position as Mechmar and would suffer the same detriment had the arrangement by the First

PL increased liability for IPTL.

The Tribunal therefore finds that the actions of the First PL in this regard are not
discriminatory and no breach of the undertaking under Article 16.1 of Implementation

Agreement could arise.

c Transfers of IPTL and the Power Plant, and Payment Out of the Escrow
Account
The factual narration relating to this issue is set out in the Tribunal’s discussion on

“Expropriation” in paragraphs 324 to 373 above.

(i) Parties’ Submissions

The Claimant argues that the Second PL, Utamwa J, BRELA, the Minister for Energy and
Minerals, and the PS MEM acted in favour of VIP and PAP, disregarding the interests of the
Claimant in IPTL through its ownership of the Mechmar shares. The discriminatory actions
included: (i) the Second PL’s recognition of the purported sale of Mechmar’s shares and
planned sale of VIP’s shares to PAP by countersigning the VIP-PAP-SPA and supporting VIP’s
application for PAP to take over IPTL’s affairs; (ii) Utamwa J’s refusal to hear the Claimant's
submissions or the Share Receiver, and instead taking “judicial notice” of the purported sale
of Mechmar’s shares in IPTL and handing over affairs to PAP despite the knowledge of the
Claimant’s rights; (iii) BRELA’s registration of the transfer of shares to PAP despite having
seen documents that put PAP’s ownership of Mechmar’s shares in doubt; and (iv) the
Permanent Secretary Maswi's signing of the agreement to release the Escrow funds despite
being aware of the Claimant’s rights and that PAP could not have purchased Mechmar’s

shares.560

The Claimant asserts that these actions materially and adversely affected the ownership and
operation of the Power Plant, and therefore the Project; IPTL’s enjoyment of its rights to full
payment under the PPA; and the Claimant’s and Mechmar’s interests under the Security

Package.5®!

433.

In relation to the actions of the Second PL, the Respondent says that the Administrator
General and Official Receiver’s office when acting in his capacity as liquidator (provisional or
otherwise) or receiver was acting as an agent of the company in or pending liquidation. He
was therefore not acting as a government official and therefore his actions could not be
attributable to the Respondent.5® As the provisional liquidator, he had the right to hold
doubts over the Claimant’s standing, especially when viewed in the light of the PwC Report,
which referred to the Claimant as an “unsecured creditor’.5®3 In any case, as provisional
liquidator, the Second PL’s actions were subject to the High Court’s scrutiny and the Claimant

failed to adequately challenge them.5¢+

As regards Utamwa J's Order of 5 September 2013, directing that the affairs of IPTL be vested
on PAP, the Respondent relies on the principle of separation of powers set out in Articles
107A and 107B of the Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania,5*5 that executive
officials could not take account of documents submitted by private parties (such as the
Claimant) conflicting with the findings of a court (Utamwa J Order) and were bound to follow
the Utamwa J Order.5¢ In other words, GoT was merely complying with the orders given by

the court and could do little more.

As to the subsequent release of the Escrow Account, the Respondent says that this was a
consequence of the agreement between TANESCO and IPTL to end the Tariff Dispute and
their agreement acknowledged that the proceeds in the Escrow Account would be released
to enable it to pay off its legitimate creditors. The Respondent relies heavily on the Utamwa J

Order.

The Respondent also submits that it released the proceeds of the Escrow Account upon IPTL’s
instructions5® to IPTL and not to IPTL’s creditors, and the fact that IPTL indicated different
bank accounts for the money to be released to does not change the fact that payment was

made to IPTL.568

(ii) Tribunal’s Analysis

434. The Tribunal accepts the Respondent's argument that the Administrator General and Official
Receiver’s office when acting in his capacity as liquidator (provisional or otherwise) or
receiver was acting as an agent of the company. However, this does not negate the fact that
the Administrator General and Official Receiver’s office remain a Governmental Authority
within the definition given in the Implementation Agreement read with the PPA. It has the
public duty to act fairly and abide by the obligations required under the Implementation
Agreement not to discriminate against IPTL and its lawful shareholders when discharging its
responsibility as Second PL. The Second PL had in his Compromise Agreement dated 20
August 20135° agreed to pay some USD 14.6 million to “uncontested creditors” including fees
of ASYLA ATTORNEYS for USD 500,000 being the legal services “supplied to [...] PAP” in
relation to the “Agreement for the Sale and Purchase of VIP Shares in IPTL dated 15th August
2013 between VIP and PAP” .570

435. As regards the role of BRELA in registering the transfer of shares in favour of PAP despite
knowledge of the possible discrepancy in the chain of transfer, the Tribunal accepts that
BRELA was merely complying with the Utamwa J Order and its acts were purely
administrative and could not of themselves be considered as discriminating against the

Claimant, Mechmar or IPTL.

436. As for the Utamwa J Order, the Tribunal is conscious that its role is not that of an appellate
body to review Utamwa J's decision. It has no jurisdiction to do so and is not doing so. The
Tribunal is nevertheless bound to consider whether Utamwa J acted judiciously, and not
capriciously in the discharge of his functions. As observed in paragraphs 347 to 352 above,
Utamwa J had acted without regard to the interest of Mechmar and the Claimant in IPTL,
made no inquiry as to whether PAP’s purported transfer was a genuine transaction and
blessed it with “judicial notice” and directed that IPTL and the Power Plant be handed over to
PAP’s control. The court attendance extracts show that these were made in the absence of

SCB HK’s counsel.5?! Counsel representing the Malaysian liquidators of Mechmar (in

liquidation) (the majority shareholders of IPTL) who objected was also not heard after the

court ruled that he had no locus standi.572

437. The Utamwa J Order deprived the Claimant as lender, secured creditor and shareholders of
IPTL (through its control of Mechmar) of its assets. The Order was then relied upon by MEM,
who wished to get out of its obligations in the Project; by the Attorney General who advised
the this provided a “golden opportunity’573 for GoT to extricate itself from its involvement in
the Project; by TANESCO to settle its claims with the PAP-Controlled IPTL and enable BoT to
release payment out of the Escrow Account. The cumulative force of Utamwa J’s Order, the
MEM action, the Attorney General’s advice, TANESCO’s settlement agreement with PAP and
BoT’s cooperation clearly discriminated against IPTL, Mechmar and the Claimant in favour of
PAP. IPTL, Mechmar and the Claimant were materially and adversely affected in their
“performance of the Company's obligations or the enjoyment of its rights or the interests of the
Investors under the Security Package” and GoT is accordingly in breach of its obligation not to

discriminate under Article 16.1 of the Implementation Agreement.

438. The Respondent has argued that the Claimant could have appealed and sought recourse
against Utamwa J Order as it was aware of the course of action to take as it did so in relation
to the challenging the winding-up order of IPTL in 2012.5” To this the Tribunal needs to
firstly point out that as the Claimant (SCB HK) was not a party to that action, it could not be
in any position to appeal against the order. The Tribunal notes that following the Utamwa J
Order the Claimant did by itself and through IPTL’s receivers (and later its liquidators)
attempt to intervene by taking the following steps:

i. The Administrative Receiver of IPTL filed a plaint against IPTL before the High Court
(Commercial Division) at Dar Es Salaam on 11 September 2013 in Original
Commercial Case No. 124 of 2013 seeking inter alia a “perpetual injunction order
restraining the Defendant [IPTL] [...] from preventing the Plaintiff [Administrative
Receiver] from entering the Plant and exercising the lawful right to take possession and
control of IPTL and its assets; [...]”.575

ii. On 11 September 2013, the Administrative Receiver of IPTL filed for an ex parte
interim injunction to restrain IPTL from “committing breach of contract by preventing
the Applicant [Administrative Receiver] from taking possession of the power plant’,
pending determination of the permanent injunction application on an inter partes
basis.576

iii. On 12 September 2013, the Claimant’s application for a Revision from the
Proceedings, Ruling and Orders of Utamwa J’s earlier order of 24 April 2013, came up
for hearing before the Court of Appeal. SCB HK attempted to bring to the court’s
attention Utamwa J’s order of 5 September 2013 transferring the affairs of IPTL to
Pan Africa Power Solutions (T) Limited. The Court of Appeal declined to consider the
matter adding that:

[The] Court cannot on the basis of the Notice of Motion journey
into what the applicant anticipates from subsequent decisions
of the High Court [...] At any rate, we were not availed with any

copy of the proceedings to see for ourselves what Utamwa, J.
ordered in September, 2013.577

iv. On 6 September 2013, the Administrative Receiver of IPTL (Ms Martha Renju) filed a
plaint against PAP, VIP and BoT before the High Court (Commercial Division) at Dar
Es Salaam in Commercial Case No. 123 of 2013 seeking “inter alia a perpetual
injunction order restraining the Defendants or any person under or acting pursuant to
the Defendants order, control, or instructions whether as employee, agent or trustee
from taking possession of, releasing, transferring or dealing with all or any of the
proceeds of the Escrow Account [...]”.578

v. On 6 September 2013, the Administrative Receiver of IPTL also filed a plaint against
PAP, VIP and BoT before the High Court (Commercial Division) at Dar Es Salaam in
Misc. Commercial Case No. 98 of 2013 (originating from Civil Case No. 123 of 2013)

seeking inter alia an interim injunction to maintain ‘status quo’ and restrain VIP and

PAP or any other person from taking possession or exercising control on the proceeds

in the Escrow Account until the “hearing and final determination of the main suit”.579
vi. On 4 November 2013, the liquidators of Mechmar applied to the Court of Appeal to

quash Utamwa J's order of 5 September 2013.58 This application was filed before the

 

funds in the Escrow Account were transferred out. The appeal remains unheard.

The Tribunal notes that it is quite evident from these steps that the Claimant and Mechmar

had made several attempts to seek recourse against the Utamwa J Order but to little avail.

The Respondent has also submitted that there could never be any discrimination by its
decision to release the funds in the Escrow Account to IPTL as the funds were paid to IPTL
and as IPTL had directed it.5*! Such an argument ignores the reality that the control of IPTL
was wrested from Mechmar and the Claimant pursuant to the purported Agreement for the
Sale of Shares made between Piper Link and PAP dated 21 October 201058 when the
Mechmar Shares in IPTL had already been surrendered by Mechmar and deposited with the
BVI Court and subsequently released to SCB HK, making such a sale impossible. The release
of the funds to PAP-controlled IPTL is clearly not a release of funds to IPTL. This argument is

artificial and contrived.

(6) Tribunal’s Decision on Discrimination

By giving credence to the transaction and relying solely on the Utamwa J Order, GoT, through
MEM, TANESCO, the Attorney-General and BoT, acted in a manner that consciously ignored
the interest of the Claimant and IPTL in favour of PAP, aiding and abetting the release of the
funds in the Escrow Account to PAP. In the Tribunal’s view, these are discriminatory actions
which materially and adversely affected the enjoyment of the rights and interests of SCB HK

and IPTL and were thereby in breach of Article 16.1 of the Implementation Agreement.

CLAIM UNDER ARTICLE 15.3 OF THE IMPLEMENTATION AGREEMENT: FAILURE TO PROVIDE
SECURITY

(4) Parties’ Submissions

The Claimant argues that the Respondent is in breach of Article 15.3 of the Implementation
Agreement which provides that:

In the event TANESCO fails to provide the security for payment required

by Article 6.6 of the Power Purchase Agreement, the GOT shall within 10

Days after receipt of a notice from the Company to GOT, that states that

TANESCO have [sic] failed to provide the security for payment required

by Article 6.6 of the Power Purchase Agreement, provide directly to the

Company [IPTL] the security for payment on the same terms and

conditions as required under the Power Purchase Agreementy...].
The Claimant submits that Article 6.6 of the PPA requires TANESCO to provide security, either
in the form ofa letter of credit or funds paid into an Escrow Account, equal to an aggregate of
two months of capacity payments and energy payments, and in the event the security was
drawn, TANESCO was required to reinstate the full required amount within 30 days. Further,
that Article 15.3 of the Implementation Agreement requires the Respondent to provide this

security if TANESCO fails to do so.583

The Claimant submits that on 5 February 2014, the Claimant wrote to the Respondent
referring to Article 15.3 and stating that following the dissipation of the monies that were in
the Escrow Account with Bank of Tanzania, TANESCO has failed to provide security for its
payment obligations as required by Article 6.6 of the PPA and demanding that the
Respondent provide such security within 10 days from receipt of the notice.5#+ The Claimant
contends that the Respondent failed to provide such security and so it breached Article 15.3

of the Implementation Agreement.585

The Respondent's pleaded case is that it is unclear whether the alleged breach of Article 15.3
of the Implementation Agreement arises from TANESCO or the Government not having
established the security referred to in Article 6.6 of the PPA in the form ofa letter of credit or
Escrow Account for the “required amount” under that Agreement (i.e. two months of capacity

payments and energy payments) or whether the breach of Article 15.3 is caused by the

584 HB/A/002/035-143: Claimant’s Memorial, paras. 206-207.

448.

Government not having reinstated the amount formerly held in the Escrow Account after its
contents were paid to IPTL in 2013.58 Furthermore, the Respondent states that funds were
withdrawn from the Escrow under Article 6.8 of the PPA in relation to the Tariff Dispute and
not Article 6.6 of the PPA. It submits that consequently there is no obligation to reinstate any

money into the Escrow, as they were only there due to the Tariff Dispute.58”

Finally, the Respondent submits that in any event, even if the Claimant is correct, it would
only be entitled to a declaratory judgment as it suffered no loss for the alleged violation of
Article 15.3 of the Implementation Agreement. Alternatively, the Claimant would be entitled

the equivalent to the security required to be as per Article 6.6 of the PPA. 588

(2) Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal notes that the Parties did not in their Post-Hearing Briefs address this claim in
any detail. The Claimant only mentioned it as part of its prayer for relief that a declaration be
made on GoT’s breach of Article 15.3589 and the Respondent criticises it as being “brought by

SCB HK with the sole intent of unduly multiplying its chances of recovery.”5°

It is clear to the Tribunal that this claim was made on the basis that the dissipation of the
monies formerly held in escrow by the BoT meant that there was no security in place for
TANESCO’s payment obligations required by Article 6.6 of the PPA. Relying on that, the
Claimant then made a demand on 3 December 2013 and 5 February 20145°! that the security
be replenished as a remedy to prevent an Event of Default under Article 19.1(b) (vii) of the
Implementation Agreement. Based on the Tribunal’s findings that the dissipation of the
Escrow Account was an act of expropriation as well as the consequence of the discriminatory
action by GoT, the Claimant’s demand for its remedy is justified. The Tribunal therefore finds

that Article 15.3 of the Implementation Agreement was breached by the Respondent.

TERMINATION

The Claimant asserts that the Respondent's actions amount to “GOT Event/s] of Default” as set
out in Article 19.1(b) of the Implementation Agreement, which entitle the Claimant as an
assignee of IPTL to terminate the Implementation Agreement.5% It argues that pursuant to
Article 20.1(b), if IPTL elects to terminate the Implementation Agreement due to a “GOT Event
of Default”, it may elect to transfer the Facility to the Respondent, and the Respondent must
pay compensation calculated in accordance with the formula in Row 2 of Schedule 2 of the

Implementation Agreement.593

The Claimant states in its Memorial that by the time of filing its Memorial, it had notified the
Respondent of seven Events of Default committed by GoT many of which gave it the right to
terminate the Implementation Agreement, which right it had expressly reserved and that it
intended to terminate the Implementation Agreement by the time of the hearing which was
scheduled to be heard in April 2018.5 It also states in its Memorial, that there were two
other GoT Events of Default that entitled it to terminate the Implementation Agreement, but
it had not at the time of filing the Memorial notified the Respondent regarding the same.
During the Hearing, the Claimant stated that it had terminated the Implementation
Agreement through a (“Termination Notice”) dated 6 July 2018,5°5 following the expiration

of the time for remedy.

The Termination Notice, which was presented to the Tribunal during the Hearing,
summarised the notice process followed for each of the eight Events of Default that formed
the basis of the termination.5°° The Claimant says that if it succeeds on any one of the Events

of Default it has relied upon it will be entitled to terminate the Implementation Agreement.5°”

The Respondent's case is that: (i) first, the Claimant is not a party to the Implementation
Agreement or a valid assignee of IPTL, so its intention to terminate the Implementation

Agreement does not carry any material substance;5% (ii) second, its acts do not constitute

“GOT Event[s] of Default” under the Implementation Agreement; 5° (iii) third, that the
Claimant has not met the necessary steps required to terminate the Implementation
Agreement including the notice provisions;®°° and (iv) fourth, even in case the Tribunal
decides that the Claimant has satisfied the necessary notice requirements, the Claimant
cannot claim compensation upon termination without satisfying the pre-condition of
transferring the Facility to the Respondent, as compensation is calculated as being the

consideration for the acquisition of the Facility by the Respondent.6%!

(4) GoT Events of Default and Notice Requirements
a. Parties’ Submissions

In its claim for termination under the Implementation Agreement, the Claimant relies on
Article XIX and XX of the IMA, specifically Articles 19.1(b), 19.2 and 20.1(b), which are

reproduced below: 62

19.1 Termination for Default [...]
(b) Termination by the Company

Each of the following events shall be an event of default by the GOT
(each a "GOT Event of Default"), which, if not cured within the time
period permitted (if any) to cure shall give rise to the right on the part
of the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article 19.2;
provided, however, that no such event shall be an Event of Default by the
GOT (aa) if it results from a breach by the Company of the Power
Agreement or this Agreement or; (bb) if it occurs as a result of a Force
Majeure Event during the period provided pursuant to Article 17.4:

(i) The expropriation, compulsory acquisition, or nationalization by the
GOT or any Governmental Authority of (i) any Ordinary Share Capital,
or (ii) any material asset or right of the Company (except as
contemplated by the Security Package);

[ul

(vi) Any material breach by the GOT of this Agreement that is not
remedied within ninety (90) Days after notice from the Company to the
GOT stating that a material breach of the Agreement has occurred that

could result in the termination of this Agreement, identifying the
material breach in reasonable detail, and demanding remedy thereof;

(vii) Any material breach by TANESCO of the Power Purchase
Agreement including but not limited to the failure by TANESCO to
provide the security for payment required by Article 6.6 of the Power
Purchase Agreement, that is not remedied within thirty (30) Days after
the receipt of a notice from the Company to TANESCO that states that a
material breach of the applicable. agreement has occurred that could
result in the termination of that agreement, identifies the breach in
reasonable detail, and demands remedy thereof or the failure of the GOT
to provide the security for payment required under Article 15.3 [...].

19.2 Termination Notices

(a) Upon the occurrence of a GOT Event of Default or a Company Event
of Default, as the case may be, that is not cured within the applicable
period (if any) for cure, the non-defaulting Party may, at its option,
initiate termination of this Agreement by delivering a notice (a "Notice
of Intent to Terminate”) of its intent to terminate this Agreement to the
defaulting Party: The Notice of Intent to Terminate shall specify in
reasonable detail the Company Event of Default or the GOT Event of
Default, as the case may be, giving rise to such notice.

(b) Following the delivery of a Notice of Intent to Terminate, the Parties
shall consult for a period of up to thirty (30) Days in case of a failure by
either Party to make payments when due, and upto sixty (60) Days with
respect to any other Event of Default (or such longer period as the
Parties may mutually agree), as to what steps shall be taken with a view
to mitigating the consequences of the relevant Event of Default taking
into account all the circumstances. During the period following the
delivery of the Notice of the Intent to Terminate, the Party in default
may continue to undertake efforts to cure the default, and if the default
is cured at any time prior to the delivery of a Termination Notice in
accordance with Article 19.2(c), then the non-defaulting Party shall
have no right to terminate this Agreement in respect of such cured
default.

(c) Upon expiration of the consultation period described in Article
19.2(b) and unless the Parties shall have otherwise agreed or unless the
Event of Default giving rise to the Notice of Intent to Terminate shall
have been remedied, the Party having given the Notice of Intent to
Terminate may terminate this Agreement by delivering a Termination
Notice to the other Party, whereupon this Agreement shall immediately
terminate and Article XX shall apply.

20.1 Compensation Upon Termination [...]

b) GOT Event of Default

In the event the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Article
19.1(b) as a result of GOT Event of Default, the Company may elect to
transfer the Facility to the GOT or its designee and, upon such transfer,
the GOT or its designee shall pay the Company the compensation
amount set forth in Row 2 of Schedule 2. [...]”

The Respondent in its Counter-Memorial contends that at the time of the filing of its Counter-
Memorial, the Claimant had not met the notice requirements; had not yet terminated the
Implementation Agreement; and did not have the right to do so, and as such Article 20.1 and

Schedule 2 of the Implementation Agreement could not be triggered.

The Respondent also contends that the different steps required in Article 19.2 of the
Implementation Agreement show that there has to be a “sufficient connection in content and
time” between the Notice of Intent to Terminate and the Termination Notice in order to
terminate the Implementation Agreement. It refers to decisions in Architectural Installation
Services Ltd v James Gibbons Windows Ltd and Mvita Construction Co Ltd v Tanzania Harbours
Authority®* to support its proposition that in contracts of this nature with complex notice
requirements, “the validity of those notices depends on the precise observance of the specified
conditions” and that there “has to be a necessary sufficient connection between the various

notices for them to be valid.” 65

The Respondent submits that due to the fact that many of the Claimant's Notices of Intent to
Terminate®® were issued more than four years from April 2018, they lack sufficient
connection with the Termination Notice that the Claimant intended to issue at the time of the
Hearing and the Notices of Intention to Terminate did not convey certainty of intent to

terminate.”

457. The Claimant summarised the various steps leading to its Termination Notice®® as follows:

 

Event A:°9 e On 3 December 2013, the Claimant served a notice on
the Respondent notifying it that the expropriation of

Expropriation of the the Facility and Mechmar's shareholding in IPTL

Facility and of IPTL's amounted to a GoT Event of Default.610

shares by Governmental

Authorities .

On 5 February 2014, the Claimant served a notice on
(Article19.1(b)(i)) GoT notifying it that the 60-day consultation and
remedy period had elapsed without the Respondent
remedying the Event of Default and that the Claimant
reserved its right to terminate the Implementation
Agreement without further consultation.6!1

As there is no cure period under Article 19.1(b)(i), the
Claimant immediately issued Notice of Intention to
Terminate under Article 19.2(a) of the Implementation
Agreement, triggering a 60-day consolation and
remedy period and reserved its right to terminate the
Implementation Agreement should the Respondent not
remedy its default within the 60 days.

The Claimant in its Termination Notice gave notice of
the exercise of its termination right pursuant to Article
19.2(c) based on this GoT Event of Default.612

 

Event B: e On 3 December 2013, the Claimant notified the

Respondent of the Event of Default that TANESCO had
Material breach of the PPA failed, despite the Claimant's demands, to pay
by TANESCO in failing to undisputed sums under the PPA, and of its failure to
pay undisputed sums remedy the breach within 30 days of being notified. It
(Article 19.1(b)(vii)) also triggered a 60-day consolation period to remedy

the Default pursuant to Article 16.2(b) of the
Implementation Agreement.®13

On 5 February 2014, the Claimant noted that the
Respondent had failed to remedy its Event of Default
and gave notice of Intent to Terminate under Article

458. The Respondent categorises all of the Claimant's alleged “GOT Event[s] of Default” into 3
categories as, according to it, they are based on the same underlying facts viz.: (i) first, “alleged
expropriation of the Facility and of IPTL’s assets” which include Events A, C, E and F listed
above; (ii) second, alleged “failure of GoT to provide security for TANESCO’s payment
obligations” which include Events D and G; and (iii) third, alleged “material breach of the PPA
by TANESCO by failing to pay undisputed sums” which is Event B (and the Respondent submits
that Event H falls in this category).

459. Inrelation to the first category, the Respondent submits that there has been no expropriation,
compulsory acquisition or nationalisation by the Respondent or any Governmental Authority
of the Facility or IPTL’s shares and that the dissipation of the Escrow Funds was nota material
breach of the Implementation Agreement as the account was established under Articles 6.6
and 6.8(b) of the PPA to deposit disputed sums in relation to the Tariff Dispute with IPTL and

the money was released once the dispute was settled in October 2013.64!

460. In relation to the second category, the Respondent argues that the Claimant confuses the
scope of Articles 6.6 and 6.8 of the PPA as the Claimant alleges a violation of Article 15.3 of
the Implementation Agreement by failing to provide security for TANESCO’s payment

obligations as per Article 6.6, whereas the monies in the Escrow Account were deposited
pursuant to the Tariff Dispute and thus fell under Article 6.8(b) of the PPA. Further it submits
that IPTL did not need to withdraw monies from the Escrow Account because TANESCO had
paid Tariff since October 2013.62

Regarding the third category and related Event H, the Respondent argues that this cannot be
an Event of Default as TANESCO’s failure to make payments under the PPA was justified on
the ground that IPTL had breached the PPA and the Implementation Agreement.°*3 Again, the
Claimant’s response is that the PPA Award had determined that TANESCO owed USD 148.4

million as at 30 September 2015 along with interest.6#

The Respondent also argues that the compensation payable under Schedule 2 would be
invalid for some GoT Events of Default, as it would constitute a penalty clause and not a
genuine pre-estimate of the damages of the breach for damages of the Implementation
Agreement. The Claimant maintains that Schedule 2 is not a liquidated damages clause, but a
formula calculated to provide compensation when the Implementation Agreement is

terminated, and the elements are appropriate pre-estimate of loss.°#5

b. Tribunal’s Analysis

In the Tribunal’s view, to entitle the Claimant (as assignee of IPTL) to terminate the
Implementation Agreement, the Claimant needs only to show that an Event of Default had
occurred. As the GoT had committed clear and direct acts of expropriation [see paragraph
380 above] and discrimination [see paragraph 441 above] expressly prohibited under Article
16 of the Implementation Agreement, the right of Termination has accrued in favour of the
Claimant in respect of events A, C, E and F as described above, which the Respondent terms
as the first category [see paragraph 458 above]. These Events of Default require no cure

period.

The Tribunal is satisfied that the Claimant has adhered faithfully to the procedural steps to
terminate the Implementation Agreement. These are matters of facts and of the record and

require no further discussion.

466.

With regards to the second category,6 Article 6.6 of the PPA requires that TANESCO or GoT
provides security for payments due to IPTL by way of a letter of credit or payment into an
Escrow Account. Any amount drawn down from the account must then be reinstated within
30 days. The intent behind this arrangement was to provide assurance of payment by
TANESCO of any amounts due to IPTL under the PPA. The Respondent’s criticism that the
Claimant was wrong to have relied on Article 6.6 of the PPA and should instead be relying on
Article 6.8 of the PPA, would make little difference. Article 6.8 merely provides for a situation
where there is a dispute as to whether such sums are due to IPTL, it nevertheless refers to
the same Escrow Account mentioned in Article 6.6 of the PPA and withdrawal must be made
only when the amount is undisputed with disputed sums remaining in account. There was no
error or confusion that the GoT has the joint responsibility under Article 6.6 of the PPA to
reinstate the amounts so withdrawn from the Escrow Account. The Tribunal therefore
reaffirms that the failure to do so is an Event of Default as it is a “material breach” specifically
identified in Article 19.1(b)(vii) of the Implementation Agreement and for which GoT is

obliged to provide security under Article 15.3 of the Implementation Agreement.

The Respondent's criticism of the third category“ also lacks merit. The Claimant has since
obtained the PPA Award in its favour, but TANESCO has failed to make payment and the
Claimant remains unable to recover any sum under the PPA Award. Any suggestion that the
PPA Award was subject to appeal has since been put to rest when the ICSID ad hoc Annulment
Committee rendered its final decision in August 2018.68 There is no doubt in the Tribunal’s
mind that TANESCO’s breach of the PPA in failing to make payments that were due and failing
to abide by the PPA Award constitute a “material breach by TANESCO” under Article
19.1(b)(vii) of the Implementation Agreement, entitling the Claimant the terminate the

Implementation Agreement.

(2) Whether the Claimant is Entitled to Claim Compensation under Row 2 of
Schedule 2 of the Implementation Agreement without Transferring the
Facility to the Respondent?

a. Parties’ Submissions

The Claimant claims that upon Termination it is entitled to be compensated in accordance
with Schedule 2 of the Implementation Agreement as provided in Article 20.1(b) of the

Implementation Agreement.

The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s claims, maintaining that compensation upon
termination by the IPTL (the Company) requires as a pre-condition, a transfer of the Facility

to the Government.

Article 20.1(b) of the Implementation Agreement reads:

In the event the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Article
19.1(b) as a result of GOT Event of Default, the Company may elect to
transfer the Facility to the GOT or its designee and, upon such transfer,
the GOT or its designee shall pay the Company the compensation
amount set forth in Row 2 of Schedule 2.

The Claimant's position is: (i) first, that the proper reading of Article 20.1(b) of the
Implementation Agreement is that the requirement that the Facility be transferred to the
Respondent is not applicable in case the Facility has been expropriated and this is apparent
as the first Event of Default as listed in Article 19.1(b) includes expropriation of a material
asset of IPTL; and (ii) second, that in general the Claimant's inability to transfer the Facility
to the Respondent is due to the Respondent's wrongful conduct i.e. expropriation of the
Facility and IPTL’s shares and thus violates the principle that a party cannot benefit from its

own wrong.°*?

b. Tribunal’s Analysis

It is difficult to see how this provision could be interpreted otherwise than that it provides
for the Company (viz. IPTL or the Claimant in this instance) to “elect to transfer the Facility to
the GOT.” Admittedly, SCB HK is in no position to, and has not suggested it could, effectively
do so. The Tribunal therefore agrees with the Respondent that the Claimant is not entitled to

compensation under Row 2 of the Second Schedule to the Implementation Agreement. This,

160

475.

however, does not mean that the Claimant is left with no remedy upon termination. The
Tribunal therefore considers that the Respondent's discriminatory actions (in breach of
Article 16.1) and the Respondent's failure to provide security (in breach of Article 6.6 of the
PPA and Article 15.3 of the Implementation Agreement), the actions of Oriyo J, Utamwa J,
MEM and PAP all culminated in the expropriation of the shares in IPTL and depletion of the
Escrow Account. It is this ultimate event of expropriation that the Claimant should get proper

compensation upon termination.

The Implementation Agreement provides specifically for such an event in Article 20.1(d) viz:

In the event the GOT or TANESCO expropriate, compulsorily acquire,
nationalise, or otherwise compulsorily procure any Ordinary Share
capital or assets of the Company, the GOT shall pay the Company the
compensation account set forth in Row 4 of the Compensation Table in
schedule 2.

Article 20.1(d) of the Implementation Agreement requires no transfer of the Facility. The
situation the Claimant is found in fits squarely into this category of compensation and should
in principle be entitled to compensation according to Row 4 of Schedule 2 of the

Implementation Agreement and not Row 2 of Schedule 2.

QUANTUM

The Claimant submits that as a statutory assignee it is entitled to recover all damages and
compensation payable under the Implementation Agreement and is not limited to the amount
of loans, subject to the excess being accounted. It relies on the Chivers and Zervos Expert

Reports®° to substantiate this proposition.®5!

The Claimant asserts that as an assignee of IPTL it is entitled to recover damages for the
following loss and damages resulting from the breaches of Implementation Agreement. The

Claimant claims a total of USD 352,514,258 in damages which comprise of: 652

i. Damages of USD 176,291,811 for breach of the Implementation Agreement relating
to the PPA tariff for the period up to September 2013: dissipation of the Escrow and
failure to use the top-up payment to discharge IPTL’s debts.653

ii. Damages of USD 176,227,447 for breach of the Implementation Agreement in relation
to losses arising from the transfer of IPTL’s affairs to PAP and relating to the period

after September 2013 which includes:
a) Damages of USD 120,733,915 for October 2013 to 31 August 2018; 654 and

b) Damages of USD 55,488,533 for 31 August 2018 to January 2022.655

The Respondent's primary case is that the Claimant should not be awarded any damages or
compensation. It argues that this is because it would be against the principle of multiple
recovery to do so as the Claimant has already been awarded substantial amounts by the 2016
Flaux J Judgement and the PPA Award. Alternatively, it submits that should the Tribunal find
that the Claimant is entitled to terminate the Implementation Agreement and seek
compensation under Schedule 2 of the Implementation Agreement, it should not be allowed
to be awarded both compensation and damages. In its PHB, the Respondent has also provided

alternative calculations to the Claimant’s expert’s calculations of compensation.°¢

The Tribunal notes that the Claimant has succeeded on its claim for expropriation for which
it is entitled to termination and compensation under Article 20.1(d) of the Implementation
Agreement.°57 The Claimant as assignee of IPTL had also suffered loss and damage during the
period leading up to the expropriation. It is quite incorrect therefore to suggest that the
Claimant should only be limited to a claim for compensation under the Implementation
Agreement and no claim for damages. They are distinct heads of claim, and the Claimant

should be entitled to the damages it can prove.

The Tribunal’s finding against GoT on discriminatory action and breach of Article 16.1

however has no impact on the damages that the Claimant could seek. This is because these

same actions have also been earlier found to be acts of expropriation for which damages will

be awarded and quantified below.

CALCULATION OF DAMAGES

The Claimant seeks damages for breach of the Implementation Agreement under the
following heads:658
i. Damage related to the amounts covered by the PPA Award (tariff payments for the

period up to September 2013)-

a) by calculating the amount, including any interest earned, that would have
been available in the Escrow Account as at September 2016 (PPA Award) and
therefore available to satisfy the PPA Award and in turn reduce IPTL's debt to
SCB HK, had the Escrow Account not been paid out to PAP in late 2013;

b) alternatively, on the assumption that the funds withdrawn from the Escrow
Account in November and December 2013 (plus the top-up sum paid by
TANESCO) should, having been withdrawn, have been paid to SCB HK in USD,
and should have been used to reduce the amount outstanding under the SCB
HK loan, to calculate the damage to IPTL as at 31 August 2018 resulting from

the non-payment of these sums to SCB HK; and

c) alternatively, and assuming no payments before September 2016, to calculate
the damage to IPTL as at 31 August 2018 from TANESCO's failure to pay the
PPA Award as at September 2016.

ii. Damages incurred for the period October 2013 to January 2022-
a) Loss of capacity payments between October 2013 and 31 August 2018; and
b) Loss of capacity payments between 31 August 2018 and January 2022.
The Claimant submitted, together with its PHB, an updated Expert Report by Mr Johnson.®°?
There is no issue raised as regard the amount in the Escrow Account when converted to USD

in December 2013, it was USD 125,719,064. Reference to the Johnson Expert Report hereafter

is a reference to the latest updated version.

658 Claimant's PHB, paras. 207-216.
659 Updated Johnson Expert Report.

481.

482.

The substance of Mr Johnson’s Report remained the same as when it was first submitted, but
it updates the calculation of damages and compensation up to 31 August 2018. The Updated
Report uses an updated loan balance under the Facility Agreement rather than a projected
loan balance; updates the calculations for the effects of hypothetical payments on IPTL’s
indebtedness; updates the applicable interest to the past hypothetical payments; updates the
discounting in case of future hypothetical payments; applies a discount rate of 17.96% rather
than 19.73%; uses the actual date rather than projected figures for the United States
Consumer Price Index (“CPI”), LIBOR and exchange rates of the period of October 2016 to
August 2018; and calculates compensation under the Implementation Agreement based on

the contract termination on 6 July 2018.50

Using these figures, Mr Johnson shows how, if the payment from the Escrow Account had
been made in December 2013 together with the top-ups between March 2015 and July 2015,
it would reduce IPTL’s indebtedness in December 2013 to 2015 by USD 176,291,811.561
Alternatively, without taking into consideration the top-up payment, if the Escrow Account
was used to pay the loan following the PPA Award in September 2016, IPTL’s debt would
have been reduced by USD 144,868,181 and if used to repay the loan in December 2013
IPTL’s debt would have been reduced by USD 147,039,707.

The Respondent asserts that its primary case is that the Claimant is not entitled to any
compensation or damages. In the event that the Tribunal finds in favour of the Claimant, the
Respondent's position is that the Claimant should not succeed beyond USD 41.33 million as
compensation for the undertaking against expropriation or up to USD 95.55 million as
compensation should the Tribunal find in the Claimant's favour on its other claims for breach
justifying termination.%3 The Respondent takes the position that the Claimant should not be
awarded both compensation and damages. If, however, the Tribunal were to award damages
alone and were to find in Claimant's favour on issues relating to the release of the Escrow
Account, these damages should not exceed USD 144.87 million®** as quantified by the
Claimant in it PHB.®5 Further, should the Tribunal find the Respondent to be fully liable of all

the Claimant's claims the aggregate sum should not exceed USD 156.62 million or USD 187.27
million depending on whether enforcement costs of USD 30.65 million incurred by the

Claimant ought to be deducted as unrecoverable.
In the following sections, the Tribunal will discuss the quantification of each of these claims.

(4) Damage Related to the Amounts covered by the PPA Award (Tariff Payments
for the Period up to September 2013)

a. Parties’ Submissions

The Claimant claims to be entitled to damages in relation to losses during the period up to
September 2013, arising from the improper release of funds from the Escrow Account and
the making of the top-up payment to PAP-controlled IPTL, which funds should have been
used to reduce IPTL’s indebtedness under the Facility Agreement. It submits that the loss
suffered under this head is the difference between the outstanding loan balance under the
Facility Agreement as of 31 August 2018 and the outstanding loan balance had the Escrow
Account funds, which were released in November - December 2013, been used to reduce
IPTL’s indebtedness, or alternatively, if the Escrow Account had been used to pay the PPA

Award issued in September 2016.67

The Respondent argues that the Claimant in its PHB claims for the amount based on the
estimated reduction of IPTL’s indebtedness in case Escrow funds would have been used to
pay the PPA Award in September 2016, and the Respondent submits that the amount of USD
176.29 million, which is the Claimant’s proposed amount, is inappropriate, because had IPTL
and TANESCO not reached an agreement for the release of the Escrow Account, they would
also not have agreed on top-up payments. The Respondent also argues that it is inappropriate
to consider IPTL’s indebtedness as being reduced by the payment of the Escrow Account in
December 2013 as the Claimant was not entitled to the Escrow Account funds until the PPA

Award was issued.6%8

b. Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal accepts that IPTL had suffered loss of revenue that could have been used to

assist it to pay down the outstanding loans, and the fact that the Claimant only obtained the

PPA Award in September 2016 does not mean that its entitlement to payment became due
and payable only thereafter. The purpose of the Escrow Account was to pay IPTL who in turn
had financial obligations to the Claimant. The Tribunal also accepts the Respondent's
argument that, had there not been agreement for the release of funds from the Escrow,
TANESCO would not have agreed to make any top-up of the funds and, as such, it would not

be reasonable to add the top-up amount in reckoning the loss.

The loss of these funds to pay down the loan is best ascertained by the difference between
the outstanding loan balance under the Facility Agreement as at 31 August 2018 and what
the outstanding loan balance would have been had the Escrow Account been used to reduce
IPTL's indebtedness upon its release in November and December 2013. No account should,
however, be taken of the top-up amount for if there was no such agreement to release the
funds in the Escrow Account, no top-up payment would have been made by TANESCO. The
Tribunal finds that based on Mr Johnson’s calculations as at 31 August 2018 (without taking
into account the top-up sum) IPTL's indebtedness would have been reduced by
USD 144,868,181. The Respondent has in its Reply PHB also accepted this as the more

proper quantification of the Claimant's loss under this head.%°

(2) Damages Relating to the PPA tariff for the Period after September 2013:
October 2013 to January 2022

a. Parties’ Submissions

The Claimant submits that the transfer of IPTL to PAP in breach of the Implementation
Agreement deprived IPTL of the ability to earn and apply income under the PPA from
September 2013, which would have reduced its debt to the Claimant and other creditors. The
loss suffered in relation to this is calculated based on the loss of capacity payments and
bonuses that IPTL would have expected to receive from TANESCO during the continuing
operation of the Facility under the PPA.‘”° The figures provided in Mr Johnson’s calculations

amount to USD 176.22 million, as summarised in the table below:

damages calculated between October 2013 and 31 March 2018.978 It provides an alternative
calculation by removing the bonus payments from 2013 onwards, takes into account
corporate income taxes and applies a risk-free interest rate to cash flows from October 2013
to August 2018 which it submits should reduce the Claimant’s claimed damages under this
head to USD 142.39 million. The Respondent prepared the following comparative table of this

b. Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal agrees that providing for bonus payments may be speculative as the same are
subject to agreement to be reached between IPTL and TANESCO based on previous year
transactions.®®° Mr Johnson had calculated bonus payment based on Equivalent Availability
Factor (“EAF”) being greater than the threshold of 0.90. His calculation of lost cashflows from
2013 thereafter assumes that EAF would be achieved beyond 0.90 and had therefore worked
out bonus payments as annually payable from 2013. Mr Johnson had in fact used the EAF of
2007 of 0.93 to support his theory that EAF would be achieved from 2013 at the same rate.
In this regard, the Tribunal agrees that this would indeed be speculative and should be
disallowed. The element of bonus payments should therefore be disregarded in the
calculations together with the VAT thereon of 18%. By removing all bonus payments from
October 2013 to January 2022, using Mr Johnson’s model, would reduce the damages sought

from USD 176.22 million to USD 170.71 million.

The Respondent also points out that Mr Johnson had made several other errors in his
computation viz. the exclusion of applicable taxes and the improper interest rate selection for
bringing forward historical damages calculated between October 2013 and 31 March 2018.
On taxes, Mr Johnson had used “EBITDA” (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and
Amortization) to quantify the cashflow loss. The omission of corporate tax would have

reduced the damages by 21.9%.

It was also pointed out by the Respondent that the interest rate used by Mr Johnson was
LIBOR +2% plus, and additional 1% as penalty interest, when the Loan Facility Agreement
stipulated USD - 6 month LIBOR +2.5% which was later reduced to LIBOR +2%°®! after the

restructuring, 682

The Respondent has in its Reply PHB adjusted these using Johnson’s native Excel spreadsheet

submitted as directed by the Tribunal and arrived with the following results:°®3

The Tribunal agrees with the observations made by the Respondent with regard to Mr
Johnson’s omission of corporate taxes and the application of default penalty interest in the
reckoning of future cashflows. The Tribunal therefore accepts the Respondent's
quantification as a better and proper approach under this head of claim and fixes the

Claimant’s loss of capacity payments at USD 142,387,737 only.

The loss and damage that the Claimant and IPTL would have suffered works out to
USD 287,255,918 (being USD 144,868,181 [paragraph 488 above] + USD 142,387,737
[paragraph 495 above]) .

COMPENSATION FOR TERMINATION

The Claimant contends that it has terminated the Implementation Agreement on 6 July 2018
and is thus also entitled to recover compensation as provided in Row 2 of Schedule 2,
pursuant to Article 20.1(b) of the Implementation Agreement. In accordance with the
Tribunal’s ruling that the Claimant is entitled only to compensation for termination based on
expropriation,°®+ the relevant computation formula is Row 4 of Schedule 2 of the

Implementation Agreement, which incorporates only elements (a) + (b) + (e).

These elements are defined under Part 2 of Schedule 2 of the Implementation Agreement

as:685

a= Sum of (i) the total amount outstanding to the Lenders under
the Financing Documents (including interest during the original
construction period through the earlier of the date of termination of this
Agreement or the Scheduled Commercial Operations Date) plus (ii) the
total amount outstanding under any loan agreements for capital
improvements to the Facility that are required under the Power
Purchase Agreement, as approved by the GOT, plus (iii) the total amount
of any other outstanding debt incurred by the Company that was
approved by the GOT, less any insurance proceeds available to the
Company following a Force Majeure Event and not spent for
Restoration.

684 See paras. 471 to 473 above.

b= The initial equity investment by the shareholders of the Company
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of years
remaining in the initial term of the Power Purchase Agreement and the
denominator of which is the initial term of the Power Purchase
Agreement.

[ul

e= The summation of the products of (i) any additional equity amounts
that are contributed by the shareholders of the Company for any of the
events that are described under Article 17.5 plus any such equity
contributions approved by the GOT, times (ii) a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of years remaining in the initial term of the
Power Purchase Agreement and the denominator of which is the
number of years remaining in the initial term of the Power Purchase
Agreement at the time of such contribution or approval for each such
additional equity amount.

Both Parties agree that there was no additional equity contribution and as such the value for
element (e) is zero.“86 The Tribunal therefore needs only to consider the values of elements

(a) and (b).

(4) Element (a) - Outstanding Loan

Mr Johnson performed calculations under three scenarios based on the Scheduled
Commercial Operations Date (“SCOD”) which was 28 October 1999 as the Financing
Documents were signed on 28 June 1997 and SCOD is defined as 28 months following

Financial Closing.°87

In Scenario 1, Mr Johnson took “the loan principal and interest outstanding at SCOD plus
interest and penalties that accrued to July 2018 (i.e. date of termination) less payments made
by IPTL against the outstanding amounts during this period. This is the actual amount
outstanding under SCB HK's loan to IPTL.”.688 In Scenario 2, he adjusted Scenario 1 by capping
it at “the lowest of the amount of the loan principal and interest outstanding at SCOD or any

lower level of principal and interest outstanding that is achieved at any time (which happens

687 See HB/C/002/013-128 at pg. 027: PPA, 26 May 1995, Article 1.1 provides: “Scheduled Commercial Operations Date:
The date that is 28 months after Financial Closing, as such date is extended for Force Majeure Events in accordance with
provisions of Article XV.” (emphasis in original); Updated Johnson Expert Report, para. 7.4.

in the period immediately prior to 31 January 2007)”.%? In Scenario 3, the amount of “the
loan principal and interest that was outstanding at SCOD less payments made by IPTL against
the outstanding amounts through to 31 January 2007.”. Under Scenario 3, he ignored the
“additional interest that in fact accrued under the loan after SCOD, and for the purposes of
the compensation formula assume that all payments made by IPTL to its lenders are applied

against the principal and interest outstanding at SCOD.”.6%

These calculations yield amounts of USD 182,782,152 (Scenario 1), USD 88,290,092 (Scenario
2) and USD 41,325,329 (Scenario 3).6%! Mr Johnson did not include capital improvements to
the Facility, or any other outstanding debt incurred by the Company that was approved by
the GoT.6%2

The Parties are both in agreement that Scenario 2 is not appropriate.63

The Claimant insists that Scenario 1 is most appropriate as “it is closest to the language of the
contract (which is inclusive) and according to Mr Johnson "is typical in terms of project
financing".°* The Respondent disagrees, maintaining that the approach in Scenario 1 violates
the definition given to element (a) of Schedule 2.55 According to the Respondent, Mr Johnson
had used the amount outstanding to the lenders as the theoretical balance of the SCB HK loan
as of 31 March 2018, based on a principal equivalent to the sum of the drawdowns made by
IPTL before October 1999, the Scheduled Commercial Operations Date, i.e., USD 84 million.66
The Respondent submits that, in doing so, Mr Johnson excluded the last drawdown of USD
1.86 million made by IPTL in January 2000°%7 and calculated the interest and penalty on the
basis of the principal as of SCOD of USD 84 million. Interest and penalties post-SCOD were
added together with insurance costs and enforcement costs, which were all incurred after the

SCOD.°%8

The Tribunal sees the force of the Respondent's criticisms. Indeed, element (a) speaks only
of “the total amount outstanding to the Lenders under the Financing Documents (including
interest during the original construction period through the earlier of the date of termination
of this Agreement or the Scheduled Commercial Operations Date)”. On a plain and simple

reading, this limits the amount of principal and interest outstanding as at the date of SCOD

 

and requires that any payments made by IPTL be applied to reduce this loan, disregarding
interest accruing after the SCOD. The Tribunal therefore agrees that Mr Johnson’s Scenario 3
is the maximum that can be awarded under element (a) and finds that this is the correct and

appropriate approach for calculating element (a), which amounts to USD 41.33 million.

(2) Element (b) - Initial Capital

For element (b) Mr Johnson considered 2 scenarios -

i. Scenario A - the actual initial equity investment of USD 60 million is used. This is on
the basis that a shareholder's loan represents equity because the shareholder was
taking equity risk and calculated this amount as USD 10,594,521.

ii. Scenario B - an initial equity investment of USD 41.4 million is used, which was the
deemed amount of equity for the purposes of calculating the tariff in the ICSID 1
Award. Mr Johnson had calculated this amount as USD 7,310,219. 69

The Respondent does not agree to either of the positions suggested. The Respondent argues
that the original shareholders did not put in equity (save for USD 100) as required but had
instead extended a Shareholder’s Loan of USD 60 million, which was eventually partially paid

down to Mechmar. It suggests that this element is a simple zero.70°

The Claimant disagrees with the suggestion that a shareholder loan could not constitute its
equity contribution. The Claimant submits that by extending a loan, Mechmar was taking an
equity risk. It also observed that the tribunal in the PPA Award made no such finding that
Mechmar’s funding was not "equity" for the purposes of the project documents. It argues that,
in any event, even if this funding was not "equity" within the meaning of element (b), it would

fall instead within outstanding debt advanced by lenders under element (a).7°

512.

The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that while Mechmar may have extended loans to
IPTL, it is nevertheless not equity as generally understood. Whereas equity remains the asset
of the company, a loan is a liability of the company and an asset of the lender. As lender, there
is a right to demand repayment, and in fact there was repayment. The Claimant’s suggestion
that as lender, the amount could then be considered under element (a) is also flawed as the
“Lender” referred to in element (a) refers only to the Lender as defined in the Implementation

Agreement, which would not include shareholders.

The Tribunal therefore finds that the compensation available to the Claimant under Article
20.1(d) of the Implementation Agreement is element (a) only, which the Tribunal determined

to be USD 41.33 million.

POTENTIAL OVERLAP BETWEEN DAMAGES AND COMPENSATION

The Tribunal’s finding against GoT on discriminatory action and breach of Article 16.1 of the
Implementation Agreement, however, has no impact on the damages that it could seek. This
is because these same actions have also been earlier found to be acts of expropriation for

which the Tribunal is awarding compensation and damages.

The Respondent states that there is an overlap between Claimant’s claim for damages

calculated under breach of the Implementation Agreement and compensation arising from

the termination of the Implementation Agreement.”°2 During the Hearing, Mr Johnson agreed
that there were two elements of overlap? and this was agreed to by the Claimant in its

Closing presentations. They are:

i. Element (a) in the compensation formula which is the amount outstanding to the
lenders may overlap with the damages for breach of the Implementation Agreement
because the damages reflect the loss suffered by IPTL due to its indebtedness not
being reduced. The Claimant proposes that in case the Tribunal goes against its
primary case then the amount awarded under element (a) could be deducted from
the damages award; and

ii. Element (d) of the compensation formula which is the net cash flows following
termination could overlap with damages in relation to Net Capacity Charges and

bonuses earned after 31 August 2018 and the Claimant proposes that should the

516.

517.

Tribunal decided against its primary case, the amount awarded under element (d)
could be deducted from the damages in relation to the net Capacity Charges and

bonuses for the aforementioned period.7*

As the Tribunal has found that element (d) is not relevant in reckoning computation of
compensation under Row 4 of Schedule 2 of the Implementation Agreement, there is no
overlap with the damages awarded as net cash flow loss quantified based on the Net Capacity

Charges projected for after 31 August 2018.

The Tribunal notes that as for element (a), which the Tribunal has fixed at USD 41.33 million,
this should be deducted from the final reconciling of damages and compensation due to the

Claimant.

Additionally, the Claimant notes that such overlap will not take place in the case where the
Tribunal decides to award only termination or compensation (but not both), or alternatively
agrees to the Claimant’s proposal at paragraph 517 below. The Respondent further states
that there is an additional area of double counting in between the initial equity contribution
ie. element “b” and the discounted net cash flows as calculated by Mr Johnson under breach
of the Implementation Agreement from October 2013 onwards. However, as the Tribunal has

given a zero factor for element (b), this overlap would not in fact feature.

The Tribunal summarises below the quantification of the claims amounting to USD 287.26

million which it has reached, as follows:

During the Hearing and in its PHB, the Claimant stated that it was amenable to the Tribunal
making the following order in relation to the sum in excess of the outstanding bank loan

amount and restricting its recovery to amount due under the Facility Agreement:

704Claimant’s PHB, para. 225.

174

518.

519.

520.

i. making a declaration as to the total amount of damages and
compensation due under the Implementation Agreement (or a
declaration that this is greater than the sum due under the Facility
Agreement, if this is the case); and

ii. ordering that the GoT pay to SCB HK the full amount due under the
Facility Agreement, comprising:

(a) US$187,269,605, being the current amount due under the Facility
Agreement; plus

(b) additional interest and other sums due in relation to the period after
August 2018, as calculated by the Facility Agent; less

(c) any amounts recovered by SCB HK or SCB Malaysia from IPTL or
Tanesco prior to the Tribunal’s award.795

The Claimant submits that the loan balance under the Facility Agreement as at 31 August
2018 stood at USD 187,269,605 and that this includes additional interest, penalties and
enforcement costs, since 16 November 2016 when USD 168,800,063.87 was found
outstanding by Flaux J.7°6 The breakdown of the outstanding loan balance as per the Updated
Loan Model at Appendix 8 of the Updated Johnson Expert Report is given in tabular form in
the Johnson Expert Report at paragraph 4.13 and reproduced below:

 

 

 

 

Projected Balance At 31 August2018 USD
Enforcement Costs 30,652,893
Insurance 5,637,070
Penalties 14,022,940
Interest 49,899,729
Principal 87,056,972
Total 187,269,605

 

 

The rationale behind the Claimant’s proposal is that it had originally proposed in its Opening
that it would account to IPTL for any sum in excess of its stake in the Project. It then realised
that this would be cumbersome and perhaps unworkable and therefore withdrew the

original proposal.

The Tribunal is conscious that while SCB HK has stepped into the shoes of IPTL and claiming
rights as an assignee, it should nevertheless not be entitled to enjoy a windfall. For GoT, the

possibility of being exposed to a claim by the very same PAP-controlled IPTL for the amount

705 Claimant's PHB, para. 203.

523.

so adjudged or declared is an unhappy one. Unfortunately, as the Tribunal has found that it
had committed discriminatory actions against the Claimant/Mechmar and wrongly
expropriated IPTL’s assets, and imperilled SCB HK’s security interest, this is a consequence it
has to face. In fact, if the Tribunal declines to make such a declaration as proposed by the
Claimant, GoT could well have to bear and make full and immediate payment of the adjudged
amount to SCB HK. Making the declaration as sought by the Claimant would ring-fence or
limit GoT’s current exposure. Should PAP-controlled IPTL attempt to rely on this Award, the

Tribunal is confident that GoT would be more than able to raise a strong defence.

In relation to the final amount to be adjudged as payable to the Claimant, the Respondent has
suggested that the costs of enforcement should be deducted from the loan outstanding
because GoT should not pay for “Claimant’s abusive and convoluted litigation strategy over the
years, including for other claims that were unsuccessfully brought against the Government such

as the BIT Arbitration.”7°7

The Claimant’s response to this is that the enforcement costs incurred by it were sums due
as damages under the Implementation Agreement because GoT's breaches of the
Implementation Agreement have prevented the sums under the Facility Agreement from
being repaid. The Claimant says it is entitled to add enforcement costs to the sum due
pursuant to Clause 24(C) of the Facility Agreement, which provides that IPTL shall pay "on
demand, all costs and expenses (including Taxes thereon and legal fees) incurred [...] in
protecting or enforcing any rights under the Financing Documents".7® In the proceedings
before the English court, Faux J had in his judgment ruled that the loan outstanding as USD
168,800,063.87 which included enforcement costs of USD 24.19 million.7°° Further, the
Claimant states that the enforcement costs were also incurred in attempts at recovery in
courts in Malaysia, BVI, New York, English, and Tanzanian proceedings, and four ICSID

arbitrations.7!°

While the Tribunal takes note of GoT’s observation that the Claimant should not be allowed

to recover costs for its “convoluted and abusive” litigation strategy,”!! the Tribunal is

nevertheless conscious that but for the discriminatory actions and expropriation, none of
these costs would ever have been incurred. In the Tribunal’s view, all of these are proper
heads of losses and should be allowed, save and except the Claimant's costs incurred for the
BIT Arbitration which was dismissed for want of jurisdiction. The Tribunal will deduct from

the amount finally adjudged the sum of USD 1,820,164.95.712

Taking all these into consideration the Tribunal will make the declaration sought and limit
the recovery of the Claimant in this award to USD 187,269,605 less USD 1,820,164.96, i.e. USD
185,449,440.04 being the amount suffered to discharge the indebtedness due to the

Claimant under the Facility Agreement.

The Tribunal notes that the sum of USD 185,449,440.04 included interest accrued up to end
August 2018. The Claimant in its Post-Hearing Brief?!3 sought “additional interest and other
sums due in relation to the period after August 2018, as calculated by the Facility Agent”. Until
the sum of USD 185,449,440.04 is fully paid, the Claimant should be compensated for the loss
of use of such funds and be entitled to interest thereon at the same rate as that provided for
in the Facility Agreement viz. 6-month LIBOR +2%7!4 and payable as from 1 September 2018

until full and final payment.

The Tribunal is also urged by the Respondent to order a set-off of whatever amount that
Tribunal is awarding to the Claimant in this arbitration against the claims they had succeeded
in the 2016 Flaux J judgment7!5 (USD168.8 million) and the PPA Award7!¢ (USD148.4
million). It should be noted that there is no identity of parties in this matter with those other
proceedings; the respondent in the PPA Arbitration was TANESCO and the respondents in
the Flaux J’s judgment were IPTL, VIP and PAP. Further, as neither the award nor the
judgment has been satisfied in whole or in part, there is no basis to suggest that the Claimant
has obtained double recovery or has such intention to do so. An enforcement court will in the
normal course require disclosure of parallel enforcement proceedings. An award-debtor

could easily bring this to the attention of the relevant forum to resist any enforcement action

PARTIES’ SUBMISSIONS

The Claimant submits that the Tribunal has power to award costs as it deems appropriate
and is not bound to follow decisions of previous ICSID Tribunals.7!? The Claimant relies upon
the following provisions:
i. Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention which provides:

(2) In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as

the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties

in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom

those expenses, the fees of the members of the Tribunal and the charges

for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall
form part of the award.

ii. ICSID Arbitration Rule 47(1) (j) which provides:
G) any decision of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding.

The Claimant submits that the Tribunal should award costs on the principle “costs follow the
event” and should take into consideration conduct of the parties and nature of the case they
advanced. It relies on the decision in Caratube v Kazakhstan”'* to support this position.7!9 It
asserts that the “cost follow the event” rule should be followed as it is common practice in
international arbitration and a norm in investment arbitration. It also submits that the rule
is desirable from a policy perspective as well.72° The Claimant asserts that there are various

reasons which justify an award of costs against the Respondent.

First, the Claimant submits that the Respondent’s procedural conduct has caused delay,
inefficiency and increased costs, and points out three instances, which include: (i) the
Respondent's delay in filing its Rejoinder; (ii) the Respondent's defective document
production and delay in complying with the Tribunal’s orders concerning the Respondent's
document production; and (iii) the Respondent's non-attendance at the first procedural

hearing.721

Second, the Claimant contends that the Respondent raised several factual allegations, which
were without merit, and the Claimant had to present a large amount of witness and

documentary evidence to demonstrate why these allegations were incorrect.722

Additionally, the Claimant also submits that due to unequal payments by the Respondent and
the Claimant towards the advance on costs of arbitration (i.e. USD 87,500 paid by the
Claimant towards the Respondent's half of the first advance and USD 150,000 towards the
Respondent's half of USD 300,000 that the Parties were asked to pay on 5 June 2018 by
ICSID). The Claimant submits that it has paid a total of USD 712,764.33 to ICSID and the
Respondent has paid USD 150,000.00. Thus, if the Tribunal decides to order that costs of
arbitration be shared equally, it should order a balance payment of USD 268,882.16 to be paid

by the Respondent to the Claimant.723

The Claimant also submits that in case the Tribunal orders the Respondent to pay the
Claimant damages and/or compensation sufficient to pay off the sum due under the Facility
Agreement, then it does not separately require costs for this arbitration from the Respondent
as those costs would already have been paid off by the Claimant under the Facility Agreement.
Thus, the Claimant is seeking payment of its costs only to the extent that damages and/or
compensation which the Tribunal orders to be paid to the Claimant are “insufficient to pay off
the amount due under the Facility Agreement, as updated by [Claimant] at the date of the

Award.”724

The Claimant claims its costs for this arbitration as incurred up to 19 September 2018 and

any additional costs incurred in connection the arbitration arising after that date. It provides

At current exchange rate, the Claimant's costs incurred amounts to about USD 4,130,000.

The Respondent submits that it seeks costs pursuant to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention
(see paragraph 527(i) above) and Rule 28 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.

The Respondent submits that the “loser pays” principle is not followed strictly by ICSID
tribunals and rather a variety of factors are considered including the relative success of the
parties’ claims and the good faith of the unsuccessful party in making those claims. It relies

on the decision Noble Ventures, Inc v Romania?26 to support this submission.727

The Respondent characterises the Claimant's litigation strategy as abusive and cites various

circumstances which include:

i. that the Claimant’s parent company started the BIT Arbitration, and, even though
claims were rejected for lack of jurisdiction, the tribunal, ordered each party to bear
their own costs and half the ICSID fees each. The Respondent adds that the Claimant
is now attempting to recover its part of the BIT Arbitration costs by including them

in the calculation as enforcement costs in the claimed outstanding loan amount;

that various procedural errors were made by the Claimant before the Tanzanian
Courts which included missing relevant deadlines;

that the Claimant's withdrawal from the Tanzanian court proceedings and its failure
to properly challenge Utamwa J Order shows that its litigation strategy was not
genuine;

the fact that the Claimant bringing this arbitration after obtaining the PPA Award and
2016 Flaux J Judgment, which shows that its intention is to pressurise the
Respondent; and

finally, that the Claimant has inflated its relief which was reflected: (a) in its own
admission that there many areas of overlap in the Claimant’s calculations; (b)
Claimant originally claiming a payment order under the Loan Facility Agreement
which was changed once challenged by the Respondent on the illogical nature of such
an order; and (c) the claim for declaratory relief on behalf of IPTL for amounts which

IPTL would not be entitled is irrational.728

538. Thus, the Respondent submits that in line with the reasons stated above, the Tribunal should

award costs to the Respondent or if it finds in favour of the Claimant's case then to apportion

costs in a manner that does not “unfairly overburden” the Respondent.”2?

TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

The Tribunal accepts that in ICSID arbitration, the principle of “loser pays” is not followed
strictly. The Tribunal is also aware that in many cases where the merits of each party's case
are mixed, determining who is the successful party may be difficult. In this case, the Tribunal
has found that the Respondent committed acts of expropriation and taken discriminatory
actions against the Claimant. The clear conclusion is that the Claimant has succeeded
substantially in its claims, albeit its monetary awards have been moderated. The Tribunal
does not see how the actions taken by the Claimant were abusive when they were genuinely
attempting to legally assert their rights through whatever available legal course but had thus
far not been successful in doing so. The Tribunal therefore takes the view that the Respondent
must bear its own costs, the cost of this arbitration (i.e. the costs paid or payable to ICSID’s
administration, and the Tribunal’s fees and expenses) and the costs incurred by the Claimant

in prosecuting this matter.

The amount sought by the Claimant is approximately USD 4.13 million as compared to the
Respondent's costs claim of USD 4.7 million. Given the work that had to be undertaken, the
Claimant’s costs appear to be fair and reasonable and would in normal circumstances be

recoverable.

The costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID’s
administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):
Arbitrators’ fees and expenses
Prof Lawrence Boo (President) 251,812.18
Justice David Unterhalter SC (Co-arbitrator) 254,164.53

Dr Kamal Hossain (Co-arbitrator)

216,718.04

Mr Stanley Burnton (Co-Arbitrator) 3937.50
ICSID’s administrative fees 148,000.00
Direct expenses (estimated) 128,243.56
Total 1,002,875.81

As of the date of this Award, the Claimant had paid as advances towards the cost of ICSID and
the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, amounting to USD 937,764.33, including a portion of
the Respondent's advances, whereas the Respondent has paid USD 175,000.00. As the

Claimant has stated in its Submission of Costs (see paragraph 532 above), it would not be

182

seeking any order for cost of arbitration should the damages and compensation awarded
herein be sufficient to discharge the Respondent’s indebtedness under the Facility
Agreement, the Tribunal will make no order on the costs of arbitration or reimbursement of

any advances made.

AWARD

For the reasons set out above,

The Tribunal hereby Declares -

I. That the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Parties and the dispute:
a. The Claimant is the lawful assignee under Article 15.2 of the Implementation
Agreement and has the title and interest to pursue its claims against the
Respondent for any breach of the Implementation Agreement in its own

b. under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.

IL. that the United Republic of Tanzania has breached Articles 15.3, 16.1 and 16.2 of the

Implementation Agreement;

TI. the Implementation Agreement was terminated on 6 July 2018 in accordance with

the Claimant’s Termination Notice; and

Iv. the Claimant is entitled to compensation pursuant to termination under Article
20.1(d) of the Implementation Agreement and damages for the Respondent’s

breaches of the Implementation Agreement.
And the Tribunal therefore, Adjudges, Awards, Orders and Directs that-
The United Republic of Tanzania shall:

Vv. Pay to the Claimant the sum of USD 185,449,440.04 together with interest thereon
at the rate of LIBOR (6-month) +2% from the 1 September 2018 until the date of full

and final payment; and

Vi. Bear its own legal costs and expenses.
