INTRODUCTION

The claimants in this arbitration are Sevilla Beheer B.V. (“Sevilla Beheer”) and Cordoba
Beheer B.V. (“Cordoba Beheer”), two private limited liability companies incorporated
under the laws of the Netherlands, as well as 57 Spanish companies listed at
paragraph 109 below and in Annex | to this Decision (the “Claimants”). The claimant
entities are ultimately controlled by a Dutch national, Mr. Reinier Bouman, the majority
owner of the Claimants and the CEO of Sevilla Beheer. The minority stake is held by his
daughter.

The respondent in this arbitration is the Kingdom of Spain (“Spain” or the

“Respondent”).

The Claimants and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the “Parties”; the names

of their representatives are set out on page vi above.

This arbitration concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement
of Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on the basis of the Energy Charter
Treaty (the “ECT”) and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes
between States and Nationals of Other States (the “ICSID Convention”). The ECT
entered into force for the Netherlands and Spain on 16 April 1998. The ICSID Convention
entered into force on 14 October 1966 for the Netherlands, and on 17 September 1994 for

Spain.

In this matter, the Claimants allege that the Respondent’s legislative and regulatory
measures enacted in respect of the renewable energy (the “RE”) sector in Spain in 2010-
2014 and described in detail in Section III.C below (the “Disputed Measures”) violated
Article 10(1) of the ECT and caused damages to the Claimants’ investments in
photovoltaic (“PV”) plants. The Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction
over the present dispute and that in any event the Disputed Measures did not breach the

ECT.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 1 August 2016, ICSID received a request for arbitration from the Claimants (the

“Request”).

On 12 August 2016, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance
with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-
General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible
in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID’s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of

Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.

On 5 September 2016, the Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with
Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention as follows: the Tribunal would consist of three
arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party and the third, presiding arbitrator, to be

appointed by agreement of the Parties.!

On 20 September 2016, following appointment by the Claimants, Professor Rudolf

Dolzer, a national of Germany, accepted his appointment as arbitrator.

On 9 October 2016, following appointment by the Respondent, Professor Attila Tanzi, a

national of Italy, accepted his appointment as arbitrator.

On 25 November 2016, the Parties appointed Sir Franklin Berman as the presiding
arbitrator. On 28 November 2016, the Centre sought Sir Franklin Berman’s acceptance,
who declined on 29 November 2016. By letter of the same date, the Centre invited the

Parties to reach an agreement on another candidate.

On 9 December 2016, the Claimants requested that the Secretary-General of ICSID
appoint the presiding arbitrator pursuant to the Parties’ agreement of 5 September 2016.
The Respondent confirmed its agreement to this request by communication of the same

date.

' The Parties also agreed that the ICSID Secretary-General “shall make its appointment after having consulted
both parties under a ballot procedure with candidates who may be from outside the Panel of Arbitrators and shall

not be natio1

 

yf the Contracting State party to the dispute or of the Contracting State whose national is a party

to the dispute.”

13. On 11 January 2017, ICSID initiated the ballot selection process as requested by the
Parties in their communications of 9 December 2016 and as initially agreed in their

communications of 5 September 2016.

14. On 23 January 2017, ICSID confirmed receipt of the Parties’ completed ballot forms.
ICSID informed the Parties that the ballot process had not resulted in the selection of a
mutually agreeable candidate and that it would proceed to appoint the presiding arbitrator

in accordance with the Parties’ agreement.

15. On 26 January 2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID proposed to appoint Dr. Raéd M.
Fathallah, a national of Lebanon and Canada,’ as the presiding arbitrator, and invited the

Parties to submit any observations related to this proposal.

16. On 7 February 2017, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID
Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “Arbitration Rules”), notified the
Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was

therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date.

17. The Tribunal was composed of Dr. Raéd M. Fathallah, President, appointed by the
Secretary-General; Professor Rudolf Dolzer, appointed by the Claimants; and Professor
Attila Tanzi, appointed by the Respondent. Ms. Anneliese Fleckenstein, ICSID Legal

Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

18. On 4 April 2017, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first

session with the Parties by teleconference.

19. Following the first session, on 12 April 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order
No. 1 (“PO1”) recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters and the
decision of the Tribunal on disputed issues. PO1 provides, inter alia, that the applicable
Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, that the procedural

languages would be English and Spanish, and that the place of proceeding would be

? Subsequently to his appointment as the President of the Tribunal, Dr. Raéd M. Fathallah acquired French
nationality of which the Parties were duly notified.

together with the witness statements of Mr. Reiner Bouman and Ms. Yolanda Paniego;
the expert reports of Mr. Pablo T. Spiller (Compass Lexecon) and Mr. Carlos Solé Martin

On 24 November 2017, the Respondent filed a Counter-Memorial on the Merits and a
Memorial on Jurisdiction (the “Counter-Memorial”) together with a witness statement
of Mr. Carlos Montoya; the expert report of Dr. Daniel Flores (Econ One Research, Inc.);
Exhibits R-1 through R-231; and Legal Authorities RL-1 through RL-65.

On 9 February 2018, and pursuant to the procedural calendar, the Parties filed a joint

request for the Tribunal to decide on production of documents.

On 2 March 2018, the Tribunal issued a decision on the Parties’ request for production of

documents of 9 February 2018.

On 13 June 2018, the Centre informed the Tribunal and the Parties that Mr. Marco Tulio
Montafiés-Rumayor, ICSID Counsel, had been appointed as Secretary of the Tribunal in

replacement of Ms. Anneliese Fleckenstein.

On 12 July 2018, the Claimants filed a Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on
Jurisdiction (the “Reply”), together with Appendices 1 through 5; the second witness
statements of Mr. Reiner Bouman and Ms. Yolanda Paniego; rebuttal expert reports of

On 5 November 2018, the European Commission (the “EC” or the “Commission’) filed
an application for leave to intervene as a non-disputing party pursuant to Arbitration Rule

37(2) (the “EC Application”).

On 9 November 2018, the Tribunal invited the Parties to make simultaneous submissions

regarding the EC Application by 26 November 2018.
On 26 November 2018, each Party filed observations on the EC Application.

On 13 December 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 (“PO2”) concerning
the EC Application. In PO2, the Tribunal held as follows:

The Commission’s Application is granted in part;

The Commission is granted leave to participate in the present arbitration as a
non-disputing party, subject to the requirement that the Commission provide
within a week from the issuance of this Order a written undertaking stating
that the Commission undertakes to bear the costs arising from its intervention
in ICSID Case No. ARB/16/27 (Sevilla Beheer B.V. and others v. Kingdom of
Spain), including its own costs as well as reasonable institutional and Tribunal
costs, as determined by the Tribunal at a later stage;

Thereafter, the Commission is invited to submit a single, written submission
of no more than ten (10) pages on the two issues set out in its Application by
4 January 2019;

Thereafter, the Parties are invited to submit their written observations on the
Commission’s written submission within four weeks of the Commission’s
filing;

The Commission’s request to access documents filed in these proceedings is
denied; and

The Commission’s request for leave to attend the hearing in this case and
make oral argument and answer questions by the Tribunal is denied.

On 19 December 2018, the Claimants filed a Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (the “Rejoinder
on Jurisdiction”), together with Appendices 1 and 2; Exhibits C-252 and C-253; and
Legal Authorities CL-164 through CL-174.

On 20 December 2018, the EC filed a request to alter PO2 (the “EC Request for
Reconsideration”) to remove the condition of providing the cost undertaking for
institutional and Tribunal costs. Alternatively, the Commission requested that the EC

Application be added to the record if the Tribunal were to decide not to alter PO2.

On 21 December 2019, the Tribunal invited the Parties to comment on the EC Request

for Reconsideration.

On 27 December 2018, both Parties filed observations on the EC Request for

Reconsideration.

On 3 January 2019, the Tribunal issued its decision on the EC Request for
Reconsideration, concluding as follows:

[...] the Tribunal has decided to maintain the relevant language in paragraph

24(2) of Procedural Order No. 2 which provides that the Commission is

granted leave to participate in the present arbitration as a non-disputing party,

subject to the requirement that the Commission provide a written undertaking

stating that the Commission undertakes to bear the costs arising from its

intervention in ICSID Case No. ARB/16/27, namely its own costs as well as

reasonable institutional and Tribunal costs, as determined by the Tribunal at a
later stage (the “Cost-Undertaking”).

LJ

Regarding the European Commission’s request that its Application to
intervene as non-disputing party dated 29 October 2018 be added to the
record of this case in the event its Request were rejected (set forth at paragraph
42 of the Request), the Tribunal defers its decision until after 7 January 2019.

On 4 January 2019, the EC informed the Tribunal that it was not in a position to comply
with the cost undertaking and hence, would not file its amicus curiae submission.

However, it requested that the Tribunal maintain the EC Application on the record.

On 8 January 2019, the Tribunal held that “given that the Tribunal has already reviewed...
the [EC Application], as well as the Parties’ comments thereon, the Tribunal decides that

the... [EC Application] is included in the record of the present proceedings.”

On 25 January 2019, the Respondent requested the Tribunal’s leave to file a new legal
authority, namely the Declaration of the Representatives of the Governments of the
Member States, of 15 January 2019 on the legal consequences of the judgment of the
Court of Justice in Achmea and on Investment Protection in the European Union
(the “Declaration of 22 EU Member States on Achmea”). On the same date, the
Tribunal invited the Claimants to submit any comments they may wish to make on the

Respondent’s request.

On 30 January 2019, the Claimants confirmed that they did not oppose the Respondent’s
request of 25 January 2019. Additionally, they requested the Tribunal’s leave to introduce
into the record three new legal authorities, namely: (i) the Declaration of the
Representatives of the Governments of the Member States, of 16 January 2019, on the
enforcement of the Judgment of the Court of Justice in Achmea and on investment
protection in the European Union (the “Declaration of Finland, Luxembourg, Malta,
Slovenia and Sweden on Achmea’’); (ii) the Declaration of the Representative of the
Government of Hungary, of 16 January 2019, on the legal consequences of the Judgment
of the Court of Justice in Achmea and on investment protection in the European Union
(the “Hungary Achmea Declaration”); and (iii) the amicus curiae brief submitted by
MOL Hungarian Oil and Gas PLC in enforcement proceedings before the US courts (the
“MOL Brief”)?

On 1 February 2019, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on the Claimants’
request of 30 January 2019 by 6 February 2019.

On 6 February 2019, the Respondent confirmed that it did not oppose the Claimants’

requests (i) and (ii) above. However, it objected to request (iii), i.e., the MOL Brief.

On 14 February 2019, the Tribunal granted all of the Parties’ requests of
25 and 30 January 2019 and invited the Parties to file a 5-page simultaneous submission

on the relevance of the recently admitted legal authorities by 22 February 2019.

On 15 February 2019, the Parties agreed to the appointment of Ms. Maria Kiskachi as

Assistant to the Tribunal.

On 18 February 2019, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the

Parties by telephone conference.

3 The Declaration of 22 Member States on Achmea, the Declaration of Finland, Luxembourg, Malta, Slovenia and
Sweden on Achmea and the Hungary Achmea Declaration are collectively referred to as the “January 2019 Achmea
Declarations”.

On 21 February 2019, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that one of its witnesses,
Mr. Carlos Montoya, would not be able to attend the forthcoming hearing on jurisdiction

and the merits scheduled on 18-22 March 2019 (the “Hearing”).

On 22 February 2019, the Parties submitted comments on the relevance of the January

2019 Achmea Declarations and the MOL Brief.*

On 25 February 2019, the Claimants requested the Tribunal to strike Mr. Montoya’s two
witness statements and the exhibits cited therein from the record pursuant to Section 19.3

of POL.

On 26 February 2019, the Tribunal invited Spain to reply to the Claimants’ request of 25
February 2019, by 28 February 2019.

On 28 February 2019, the Respondent objected to the Claimants’ request of 25 February
2019 because of the following reasons. First, Section 19.3 of PO 1 referred to disregard,
not to “strike from the record”. Second, Mr. Montoya’s decision not to attend the Hearing
was “only to be attributed to the witness; the Respondent holds as much interest as the
Claimants in Mr. Montoya’s examination.” Third, when Spain asked Mr. Montoya for an
explanation, it was told that Mr. Montoya was “not in disposition to participate in the
arbitration proceeding due to personal and work reasons.” Finally, Spain argued that if
the Tribunal were to disregard the witness statements, Mr. Montoya’s exhibits should be

kept on the record.

On 4 March 2019, the Tribunal transmitted to the Parties for their comments Procedural

Order No. 3 in draft form (“Draft PO3”) regarding the organization of the Hearing.

On 5 March 2019, the Tribunal invited the Claimants to comment on the Respondent’s

letter of 28 February 2019 by 6 March 2019.

+ Respondent’s Comments on (i) the declarations of the representatives of the governments of the European Union
Member States with regard to the Judgment of the European Union Court of Justice in Achmea and on investment
protection in the European Union and (ii) on the brief of MOL Hungarian Oil and Gas PLC as amicus curiae,
22 February 2019 (the “Respondent’s Comments on the January 2019 Declarations and the MOL Brief”);
Claimants’ comments on the declarations of the EU Member States on the consequences of the Achmea Judgment
and the MOL Brief (the “Claimants’ Comments on the January 2019 Declarations and the MOL Brief”).

On 6 March 2019, the Claimants replied to the Respondent’s communication of
28 February 2019, reiterating their request to strike Mr. Montoya’s witness statements
and exhibits from the record because of the following reasons. First, pursuant to Section
19.3 of POI and Article 4.7 of the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence, witness
statements are to be disregarded where a witness fails to appear for cross-examination
absent a valid reason. Second, Spain did not provide a “valid” reason for Mr. Montoya’s
failure to attend the Hearing, merely asserting that there were “personal and work
reasons” underlying his refusal to appear, without specifying what those reasons were.
Third, Spain sought to create “a formalistic distinction between disregarding a witness
statement and striking it from the record.” Finally, Spain’s request to
disregard Mr. Montoya’s witness statements but not the accompanying exhibits, which
did not qualify as “witness statement” as such was “overly formalistic and lack[ed] any

merit.”

Also on 6 March 2019, the Parties agreed to extend by one day (i.e., until 7 March 2019)
the deadlines in Draft PO3 to (i) indicate to the Tribunal whether they objected to any of
the documents proposed by the other Party and the reason for their objection; and

(ii) explain the relevance of the documents objected to the other Party.

On 6 March 2019, the Claimants identified eleven documents that they intended to

introduce as new exhibits pursuant to Section 16.7 of POI and Section L of Draft PO3.

On 7 March 2019, the Respondent objected to seven documents from the Claimants’
request of 6 March 2019. On the same date, the Claimants submitted an explanation of

the relevance of the seven objected documents.

On 10 March 2019, the Tribunal dismissed the Claimants’ request to strike from the
record Mr. Montoya’s witness statements and exhibits cited therewith. Having noted the
Claimants’ concerns related to Mr. Montoya’s non-appearance, the Tribunal nonetheless
observed that cross-examination was not the only means to test written witness testimony,
especially in view of the fact that Mr. Montoya testified on the content and evolution of
Spain’s regulatory framework for RE producers. The Tribunal further emphasized its
power to determine the evidentiary value of testimony which has not been tested on cross-
examination. Therefore, the Tribunal decided that it was impracticable to disregard

Mr. Montoya’s witness statements, but that in the assessment of the probative value of

57.

58.

59.

60.

61.

62.

said witness statements, the Tribunal would take into account that Mr. Montoya was not
available for cross-examination. For the same reasons, the Tribunal also decided not to
disregard the exhibits accompanying Mr. Montoya’s witness statements. The Tribunal
additionally noted that it would be unduly formalistic to strike the remaining Montoya-
exhibits from the record given that Spain would have previously been able to introduce
them with its written submissions (with or without a witness statement) or could

potentially still apply to introduce them in the course of the proceedings.

On 11 March 2019, the Tribunal decided to grant the Claimants’ request of 6 March 2019
to enter eleven new documents into the records, subject to the respective conditions

stipulated by the Respondent.

Also on 11 March 2019, Spain requested to introduce into the record the Decision on
Responsibility and on the Principles of Quantum issued on 30 November 2018 in ICSID
Case No. ARB/13/30 RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Limited and RREEF Pan-European
Infrastructure Two Lux S.d.r.1 v. Kingdom of Spain (the “RREEF v. Spain Decision”). It
also clarified that it had proposed to the Claimants to introduce several exhibits and legal

authorities and that none of them were objected by the Claimants.

On 12 March 2019, the Claimants accepted Spain’s request to enter on the record the
RREEF vy. Spain Decision on the condition that the dissenting opinion of Professor Robert

Volterra was also included on the record.

On 12 March 2019, the Claimants submitted a communication to the Tribunal stating their
concern that the Tribunal’s decision regarding Mr. Montoya’s statement and exhibits
could give rise to a procedural inequality that could unduly prejudice the Claimants.
Therefore, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal grant an additional 15 minutes to
Mr. Carlos Solé, the Claimants’ regulatory expert, to address Mr. Montoya’s testimony

in his presentation.

On 15 March 2019, the Tribunal granted the Claimants’ request of 12 March 2019.
Accordingly, Mr. Carlos Solé was accorded an additional 15 minutes to address

Mr. Montoya’s testimony in his presentation at the Hearing.

On 16 March 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, regarding the
organization of the Hearing (“PO3”).

63.

64.

On 17 March 2019, the Tribunal decided to admit into the record the RREEF v. Spain
Decision, including Professor Volterra’s dissenting opinion. It also directed the Parties to
write jointly to the tribunal in the RREEF v. Spain proceeding to request leave for the said

decision and dissenting opinion to be submitted in this proceeding.

On 16 April 2019, the Tribunal confirmed that, as agreed by the Parties, the post-hearing
briefs should not exceed 50 pages and shall be filed simultaneously by
21 May 2019. The Tribunal also provided the Parties with a list of questions and invited
the Parties to address in their post-hearing briefs these questions and new case law that

may be relevant to the present case, including, as agreed, the RREEF. v. Spain Decision.

On 22 April 2019, the Parties submitted the agreed-upon corrections to the Hearing

transcript.

On 21 May 2019, the Parties filed simultaneous post-hearing briefs (the “Claimants’

Post-Hearing Brief” and “Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief”).

On 27 May 2019, the Parties confirmed their agreement to submit rebuttal post-hearing
briefs by 14 June 2019.

On 14 June 2019, the Parties filed simultaneously rebuttal post-hearing briefs (the
“Claimants’ Reply Post-Hearing Brief’ and “Respondent’s Second Post-Hearing
Brief”).

On 17 June 2019, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to remove from the
record several factual exhibits (C-267 and C-268) and legal authorities (CL-182 and CL-
183) submitted by the Claimants together with their Post-Hearing Briefs. The Respondent
argued that the submission of new exhibits and legal authorities had not been authorized
by the Tribunal and contradicted Section 17.4 of POI. Spain further contended that
pursuant to the Tribunal’s invitation to address in the Post-Hearing Briefs “new Spanish
case law” made at the end of the Hearing”, the Claimants were not allowed to introduce

case law that was not related to the Kingdom of Spain.

On 21 June 2019, the Claimants argued that the introduction of new authorities was
contemplated at the Hearing and referred to the exchange on “housekeeping matters”
between the Claimants’ counsel and the Tribunal.° The Claimants further contended that
Section 17.4 of PO! did not prohibit the Parties from filing additional documents, as long
as they were submitted together with, but not after, the last written submissions, which,

according to the Claimants, means post-hearing briefs.

On 27 June 2019, the Tribunal decided as follows regarding the Respondent’s request of
17 June 2019:

[T]he Tribunal denies the Respondent’s request to remove from the
record legal authorities CL-182 and CL-183. The Tribunal’s invitation to
address “new Spanish case law” was not intended to serve as a limitation on
the types of authorities that could be relied upon by the Parties in their Post-
Hearing Briefs. Moreover, the possibility to submit additional legal authorities
was secured by the Claimants’ counsel at the end of the Hearing on
Jurisdiction and the Merits [Hearing Tr., Day 5, 158:1-16] and was not
challenged by the Respondent.

The Tribunal however grants the Respondent’s request to remove from the
record the two new factual exhibits (C-267 and C-268). The Tribunal is not of
the view that the reference to “the last written submissions” in Section 17.4 of
Procedural Order No. 1 was intended to address post-hearing briefs or allow
the submission of additional evidence with the post-hearing briefs. Indeed, it
is common practice that post-hearing briefs should not serve as an opportunity
for the Parties to introduce new evidence. As the Tribunal stated at the hearing:
“the post-hearing memorial is also for you to put forward whatever you wish,
in terms of making use of what has been said and established during the
hearing, by way of cross-examination and by way of advocacy.” [Hearing Tr.,
Day 5, 160:5-10] The Tribunal’s invitation to utilize post-hearing briefs as the

5 Hearing Tr., Day 5, 22 March 2019, 163:12-20 (President).
° Hearing Tr., Day 5, 22 March 2019, 158:1-6 (Stoyanov/President).

13

Parties deem fit, made in the letter dated 16 April 2019, concerned the post-
hearing briefs’ organization and structure as well as the choice of issues to be
addressed in addition to answering the questions put by the Tribunal.

The Tribunal thus decides to remove exhibits C-267 and C-268 from the
record of these proceedings.

73. On 31 July 2019, the Parties filed their cost statements.
74. On 2 August 2019, Spain requested leave to comment on the Claimants’ cost statement.

75. On 8 August 2019, the Tribunal invited the Parties to briefly comment on each other’s

cost statements by 16 August 2019.
76. On 16 August 2019, the Parties filed their rebuttal cost submissions.

77. On 4 December 2019, Spain requested leave to introduce into the record the
award rendered in the ICSID Case No. ARB/15/1 Stadtwerke Miinchen GmbH, RWE
Innogy GmbH and Others v. Kingdom of Spain (the “Stadtwerke Miinchen v. Spain
Award”) and the Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Directions on Quantum issued
in the ICSID Case No. ARB/15/16 BayWa R.E. Renewable Energy GmbH and BayWa
R.E. Asset Holding GmbH v. Kingdom of Spain (the “BayWa v. Spain Decision”).

78. On5 December 2019, the Tribunal invited the Claimants to comment on the Respondent’s

request of 4 December 2019.

79. On 6 December 2019, the Claimants opposed the Respondent’s request to submit
additional legal authorities. In the alternative, the Claimants requested leave to also

submit additional legal authorities.”

On 10 December 2019, the Tribunal decided to admit all of the additional legal

authorities, as requested by both Parties, to the record of these proceedings.

On 15 February 2020, the Claimants requested that a new legal authority, namely the
award rendered in the ICSID Case No. ARB/15/44 Watkins Holding S.a.r.l. and others v.
Kingdom of Spain (the “Watkins v. Spain Award”) be admitted into the record of these

proceedings.

On 27 February 2020, in light of the Parties’ respective observations, the Tribunal decided
to admit into the record the Watkins v. Spain Award, together with the dissenting opinion

of Professor Dr. Héléne Ruiz Fabri.

On 5 March 2020, the Respondent requested that a new legal authority be admitted into
the record of these proceedings, namely the award rendered on 28 February 2020 in the
UNCITRAL Arbitration PCA Case No. 2012-14 The PV Investors v. Kingdom of Spain
(the “The PV Investors v. Spain Award”).

On 12 March 2020, the Claimants confirmed that they did not object to the Respondent’s
request, provided that the dissenting opinion of the Honorable Charles N. Brower would

also be admitted into the record.

On 25 March 2020, the Tribunal decided to admit to the record the The PV Investors v.

Spain Award, as well as the dissenting opinion of the Honorable Charles N. Brower.

On 8 April 2020, following the passing away of arbitrator Rudolf Dolzer, the Secretary-
General notified the Parties of the vacancy on the Tribunal and the proceeding was

suspended pursuant to Arbitration Rule 10(2).

On 7 May 2020, the Tribunal was reconstituted as follows: Dr. Raéd Fathallah, President

of the Arbitral Tribunal, appointed by the Secretary-General; Professor Peter D. Cameron,

Decision on the “Intra-EU” Jurisdictional Objection dated 25 February 2019 rendered in Landesbank Baden-
Wiirttemberg et al. v. Kingdom of Spain (ICSID Case No. ARB/15/45); the Dissenting Opinion of Dr Horacio A.
Grigera Na6n to the BayWa Decision; and the Dissenting Opinion of Prof. Kaj Hobér to the Stadtwerke Miinchen
Award.

appointed by the Claimants; and Professor Attila Tanzi, appointed by the Respondent.

The proceeding was resumed pursuant to Arbitration Rule 12.

On 12 May 2020, the Respondent stated that it “would like to respectfully suggest the
possibility of holding a short supplementary hearing once Professor Cameron has had the
opportunity to review the Parties’ written submissions” in order to “allow the newly
appointed Arbitrator to address any issues that he could not raise during the oral phase of
these proceedings and at the same time contribute to finalize the Tribunal’s deliberation

process.”

On 18 May 2020, the Claimants opposed the Respondent’s suggestion on the grounds
that: (i) as a general rule, the proceedings must be resumed immediately after the filling
of the vacancy on the Tribunal; (ii) it is a “discretionary right” of the new arbitrator alone
to require that the oral procedure be recommenced pursuant to Arbitration Rule 12; and

that (iii) holding a supplementary hearing would be wasteful and inefficient.

On 22 May 2020, the Tribunal directed the Parties to prepare a joint electronic bundle of
the case file to be uploaded to ICSID’s file sharing platform and also sent by courier to

Professor Cameron in a USB drive.

On 11 June 2020, the Claimants confirmed that the joint electronic bundle had been

uploaded to ICSID’s platform and sent to Professor Cameron.

On 30 July 2020, the Tribunal informed the Parties that Professor Cameron “has had the
opportunity to familiarize himself with the record and decided not to require that the oral
procedure be recommenced. The Tribunal therefore decided that there will be no

recommencement of the oral procedure in this matter.”

On 22 March 2021, the Respondent requested leave to submit the following authorities
to the record: (i) the Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Directions on Quantum issued
on 31 August 2020 in Cavalum SGPS, S.A. v. the Kingdom of Spain, 1CSID Case No.
ARB/15/34 (the “Cavalum vy. Spain Decision’); (ii) the Award rendered on 8 March 2021
in FREIF Eurowind Holdings Ltd. v. the Kingdom of Spain, SCC Case V 2017/060 (the
“FREIF Eurowind Award’), and (iii) the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability issued
on 17 March 2021 in Eurus Energy Holdings Corporation v. Kingdom of Spain, 1CSID
Case No. ARB/16/4 (the “Eurus Energy v. Spain Decision”).

On 29 March 2021, the Claimants objected to the Respondent’s request to submit the
above new legal authorities. Firstly, the Claimants argued that there were no exceptional
circumstances that would justify adding these new authorities to the record. Secondly, the
Claimants contended that Spain’s argument that these new legal authorities evidenced the
“consistency of the new approach adopted by Arbitral Tribunals” was a misrepresentation
of the current status relevant jurisprudence. Thirdly, the Claimants submitted that
“continuing to allow the submission of additional authorities would only disrupt the
proceedings and cause additional delays and costs.” Finally, the Claimants observed that
the Respondent’s request was in breach of paragraph 17.4.1 of PO1 because, inter alia, it
set out a summary of each of the authorities Spain sought to add to the record, with explicit

mention to the tribunals’ main conclusions and reasoning.

On 30 March 2021, the Tribunal decided to admit all of the new legal authorities
referenced in the Respondent’s 22 March 2021 letter, together with any dissenting or
separate opinions into the record, noting that these new arbitral decisions were widely
commented, publicly available documents. Having agreed with the Claimants that the
Respondent’s request to submit new authorities was made at a very advanced stage of the
proceedings, the Tribunal nevertheless considered that the admission of these publicly
available documents did not create any prejudice to the Claimants and would not affect

the prompt resolution of the Parties’ dispute.

On 9 September 2021, the Respondent requested leave to submit a new legal authority to
the record, namely the Judgment of the Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice of the
European Union, issued on 2 September 2021 in the Case C-741/19 Republic of Moldova
v. Komstroy (the “Komstroy Judgment”). The Respondent argued that the Komstroy
Judgment was “a landmark ruling that the investor-state arbitration clause in the Energy
Charter Treaty does not cover intra-EU investment disputes” such as the present one. On
this basis, the Respondent asserted that in view of these “exceptional circumstances” the

Komstroy Judgment must be admitted into the record pursuant to Section 17.4 of POI.

On 20 September 2021, the Claimants objected to the Respondent’s request of
9 September 2021 because of the following reasons. First, the Claimants argued that there
were no exceptional circumstances under PO1 that would justify adding this authority to
the record. In their view, EU law (including the Komstroy Judgment) was not relevant to

the question of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. Second, the request was made “very late” in

17

98.

99.

100.

101.

102.

103.

104.

the proceeding and continuing to allow the submission of additional authorities would
only “disrupt the proceedings.” Third, the Respondent breached Section 17.4.1 of POI

because its letter contained a summary of the Komstroy Judgment.

On 22 September 2021, the Tribunal decided to admit the Komstroy Judgment into the
record because it was available publicly and its admission would not cause any prejudice

to the Claimants.

On 23 September 2021, the Respondent requested leave to submit a new legal authority
to the record, namely the Decision issued on 13 September 2021 in ICSID Case No.
ARB/16/18 Infracapital F1 S.A.R.L. et al v. Kingdom of Spain (the “Infracapital v. Spain

Decision”).

On 29 September 2021, the Claimants objected to Spain’s request arguing that there were

“no ‘exceptional circumstances’” that justified adding the Infracapital v. Spain Decision
onto the record. The Claimants argued that “new decisions and awards in ECT cases
against Spain see light on a regular basis.” Moreover, “should the Tribunal rely on the
Komstroy Judgment to uphold Spain's intra-EU objection [...] the Claimants will suffer

prejudice” and that “this outcome would be in breach of the Claimants’ right to be heard.”

On 4 October 2021, the Tribunal decided to admit the /nfracapital v. Spain Decision to
the record because it was a publicly available document. The Tribunal also concluded
that:
[...] for the sake of good order and with a view to providing both Parties the full
opportunity to be heard, the Tribunal has decided to invite the Parties to comment on
both, the Komstroy Judgment and Infracapital Decision. Being mindful of the very
advanced stage of these proceedings, the Parties’ positions regarding these two new
legal authorities shall be presented in the following manner: the Respondent shall

present its comments on the Komstroy Judgment and Infracapital Decision by
8 October 2021 and the Claimants shall respond by 15 October 2021.

On 8 October 2021, the Respondent submitted its comments on the Komstroy Judgment

and the Infracapital v. Spain Decision.

On 15 October 2021, the Claimants submitted their reply comments on the

Komstroy Judgment and the Infracapital v. Spain Decision.

On the same day, the President of the Tribunal informed the Parties that he had recently

acquired French nationality, in addition to his Canadian and Lebanese nationalities.

18

105. The Tribunal has deliberated by various means of communication, including numerous
exchanges in writing, as well as virtual meetings held on 20 May 2020, 22 October 2020,
19 November 2020 and 14 April 2021. The Tribunal has taken into account all of the

pleadings, documents and testimony submitted in this case.

Il. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

106. This section summarizes the facts that are largely uncontested, including the description
of the Claimants’ investment process, the evolution of the regulatory framework under
which the Claimants made their investments in Spain and the Disputed Measures. The
aim of the summary below is not to give an exhaustive account of all the factual and
regulatory developments presented by the Parties in the course of these proceedings, but

to set the context for the Tribunal’s subsequent analysis.

A. Overview of the Claimants and their investments

1. The structure of the Claimants’ investments

107. Sevilla Beheer and Cordoba Beheer are private liability companies established under the
laws of the Netherlands® which fully own Cross Retail S.L. (“Cross Retail”), a company

incorporated in Spain.”

108. Cross Retail and Sevilla Beheer also fully own 56 Spanish limited liability companies

(the “Spanish Project Companies”).'°

The Claimants are controlled by a Dutch national, Mr. Reinier Bouman, who is the

majority owner of the Claimant entities and a CEO of Sevilla Beheer.'?

Mr. Bouman explains in his Second Witness Statement that he took all of the investment

decisions for the Claimant entities, which were used as investment vehicles. !>

The Tribunal understands that none of the above-mentioned facts regarding the identity
of the Claimants, their structure, and their control by Mr. Bouman has been contested by

the Respondent.

As further described at paragraphs 127-132 and 214-216, 226, 241 below, through
Ra Solar, Cross Retail and the Spanish Project Companies Mr. Bouman acquired interests
in the following five PV plants between 2007 and 2010: Mahora PV, Villar de Cafias PV,
Ronda PV, Matapozuelos PV, and Fuentes de Afio PV (the “PV Plants”), which had a
total installed capacity of approximately 8.8 megawatts (“MW”).'4

take measures in preparation of the financing and construction of the PV Plants, such as
the incorporation of Cross Retail and the Spanish Project Companies.'> It was
Cross Retail, which between 2006 and 2010 entered into agreements with Engineering
Procurement and Construction (EPC) contractors who, according to the Claimants, were
in charge of leasing the relevant parcels of land, obtaining the relevant permits and
administrative authorizations and constructing the PV Plants.!° In parallel, Ra Solar (as
defined below) oversaw the development and the commissioning of the PV Plants.!’ Ra
Solar was also a part of the Asociacién de la Industria Fotovoltaica

(the Photovoltaic Industry Association or “ASIF”).'®

The Claimants’ decision to invest in Spain

According to Mr. Bouman’s First Witness Statement, he began investigating the
possibility of investing in the solar energy sector in different countries in February 2005.!°
Specifically, these countries included Germany and Spain.?? For that purpose
Mr. Bouman hired an advisor, Mr. Edwin Koot, whom he considered a specialist in solar
energy.”! Mr. Bouman explains that he instructed Mr. Koot to compare the options of a

solar investment in Germany with one in Spain.??

According to Mr. Bouman, “{iJn
analyzing the Spanish option, Edwin provided me with a report confirming that the

Spanish [Feed-in Tariff or the “FiT”] scheme was specifically designed to attract

investors and stimulate, among others, the PV solar energy market, which was ‘still in its

infancy’.”>

This “report” mentioned by Mr. Bouman, is a document dated January 2005 and prepared
by one of Mr. Koot’s consultancy companies, Solar Plaza

(the “2005 Solar Plaza Report”).

In its introduction, the 2005 Solar Plaza Report lays out the information on which it was

based:

The report content is based on intensive research of a number of sources:

documents discovered on the Internet (most are in Spanish), general literature

about the country, PV and market developments and information provided by

several Spanish PV companies. These sources have provided SolarPlaza with

information on import market trends and market volume forecasts.4
In his First Witness Statement, Mr. Bouman notes that the 2005 Solar Plaza Report stated
that under Royal Decree 436/2004 (“RD 436/2004”) the FiT was guaranteed for the
lifetime of a PV installation and was subject to a 20% decrease only after the first 25 years

of operation.?> As further explained by Mr. Bouman, “with this in mind, I decided to
gauge the financial market for PV investment in Spain.””°
The passage from the 2005 Solar Plaza Report on which Mr. Bouman relies reads in full

as follows:

The feed-in tariff is highly generous for the following reasons:

- The feed-in tariff is guaranteed for the lifetime of the PV-system. This is
unique in the world. The tariff remains constant for 25 years after which it is
only reduced by 20 per cent.

- The rates are high for systems up to 100 kWp. This feed-in tariff, together
with the high insolation in most of the Spanish regions means that a PV system
is almost registering a profit for Spanish investors from day one.

- The feed-in tariff has no constraints with respect to grants obtained for the
system.

The only problem with the current feed-in tariff seems to be the presence of a
ceiling at 150 MWp and 200 MWp for systems up to 100 kW respectively
larger systems th[a]n 100 kWp. This could result in the dramatic interruption
of the rapid PV market development as the ceiling is approached. It is difficult
to predict when this will happen because the ceiling could itself be one of the
reasons for a slowdown in market growth.””

120. In its conclusions, the 2005 Solar Plaza Report contains the following observation:

The new national State financial incentive provided by IDAE is expected to
be published in March 2005. So far few changes are expected to the
regulations of last year. This together with the stable political situation will
create healthy conditions for further market growth. There is still much
uncertainty concerning the regional (investment) subsidies for 2005. So far
there is nothing to indicate a movement in direction of structural cooperation
and tuning. This situation can serve to feed the Spanish PV paradox: a
worldwide unbeaten attractive feed-in tariff structure but a market
development hindered by (budget) limited national and regional grant and
loans programs.”*

121. The 2005 Solar Plaza Report also states that “[t]he Spanish Solar Industry Association

ASIF (Asociacién de la Industria Fotovoltaica) plays an important role in the market

development and already represents 112 PV companies in Spain.”??

122. In November 2005, Mr. Bouman participated in a business tour to Spain organized by
Solar Plaza.*? During the tour, Mr. Bouman attended a presentation at the Instituto para
la Diversificaci6én y Ahorro de la Energia (the Institute for Energy Diversification and
Savings or the “IDAE”), an advisory body within the Spanish Government.*! According

to Mr. Bouman, the presentation focused on promoting RE investments in Spain and

presented “the Government’s plans for the PV sector.”**

As stated by Mr. Bouman, IDAE’s message at the time was clear: the FiT would be
guaranteed for the entire operational lifetime of a PV plant, with no limits on production.*?
The business tour also involved a presentation on certain technical aspects by the Centro
de Investigaciones Energéticas, Medioambientales y Tecnolégicas — the Center for

Energy, Environmental and Technological Research (the “CIEMAT”).**

During one of the networking events of the business tour, Mr. Bouman met a Dutch
couple — Mrs. Linda and Mr. Bart Goossens — who operated a small solar company in
Madrid called “Natec Energy Espafia” (“Natec”).** After a number of discussions about
the Spanish PV market, the Goossens proposed Mr. Bouman to make an investment in a
2.8 MW PV Plant in the province of Albacete.*® The Goossens’ proposal was formalized
in a “Proposal for a Photovoltaic Plant, Executive Summary”, a document of 11 pages

(including annexes), dated December 2005 (the “Natec Proposal”).*”

The Natec Proposal, in a section named “Legislation”, states the following:

LEGISLATION

Spanish Legislation [...]

- Law 54/1997 of the electric sector.

It is established that renewable sources of energy will receive a premium
(prima) over the electric tarif[f] with the aim of promoting a reasonable
rentability.

Up to date of methodology. It determines that instal[l]ations of solar
photovoltaic of no more than 100 kW will have a prima over the electric
tarif[f] (cost) established on 575% on the first 25 years from its starting point
and 460 % after.

National Energy Plan (Plan Energético Espafiol, PEN)

- The new energy plan was signed in September this year and raised the targets
for photovoltaic this year from 150 [MW] to 400 [MW] until 2010.**

126. As recalled by Mr. Bouman, the Natec Proposal referred to projected profit and loss

accounts for 25 years.*?

127. Sometime between the end of 2005 and early 2006, having studied the Natec Proposal,
“and in reliance on the predictability of the future revenues of the project”, Mr. Bouman
purchased a 75% stake in Natec which was subsequently renamed Ra Solar Systems &

Solutions Espaiia S.L. (“Ra Solar”).”°

128. According to Mr. Bouman, the Goossens became his “people on the ground”.*!
As Mr. Bouman explains, Ra Solar also instructed an external lawyer, Mr. Richard Wicke
(of Dikeos Abogados Law firm), who provided advice on regulatory aspects relating to
investments in the PV farms contemplated by Mr. Bouman.*? One of the reports prepared
by Dikeos Abogados with respect to the Ronda PV farm, dated 28 April 2009, contained
the following conclusion: “[t]here are no reasons to doubt the definitive character of the

allocation of [the FiT] throughout the whole lifespan of the Project.”

38 Natec Energy Espajia, Business Plan 2006, PV Proposal, December 2005 (C-36), p. 5. In its introduction, the
Natec Proposal also noted: “[t]his project arises from the opportunity brought up by the [Royal Decree] 436/2004,
12th March that states that anyone interested can become a producer of electricity from the solar energy.” Ibid.,

129. According to the Claimants, the original financing of the construction was provided by
Mr. Bouman himself.4+ Specifically, between 2007 and 2010, Mr. Bouman invested
EUR 56.6 million in the construction of five PV plants.*> Bank financing (up to 80%, via
loans to the Spanish Project Companies) was obtained from Triodos Bank“ only after the
construction phase in order to exclude additional financing costs that would have been
borne by the Claimants due to construction risk and in order to ensure that the PV Plants
could be commissioned as rapidly as possible.*” Triodos Bank was advised on certain

legal matters related to the Claimants’ projects by Gomez-Acebo & Pombo.**

130. Mr. Bouman emphasizes that he decided to develop the PV Plants through the companies
he controlled (i.e., Sevilla Beheer, Cross Retail and Ra Solar) instead of acquiring already
operational plants,’ and then caused the Spanish Project Companies to purchase the
PV Plants with the aid of bank loans. To that end, Cross Retail entered into Engineering,
Procurement and Construction (“EPC”) contracts to build the individual PV

installations.*° Ra Solar supplied the PV panels and other equipment for the construction

2007, Ra Solar hired a project manager, Ms. Yolanda Paniego,* in order to make sure

that all of the Claimants’ PV projects were executed according to plan.**

131. In 2007-2010, following their construction, Cross Retail sold the PV Plants to the 56
Spanish Project Companies.*> Cross Retail retained less than 1% in each of the Spanish

Project Companies and the remaining shares were held by Sevilla Beheer.*°

134. As of the date of this Decision, the Claimants still own and operate all of the above-listed

PV Plants.”

135. The Respondent does not contest the facts related to the making and development of the
Claimants’ investments in Spain (other than the reasonableness of the Claimants’ alleged
investment costs; see paragraphs 964-972 below). The Respondent however argues that
the Claimants’ decision to invest in the first PV Plant was not taken under the legal regime
created by RD 661/2007 (as defined below), but under the previous legal regime put in
place by RD 439/2004 (as defined below).

136. Moreover, the Respondent challenges the Claimants’ assertion that the legal advice
provided by Mr. Wicke and the due diligence reports prepared by Ramén y Cajal and
Gémez-Acebo & Pombo for third parties were sufficient for the purposes of meeting the

investor’s obligation to perform due diligence.*!

137. The following section describes, amongst others, the measures adopted by Spain in 2010-
2014 and challenged by the Claimants in these proceedings. According to the Claimants,
the main adverse effect of the measures was that they deprived the PV plants of the FiT
and limited the remuneration to which the investors were entitled to a “reasonable return”

calculated by reference to a “standard installation.” A detailed discussion of the economic

impact of the Disputed Measures on the Claimants’ investments is set out at Section

VIILA. below.

The regulatory framework at the time of the Claimants’ investments

General remarks

. Asa preliminary matter, the Tribunal deems it important to set out the sources of Spanish

law and their respective positions in the hierarchy of norms. Though such legal
framework has been the object of several awards in recent times, some of which will be
referred to below, the Tribunal deems that its function as an adjudicative body requires it
to “make its own determination of the facts and then apply the relevant rules of
international law to the facts which it has found to have existed”, irrespective of findings

of fact and related to the determination of law made by other tribunals.

The Spanish Constitution of 1978 is the supreme law of Spain and the Spanish
Constitutional Court is its supreme interpreter.© Subordinate to the Constitution are

legislative acts, which themselves supersede regulatory acts.

There are two types of legislative acts: (i) organic laws governing such matters as, inter
alia, human rights and freedoms and general electoral regimen (their adoption requires
an absolute majority of the votes of the Congress of Deputies); and (ii) ordinary laws
regulating all other matters not reserved for the organic acts; their adoption requires a
simple majority of the Congress of Deputies. In addition, Royal Decree-Laws (“RDLs”)
which can only be adopted by the Government in cases of extraordinary need or urgency

1,05

have the force of a legislative ac However, their validity requires subsequent

parliamentary validation.©

Royal Decrees (“RDs”), which are hierarchically subordinate to legislative acts, are
adopted by the Government for purposes of supplementation and implementation of
legislative acts.®’ Further subordinate regulatory acts include ministerial orders and

resolutions.

According to Spain, a Royal Decree can only regulate matters within the authorization
granted by a law and cannot supersede or infringe the provisions set out in a law. Spain
further explains that the principle of hierarchy of norms implies that Royal Decrees (as
any regulatory act) cannot contradict the provisions of a hierarchically superior law and
that no regulatory provision may impede regulatory changes aimed at fulfilling a mandate

set forth in a legislative act.”

Further, as a Member State of the European Union (the “EU”) since 1986, Spain is bound
by the EU primary legislation, i.e., the treaties and notably the Treaty on the Functioning
of the European Union (the “TFEU”), as well as EU secondary legislation such as

regulations and directives and, to the extent they are addressed to Spain, decisions.”!

In addition, according to the Respondent, the Supreme Court’s application and

interpretation of Spanish law is binding on all other courts and the administration.”

The Parties appear to agree on the existence of the principle of the hierarchy of norms
under Spanish law.”> However, as discussed below, the Parties disagree as to the

consequences that flow from this principle in the case at hand.

According to the Respondent, Royal Decrees (including those on which the Claimants
allegedly relied when making their decision in invest in Spain, i.e., RD 436/2004,
RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008, as defined below) must be interpreted within the
confines of Law 54/1997 on electric power (“Law 54/1997”), which, under the

Respondent’s case, “has always established that the aim of [a] Royal Decree could never
include a stabilization commitment”.” It is for this reason, the Respondent argues, that
investors in the RE sector were, in 2007, requesting that the premiums for RE producers

be regulated by means of a legislative rather than an executive act.’

147. The Respondent further argues that the execution of certain legislative acts, such as
Law 54/1997 required the Government to develop a detailed plan in order to assess,

amongst others, the costs imposed by the roll-out of renewable energies.”° These plans

were generally referred to as “renewable energy plans.””’

148. According to the Claimants, the principle of hierarchy of norms does not preclude Royal
Decrees (including RD 436/2004, RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008, as defined below)
from defining what constitutes a “reasonable return” referred to under Law 54/1997 and

from “grandfathering” a commitment towards investors.”

149. The Claimants also challenge the weight attached by the Respondent to the Spanish
renewable energy plans. According to the Claimants, such plans constitute “advisory

document[s] drafted by IDAE”, which cannot be characterized as “regulatory

instrument[s]”, and shall be considered as devoid of “any legal or regulatory force.”””

150. The Parties further disagree about the legal effect, if any, ascribed to the press releases
issued by the Council of Ministers as well as reports, studies and presentations prepared
by various administrative authorities, including the Ministry of Industry, Trade and

Tourism, the Secretary of State for Energy, the National Energy Commission

Law 54/1997, RD 2818/1998, and the 2000-2010 PER

Law 54/1997

In November 1997, Spain enacted Law 54/1997, the primary aim of which was to

liberalize the Spanish electricity market.*”

The promotion of renewable energies was another crucial goal of Law 54/1997. For that
purpose, Law 54/1997 established two separate legal regimes for electricity generation,
“ordinary” and “special”. The so-called “Ordinary Regime” governed the generation of
electricity from non-renewable energy sources, which was remunerated based on market

prices.*!

By contrast, the “Special Regime” applied to facilities with an installed capacity of no
greater than 50 MW that use, inter alia, renewable energy sources, such as, for example,

solar energy.*”

Renewable energy generators under the Special Regime were entitled to specific
additional rights, such as, for example, the priority of access to the transmission and

distribution networks.*?

The remuneration of electricity generation under the Special Regime was governed by
Articles 16 and 30(3)/30(4) of Law 54/1997. Article 16(1) provided for the principle of
remuneration on the basis of market prices. Article 16(7) further specified that in addition

to a remuneration under Article 16(1), the remuneration for electricity generated under

the Special Regime shall “where applicable, [include] a premium that will be determined

by the Government [...] as set out in article 30.4.”
156. Article 30, sub-paragraphs (3) and (4) provided in relevant part as follows:

3. The remuneration arrangements for electric power generation installations
under the special regime shall satisfy the stipulations of point | of article 16
for electric power generators.

4. The remuneration arrangements for electric power generation installations
operating under the special regime shall be supplemented by the payment of a
premium under statutory terms set out in regulations [...].

To work out the premiums, the voltage level on delivery of the power to the
network, the effective contribution to environmental improvement, to primary
energy saving and energy efficiency, the generation of economically
justifiable useful heat and the investment costs incurred shall all be taken into
account so as to achieve reasonable profitability rates with reference to the
cost of money on capital markets.**

157. Both legal regimes required the prior registration with the Administrative Register of
Electricity Generation Installations (the “RAIPRE”*°) created by Law 54/1997.87
According to the Respondent, this registry would “allow the government to control the

tariffs and premiums” and “to keep track of the evolution of the electrical energy

produced, the energy transferred to the network and the primary energy used.”**

158. In addition, the Twenty-fifth additional provision to Law 54/1997 recalled the objectives

to “be taken into consideration when setting the premiums” for PV installations:

The Government shall modify the [PER] in order to adapt it to the objectives
established by the European Union of 20% by 2020 and shall maintain the

Plan’s commitment to 12% by 2010. These objectives shall be taken into
consideration when setting the premiums for these types of installations.*?

159. Law 54/1997 further provided that until the adoption of implementing regulations, a
number of transitory provisions would continue to apply.°° Amongst them was the
Sixteenth transitional provision, which read as follows:

In order for renewable energy sources to cover at least 12% of Spain’s total
energy demand by the year 2010, a plan shall be drawn up to promote

renewable energies and whose objectives shall be taken into account in the
setting of premiums.”!

160. According to the Claimants, Law 54/1997 is a “framework law” that leaves it to the
Government to determine the specific premiums which must ensure, but may not
necessarily be limited to a reasonable return (Article 30(4) of Law 54/1997).°? On the
Claimants’ case, Spain was thus free to commit to grant investors a more favorable
entitlement by means of a Royal Decree. The Claimants moreover state that Law 54/1997
does not define the proxy it uses for the cost of money on capital markets referred to in

Article 30(4).23

161.

According to the Respondent, Law 54/1997 must be read against the background of two
principles, i.e. (i) that the supply of electricity is a service of strategic importance and
(ii) that guaranteeing the supply of electricity requires the financial sustainability of the
Spanish electricity system (the “SES”).* Such sustainability, according to the
Respondent, rests on the financial self-sufficiency of the SES. On the Respondent’s
case, the sustainability of the SES, which is also recognized in Law 54/1997, would be

jeopardized if hierarchically inferior acts such as Royal Decrees were able to commit to

b. RD 2818/1998

162. On 23 December 1998, Spain passed Royal Decree 2818/1998 “regarding production of
electric energy for facilities supplied by renewable, waste and cogeneration resources or

sources of energy” (“RD 2818/1998”).
163. In its preamble, RD 2818/1998 noted that:

This Royal Decree develops [Law 54/1997] [...], and promotes the
development of special plan facilities by creating a new supportive framework
without entering into discriminatory practices that could be limiting to a free
market; although establishing differentiating situations for those energy
systems that are highly effective in contributing to the aforementioned
objectives.

To achieve that goal, a system of temporary incentive is set up for those
facilities that require them to put themselves in a competitive position in an
open market.

For facilities based on renewable energies and wastes, there is no time limit
for incentives established given the need to internalize its environmental
benefits and to which, because of its special characteristics and level of
technology, its high costs prohibit them from competing in an open market.

The incentives established for renewable energies are such as to contribute
12% to Spain’s energy demand in 2010, as is established in the 16th transitory
provision of [Law 54/1997].°”

164. In addition to providing detailed rules regarding the registration of electricity generating
installations and the conditions of delivery of electricity under the Special Regime,
RD 2818/1998 set forth the economic regime applicable to installations falling under the
Special Regime. Article 23 of RD 2818/1998 notably recognized the right of owners of
installations generating electricity of 50 MW or lower from renewable energies and
finally registered in the RAIPRE to “sell their surplus or, if applicable, their electrical

production, to distributors at the final average price for electric power, plus any premiums

or incentives based on the amounts indicated in [Chapter IV ‘Economic Regime’].”**

Article 28 of RD 2818/1998 allowed such installations to choose between either a feed-
in premium on the market price or a fixed regulated feed-in tariff (the FiT).” Article 32
of RD 2818/1998 provided that premiums would be revised every four years, taking into
account the evolution of the electricity market price, the qualifying installations’ demand

coverage and their impact on the technical management of the SES.!°°

The 2000-2010 PER

On 30 December 1999, the Council of Ministers approved the 2000-2010 Plan for the
Promotion of Renewable Energies that had been elaborated by the IDAE
(the “2000-2010 PER”), in accordance with the Sixteenth Transitory Provision of
Law 54/1997.10!

The 2000-2010 PER, inter alia, proposed basic financial and technical conditions as well
as a methodology for a remuneration scheme for RE producers to be developed through

regulations.
As regards the methodology used, the 2000-2010 PER explained that:

Based on the proposed energy objectives, the financing needs for each
technology have been determined based on their profitability, defining a range
of standard projects for the calculation model. These standard projects have
been characterized by technical parameters related to their size, equivalent
operating hours, unit costs, implementation periods, useful life, operation and
maintenance costs and sales prices per final energy unit. Likewise, financing
assumptions and a series of financial measures or aid have been applied.'°?

Spain’s initiatives to promote RE were undertaken in a broader context of
intergovernmental efforts to tackle climate change that resulted in the adoption of the
1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 1997 Kyoto
Protocol. The EU was also receptive to the environmental concerns and adopted in 1997
a White Paper for a Community Strategy and Action Plan entitled “Energy for the future:
renewable sources of energy”.!*

On 27 September 2001, the European Parliament and Council passed Directive
2001/77/EC on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in
the internal electricity market (“Directive 2001/77/EC”) that mandated EU Member
States to “take appropriate steps to encourage greater consumption of electricity produced
from renewable energy sources in conformity with the national indicative targets”.!°°

3. RD 436/2004 and the beginning of the Claimants’ investment process

a. RD 436/2004
i. RD 436/2004: Preparation and most relevant provisions

171. On 22 January 2004, prior to adopting RD 436/2004, the CNE issued a report on a draft
text of RD 436/2004. The report observed, inter alia, as follows:

The production facilities included in the special regime have the right to
receive a certain remuneration for energy sold, but logically they only have
the acquired right to receive said remuneration with respect to the energy
already sold, but not regarding the energy they forecast selling in the future,
which only constitutes an expectation.'”

172. Prior to the issuance of RD 436/2004, the Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Tourism
prepared an economic memorandum. With respect to the determination of a reasonable

rate of return, the economic memorandum provided as follows:

Parameter A (the investment, operating and maintenance costs of each
technology) is heavily weighted in setting the amount of the regulated tariff
for sale to the distributor. Thus, any plant of the special scheme installed in
Spain, as long as it is equal to or better (than the standard plant of its group),
will succeed in earning reasonable profitability.!°°

173. As regards project financing, the same economic memorandum observed that:

Project financing: in all cases, 100% of the financing is assumed to have been
through equity capital. Leveraging and the percentage between equity capital
and external funds are specific decisions to each project and each promoter. If
made wisely, they should provide better ratios than those estimated here.!°

174. On 12 March 2004, the Spanish Government adopted RD 436/2004, which replaced
RD 2818/1998.!1°

RD 436/2004 was based on a new methodology to calculate the Tarifa Eléctrica Media
(the average or reference electricity tariff or the “TMR”), which had been introduced by
Royal Decree 1432/2002, on the methodology of the average reference tariff, of
27 December 2002 (“RD 1432/2002”).!!!

The TMR determined the sale price of electricity to consumers. It was to be set annually

by the Government and published in advance. The TMR was to be based on estimated

113

consumer demand!" and costs to remunerate projected electricity supply! as well as

inflation and cost of capital.!!+

According to Mr. Bouman, RD 436/2004 was the first regulation he relied on when

making his decision to invest in the Spanish PV sector.!!>

In its preamble, RD 436/2004 affirmed the pursuit of “the dual goal of protecting the

environment and guaranteeing quality electricity supply for all consumers which is the

premise underlying [Law 54/1997].”!'¢

The preamble of RD 436/2004 further provided that:

From the perspective of remuneration, the salient characteristic of electricity
production as an activity covered under the special regime is that its
remuneration arrangements can be supplemented by the payment of a
premium under the statutory terms and conditions set out in regulations. This
premium is to be determined by taking into account factors such as the voltage
level for delivery of the power to the network, the effective contribution made
to environmental improvements, to primary energy saving and any investment
costs incurred.'!”

180. The preamble further stated that the operators of qualified installations could opt for either
a wholesale-market price with a premium or a regulated tariff “taking into account the

criteria mentioned in article 30.4 of [Law 54/1997]”.!'® It further observed:

Whichever remuneration mechanism is chosen, the Royal Decree guarantees
operators of special regime installations fair remuneration for their
investments and an equally fair allocation to electricity consumers of the costs
that can be attributed to the electricity system although incentives are offered
for market participation.'!°

181. The preamble of RD 436/2004 also noted that “the security and stability offered by this

new methodology to calculate the special regime remuneration should help it to foster

investment in this kind of plants.”!?°

182. The purposes of RD 436/2004 were set out in its Article 1. One of the declared purposes

was to:

[e]stablish a lasting economic regime for the plants eligible to be under the
special regime, based on an objective, transparent methodology to calculate
the remuneration that is compatible with the methodology to approve or
amend the average electricity or reference tariff regulated by Royal Decree
1432/2002."*!

at a particular rate for the first 25 years from the installation’s commissioning and at a

reduced rate thereafter.'?*

184. Article 40(1) of RD 436/2004 envisaged that tariffs and other incentives would be revised

every four years starting from 2006:

During 2006, in light of the result of the follow-up reports on the level of
compliance with the Renewable Energies Development Plan, the tariffs,
premiums, incentives and supplements defined in this Royal Decree will be
revised, thereby considering the costs associated with each of these

In respect of the temporal application of such revisions, Article 40(3) of RD 436/2004

stated as follows:

The tariffs, premiums, incentives and supplements resulting from any of the

revisions provided for in this section shall apply solely to the plants that

commence operating subsequent to the date of the entry into force referred to

in the paragraph above and shall not have a backdated effect on any previous

tariffs and premiums.!?5
On 19 April 2004, the Asociacién de Productores de Energias Renovables
(the Association of Renewable Energy Producers or “APPA”) published an analysis of
RD 436/2004.!"6 Among the advantages of RD 436/2004, APPA mentioned Article 40:
“Art. 40. Revisions at previously established time intervals, period for applying them and

no retroactivity.”!?7

At the same time, APPA was concerned with the “retroactive” application of the Decree
to existing facilities: “[d]eadlines starting from ‘commissioning’ instead of after the date

of entry into force of the Decree.”!”8

190. The Claimants also submitted a report of the CNE, dated 14 February 2007 containing
the following statements regarding the alleged stability and predictability of the regime
implemented through RD 436/2004:

b) Regulatory stability

The production facilities in the special regime capital-intensive and have long
recovery periods. Royal Decree 436/2004 minimises the regulatory risk by
granting stability and predictability to the economic incentives during the
service life of the facilities. This is done by establishing a transparent annual
adjustment mechanism, associating incentives to trends in a robust index such
as the average or reference tariff (TMR), and by exempting existing facilities
from the four-year review because only new incentives affect new facilities.

The developers who have invested in special regime production facilities
during the validity of Royal Decree 436/2004 have done so in stable regulatory
conditions, fundamentally based on a secure and predictable regulated tariff
during the entire service life of the facility. The guarantees covered in Royal
Decree 436/2004 have allowed cheaper financing, with lower project costs
and a lower impact on the electricity tariff ultimately paid by the consumer.'*°

(b) The Respondent

191. The Respondent argues that Article 40(3) of RD 436/2004 is not a “stabilization
commitment”, because it does not apply to “any” revisions of the tariffs, premiums, and
incentives, but only to those “provided for in [Article 40(1)]” of the Decree.'*! This,

according to the Respondent, is apparent from the reference in the discussed provision to

>> 132

“the revisions provided for in this section As the Respondent further explains, the

revisions envisaged in Article 40 have the limited aim of ensuring the renewable energy
promotion plan’s goals.'** Thus, any other revisions are not prevented by Article 40(3)

and are permissible pursuant to the principle of hierarchy of laws.'*+

development of electricity generated by photovoltaic installations had been limited by
some economic, technological, legislative and social barriers.'** According to the 2005-

2010 PER, one economic barrier consisted in the fact that:

With the prices and the yield in force until now, the facilities are amortized
over long time periods. For this reason, the photovoltaic energy has been
developed in association with aid schemes, both by the Autonomous Regions
as well with state funds.

At present, it is considered that the market growth is going to enable a
progressive lowering of the prices of the facilities, such that if the premium is
maintained on the conditions defined in Royal Decree 436/2004, the facilities
can be improving their profitability.'*°

The 2005-2010 PER further identified a legislative barrier, namely the fact that
RD 436/2004 “established a limit of 135 MW, which implies a very clear limitation on

the development of the photovoltaic industry.”!#°

Amongst the measures suggested for overcoming the aforementioned barriers, the 2005-

2010 PER noted the following, amongst others:

Maintenance of the economic conditions established in [RD 436/2004]

[1

Modification of the criteria for aid. With the level of return via the current
premium, it is considered that, except in cases of isolated facilities of the
network, the aid is not necessary.

LJ

Realization of promotional campaigns aimed at society in general.'4!

Thus, the 2005-2010 PER recommended to maintain the existing guarantees and to

increase Spain’s PV installed capacity by an additional 363 MW.!*?

Among one of its technical and financial assumptions, the 2005-2010 PER listed a return
on a standard project “calculated on the basis of maintaining an Internal Rate of Return
(IRR), measured in legal tender and for each standard project, around 7%, on equity

(before financing) and after taxes.”!4

The Claimants rely on the 2005-2010 PER for the proposition that the Spanish “PV sector
was not developing at a sufficient pace” and that “RD 436/2004 offered PV investors an

‘insufficient return.””!4

The Claimants however argue that the 2005-2010 PER, as such, did not form part of the
regulatory framework but was merely a plan,'#> and that neither RD 661/2007, nor

RD 1578/2008 were based directly on the 2005-2010 PER.'*°

The Respondent argues that “in general, the 2005-2010 PER envisaged that the 2000-
2010 PER subsidies set out in RD 436/2004 would be maintained.”!“7

The Respondent also suggests that “there is a clear relationship between [Law 54/1997],
the [2005-2010 PER] and Royal Decree 661/2007” and that the Claimants’ argument that
there is no reference to the 2000-2010 PER in Law 54/1997 is incorrect.'*8 According to
the Respondent, the Twenty-fifth additional provision to Law 54/1997 “establishes that
the Renewable Energy Plan has to define [...] installation types [...] used to determines
the tariffs and premiums of Royal Decree 661/2007,” and that the 2000-2010 PER had
the same relationship with RD 436/2004.'*?

In October 2005, ASIF issued a report on the development of photovoltaic energy in Spain
(the “October 2005 ASIF Report”).!°° With respect to the regulation of PV

development, the report noted the following:

An important change has occurred in photovoltaic development in Spain with
the approval of RD 436/2004, which has had a wide-ranging and varied
impact on the sector.

In terms of the economic impact, we could say that, before the decree,
photovoltaic facility owners in Spain had no legal certainty of receiving a
premium per photovoltaic kWh fed into the grid during the years needed to
secure a return on investment. The market needed large subsidies to counter

this uncertainty, subsidies that limited the market to the few MW per year for
which there was support.

RD 436/2004 has given the majority of investors the certainty of receiving a
reasonable rate of return. In 2005, alongside a general interest in this
technology thanks to its environmental suitability, simplicity and reliability.
This contributed to an increase in the number of projects and in the average
size of PV facilities, with a higher average than the 3 kW of only two or three
years before.

The facilities created in 2004 are estimated at a little over 10 MW. In 2005,
this volume will be greatly surpassed, if we take into account the large number
of projects being started and the numerous requests for connection points to
the distribution network.

This new context of greater dynamism and larger volumes has led to a drop in
prices, compensating for the price increase of some of the system components,
as is the case with the abovementioned photovoltaic modules.'*!

considered to be ten years or, taking another investment analysis parameter

The 2005 Supreme Court Judgment

On 15 December 2005, the Spanish Supreme Court issued a judgment concerning an
appeal brought by the Asociacién de pequefios productores y autogeneradores de

autogenerators of electricity with renewable energy sources) against RD 436/2004

(the “2005 Supreme Court Judgment”). Amongst other arguments, the claimants

contended that RD 436/2004 did not set forth any mechanism to update the “fixed tariff”
pricing option (i.e., one of the two pricing options provided for under RD 2818/1998).
The claimants in that case further argued that RD 436/2004 provided for stricter technical
requirements than RD 2818/1998, which applied not merely to new, but also to existing

PV installations.'!**

206. Relying on an earlier judgment dated 5 July 2005, the Supreme Court provided the
following analysis of the normative relationship between RD 2818/1998, RD 436/2004
and Law 54/1997:

[...] the right to the annual update of the premium of the facilities under the
special regime does not arise directly from the Law of the Electric Sector,
since its article 30 is to be subjected to Government’s power of determination,
attributes a margin of freedom within the parameters in that precept
established, in order at the time of its application, and even its subsequent
modification. There is, therefore, no imperative mandate of the legislator
regarding the periodicity of the update, but simply an authorization to the
holder of the Executive Power for the determination of the right to the
premium, an authorization that positively reflects through Royal Decree
2818/98. Given the normative range of this Royal Decree, nothing prevents
another standard of the same hierarchical level from modifying it. This does
not preclude that the latter has the category of basic in accordance with its
First Final Provision, since this character does not make it intangible to its
subsequent alteration, when operating the basics in the relationship
State/Autonomous Communities, but not in what concerns the system of
hierarchy of sources within the state system.'*°

207. With respect to the imposition of more restrictive technical requirements by

RD 436/2004, the Supreme Court held that:

There is no legal obstacle that exists to prevent the Government, in the
exercise of the regulatory powers and of the broad entitlements it has in a
strongly regulated issue such as electricity, from modifying a specific system
of remuneration, provided that it remains within the framework of
[Law 54/1997].!°

published an article titled “An integrated assessment of the feed-in tariff system in Spain”,
which conducted a quantitative analysis regarding FiTs in Spain for the period 1999-2003

and identified a number of “risks” relating to the Spanish PV sector:

4.9. Uncertainty for investors

Factors at different institutional levels affect risk and uncertainty for investors
which, in turn, influence the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a RES-E
promotion scheme. The [FiT] under RD2818 combines both risky and security
elements.

Security for the investor depends on the existence of an institutional
commitment to RES-E deployment. This was the case in Spain where, at least
since 1994, RES-E promotion has been a major policy priority. This is a
necessary albeit not a sufficient condition, however. Policy makers have to
give real signs of their commitment. The backing of the [FiT] system by policy
makers and its certainty for the investor in Spain.

Changes in the level of support are another factor affecting investors’ risk.
This has been a negative aspect of the [FiT] under RD2818. Annual revisions
of the support granted have not been based on a transparent objective formula
and have been deemed unpredictable and arbitrary. Investors ignored the level
of support in the next years and even in the following year, and no price floor
was set.'°

RDL 7/2006: Public criticism

In reaction to RDL 7/2006, on 26 July 2006, several associations in the Spanish RE
sector, including APPA and ASIF, addressed a joint letter to the Ministry of Industry,

Trade and Tourism, which stated:

[The undersigned] business associations can only express their rejection, their
deepest discontent and their utmost concern about the substance and the form
in which this process is being carried out.

RDL 7/2006 breaches substantially the regulation of renewable energies
established by [Law 54/1997], which was the product of a consensus between
all political parties and a model for the rest of the world, not only for being
the most effective, but also the cheapest for consumers.

RDL 7/2006 abolishes the objective parameters that established minimum
remuneration for the different renewable energies collected by said Law.
These minimums were the guarantee of stability, predictability and durability

precisely the special regime FiT. So as you can imagine, the higher the installed capacity of renewable energy, the
higher the cost of the special regime; and as a result, the higher the TMR. Likewise, the higher the TMR would

This situation, already [...] is further aggravated when there is knowledge that
the planned revision of Royal Decree 436/2004 is becoming the birth of a new
regulatory framework - in which none of the signatory associations has been
able to take part before it will be made public through the CNE - whose
remuneration criteria are manifestly and objectively discouraging to
encourage the development of planned projects with the Renewable Energy
Plan 2005-2010 (PER), approved by the Council of Ministers on August 25,
2005.

This way of proceeding would provoke an adverse generalized reaction of the
investments and the financial entities of very difficult rectification, which can
lead to the deactivation of the renewable energy sector and to the breach of
the planning objectives foreseen in the Sectorial Law. It is necessary to
remember that the companies that are members of the sector are disbursing
the almost 25,000 million euros that PER requires for its execution, and that
the amortization of this important invention requires more than 10 years ina
stable, predictable and sufficient regulatory environment. '”

224. At the end of July 2006, APPA published a note criticizing RDL 7/2006 in the following

terms:

The RD-L 7/2006 came to light in a manner reminiscent of days gone by -
with obscurity and premeditation - without prior consultation with the agents
involved, backtracking on reiterated words and changing the rules of play
while the game is underway. With retroactivity, acquired rights have been
amended.

What is more, after passing the RD-L 7/2006, the sector was told that the
reform of the Royal Decree 436/2004 - the benchmark legislation for
renewable energy in Spain, the reformed version of which should have been
in effect two years ago and is urgently required for some renewable
technologies - is to become the new regulatory framework, which bears little
resemblance to the original regulation. To top it off, it was announced that the
economic actors, those who will be affected by the new regulatory framework,
are excluded from the drafting process. Because that is just the way it is.!7”

claimants had argued that RD 2351/2004 had altered the legal regime for calculating the
premiums under the Special Regime by modifying the methodology for revising
premiums in the future and by raising the minimum capacity requirement set forth in
RD 436/2004 from 10 MW to 15 MW, and that this violated the legitimate expectations
based on which they had made their investments.'** The Supreme Court rejected the

appeal, holding that:

[E]lectricity producers under the special regime do [not] have an ‘unalterable
right’ to remain in an unchanged economic regime governing the collection of
premiums. The scheme is, in fact, to encourage the use of renewable energy
through an incentive mechanism, like all of this genre, and cannot be
guaranteed to remain unchanged in the future.

It is true that in this case the setting of premiums is subject to certain normative
standards, as stated above, but is also so that the Council of Ministers may,
respecting them, introduce quantitative variations in the formulas by which
the premiums are from time to time adjusted, or in the calculation of them. If
the change has not deviated from these legal guidelines and, again, there is no
allegation of infringement of Article 30 of [Law 54/1997], it can hardly be
considered unlawful.

LJ

Until it is replaced by another, the above outlined legal regulation (Article 30
of [Law 54/1997]) allows the respective companies to expect that the fixing
of the premiums can be included as a factor relevant to their obtaining
‘reasonable rates of return with reference the cost of money in the capital
market’ [...]. However the payment regime under examination does not
guarantee to special regime electricity producers that a certain level of profits
or revenues will be unchanged relative to those obtained in previous years, or
that the formulas for fixing the premiums will stay unchanged.'**

228. The Parties disagree as to the relevance of this Judgment.

229. According to the Respondent, this Judgment is part of a string of well-established case
law confirming that Royal Decrees did not guarantee a specific return and that the only
limit for any regulatory change is the principle of reasonable return enshrined in
Article 30 of Law 54/1997.'* This, the Respondent argues, must be considered part of

the Spanish legal system, which must serve as the benchmark for assessing the Claimants’

claim of legitimate expectations.'** Referring to later judgments of the Spanish Supreme
Court, the Respondent also argues that the concept of reasonable return is “dynamic”, i.e.,
“[d]epending on the change of financial circumstances and circumstances of other types,
a percentage of profitability could be ‘reasonable’ at that first moment and could require
subsequent adjustment to precisely maintain that ‘reasonableness’ due to the modification

of other financial or technical factors.”'**

According to the Claimants, the 25 October 2006 Judgment of the Spanish Supreme Court
is irrelevant for the purpose of assessing the Claimants’ expectations.'*’ The Claimants
also argue that neither the 2005 and 2006 Supreme Court Judgments, nor the two
subsequent judgments “could have enabled the Claimants to anticipate the Disputed
Measures.”!** The Claimants further argue that neither of these judgments provided any

interpretation of RD 436/2004 or RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 (as defined below).!*°

Parliamentary debates

On 26 October 2006, the Spanish Minister of Industry, Mr. Joan Clos i Matheu, addressed
the Spanish Senate on several topics. With respect to the remuneration of renewable

energies, he stated:

The Government’s first responsibility in this regard is to establish calmness
and perspective in the regulatory framework, and this is included in our
adherence to the key principles of the European regulatory framework. It is
important for all operators to receive this message and to be aware that our
road map entails adapting to this framework as quickly as possible, which
involves generating more market that we hope will be efficient, because it is
not always so, and obviously, the tariffs are not going to pay for anyone’s

party. Tariffs by law can only take into account energy costs, and shareholder
ventures are not energy costs.!°°

232. Mr. Clos i Matheu further noted that:

[T]here shall be no further criteria other than objective energy costs and,
obviously, the market price is not included; the stock market price is a mixture
of future remuneration expectations, etc. You may believe what you like
regarding the rational expectations or not, regarding the future of these
companies and their value, however the tariff framework will be strictly bound
to what the regulations state, that is to say, only the costs shall be taken into
account, and this shall be our principle of action.'*!

233. On 8 November 2006, the Secretary of Energy, Mr. Nieto Magaldi, addressed the
Spanish Congress of Deputies, stating specifically in relation to the remuneration of wind-

generated electricity:

The regulation of wind power in 2004 was rather unfortunate. In 2004, the
current Royal Decree, 436, established premiums based on market price
expectations. For example, for the wind power, the expectation of prices in
that year in the market was of 36 Euros/MW-hour and therefore a subsidy of
30 Euros was fixed, which with those 36, with 66 of total remuneration, it
recovered his investments. What has happened? That the price of market now
is of 55 or of 60 and the wind power has a total remuneration of almost 100
Euros/MW-hour. This remuneration has an IRR of around 20 percent. I
believe in renewable energies as much as anyone, but I also believe that we
have to do things reasonably. Technologies, that is my opinion, whose
investment is guaranteed through a premium—their risk is practically zero,
the only risk they have is the financial risk of debt in the project—they cannot
have returns of 20 per cent; nobody has those. Some speculators do have them.
We must be reasonable.”

6. RD 661/2007

a. RD 661/2007: Preparation

234. On 28 November 2006, the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism circulated a Proposal
of a Royal Decree “regulating the activity of electricity production under the Special
Regime, and specific installations of analogous technologies”, which ultimately would
become RD 661/2007 (as defined below) (the “Initial Draft RD 661/2007”). Article 40
of the Initial Draft RD 661/2007 dealt with the issue of tariff revisions in the following

manner:

3. In 2010, in view of the results of the monitoring reports on the degree of
compliance with the Renewable Energy Plan (PER) 2005-2010, of the
Strategy for Energy Saving and Efficiency in Spain (E4), and of the new
targets to be included in the next Renewable Energy Plan for the period 201 1-
2020, there will be a review of the tariffs, premiums, supplement and lower
and upper limits defined in this Royal Decree for implementation from
January 2011 onwards. This revision will take into account the costs
associated with each of these technologies, the degree of participation of the
special regime in covering demand and its impact on the technical and
economic management of the system. Every four years, a new revision will be
conducted.!**

235. The Initial Draft RD 661/2007 did not contain a provision exempting “tariffs, premiums,
incentives and supplements resulting from any of the revisions provided for in this

section” from revisions similar to Article 40(3) of RD 436/2004.'%4

236. On 19 January 2007, the Asociacién Empresarial Eélica (the Spanish Wind Energy
Association or “AEE”) published an article expressing the following criticisms of the

provision addressing revisions in the Initial Draft RD 661/2007:

The recent economic regulation (RD 437/2004) of these activities [RE
production] has established a scheme that gives more stability through an

Claimants’ Post-Hearing Brief, para. 109.

194 See Reply, para. 77, referring to Initial Draft of RD 661/2007, 29 November 2006, (C-158), Article 40(3),
which states as follows: “[i]n 2010, in view of the results of the monitoring reports on the degree of compliance
with the Renewable Energy Plan (PER) 2005-2010, of the Strategy for Energy Saving and Efficiency in Spain
(E4), and of the new targets to be included in the next Renewable Energy Plan for the period 2011-2020, there will
be a review of the tariffs, premiums, supplements and lower and upper limits defined in this Royal Decree for
implementation from January 2011 onwards. This revision will take into account the costs associated with each of
these technologies, the degree of participation of the special regime in covering demand and its impact on the

economic regime that is lasting, non-retroactive and predictable in its reviews.
[...] The proposal is puzzling as it even advocates amending it for facilities
already in operation and for investments in progress, while removing the right
to receive the remuneration established, recognised by the current regulation,
which would seriously affect the legal certainty and legitimate expectations
that were generated based on the sustainability that this regulation
guarantees.!°5

237. On 25 January 2007, the Ronda installations were initially registered by the Claimants
with the RAIPRE.'” The final registration occurred in September 2008.!”

238. On 14 February 2007, the CNE issued a report addressing the Initial Draft RD 661/2007
(“CNE Report 3/2007”) and containing the following statements:

The [CNE] understands that transparency and predictability in the future of
economic incentives reduces regulatory uncertainty, incentivizing
investments in new capacity and minimizing the cost of financing projects,
thus reducing the final cost to the consumer. The regulation must offer
sufficient guarantees to ensure that the economic incentives are stable and
predictable throughout the service life of the facility.

[...] although it is difficult to defend the petrification of regulations, it is
necessary to try to achieve sufficient legal certainty to counteract regulatory
uncertainty and risk as much as possible; only in this way can there be
sufficient investment.

[CNE’s] assessment of the proposed Royal Decree in terms of this criteria is
positive, given that, firstly, remuneration is substantially increased for
energies and technologies that are further away from the planning targets
(biomass, biodigestion biogas, photovoltaic and thermoelectric solar power,
and cogeneration). Secondly, the rates of return calculated for the regulated
tariffs for energies and technologies developed in recent years (wind,
photovoltaic, hydropower, landfill biogas and cogeneration with natural gas)
in general exceed 7 %.

[...] what the [CNE] proposes is regulatory stability to recover investments,
maintaining regulated tariffs during the service life of existing facilities (with
a transparent annual adjustment mechanism).'°*

At the same time, CNE Report 3/2007 also stated:

[...] the principle of legal certainty is not by definition an anti-evolutionary or
conservative principle; it does not mean that legislation is resistant or immune
to reform. In this sense, these principles do not impede dynamic innovation,
nor that new regulatory provisions be applied retroactively to existing
situations, but that they should continue upon entry into force of the new
regulations.'”

In preparing CNE Report 3/2007, the CNE referred to the 2006 Supreme Court Judgment

discussed above. As stated in the preliminary draft report:
[T]he recent Ruling of the Supreme Court dated 25 October 2006 is very
enlightening relating to the challenging to the Royal Decree 2351/2005 of
23 December. This particularly analyses the legal change that the afore-
mentioned Royal Decree makes to the system of calculating the bonuses
which encourage the production of electricity energy in the special regime. In
the ruling the High Court came to the conclusion that this modification does
not breach either the principle of legal certainty or of legitimate expectation.””

purpose of exploiting the Matapozuelos plant.?”!

On 19 March 2007, a new draft of RD 661/2007 (the “Second Draft RD 661/2007”) was

released by the Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Tourism.”

On 20 March 2007, the Spanish Supreme Court issued another judgment relating to a
modification of the transitory regime provided under RD 436/2004 (the “March 2007
Supreme Court Judgment”) and confirming the conclusions reached in the 2006
Supreme Court Judgment to the effect that there was no guarantee of intangibility of a
particular remuneration regime.2°> On 9 October 2007, the Spanish Supreme Court

similar reasoning (the “October 2007 Supreme Court Judgment”).?™

244. On 21 March 2007, the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism issued its Memoria
Econémica (economic report) for what would become the future RD 661/2007, stating,

inter alia, as follows:

The regulated tariff has been calculated in order to guarantee a return of 7-8%
depending on the technology. The premiums have been calculated by
following the criteria found in Royal Decree, i.e., the premium has been
calculated as the difference between the regulated tariff and the average
futures market price for these technologies.”°°

245. On 29 March 2007, the Solicitor General of the State (Abogado del Estado Jefe) issued a
legal report considering the proposed changes to the Special Regime.” Relying on the
jurisprudence of the Spanish Supreme and Constitutional Courts, this legal report noted
that the proposed reform could not be characterized as “retroactive”, as it was not

“intended to be a restriction of individual rights.”?°’ The legal report further elaborated:

[...] the so-called reform does not involve either the abolition of the promotion
measures, nor a total alteration of the special regime. The reform respects the
construction of the economic regime established in Royal Decree 436/2004.
Moreover, the reform is based on the need for stability of the system by
maintaining the premises that inspired its establishment and the need to ensure
a reasonable return to owners of the plants that benefit from the special
regime.”

[...] the modification of Royal Decree 436/2004 introduces reforms that,
going beyond a simple review of the premiums constitute an adaptation of the
plants covered by this regime to the current social and economic reality trying
to correct, update and complete the regulation for the promotion of renewable

implementation. For this reason, the intention of establishing a lasting
economic regime is reinforced with the modification and the anticipation of
reviews established in art. 40 and would not prevent the reform now being
undertaken. Therefore, an initial conclusion has been reached, which is that
even considering that the measure would have a certain retroactive nature, the
tule is not restrictive of individual rights [...?”

246. On 3 April 2007, APPA issued a public complaint about the Second Draft RD 661/2007:

Distrust in the new model

It is essential for the Government to respect the regime stipulated in
[RD 436/2004] for the facilities put into operation before 1 January 2009, also
from a second perspective.

LJ

If the Government fails to do so, it will no longer be credible in the future: any
rational investor, when planning facilities of this type, must bear in mind not
only the costs and the foreseeable remuneration, but it also must consider the
risk that such remuneration could be lowered; because, if the Government
does not respect now the compromise assumed in 2004, what investor could
discard that for example next year, the Government may lower again the
maximum and minimum limits of the remuneration for the facilities that may
join the market?

Could such investor in their forecasts rule out that the profit rates for their
facilities will not fall once the renewable energy plants are large enough??!°

247. On 9 April 2007, the Claimants established another 13 Spanish Project Companies for the

purposes of developing their PV Plants.7!!

248. On 8 May 2007, the Minister of Industry, Tourism and Trade addressed the Cortes
Generales (the Spanish Parliament) and made the following statement concerning the

adoption of the future RD 661/2007:

[...] the solution we are preparing is balanced and reasonable. In any case,
please know that what is driving me is nothing other than finding a balance
between promoting renewable energy and an electricity price that is well-
balanced. That is my only interest [...] With regards to regulatory stability,
believe me that I am doing it to protect the cost of the electricity bill and not
because of any other interests. given that we all pay for it, we have to decide
where to draw the line, and there's no need to stretch the gum out so far that it

breaks. I think that the premiums we are giving now and the regulatory
framework entail a very reasonable agreement. [...] we are talking about
premiums, the framework does not talk about anything other than premiums
and capital gains. I’s OK, I understand, it is reasonable for those receiving a
premium to want it to be high and last as long as possible, but we have to
balance things out a little and do it in the best possible way.7!”

249. On 25 May 2007, the Government adopted Royal Decree 661/2007 (“RD 661/2007”) to
supersede RD 436/2004.

250. The Parties disagree as to the significance of the replacement of RD 436/2004 by
RD 661/2007 in view of Article 40(3) of RD 436/2004.

251. The Respondent argues that Article 40(3) of RD 436/2004 did not prevent the
Government from replacing RD 436/2004 with RD 661/2007 that was applicable to
existing plants.?!>

252. The Claimants respond that there was no harm done to PV investors by passing from
RD 436/2004 to RD 661/2007, as further discussed below.?!* Consequently, the
differences in the wording between Article 40(3) of RD 436/2004 and the corresponding
provision in RD 661/2007, on which the Respondent relies, are devoid of relevance,
according to the Claimants.

253. The preamble of RD 661/2007 provided, inter alia, as follows:

Spanish society today, in the context of reducing dependence on foreign
energy, better use of available energy sources, and a greater awareness of the
environment, is increasingly demanding the employment of renewable
sources of energy and efficiency in the generation of electricity as basic
principles in the achi of inable devel from an i

of the promotion of renewable energy and combined heat and power are
covered in the Renewable Energy Plan 2005-2010 and in the Strategy for
Energy Saving and Efficiency in Spain (E4), respectively. In view of the
above, it can be seen that although the growth seen overall in the special
regime for electricity generation has been outstanding, in certain technologies
the targets posed are still far from being reached. [...]

In view of the behaviour of the prices in the market, where certain variables
which were not considered in the cited compensation system for the special
regime have, over recent times, acquired greater importance, the economic
circumstances established by Royal Decree 436/2004, of 12 March, make it
necessary to modify the compensation system and de-link it from the [TMR],
which has been used to date. [...]

The economic framework established in the present Royal Decree develops
the principles provided in Law 54/1997 [...] guaranteeing the owners of
facilities under the special regime a reasonable return on their investments

To this effect, a system which is analogous to that provided in Royal Decree
436/2004 [...] is maintained, in which the owner of the facility may opt to sell
their energy at a regulated tariff, which will be the same for all scheduling
periods or alternatively to sell this energy directly on the daily market, the
term market, or through a bilateral contract, in this case receiving the price
negotiated in the market plus a premium.

Furthermore, in order to safeguard the security and quality of the supply of
electricity in the system, and in order to minimise the restrictions on
production in those technologies which are today considered not manageable,
certain reference installed power targets are established which coincide with
the targets of the Renewable Energy Plan 2005-2010.7!5

254. Under RD 661/2007, photovoltaic installations were classified as “Group b.1” (“Facilities
which use solar energy as their primary energy”) and, within that group, as “Sub-

256. Contrary to RD 436/2004, which had defined the FiT with reference to the TMR (the
level of which was eventually fixed at a particular level by RDL 7/2006), RD 661/2007
defined the FiT as a specific income figure over a period of 25 years (subject to an
adjustment based on price inflation, as explained in the following paragraph). After the
first 25 years of operation of a PV facility, the FiT would decrease, as it follows from the

below table provided in Article 36 of RD 661/2007:7'*

257. As stated in its preamble, RD 661/2007 provided for a FiT adjustment formula that was

linked to the consumer price index (the “CPY”),7! and no longer to the TMR.

258. Article 17 of RD 661/2007 contained the following provision regarding the rights to RE

producers:

Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 30.2 of Law 54/1997, of 27
November, the proprietors of production facilities under the special regime
shall enjoy the following rights:

a) To connect their generating unit or units in parallel to the grid of the
distribution or transport company.

b) Transfer to the system their net production of electrical energy or energy
sold, by way of the distribution or transport company upon condition that it is
technically possible for it to be absorbed by the grid.

c) Receive, for the total or partial sale of their net electrical energy generated
under any of the options appearing in Article 24.1, the compensation provided
in the economic regime set out by this Royal Decree. The right to receive the
regulated tariff, or if appropriate the premium, shall be subject to final
registration of the facility in the Register of production facilities under the

28 RD 66 1/2007, 25 May 2007 (C-54)/(R-49), Article 36.

special regime of the General Directorate of Energy Policy and Mines [the
RAIPRE], prior to the final date set out in Article 22.

d) To sell all or part of their net production by way of direct lines.

e) To enjoy priority in access and connection to the electricity grid [...].?”°

259. RD 661/2007 increased the installed capacity target for PV installations from 150 MW to
371 MW.””! In view of this, RD 661/2007 provided that once 85% of such capacity was
reached, the government would establish a time limit (no earlier than 12 months after the
85% target was reached) for PV project entitlement to the incentives under the Decree

before a new regulation was passed (the so-called “Tariff Window”).

260. Moreover, Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 established the following rule concerning future

FiT revisions:

3. During the year 2010, on sight of the results of the monitoring reports on
the degree of fulfilment of [the 2005-2010 Renewable Energy Promotion
Plan], and of the Energy Efficiency and Savings Strategy in Spain (E4),
together with such new targets as may be included in the subsequent
Renewable Energies Plan 2011-2020, there shall be a review of the tariffs,
premiums, supplements and lower and upper limits defined in this Royal
Decree with regard to the costs associated with each of these technologies, the
degree of participation of the special regime in covering the demand and its
impact upon the technical and economic management of the system, and a
reasonable rate of profitability shall always be guaranteed with reference to
the cost of money in the capital markets. Subsequently a further review shall
be performed every four years, maintaining the same criteria as previously.

The revisions to the regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits indicated
in this paragraph shall not affect facilities for which the deed of
commissioning shall have been granted prior to 1 January of the second year
following the year in which the revision shall have been performed.”

261. On the same day, the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism issued a press-release

announcing the adoption of RD 661/2007:

The aim of this Royal Decree is to increase remuneration for facilities using
newer technologies, such as biomass and solar-thermal, in order to comply
with targets outlined under the Renewable Energies Plan 2005-2010 and those
agreed upon between Spain and the European Union. [...]

High power photovoltaic facilities will practically double their remuneration,
whereas that of smaller plants shall remain the same, with a guaranteed
profitability of 7% [...]

Tariffs shall be reviewed every 4 years, taking into account compliance with
the established targets. Such a revision shall allow for adjustments to be made
to the tariff in virtue of new costs and the level of compliance with the targets.
Future tariff revisions shall not be applied to existing facilities. This
guarantees legal certainty for the electricity producer and stability for the
sector, thereby favouring development. The new legislation shall not be
applied retroactively. Facilities with a start-up date prior to 1 January 2008
may operate under the previous framework in accordance with the fixed-tariff
option for the duration of the facility’s working life.?*

Textual comparison between Article 40(3) of RD 436/2004 and Article 44(3) of

RD 661/2007

262. In view of the importance attached by both Parties to the formulations of Article 40 of

RD 436/2004 and Article 44 of RD 661/2007, the Tribunal deems it useful to provide the

following textual comparison between the two provisions.

Article 40 of RD 436/2004

1. During 2006, in view of the findings of the
monitoring reports on the degree of performance
of the renewable energies promotion Plan, the
tariffs, premiums, incentives and supplements
defined in this Royal Decree shall undergo
revision. This shall bear in mind the costs
associated with each one of these technologies,
their degree of participation in the special regime
in demand coverage and their impact on the
technical and economic management of the
system. Every four years, starting from 2006, a
new revision shall take place.

Article 44 of RD 661/2007

1. The tariffs and premiums for Sub-Groups a.1.1
and a.1.2 shall undergo a quarterly update as a
function of the variations in the reference values of
the fuel price indices defined in Annex VII and the
national retail price index (RPI) for the same
period. Such updating shall be effected following
the procedure provided in Annex VII of this Royal
Decree.

Such facilities in Sub-Groups a.1.1 and a.1.2 as
have completed ten years of operation shall have a
correction for length of service in the updates in
respect of the subsequent years, in accordance with
the provisions of Section c) Annex VII.

Notwithstanding the above, such facilities as at
time of the entry into force of the present Royal
Decree are already in service shall not apply the
indicated correction for length of service until the
earlier of either the lapse of fifteen years since the
date of commissioning, or the lapse of ten years

provided for in this section shall come into force
on January Ist of the second year subsequent to
the year that the revision has been carried out.

3. The tariffs, premiums, incentives and
supplements resulting from any of the revisions
provided for in this section shall apply solely to
the plants that commence operating subsequent to
the date of the entry into force referred to in the
paragraph above and shall not have a backdated

since the entry into force of the present Royal
Decree.

For Sub-Groups a.2 and a.1.4, compensation shall
be updated on an annual basis as a function of the
change in the RPI and the price of coal,
respectively, in accordance with the provisions of
the cited Annex VII.

The values of the tariffs, premiums, supplements,
and lower and upper limits to the hourly price of
the market as defined in this Royal Decree, for
Category b) and Sub-Group a.1.3, shall be updated
on an annual basis using as a reference the increase
in the RPI less the value set out in the Additional
Provision One of the present Royal Decree.

The tariffs and premiums for facilities in Groups
c.1, c.2, and c.3 shall be maintained for a period of
fifteen years from the date of commissioning of the
facility, with those relating to Groups c.1 and c.3
being updated on an annual basis in reference to
the RPI, and those relating to Group c.2 being
updated in the same manner as co-generators in
Group a.1.2 for the range of power range between
10 and 25 MW fuelled by fuel oil. For facilities in
Group c.4, the tariffs and premiums shall be
updated on an annual basis, with reference to the
RPI and the change in the electricity market and
the price of coal in the international markets.

2. The values of the tariffs, premiums,
supplements and lower and upper limits to the
hourly price of the market which derive from any
of the updates covered in the preceding point shall
be applicable to all of the facilities in each group,
regardless of the date of commissioning of each
facility.

3. During the year 2010, on sight of the results of
the monitoring reports on the degree of fulfilment
of the Renewable Energies Plan (PER) 2005-2010,
and of the Energy Efficiency and Savings Strategy
in Spain (E4), together with such new targets as
may be included in the subsequent Renewable
Energies Plan 2011-2020, there shall be a review
of the tariffs, premiums, supplements and lower
and upper limits defined in this Royal Decree with
regard to the costs associated with each of these
technologies, the degree of participation of the

criteria as previously.

The revisions to the regulated tariff and the upper
and lower limits indicated in this paragraph shall
not affect facilities for which the deed of
commissioning shall have been granted prior to 1
January of the second year following the year in
which the revision shall have been performed.

4. The National Energy Commission is hereby
authorised to set out the definition of the
technologies and standard facilities, in a Circular,
and to gather information on the investments,
costs, revenues, and other parameters of the
various different actual facilities which make up
the standard technologies.

iii. Parties’ interpretations of Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007

According to the Claimants, this provision confirmed the right to a guaranteed FiT,

exempted from future revisions. Similarly to Article 40(3) of RD 436/2004, Article 44(3)

of RD 661/2007 guaranteed that future revisions of the FiT would only apply to new

facilities (“[t]he revisions to the regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits indicated

in this paragraph shall not affect facilities for which the deed of commissioning shall have

been granted prior to 1 January of the second year following the year in which the revision

shall have been performed”).?* In support of this interpretation, the Claimants refer to

the Memoria Econémica (economic report) issued by the Ministry of Industry, Trade, and

Tourism on 21 March 2007 (referred to above at paragraph 244), which according to the

Claimants indistinctly refers to “any” revisions of “regulated tariffs, premiums, [and]

supplements”:

Revisions to the tariffs, premiums, and supplements will be done in the

following manner:

In 2010, in light of the monitoring reports on the degree of compliance with
the Renewable Energy Plan (PER) 2005-2010 and the Spanish Strategy for

Electricity Savings and Efficiency (E4), as well as the new objectives that are
included in the following Renewable Energy Plan for the 2011-2020 period,
the tariffs, premiums, supplements, and upper and lower limits defined in this
Royal Decree will be revised, their application starting on | January 2011,
attending to the costs associated with each of these technologies, to the degree
of participation in the special regimen in the coverage of demand, and to their
incidence in the technical and economic management of the system. A new
revision will be carried out every four years from then.

The regulated tariffs, premiums, supplements, and limits derived from any of
these revisions will be applicable only to those facilities that have been
registered definitively in the [RAIPRE] after 1 January of the year following
the year in which the revision is made.?”°

264. The Claimants further refer to CNE Report 3/2007 on the Initial Draft RD 661/2007,
where the CNE proposed to maintain “regulated tariffs during the service life of existing
facilities (with a transparent annual adjustment mechanism)”.??’ The Claimants moreover
refer to an excerpt from a press release of 25 May 2007 issued by the Government and

announcing the adoption of RD 661/2007:

Tariffs shall be reviewed every 4 years, taking into account compliance with
the established targets. Such a revision shall allow for adjustments to be made
to the tariff in virtue of new costs and the level of compliance with the targets.
Future tariff revisions shall not be applied to existing facilities. This
guarantees legal certainty for the electricity producer and stability for the
sector, thereby favouring development. The new legislation shall not be
applied retroactively. Facilities with a start-up date prior to 1 January 2008
may operate under the previous framework in accordance with the fixed-tariff
option for the duration of the facility’s working life.?*

The Respondent

The Respondent advances four reasons why Article 44(3) is neither a stabilization clause

nor a basis for any expectation of the freezing of the regulatory framework

First, the Respondent argues that the second paragraph of Article 44(3) covers only the
compulsory review of 2010 and does not apply to other possible revisions.?* This,
according to the Respondent, is evidenced by the reference to “this section” (or “in this
paragraph”, depending on the translation), which necessarily only refers to Article 44 and
the reviews mentioned therein.?*” Moreover, the first sub-paragraph of Article 44 does
not prohibit or otherwise exclude revisions other than the quarterly ones explicitly
mentioned therein.?** In any event, Article 44(3) has a limited scope. It refers only to
revisions “of the regulated tariff and of the upper and lower limits”.?*? It does not refer to
any other types of updates such as (i) updates to the CPI, (ii) the hours of operation for
which premiums are paid, and (iii) does not refer to the possibility of introducing tax or
other measures that might directly or indirectly impact the profitability of PV plants.7*°
Thus, Article 44(3) cannot be read as a commitment to shield the FiT from the type of

revision undertaken by the Disputed Measures.

Second, the Respondent argues that the Claimants’ interpretation disregards the principle
of regulatory hierarchy, which provides that no regulatory act can contravene the
provisions of a law. In the case at hand, Law 54/1997 sets forth the basic principle of the
sustainability of the Spanish Electricity System (the “SES”). Since subsidies received by
RE producers constitute a cost of the SES their payment needs to be regulated subject to
Law 54/1997.4! Furthermore, Article 30(4) of Law 54/1997 explicitly provides that the

aim of any subsidy granted by regulation shall consist in achieving a reasonable rate of

return.“*~ This, according to the Respondent, creates a clear limit and is incompatible with

the Claimants’ assertion of the right to receive a FiT that remains “frozen” for decades.”

Third, the Respondent argues that Article 44(3) “is no new feature in the Spanish
regulatory framework”.*+ To the contrary, Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 closely
resembles Article 40(3) of RD 436/2004, which read:

The tariffs, premiums, incentives and supplements resulting from any of the
revisions provided for in this section shall apply solely to the plants that
commence operating subsequent to the date of the entry into force referred to
in the paragraph above and shall not have a backdated effect on any previous
tariffs and premiums.”

According to the Respondent, both Article 40(3) of RD 436/2004 and Article 44(3) of
RD 661/2007 refer to revisions “provided for in this section”, which implies that any other
changes to the regulatory regime (including the possibility of adopting new Royal

Decrees in place of the ones in force) were not addressed in these provisions.”*°

The Respondent further argues that Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 in any event is less
restrictive in respect of tariff revisions than Article 40(3) of RD 436/2004.74” This is
allegedly so, because Article 40(3) (unlike Article 44(3)) uses the term “retroactive””“*.
Furthermore, the guarantee against future revisions under Article 40(3) applied to “tariffs,
premiums, incentives and supplements”, whereas the same guarantee under Article 44(3)
applied only to “the regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits”, thus excluding

“premiums, incentives and supplements” from its scope.24?

2” “The remuneration arrangements for electric power generation installations operating under the special regime
shall be supplemented by the payment of a premium under statutory terms set out in regulations [...]. To work out
the premiums, the voltage level on delivery of the power to the network, the effective contribution to environmental
improvement, to primary energy saving and energy efficiency, the generation of economically justifiable useful
heat and the investment costs incurred shall all be taken into account so as to achieve reasonable profitability rates
with reference to the cost of money on capital markets.” Law 54/1997 on the electric power sector, 27 November

274. Furthermore, the Respondent argues that the adoption of RD 661/2007 represented an
unfavorable change for certain RE producers, which Article 40 of RD 436/2004 did not

preclude.

275. According to the Respondent, Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 brought a reduction in the
profitability of operating wind farms and the elimination of the “pool plus premium”
option for photovoltaic facilities.°° This regulatory change from RD 436/2004 to
RD 661/2007 gave rise to a number of administrative suits which resulted in Supreme
Court judgments that yet again confirmed, according to the Respondent, that regulatory
changes of this sort were permissible as long as they respected Law 54/1997 and the
principle of a reasonable return.?*! Specifically, the Respondent refers to the following

ruling:

[...] [The claimant] does not pay sufficient attention to the case-law of this
Chamber issued specifically in relation to the principles of legitimate
expectations and non-retroactivity applied to successive incentives regimes
for electricity generation. These are the considerations expressed in our
Judgment of 25 October 2006 and reiterated in that of 20 March 2007, inter
alia, on the legal status of the owners of facilities producing electricity under
the special regime, for whom it is not possible to recognize pro futuro an
“unalterable right” to the maintenance of the remuneration framework
approved by the holder of regulatory power, provided that the requirements of
the Electricity Sector Act are respected as regards the reasonable rate of return
on investment.

250 Counter-Memorial, para. 522; Rejoinder, para. 541. The Respondent argues in its Rejoinder that “as regards all
the types of photovoltaic technology, RD 661/2007 led to a 13.76 % decrease from the regulated tariff that the
photovoltaic plants would have received if RD 436/2007 had been in force.” Rejoinder, para. 510. The Claimants
and their regulatory expert, Mr. Solé, contest this as being the result of an incorrect calculation by Mr. Montoya,
who failed to appear at the hearing to explain his method. Claimants’ Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 99-101. In
response, the Respondent argues that “it is a fact (not a calculation by Mr. Montoya) that the TMR was
7.3304 cents of EUR/kWh in 2005, 7.6588 cents of EUR/kWh in 2006 and 8.8809 cents of EUR/kWh in 2007
[referring to CNE Report 39/2006, p. 24]. These increases were, as a matter of fact, well beyond the alleged 2 %
cap.”

276. The Respondent further relies on certain statements made by industry associations, such

diligent investor could not have been unaware of these industry views.”*4 The Respondent
also refers to a regulatory impact report on RD 661/2007, which, inter alia, provides as

follows:

The regulated tariff has been calculated for the purpose of guaranteeing a
return of between 7% and 8% depending on the technology. [...]

For facilities of up to 10 MW, these regulated tariff values provide a
reasonable IRR at 25 years of approximately 7%.?°>

supporting its interpretation of RD 661/2007.7°

c. RD 661/2007: Public comments

278. Following the publication of RD 661/2007, ASIF made the following statement:

The photovoltaic economic system is basically being developed due to the
support it has under Royal Decree 661/2007 [...] A reasonable rate of return is
sought, but what is a reasonable rate of return for an investment in renewable
energy, specifically in photovoltaic energy? [...] It is considered rather
reasonable that a period of return on investment is around ten years, and an
internal rate of return of the project (without leverage) is around 7%, which is
aligned with other regulated investments.?*”

279. The AEE also specifically deplored the retroactive reduction in the remuneration of wind

power facilities that RD 661/2007 introduced:

The new decree also foresees the allocation of remuneration in a long-lasting
manner; specifically, for 20 years. However, the system of revisions and

280. In November 2007, the IDAE published a new version of its presentation “The Sun Can
Be Yours”, which stated that a FiT of 0.440381 EUR/kWh would apply to PV
installations below 100 kWh for the first 25 years, subject to annual updates based on the
CPI. The presentation further noted that “[t]he tariffs will be applicable to those facilities
definitely registered in the [RAIPRE] prior to 29 September 2008.”?°? According to the
Claimants, these statements demonstrate that the RAIPRE registration confirmed the right

288. On 29 July 2008, the CNE published report No. 30/2008 regarding the draft of what
would become RD 1578/2008 (‘““CNE Report 30/2008”).?° The CNE observed:

[A]fter being considered at the Electricity Consultative Council and a report
being issued with a negative assessment, a new draft Royal Decree was sent
ten months after the mechanism in question was activated, and when there
were only two months to reach the deadline of finalizing the current tariff.
This long absence of regulation introduces uncertainties in an industrial sector
that has placed itself among the world leaders, not to mention the confusion it
generates among potential investors, mostly natural persons.?”°

289. CNE Report 30/2008 also discussed the principles of legal certainty and protection of

legitimate expectations:

b) Legal certainty and the protection of legitimate expectations. Stability and
predictability of economic incentives (tariffs and premiums) reduce regulatory
uncertainty, which encourages investments in new capacity to address their
projects, while minimizing the cost of financing and thereby reducing the final
cost to the consumer. The current regulation has established annual updates of
economic incentives, based on robust indexes (such as the IPC, ten-year
bonds, etc.), and periodic reviews every four years, which in this case only
affect the new facilities.

Certainly, the principles of legal certainty and the protection of legitimate
expectations (Article 9.3 EC) do not constitute insurmountable obstacles to
the innovation of the legal system and cannot therefore be used as instruments
to petrify the legal framework in force at any given time. In this sense, these
principles do not prevent the dynamic innovation of the regulatory
frameworks, nor of new normative provisions which can be applied pro-future
to situations initiated before it comes into force. But these principles do
require that regulatory innovation - especially if it is abrupt, unforeseeable or
unexpected - is carried out with certain guarantees and cautions (transitional
periods to adapt to the new regimes, where appropriate compensatory
measures, etc.) that dampen, moderate and minimize, as far as possible, the
disappointing of any expectations generated by the previous regulations.””!

The report further notes, with respect to RD 661/2007: “Special-regime production facilities are often capital-
intensive and have long recovery times. The regulation of the generation facilities under the special regime
established in RD 661/2007, has tried to minimize the regulatory risk of this group, providing security and

77

290. According to the CNE, the Spanish PV market had been “over-incentivized” by
RD 661/2007, which resulted in the passing of additional cost to the consumer despite a
situation where market demand for photovoltaic models should have led to (but failed to

result in) a reduction in costs:

We are faced with a photovoltaic solar technology market in a situation of
sudden expansion (with an increase of 350% in 2007 compared to 2006, and
an estimated 180% in 2008 compared to 2007) and where the supply has been
internationalized and is capable of meeting this demand. [...]

This unexpected growth has consequences for the electricity consumer. The
extra cost to the consumer for its economic support to the special regime is
increasing, from 8.6% in 2007 to 8.9% in 2008. In this extra cost, the support
to the photovoltaic technology represented 189 M EUR in 2007, and may
amount of 524 M EUR in 2008 for a capacity of 1.800 MW, which assumes
335M EUR of additional cost, which leads to the need to increase the
electricity tariff in 2008 from 1.3% in order to satisfy the increase in the extra
photovoltaic cost.

LJ

[T]he expansion of the demand for photovoltaic modules should have led to a
reduction in costs, derived from economies of scale and the learning curve of
the technology, whereas this reduction in costs is not being transferred to the
owners of the facilities.

The explanation for this effect could be that in this sector, the promoters of
the facilities are not usually the same as their owners, which is why the cost
reductions obtained by the former are transferred to the latter at a much slower
rate than the one in which the market is changing.

LJ

In this specific situation, it is necessary to adapt the methodology for
determining tariffs, bonuses and incentives, trying to stimulate the
technological evolution and competitiveness of the facilities in the medium
and long term, based on reduced initial tariffs and their evolutionary path,
according to the real change in demand in the short term.?””

predictability to economic incentives during the useful life of the facilities, by establishing transparent mechanisms
to update them annually, and by exempting existing installations from the four-year review, since the new
incentives that are being set out only affect the new installations.” (ibid., p. 20).

b. RD 1578/2008: Relevant provisions

291. On 26 September 2008, the Government adopted Royal Decree 1578/2008 “covering the
compensation for the generation of electric power by photovoltaic solar technology for
facilities subsequent to the deadline for the maintenance of compensation under

[RD 661/2007]” (“RD 1578/2008”).273

292. RD 1578/2008 did not change the incentives applicable to the PV installations registered
under RD 661/2007, as it applied exclusively to new installations registered in the

RAIPRE after 29 September 2008, i.e., after the Tariff Window.?”4
293. RD 1578/2008 stated in its preamble as follows:

The growth of installed capacity experienced by the photovoltaic solar
technology has been much greater than expected.

LJ

This rapid evolution has been due to numerous industrial investments related
to photovoltaic solar technology, from the manufacture of polysilicon, wafers
and modules to followers or inverters, so that all of the elements of the chain
involved in a photovoltaic solar facility can currently be produced in Spain.

LJ

It has become necessary to provide continuity and expectations to these
investments, as well as to establish progressive guidelines for the
implementation of this type of technology, which, in addition, can contribute
to achieving the goals of the 2005-2010 Renewable Energy Plan and those set
in the new 2011-2020 Renewable Energy Plan, based on the objectives
assigned to Spain in the new Renewable Energy Directive. Therefore, it has
been determined that it would be appropriate to raise the current goal of 371
MW of installed capacity connected to the network, set in [RD 661/2007].?*

294. Regarding the compensation under the Special Regime, the preamble of RD 1578/2008

further noted:

In addition, the support framework for this technology, represented by
[RD 661/2007], which regulates the generation of electric power under a
special regime, which has demonstrated its effectiveness should also be

adapted rapidly enough to keep pace with the evolution of technology, in order
to ensure its effectiveness. Just as insufficient compensation would make the
investments nonviable, excessive compensation could have significant
repercussions on the costs of the electric power system and create
disincentives for investing in research and development, thereby reducing the
excellent medium-term and long-term perspectives for this technology.
Therefore, it is felt that it is necessary to rationalize compensation and,
therefore, the Royal Decree that is approved should modify the economic
regime downward, following the expected evolution of the technology, with a
long-term perspective.?”°

295. RD 1578/2008 provided for the following key developments for the Special Regime:

a) RD 1578/2008 created a new subsection in the RAIPRE, monitoring the installations
that intended to qualify for the Special Regime (the “Compensation pre-assignment
registry”);?””

registration in the RAIPRE to be completed. RD 1578/2008 further provided that pre-

such pre-registered installations then were given one year for their final

assignment registration was to take place by time periods. The “first call” for
registration in the Compensation pre-assignment registry was set for the time period

of 2009.278

b) RD 1578/2008 introduced a cost adjustment mechanism by time period for pre-
assignment registration. The adjustment, downwards or upwards, was to be based on
the amounts of subsidies paid during a previous time period.?”? The Memoria
Justificativa (explanatory report) for RD 1578/2008 referred to this mechanism as the

“tariff reduction curve”:

[T]he tariff reduction curve will follow the cost reduction path for this
technology. This mechanism, linked to the increase in capacity in the
same percentage as the reduction in remuneration, will encourage
manufacturers and installers to reduce their costs to increase their
production, and will help consumers, who in the end are financing these
technologies, to avoid incurring an unnecessary cost.28°

As a result, the FiT would vary depending on the call period during which a PV

made the following statement before the Senate:

I met some foreign investors who told me that if the premiums were
maintained the next year they would invest billions of euros in Spain, but it is
very easy to invest when the electricity consumers are remunerating you. [...]
We want to obtain investments that generate wealth, not just ones that absorb
the consumers’ resources. [..] we must be aware of the economic sustainability

the market.

LJ

Solar PV projects that were not fully permitted and operational before the 28th
of September 2008 (RD 661), are forced on to the recently published
RD 1578. In essence the tariffs under RD 1578 have been reduced by about
25% compared to RD 661. RD 1578 also tries to control the growth levels by
capping the number of projects that can achieve the feed in tariff on a yearly
basis.

301. On 9 and 13 February 2009, CNE officials Messrs. Carlos Solé and Luis Jestis Sanchez
de Tembleque made presentations in Barcelona, Spain and Cartagena, Colombia. With
respect to the legal regime under RD 661/2007, these presentations provided the

following information regarding the basic criteria of the CNE’s methodology:

— Reach the planning objectives: Economic incentives constitute an
instrument of energy and environmental politics (sufficient for reasonable
profitability, but [...] incentives that obtain profitability greater than is
reasonable are justified):

— Regulatory stability. Predictability and security in economic incentives
throughout the lifetime of the installation (to [encourage] investors and have
a lower financial cost): no retroactivity

— Facilitate the operation of the system. Complementary regulation for
improving the quality of the energy produced (better security in the system).”"!

302. The presentations also discussed RD 1578/2008, but did not make similar comments

regarding profitability or non-retroactivity.?>

303. On 1 March 2009, another commentator made the following observations regarding the

modifications introduced by RD 1578/2008:

2% Pdyry, Report: “Current and future trends in the Spanish solar industry”, November 2008 (R-234), pp. 2, 3. See
also ibid., p. 29: “As we will see in this report, the Spanish Government has under estimated the growth potential
for Solar PV and CSP, and this has lead to a boom in the industry that is without precedent anywhere in the world.
The Government, only too aware of the impact that higher feed in tariffs have on the syst leading to
higher tariff deficit) has put in place desperate measures to try to cool the industry down while not inflicting lasting
damage. As we will see in section 3.6.2 the Government has once again acted in a lethargic and inefficient manner.”

304. On 22 October 2009, the CNE issued a report in response to a query made by an individual

In short, although the current regulation on remuneration for photovoltaic
technology has receive[d] numerous criticisms due to the notable reduction it
represents regarding the price of the electricity generated, we must conclude
by saying that the change has been positive. This is because it already
introduces us into a system with a tighter remuneration, that will prevent the
uncontrolled growth of photovoltaic facilities all over Spain. On the other
hand, the fact that facilities built on farming-type structures have been
included is seen as positive, which was left out of the regulation for
RD 661/2007. Finally, it also prevents the possibility of committing fraud at
the photovoltaic facilities, as was the case when, de facto, a | Mw. facility was
considered as divided into small facilities with power less than 20 Kw.

On the less positive side, it should be indicated that legal insecurity has not
been done away with completely, above all due to the fact that revision of the
tariffs remains an authority of the Ministry of Industry through the General
Secretariat of Energy. Furthermore, as I finish writing this brief article,
protests have arisen from photovoltaic employers’ associations (the ASIF) as
regards how the Remuneration Pre-assignment Register works, as before the
second public notice was launched since RD 1578/2008 entered into effect,
the final results are still not known for the first because of delays in processing
the requests.”

Given that Section 5 of Article 11 [of RD 1578/2008] provides for a maximum
duration of 25 years for the financial payment allocated to a facility registered
under the scope of application of RD 1578/2008, the judgement of this
Commission is that the modification of the remuneration scheme to which the
Sth Additional Provision refers should be applicable to new facilities that are
registered starting in 2012. However, it should be noted that the Government
has _the ¢ y to determine the lication of the fifth additional
provision of Royal Decree 1578/2008.

 

This regulation is consistent with the regulation established in Article 44.3 of
Royal Decree 661/2007, where it provides for a revision of the remuneration

309. According to the Claimants similarly to RD 661/2007, RD 1578/2008 provided for the
stability of a fixed FiT over 25 years (at least implicitly).?°* The Claimants rely on the
statement in the 2009 CNE Report, which had stated in respect of the Fifth additional
provision of RD 1578/2008 (providing that the compensation mechanism would be
subject to revisions from 2012 onwards) that it was “consistent with the regulation
established in Article 44.3 of [RD 661/2007].”? According to the Claimants, the Fifth
additional provision “aimed to provide certainty to investors [...] that there might be a

new payment system for PV in 2012 that would affect newly built plants registered after

that date.”°°° The Claimants thus conclude that the Fifth additional provision of

RD 1578/2008 “had the same effect” as Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007.2"!

The Claimants further rely on a passage from the Memoria Justificativa of RD 1578/2008,
which provided that:

During 2012, the percentage of reduction will be reviewed and, if necessary,
modified upwards, if, in view of the technological evolution of the sector, it is
found that the costs of this technology have fallen below the maximum
expected rate of decrease, in which case the installed capacity target for the
following call will be increased by the same percentage as the regulated tariff
will be reduced.*

In the Claimants’ view, this type of revision could only be forward-looking.

As regards the fact that the new FiT was lower than under RD 661/2007, the Claimants

note that “that made sense since by the time RD 1578/2008 was passed, new installations

could benefit from the reduction in the price of PV panels.”°°*

The Claimants also rely on a publication from industry analysts published in 2010 that
discusses feed-in tariffs worldwide, and which stated that “tariff degression stimulated
investors to speed up the planning process: the sooner you get connected to the grid, the
higher will be the payment for the power plant.”

Finally, according to the Claimants:

As the RD 1578/2008 [FiTs] were automatically modified for each new wave
of installed capacity, the regulation had no need for an express stability
provision. Under RD 1578/2008, although [FiTs] were constantly being
reviewed for new installations, it was clear that once an installation was listed
in the Pre-assignment Register it locked-in the right to a specific [FiT] for 25

regime worked.*”°

According to the Respondent, RD 1578/2008 contained no stability commitment.
Disagreeing with the Claimants’ interpretation of the Fifth additional provision of
RD 1578/2008, the Respondent argues that this provision “announced that an amendment
of the subsidies for photovoltaic facilities was possible in 2012, depending on their impact
on the economic stability of the SES.”°°’ According to the Respondent, the wording of
the Fifth additional provision is “clear” and has to be interpreted and applied without

recourse to any additional means of interpretation.*°°

The Respondent further refers to the preamble of RD 1578/2008 to the effect that this

regulation was guided by the principle of economic sustainability.”

RDL 6/2009: Relevant provisions

On 30 April 2009, Spain enacted Royal Decree-Law 6/2009 which “adopted certain

measures within the energy industry and approved the discount rate” (“RDL 6/2009”)2!°

The preamble of RDL 6/2009 stated in its first paragraph:

Law 54/1997 [...] introduced the liberalisation of activities involving the
generation and sale of electricity. However, the commercial activity has in fact
been greatly conditioned by the tariff system. In this way, the difference
between the regulated tariffs and the energy prices has threatened the primary
objective that was sought in using market prices to achieve greater efficiency
and has caused prejudicial effects which are increasing as time goes by,
undermining the very base of the liberalisation of the electricity systems and,
in parallel, leading to an erroneous belief with respect to the price of a scarce
resource such as energy, which does not contribute to encouraging savings
and energy efficiency.*"!

319. The main purpose of RDL 6/2009 was to tackle the Tariff Deficit®!” that existed in the
electricity sector since the early 2000s and had significantly increased after 2008, as

shown on the below chart:33

6.287

 

2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 ©2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014

320. In this regard, the preamble of RDL 6/2009 noted:

The growing tariff deficit, that is to say, the difference between revenue from
the regulated tariffs that are set by the Administration and that consumers pay
for their regulated supply and from the access tariffs that are set in the
liberalised market and the real costs associated with these tariffs, is causing
serious problems which, in the current context of international financial crisis,
is having a profound effect on the system and placing at risk not only the
financial situation of the companies that make up the Electricity Industry, but
also the very sustainability of the system. This imbalance is unsustainable and
has serious consequences, as it undermines the security and the capacity to
fund the investments needed for the supply of electricity at the levels of quality
and security that Spanish society requires.>"*

321. As a consequence, the preamble of RDL 6/2009 called for the need to adopt urgent

measures:

[D]ue to the growing impact on the tariff deficit, mechanisms are established
with respect to the remunerative system of special regime facilities. The trend
that these technologies are following could place system sustainability at risk
in the short term, both from the economic point of view due to its impact on
the electricity tariff and from the technical point of view, also compromising
the economic viability of already completed facilities whose operation
depends on the suitable balance between manageable and non-manageable
generation. Therefore there is a need to adopt an urgent measure that serves to

established tariffs. See RDL 6/2009, 30 April 2009 (C-82)/(R-37), preamble.

guarantee the necessary legal security of those who have made investments,
and lays down the bases for establishing new economic regimes that
encourage compliance with the intended objectives: the achievement of
certain power objectives from technology at a reasonable cost for the
consumer and the technological evolution thereof, which makes possible a
gradual reduction in their cost and consequently their concurrence with
conventional technologies.*!>

322. With respect to the impact of the Special Regime, the preamble of RDL 6/2009 noted:

The current regulation of the special regime does not establish sufficient
mechanisms to make it possible to plan facilities that use this type of energy,
nor indeed the amount and the distribution over time of the remuneration
premiums and therefore the impact on costs that are attributed to the tariff
system. The measure envisaged in the Royal Decree-Law, by creating the
Remuneration Pre-assignment Registry, makes it possible to correct the
situation described above from the very moment of its coming into effect. It
will make it possible to know within the deadlines envisaged in the Royal
Decree-Law, the facilities that are not only currently projected but which meet
the conditions for start-up and for accessing the electricity system with all
legal and statutory requirements, the volume of power associated with them
and the impact on the costs of the electricity tariff and its calendar. In any
event, the rights and expectations of the owners of the facilities are respected,
with the necessary caution being exercised and the necessary transitional
regime for adaptation being envisaged.*"®

323. The key provision of RDL 6/2009 consisted in modifying the Twenty first additional
provision to Law 54/1997, which governed the average benchmark tariff.>!” As revised,
it provided for an obligation to verify the sufficiency of access fees and revenue
imbalances. Specifically, it provided that “[a]s of 1 January 2013, access fees shall be
sufficient to satisfy the entire costs of the regulated activities without the possibility of
any ex ante deficit appearing.”*!®

324. RDL 6/2009 also provided for a maximum limit of the Tariff Deficit.>"” It also adopted a

so-called social tariff for certain consumer classes.

In addition, RDL 6/2009 put in place a so-called remuneration pre-assignment registry
(the “Remuneration Pre-assignment Registry”), similarly to the Compensation pre-
assignment registry created by RD 1578/2008, subject to more stringent administrative

requirements.*”°

On 13 November 2009, the Council of Ministers adopted an agreement ‘which proceeds
the organisation of projects or installations presented to the administrative register for
attribution of payment for the production of electrical power installations, provided for in
[RDL 6//2009]’. This agreement was published on 19 November 2009 by the Secretary
of State of Energy.*?! It supplemented the regulation of the new Remuneration Pre-
assignment Registry in that it granted the Government the power to provide restrictions

- oe . «322
to the number of registrations on an annual basis. *7

RDL 6/2009 was subject to public criticism. For example, in May 2009, APPA published

an editorial stating:

The RDL 6/2009 may paralyse the renewable energy sector

The renewable energy associations condemn some of the requirements that
Article 4 of RDL 6/2009 demands as being practically impossible to achieve,
preventing many projects from being carried out and which will subsequently
lead to an industrial standstill and job loss. A clear and disastrous example can
be seen in Royal Decree 1578, which regulates activity relating to solar
photovoltaic technology and has caused the sector to grind to a halt, leading
to factory closures and investment relocation.

The new RDL may have the same impact on other renewable technologies and
even affect wind energy, the most developed.

LJ

APPA, ADAP, APREAN, EolicCat, Gi Watt and the Energy Cluster of
Extremadura recognise that the growth of the Special Regime, and more
specifically that of renewable energy with its aim of accounting for 20% of
total energy by 2020, requires broad discussion and imagination to equip it
with adequate regulation, and on that basis they object to it being handled with
the urgency of a RDL.

Renewables need legal stability and certainty

The frequent change in criteria made by the Ministry of Industry regarding the
tules regulating renewable energy development, without consulting agents in
the sector or the regulatory body, continues to characterise this form of
electricity production by its legal weakness and uncertainty amid any
investment project, determining its development and specific influence in the
production mix of the Spanish energy and electricity system.*”

RDL 6/2009: The Parties’ positions

The Parties’ positions differ regarding the significance of RDL 6/2009.

The Claimants contend that RDL 6/2009 sought to address the Tariff Deficit, which,
according to the Claimants, had been created by the Government’s “repeated failures to
set the regulated retail price of electricity at a level sufficient to recover the costs of all
regulated activities, including (but not limited to) the costs of the Special Regime.”?*4 The
Claimants further emphasize that the Government did not tackle the Tariff Deficit by
cutting the FiTs, “because Spain understood, as did numerous investors that invested

under such regimes, that the [FiTs] could not be reviewed for existing installations.”??>

The Respondent argues that RDL 6/2009 was adopted as an extraordinarily urgent
measure, “necessary to try to rebalance the sustainability of the SES.”*?° According to the
Respondent, the modifications adopted under RDL 6/2009 had to affect the Claimants’
“expectations [...] concerning the evolution of the SES.”?*’ The Respondent points to the

vocal criticism from the industry associations in support of this argument.*?*

9. Subseq factual devel prior to the

of the Disputed Measures

a. The APPA/Greenpeace Draft Law Proposal

331. On 21 May 2009, APPA and Greenpeace submitted a proposal for a draft bill for a
Renewable Energies Development Law to the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Commerce

(the “APPA/Greenpeace Draft Law Proposal”).*”°

332. The APPA/Greenpeace Draft Law Proposal provided, inter alia, for the determination of

a regulated tariff based on the concept of a “reasonable return”:

Article 23. Determination of regulated tariffs, premiums and supplements

4. The Government shall set the rate of regulated tariffs, premiums and
supplements, in all cases considering the costs of operation and maintenance
and the investment costs that the owners of the facility may incur, with an end
to ensuring reasonable rates of return with reference to the cost of money on
the capital market. The capital return rate shall be set at an annual percentage
rate equivalent to the previous year’s average yield on 10-year Spanish
government bonds, plus a spread of 300 basis points.**°

333. The APPA/Greenpeace Draft Law Proposal also contained the following provisions

regarding the entitlement to the proposed support scheme:

Article 27. Entitlement to the adopted support scheme

1. The facilities and uses of renewable energy to which the present law applies
shall be entitled to benefit from the support schemes in force at the time of
initiating the prior authorisation procedures or upon commencing operation,
as applicable, and during the term of application for which each support
scheme was designed, which shall depend on the estimated useful life of each
technology and shall in no case be less than twenty years.

LJ

5. Changes to compensation amounts from support schemes resulting from
any of the reviews contemplated in this article shall apply to the facilities and
uses which initiate prior authorisation procedures or commence operation, as
applicable, after the date on which the corresponding modification to the
support scheme enters into force, as indicated in the previous section. In any

case, it is not permitted for modifications made to support schemes to be
extended to facilities or uses that were enjoying the benefits of previous
support schemes, which shall be retained unless an express replacement
request is submitted by the respective beneficiary.**!

The Parties disagree with respect to the significance of the APPA/Greenpeace Draft

Law Proposal.

According to the Respondent (who first referred to this Proposal), the substance of the
APPA/Greenpeace Draft Law Proposal, which was widely reported on in the Spanish
press, reflects the substance of the New Regime (as defined below).**? Amongst others,
the APPA/Greenpeace Draft Law Proposal suggested that the estimation of investment
costs be carried out by reference to “standard installations.”**? In addition, the
APPA/Greenpeace Draft Law Proposal reflected the awareness of RE market participants
that the governing principles for the remunerative regime of the SES “were contained in
the Law (not the implementing regulations).”**+ Further, the APPA/Greenpeace Draft
Law Proposal showed that “any investor in Spain was aware of or should have been aware
of the dynamic nature of the fair return guaranteed under article 30.4 of Law 54/1997 and

the need for sustainability of the SES.”*°5

The Claimants advance essentially four objections to the Respondent’s arguments. First,
according to the Claimants, Spain’s argument “entirely disregards the dates on which the
Claimants’ investments were made” because the APPA/Greenpeace Draft Law Proposal
did not exist at the time when the Claimants invested in the Mahora, Villar de Cafias and
Ronda PV Plants.**° Regarding the Claimants’ remaining two PV Plants (Matapozuelos
and Fuentes de Ajfio), the Claimants argue that the APPA/Greenpeace Draft Law Proposal
had no bearing on their expectations when investing in these two PV Plants.**” Second,
the Claimants rely on Article 27(5) of the APPA/Greenpeace Draft Law Proposal (quoted
above at paragraph 333) to argue that the APPA/Greenpeace Draft Law Proposal “would

only apply prospectively”, not retroactively,*** and that the APPA/Greenpeace Draft
Law Proposal “reiterate[d] the necessity for RE support schemes to be underpinned by
stability and predictability.”**? Third, the Claimants argue that Spain exaggerated on the
relevance of the nomenclature used (“law” as opposed to “Royal Decree’). According to
the Claimants, the use by APPA and Greenpeace of the term draft Law merely served to
“indicate that, if enacted, the law would have a higher constitutional rank than other forms
of legislation or regulations.”*4° Fourth, the Claimants contend that the views of RE
associations had no bearing on the Claimants’ expectations, which under the Claimants’
case were based solely on what Spain was alleged to be saying “about the stability of
RD 661/2007.”*4! The Claimants rely on the findings of the Novenergia II v. Spain
tribunal which found that “none of the documents originate from the Respondent or any

Spanish state entity, but from private associations.”*4?

On 17 September 2009, Cross Retail signed an EPC contract with Enerpal S.A. for the

RD 661/2007, which allowed wind farm operators (but not the operators of PV
installations) to opt for the remuneration system available under the previous legal regime
set forth by RD 436/2004,*4’ an option which was very frequently exercised in practice.
According to the plaintiffs in that case, paragraph 4 of the first transitional provision of
RD 661/2007°#* violated the principles of legal security and legitimate expectations
because it disregarded the guarantee of non-retroactivity allegedly set forth in

Article 40(3) of RD 436/2004.*°
339. The Supreme Court rejected the appeal, noting that:

The request for annulment of the first transitional Provision (4), in Royal
Decree 661/2007 [...] must be repealed, since the setting in stone or freezing
of the remuneration system cannot be gathered from the prescriptive content
of Law 54/1997, of 27 November, on the Electric Sector for titleholders of
electric power facilities under the special scheme; or a recognition of the right
of producers under the special scheme to the scheme unchangeability of the
said scheme. The reason for it is that the Government, in compliance with the
legislator’s plan, has a degree of discretion to determine the energy yields
offered, on the basis of the clear objectives inherent to the implementation of
economic, energy and environmental policies, and taking into account - on
exercising its regulatory power - the obvious, essential general interests
involved in the proper functioning of the electricity production and
distribution system, and specifically, users’ rights.**°

340. The Supreme Court further held that:

The argument that the transitional Provision under appeal represents a
weakening of the principle of legal certainty enshrined in Article 9.3 of the
Constitution must be rejected - because it produces, as it is claimed, a situation
of uncertainty in the legal system regarding the regulation of the activity of
electrical energy producers under the special scheme. Hence it cannot be
followed that the said regulation does not meet the requirements of the
principle of legal certainty, which does not include any right whatsoever to
freeze the existing law.**!

341. On 9 December 2009, the Supreme Court issued another judgment in relation to an
administrative appeal lodged to request the repeal of certain provisions of RD 661/2007,
which granted the government discretion whether to grant a premium to gas cogeneration
facilities with an installed capacity about 50 MW (i.e., Articles 28 and 45(4) and 45(5) of
RD 661/2007), on the grounds that these provisions contravened EU law and principles
of legal certainty and non-retroactivity under Spanish law. The Supreme Court rejected
the appeal, inter alia, on the grounds that the gas cogeneration facilities of the claimants

in that case were not included in the scope of the Special Regime.
342. The Supreme Court also added the following dictum:

Furthermore, both in the claim and in the findings document (the latter
undoubtedly contains a somewhat more detailed reference), [the claimant]
does not pay enough attention to the case law of this Chamber specifically
referred to with regard to the principles of legitimate expectation and non-
retroactivity applied to the successive incentives’ regimes for electricity
generation. This involves the considerations set out in our decision dated
October 25, 2006 and repeated in that issued on March 20, 2007, inter alia,
about the legal situation of the owners of electrical energy production
installations under a special regime to whom it is not possible to acknowledge
for the future an ‘unmodifiable right’ to the maintenance unchanged of the
remuneration framework approved by the holder of the regulatory authority
provided that the stipulations of the Lawon the Electricity Sector are
respected in terms of the reasonable return on investments.**”

343. On 19 February 2010, commentators published an analysis of the Supreme Court’s

above-mentioned case law relating to the remuneration of RE producers:

[T]his retroactivity in premiums was already given and explained by the
Supreme Court [...]. As we have been saying, it is nothing new, and we will
now look at why: Recently the [...] Judgment dated 3 December 2009, [...]
[based on] a judgment from 15 December 2005, literally states that: ‘the
appellant commercial entities have no right to the remuneration regime of the
electricity sector remaining unchanged, [...] the existing situation, which can
be modified at the discretion of the institutions and public authorities to
impose new regulations taking into account the needs of the general interest.
[The appeal was rejected as] the return of the generation activity from this
technology was higher than that considered sufficient and reasonable

remuneration’ ***

344. In February 2010, the CNE made another presentation on RE regulation in Spain, which
contained, inter alia, the following observation regarding the methodology underlying

the RE incentives:

[s]ecurity and predictability of the economic supports -> To eliminate the
regulatory risk (warranty by law). Non-retroactive-> Less uncertainties to
investors (and Banks) and less cost to the consumers.

-[e]conomic incentives are assured during the life of the installation (existing
capacity)

-[e]very 4 years or when planning is fulfilled, economic incentives are updated
(only for new capacity).**

345. In April 2010, APPA presented its comments on the Supreme Court’s case-law
(the “April 2010 APPA Report”):

5.) The matters of fact examined by the Supreme Court

[I]t should be reiterated that the rulings examined do not deal specifically and
directly with the subject that concerns us, viz. the legality of possible
retroactive regulations that would modify downwards the regulated tariff or
the premiums that are received by renewables installations already in
operation. It should be noted that the rulings of 9 December refer to power
stations outside of the special regime and that these are not renewables, that
the ruling of 3 December 2009, although it does refer to renewables, the
question of fact examined does not refer to a retroactive reduction of tariff or
premiums, but to the option mechanism in the first transitory provision of
[RD 661/2007], and neither does the ruling of 30 November 2009 refer to the
retroactive reduction of premiums and neither does those originated by the
contentious action taken by BECOSA refer to renewables. I highlight the
above because it gives a small hope that the above rulings have not mentioned
in their reasoning the second paragraph of article 44.3 of [RD 661/2007]
ees

346. However, APPA also made the following observations regarding the temporal application

and impact of potential regulatory reforms:
6.) The validation of retroactivity by the rulings examined

e) The ruling of 9 December 2009 (Nueva Generadaora del Sur, S.A.) [...]

[T]he Supreme Court’s jurisprudence is conclusive: It openly and
resoundingly justified the retroactive nature of the law that regulate or could

97

regulate the economic regime of the special regime, whilst respecting the
principles established in the law, leading in the end to the famous rates of
‘reaonsable return with reference to the cost of money on the capital markets’.
In this way, neither the principle whereby laws are not retroactive, nor the
maintenance of legitimate confidence in the administration for citizens
prevent the modification of the remuneration regime for renewable energies
in a retroactive manner, i.e., applicable to the installations already functioning
at the time the aforementioned modification came into effect.

LJ

In any case one has to state clearly the advisability of fleeing from any
optimism when it comes to an appeal in the courts of law. Despite what we
are saying, an eventual practical demonstration that a certain modification to
the premiums would put the IRR for an installation below that 7 per cent and
would thereby cease to guarantee these ‘reasonable rates of return’, might
perfectly be ‘ratified’ by a court simply by maintaining that the
‘reasonableness’ of the rates of return in 2006 or 2007 could be at the
aforementioned 7 per cent, but they do not have to coincide with this figure
when making this modification, with which another route of attack to the
adjustment to law of retroactive modifications to tariffs and premiums would
be frustrated once again.”*°°

347. Moreover, APPA noted with respect to the modifications of Article 44(3) of
RD 661/2007:

7) The incidence of article 44.3 of the [RD 661/2007]

As is known, this precept establishes that successive reviews of the tariffs shall
only apply to installations entering service subsequent to | January for the
second year following the modification.

It should be noted, however: One, that what has been said is valid for the
successive reviews carried out within the period of validity of the Royal
Decree, but does not need to be maintained in a possible new Royal Decree to
replace and derogate [RD 661/2007]. Two, that with the omission of the
word ‘premiums’ in the second paragraph of the rule, one has to see that its
jurisprudential interpretation does not justify the retroactive application to
these premiums, even though not to the ‘regulated tariff’ and the ‘upper and

lower limits’.*°”

c. Consultations between the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism and
representatives of the Spanish RE sector

348. In the Spring of 2010, the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism was reported to have
held consultations with representatives of the Spanish RE sector regarding a reduction of

RE subsidies proposed by the Ministry:

The Ministry of Industry intends to cut back the premiums of renewable
energies by EUR 2,500 million from the tariff of last year in which the
incentives totalled over EUR 6,000 million, according to business sources.
Miguel Sebastian, head of the department, conveyed this information to the
various associations that met last Thursday, and he asked which part of the
cutback each of them would be willing to undertake.

The associations of photovoltaic producers (APPA, ASIF and AEF), wind
power companies (AEE) and solar thermal companies (Protermosolar)
participated in the successive meetings held on the same day. Sebastidn
justified the cutback as a need to put an end to some incentives which, in his
opinion, jeopardise the goal to suppress the tariff deficit that last year
exceeded the EUR 3,500 million permitted by the Law for this tax year by up
to EUR 4,616 million, from which EUR 372 million must be deducted for the
cost of CO2 set aside for the companies in 2009.

The mechanism of the disputed cutback of the premiums has been prepared
by Sebastian’s team and already figures in a preliminary Royal Decree draft,
to which content CincoDias has had access. The strategy is to establish a
remuneration that is different to the current one for all the renewable
technologies, although the measure would primarily affect solar thermal
energy, followed by photovoltaic and wind power.

The remuneration would not be linked to market prices (as is currently the
situation with wind energy), it would be linked to a ‘reasonable’ rate of return.
This retribution system would be similar to that of Enagds and Red Eléctrica,
whose profitability is determined in accordance with the evolution of the
bonus over 10 years. Nonetheless, the remuneration for renewable energies
would be more favourable than that of the latter, according to insider sources
of the proposal close to the Government.

One of the consequences of the new system is that the depreciation of the
investment of photovoltaic installations (there are more than 51,000 in
operation), which is now situated at about seven years, would extend over
time. According to industry sources, the problem worsens in the case of plants
that have changed hands at least once, which has caused the investment to be
more expensive and, therefore, created a bubble.***

(i) 20% share of RE in gross final consumption of energy in the EU and (ii) a 10% target
for energy from renewable sources to be achieved by all EU Member States in energy
consumption in the transportation sector by 2020.** It also required the preparation of a
NREAP, which Spain at the time stated it did in parallel with preparing its new Renewable
Energy Plan, as provided by RD 661/2007.** The NREAP, amongst others, provided an
overview of RE targets and measures to achieve them. Regarding the financial aid granted

to the RE sector, the NREAP noted:

4.3.2 Financial aid for electricity generation using renewable energies

LJ

Electricity generation using renewable energies is considered Special Regime
production in the terms laid down in the Electricity Sector Act, Law 54/1997.
This Special Regime is based on system of direct support for production and
provides for higher remuneration than under the Ordinary Regime through a
regulated tariff scheme and specific premiums which are justified on the basis
of environmental and supply diversification and security benefits. This
scheme has proven to be highly effective in the development of electricity
using renewables both in Spain and the rest of the world.

The costs arising from the support network are included in the tariff structure
together with system-related costs.

LJ

The support mechanism takes account of the evolution of electricity market
prices so as to strike a balance between the need to guarantee minimum
remuneration levels and the desirability that electricity generation from
renewable sources be able to compete on an equal footing with conventional
generation, including external factors, while at the same time contributing as
far as possible to lower system costs.[...]°°

353. Regarding the review of remuneration, the NREAP stated as follows:

Review of remuneration

Royal Decree 661/2007 provides for reviews of remuneration amounts every
four years, which may be modified on the basis of technological developments
within the sectors, market behaviour, degree of compliance with renewable

energy targets, percentage of demand covered by special regime facilities and
their effect on the technical and economic management of the system, while
always guaranteeing reasonable rates of return. In any event, these reviews
take account of cost trends associated with each technology with three
objectives in mind: to see that renewable technologies become as competitive
as possible with Ordinary Regime generation, to foster a technological
development balance and to see that the remunerative scheme moves in the
direction of minimising socio-economic and environmental costs.*°

354. As regards future developments in support schemes for electricity generation from

renewable energies, the NREAP also noted:

Also, effective administrative supervision is required to assure that gains from
the development of these technologies in terms of relative cost
competitiveness are passed on to society, thus minimising the speculative risks
posed in the past by excessive rates of return, which not only hurts consumers
but is also damaging to the industry in general in terms of the perception
people have of it. Therefore, it will be necessary to devise sufficiently flexible
and transparent systems that permit the issue and reception of economic and
market signals so as to minimise the risks associated with investment and its
remuneration and those caused by fluctuations in the energy markets.*”

355. In July 2010, the Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Tourism announced that it reached an
agreement with the CSP and wind power sectors pursuant to which the respective RE

producers agreed to certain limitations such as, for example, a fixed number of operating

hours for which installations could enjoy the FiT (the “July 2010 Agreement”).**

356. On 22 July 2010, the Spanish Council of State issued an opinion on the legal nature of a

registration in the RAIPRE:

In essence, neither the resolution of registration in the Special Regime
Register, nor the actual act of registration imply a declaration of the right to
receive the premiums. Therefore, the right to a certain regime of premiums
depends on compliance with the corresponding requirements and conditions,
including, as indicated in the report of the National Energy Commission and
in the report on regulatory impact, that of having the necessary equipment for
the production of electrical energy on the corresponding date.*”

360. The preamble of RD 1565/2010 stated:

The growth in the number of electric power installations within the special
regime through renewable energy sources, co-generation and residues, has
been very important in the last years. Thus, Spain has become one of the
leading countries in the development of these technologies.

It is a very dynamic sector with a very fast pace of technological evolution.
Currently, approximately 25 per cent of the produced electric energy comes
from renewable energies. These facts, linked to the structural characteristics
of our electric system, require the establishment of additional technical
requisites to guarantee the functioning of the system and enable the growth of
these technologies.*”*
361. RD 1565/2010 implemented the following changes to the legal regime under

RD 661/2007:

(i) RD 1565/2010 reduced the number of years during which qualified installations

could receive the FiT to 25 years*”4;

(ii) RD 1565/2010 capped the quantity of electricity produced by PV installations

eligible to receive the FiT?*”>; and

(iii) RD 1565/2010 introduced additional technical requirements.*”°

362. RD 1565/2010 also introduced changes to the regime created under RD 1578/2008,

amongst others, by modifying the values of the rates of PV installations applicable during

g. Council of State opinion on future RD 1614/2010

364. On 29 November 2010, the Spanish Council of State issued an opinion on what was to
become RD 1614/2010 (see paragraph 365 below). With respect to the interpretation of
article 44(3) of RD 661/2007, the Council of State noted:

In any case, the forecasts contained on the exclusion of the review in the future
of the equivalent reference hours and the bonuses of certain thermal and wind
power facilities warrant special consideration (Arts. 2.5, 4 and 5.3).

In relation to that forecast, reference should be made to the wording of Article
44 of [RD 661/2007], which reads as follows:

‘3. During the year 2010, in view of the results of the monitoring reports on
the degree of fulfilment of the Renewable Energies Plan (PER) 2005-2010,
and of the Energy Efficiency and Savings Strategy in Spain (E4), together with
such new targets as may be included in the subsequent Renewable Energies
Plan 2011-2020, there shall be a review of the tariffs, bonuses, supplements
and lower and upper limits defined in this Royal Decree with regard to the
costs associated with each of these technologies, the degree of participation of
the special regime in covering the demand and its impact upon the technical
and economic management of the system, and a reasonable rate of return shall
always be guaranteed with reference to the cost of money in the capital
markets. Every four years, thereafter, there will be a further review,
maintaining the above criteria.

The reviews referred to in this section of the regulated tariff and the upper and
lower limits will not affect facilities whose commissioning certificate was
awarded before | January of the second year following the year in which the
review was carried out.”

In accordance with this precept, a review of tariffs, bonuses and the lower and
upper limits provided for in that Royal Decree (in particular, with regard to
the limits, see Art. 27 of that regulation) must be carried out in 2010; according
to the rule contained in the second paragraph, the review of the ‘regulated
tariff and lower and upper limit’ does not affect the authorised facilities before
the review is carried out, which indicates that they could be affected as far as
the review of the bonuses is concerned.*”

h. Adoption of RD 1614/2010

365. On 8 December 2010, the Government adopted Royal Decree 1614/2010 “regulating and
modifying certain aspects of the activity of electrical power production through solar
thermoelectric and wind technologies” (“RD 1614/2010”). Although this Royal Decree
was not concerned with PV installations, both Parties referred to it for the purposes of
giving a complete account of the principles underpinning regulatory developments in the

RE sector.**°
366. The preamble of RD 1614/2010 stated:

In recent years, Spain has become one of the countries in the lead in
developing certain electrical power production technologies from sources of
renewable energy. Currently more than 25 % of electrical power produced is
from renewable energies.

This growth has been brought about thanks to the existence of a solid, stable
and predictable economic and legal scheme and to the contribution of all the
parties involved, government bodies, technical and economic operators of the
system and companies.

The growth of wind, solar thermo-electric and photovoltaic technologies is
especially remarkable, having reached and even surpassed the installed power
objectives planned for the year 2010.

Thus is the legal framework, which as is recognised in its formulation must be
adapted to the dynamic reality of the learning curves of the various
technologies and to the technical conditions that arise with increased share in
the generation mix, safeguarding the legal security of investments and the
[principle] of reasonable return to thereby maintain a necessary and sufficient
support that is coherent with market conditions and with the strategic energy
objectives and to contribute to the transfer the benefits of the suitable
evolution of these technologies to society.

This Royal Decree intends to resolve certain inefficiencies in the application
of the cited [RDL 6/2009], for the wind and solar thermo-electric
technologies, which intended to ensure the economic scheme in effect in
[RD 661/2007], which regulates the activity of electrical power production in
the special scheme for projects at an advanced stage.

This Royal Decree arose from the report of the National Energy Commission
and the process of hearings through its Consultative Electricity Council, as

well as an examination by the Government Commission for Economic Affairs
in its meeting on 23 September 2010.**!
Article 2 of RD 1614/2010 established limitations on the operating hours for thermo-solar

(or CSP) and wind installations.**?

Article 4 of RD 1614/2010 set out the following rule regarding revisions of the economic

regime for thermo-solar and wind installations:

For solar thermoelectric technology facilities that fall under [RD 661/2007],
revisions of tariffs, premiums and upper and lower limits referred to in article
44.3 of [RD 661/2007], shall not affect facilities registered definitively in the
Administrative Registry of production facilities entitled to the special regime
that is maintained by the Directorate-General for Energy and Mining Policy
as of 7 May 2009, nor those that were to have been registered in the
Remuneration Pre-assignment Registry under the fourth transitional provision
of [RDL 6/2009], and that meet the obligation envisaged in its article 4.8,
extended until 31 December 2013 for those facilities associated to phase 4
envisaged in the Agreement of the Council of Ministers of 13 November
2009.58

The Parties disagree about the significance of RD 1614/2010.

According to the Claimants, RD 1614/2010 formalized the July 2010 Agreement.**
Further, Articles 4 and 5 of RD 1614/2010 allegedly “reconfirmed that any future changes
to the RD 661/2007 economic regime would not be applied to duly registered existing

wind and CSP installations.”3°5

According to the Respondent, RD 1614/2010 (similarly to RD 436/2004 and
RD 661/2007) applied to existing plants that were already registered under an earlier
Royal Decree (subject to the principle of respecting a reasonable return).**

RD 1614/2010 also allegedly sought to preserve the sustainability of the SES.**’

In support of its position, the Respondent refers to a regulatory impact report prepared for

draft RD 1614/2010:

The installed power targets set out in the 2005-2010 Renewable Energies Plan
have been reached or exceeded for the solar energy and wind technologies.
Although this development may be considered a very important achievement
by all players involved [...] it has also caused problems that need to be
addressed before they represent an irreversible risk for the economic and
technical sustainability of the system.***

372. On 16 December 2010, the CNE issued its Report 39/2010 “on the draft ministerial order
approving access tariff reform in the electrical energy sector as of 1 January 2011”

(“CNE Report 39/2010”)**°, and which noted:

It is true that presenting tariff proposals a year ahead of time is a forecasting
exercise and therefore subject to unforeseen and unexpected factors. However,
based on the forecast access costs for 2011, an application of the access tariffs
proposed in the [Order] under scrutiny would saddle the electrical energy
sector with an annual deficit of as much as EUR 5,048,000,000. In other
words, EUR 3,048,000,000 over the deficit upper limit, as per current
legislation. Taking into account the increased capacity payments included in
this draft [Order], and the possible eventuality that the resulting revenue might
not be sufficient to cover the payments provided in Royal Decree 134/2010,
the estimated settlement deficit in respect of regulated activities for 2011
could exceed the legally established upper limit by up to EUR 1,972,000,000.
Therefore, the access tariffs proposed under this Mandate are clearly
insufficient and will not cover the estimated access costs; nor will said access
tariffs sufficiently comply with the sector’s legally defined limits in terms of
the 2011 deficit.*°°

373. The Claimants rely on this excerpt from CNE Report 39/2010 to argue that “Spain had

kept Network Access Tolls artificially low”, thereby aggravating the problem of the tariff
deficit and the sustainability of the SES.**!

the SES could not exclusively be addressed by increasing the access tolls paid by Spanish

consumers.”39?

C. The Disputed Measures and other (non-impugned) regulations

375. According to the Claimants, RD 1565/2010 and RDL 14/2010 (as defined below)

constituted the “initial measures” that harmed their investments.*”?

FiT scheme.

a. RD 1565/2010: The Parties’ positions

377. The Claimants challenge RD 1565/2010, on the grounds that it cancelled the purported
entitlement, granted under RD 661/2007 to receive the FiT after the first 25 years of the
PV installations’ operation.*** The Claimants acknowledge that this 25-year period was
subsequently extended to 28 years in 2010,**° and to 30 years in 2011 by Law 2/2011.
The Claimants however maintain that “Spain has been inconsistent in its alleged
understanding of PV installations’ operational life and it has subjected those installations
to a significant lack of stability in this regard.”*°’ The Claimants further argue that Spain
has provided no support for its argument that RD 1565/2010 involved no alteration of the

right to a reasonable return.***

In sum, according to the Claimants, “RD 1565/2010 augured a new era of regulatory

instability”, “[t]he stable regulatory regime that had been central to Spain’s RE policy

and to the Claimants’ investment decisions was suddenly in a state of flux.”*””

The Respondent argues that “[a]s with previous measures, the measures adopted during
2010 (Renewable Energies Action Plan, Royal Decree 1565/2010, Royal Decree
1614/2010 and the subsequent Royal Decree Act 14/2010) responded to the need to
guarantee the technical and economic sustainability of the SES, as well as to correct any
detected situations of over-remuneration.”*°° The Respondent moreover argues that the
criticism, for instance by AEE, directed against previous drafts of RD 1565/2010
demonstrated that the regulatory framework was understood as allowing for the

possibility of regulatory changes, provided that the reasonable return is guaranteed.*°!

The Respondent further refers to the findings of the Charanne v. Spain tribunal that

rejected Spain’s liability under the ECT on account of adopting RD 1565/2010.4°

RDL 14/2010 — Disputed Measure

RDL 14/2010: Context and relevant provisions

On 23 December 2010, Spain adopted Royal Decree-Law 14/2010 on the establishment
of urgent measures for the correction of the tariff deficit on the electricity sector

(RDL 14/2010”). In its preamble, RDL 14/2010 specifically observed:

2. Since the adoption of [RDL 6/2009], there have been a series of
supervening circumstances that have had a direct impact on the anticipated
tariff deficit in the electricity system and it has been determined that the
capped ex ante deficit limits, as established in the aforementioned Twenty-
First Additional Provision [of Law 54/1997], have been largely overcome.
The impact of the global crisis, which traverses the Spanish economy, has led
to a significant decline in the demand for electric energy, however, supply has
been impacted by aspects such as the evolution of the price of fuels on the
international markets during the current year, 2010 and the favourable climatic
conditions that have led to increased electric energy production from

renewable sources. The current economic situation has not had symmetrical
consequences in all electric power sectors: while the ordinary regime
(traditional electric power plants) have seen a reduction in their operating
hours and income, due to the decline in Wholesale market prices, however,
producers under the special regime are found to be in a different circumstance,
as this specific regime ensures the sale of generated electricity at preferential
rates within the system.

3. In consequence, the objective of this Royal Decree-Law is to urgently
address the correction of the tariff deficit in the electricity sector. [...].“°*

382. The preamble of RDL 14/2010 further observed:

4. In addition, this Royal Decree-Law holds the objective of eliminating the
appearance of a new deficit in the electricity system, as of 2013, and ensures
an avenue for its reduction, enforcing a set of measures with immediate effect,
allowing for the economic situation to be addressed and to strengthen the
consideration of the electrical system in the financial and debt markets, being
of great importance at present. Thus, a set of provisions is established, so that
all industry agents contribute, in a further and combined effort, to the
reduction of the deficit of the electricity system.

In formulation of these measures, care has been taken to ensure the
safeguard of the supply of electricity, in terms of universality, quality, safety
and continuity and to ensure the protection of consumer rights for electrical
power supply, under equitable terms, as well as to ensure compliance of the
targets regarding energy efficiency and the promotion of renewable energies.
In parallel, special attention and care has been taken not to affect the
economic-financial balance of companies within the sector, and not solely for
large companies, preserving the principles of a free market, which are
governed under [Law 54/1997], but also for sets of power generation facilities,
monitoring such, because, especially in the case of power generation
companies under the special regime, these have secured adequate and
reasonable compensation.

Therefore, firstly, payment exemptions on the use of transmission and
distribution networks for pumping consumption are annulled and an
obligation on electricity producers for the payment of such access fees is
established, which shall allow for a fair evolution thereof. As generation
facilities, especially under the special regime, have experienced significant
growth, there has been greater investment in the electricity transmission and
distribution networks, in order to carry electricity therein. In the current
context of the crisis and tariff deficiency, it is deemed justified the producers
contribute, through the payment of access fees for the expenditures
attributable to the required investments[.]

Secondly, in order to reduce the costs attributable to the tariff, it is established
that the producers of electricity, under the ordinary regime, finance Action

111

Plan 2008-2012, approved by Resolution of the Council of Ministers, of 8 July
2005[.]

Thirdly, and as stated in the Second Section, it is deemed reasonable that
producers under the special regime also make a contribution to mitigate the
additional costs on the system, and such contribution must be proportionate to
the characteristics of each technology, to the degree of participation in the
generation of such additional costs and to the current extent for compensation,
whose reasonable return, nonetheless, is guaranteed. Thus, for the same
purpose, there has been Government approval, over recent months, for
regulatory measures directed at producers of wind, solar thermal and co-
generation electricity.

Thus, in consideration of the rate of growth of photovoltaic installations, and
for safeguarding the principle of sufficiency for compensation, due to the
special impact that the deviations in the forecast generation of this energy
source have caused to the tariff deficit, it is established, in general terms, the
possibility for limiting the recognised equivalent operating hours entitled by
the prevailing economic system. Thus, such reference values are expressly
fixed according to the values used for the compensation calculation, as
established in the Renewable Energy Plan 2005-2010, and by those reflected
in [RD 661/2007][.] In parallel, and in order to ensure reasonableness for any
compensation, any references with regard to the first 25-year period, as
established by Royal Decree 661/2007, of 25 May, shall be extended to 28
years for installations of type b.1.1."°°

383. Thus, RDL 14/2010 introduced a new access toll, applicable to electricity producers
under the Ordinary and the Special Regimes, for the use of the transportation and

distribution grids of the SES.*°°

384. Moreover, RDL 14/2010 introduced limitations on operating hours. Installations covered
by RD 661/2007 were subject to: (i) a temporary limitation applicable until 31 December
2013*°7 and (ii) a permanent limitation applicable from 2014.*"* Installations covered by
RD 1578/2008 were subject to a permanent limitation from 1 January 2011.4 Any
quantities of electricity produced in excess of these hours were thus not eligible for the

FiT and had to be sold at market rates.

385. Further, RDL 14/2010 set additional limits for the revenue deficit.*!°

386. The regulatory impact report for RDL 14/2010, dated 23 December 2010, stated as

follows:

As has already been pointed out, since the approval of [RDL 6/2009], a series
of unexpected events has taken place which have had a direct impact on the
estimated tariff deficit in the electricity system and which have meant that the
maximum deficit limits established ex ante in the above-mentioned additional
ruling 21 have been greatly exceeded.

The first of these events was the effective fall in demand recorded in the
second half of 2008, which was greater than the estimates handled by the
government when [RDL 6/2009] was issued. Demand directly affects the
deficit given that it determines the unit costs (costs per unit for demand
consumed) budgeted in the tariffs fixed at the beginning of each fiscal year. A
downwards difference in this factor (the denominator of the formula), as
happened in this case, caused a deficit in financing which as can be seen in the
following figure, reached 600M EUR up to 2010: [...]

The second unexpected factor that significantly affected the estimate of the
tariff deficit is related to wholesale market prices and the indirect effect they
have on system costs through the equivalent bonuses under the special regime.

In effect, given that renewable technologies enjoy a guaranteed minimum
compensation and tariff income should cover the part of this compensation
that is not covered by the market, regulated costs go up when market prices
fall and vice versa.*"'

387. The regulatory impact report pursued:

The estimated temporary imbalance for 2010 in the settlement of regulated
activities as a consequence of the above factors should be acknowledged in
the access tariff review order for 1 January 2011, which is compulsory and is
issued at the end of December in each year as set forth in Royal Decree
1202/2010, dated 24 September, which establishes the review periods for
electricity transmission and distribution access tariffs. This would involve an
impact on access tariffs that would eventually be paid exclusively by
consumers, and in the short term and at a time of economic crisis like the
present one, would affect household economies and the competitiveness of
companies.

Hence there is an urgent need to establish in this Royal Decree Law that the
temporary imbalances of settlements in the electricity system that are
produced in 2010, up to a maximum value of 2,500 million Euros, are
classified as a deficit in income for the electricity settlement system for
2010[.]"?

113

388. With respect to network access costs, the regulatory report observed:

Given that generation facilities, especially those under the special regime,
have experienced significant growth, there has been an increase in investment
in electricity transmission and distribution grids to evacuate the electricity
pumping into the same. In the current context of crisis and tariff deficiency, it
is fair that generators should contribute by paying the costs attributable to the
investment they require.

Consequently, producers of electricity are therefore obliged to pay said costs,
which will enable a reasonable evolution thereof.

For this purpose, [Law 54/1997 has] been amended, in order to fix the
obligation for generators, both under the ordinary regime and the special
regime, to pay for the use of the grids, to make it possible for transmitters and
distributors to charge the owners of facilities for such services and to declare
the revenue from said invoicing realizable income for the NEC.*"3

389. Regarding the modifications with respect to PV installations, the regulatory impact report

specifically noted:

In the current context it seems reasonable for producers under the special
regime to also make a contribution to mitigate the extra costs. This
contribution should be proportional to the characteristics of each technology,
its degree of participation in the generation of these extra costs and the margin
existing in the compensation whose reasonable profitability shall remain in
any case guaranteed. Hence, for the same purpose, in recent months the
government has approved measures aimed mainly at wind and thermo-solar
electricity producers. These measures include, firstly, a provisional
contribution of cost reduction for the system, and secondly, a limit on the
number of subsidized hours, depending on the amount used in the REP 2005-
2010, in order to calculate reasonable compensation, and without prejudice to
compensation for other hours at the price fixed by the market.

In the field of photovoltaic technology, taking into account the rhythm of
growth in this kind of facility, and mainly the number of subsidized hours, a
general possibility is established for limiting the equivalent operating hours
with a right to the economic bonus regime as acknowledged, safeguarding the
principle of self-sufficiency in compensation, because of the heavy impact that
imbalances in generation forecasts from this energy source cause in the tariff
deficit and in the cost of energy for consumers and companies.*!

114

390. The regulatory impact report further commented on the modifications to the remuneration

regime under RD 661/2007:

2. Secondly, and in accordance with the same principle, in order to avoid
greater than forecast profitability, the number of equivalent subsidized hours
has been limited, at the same time as this was done under [RD 1614/2010] for
wind and thermoelectric solar facilities.

The compensation values in [RD 661/2007] were calculated in order to obtain
reasonable profitability rates and using as a hypothetical starting point the
average operating hours for facilities in these three technologies.

These operating hours can be found in the Renewable Energies Plan 2005-
2010 for all technologies.

Subsequently, in the actual operation of the system, it has been shown that
there are more operating hours at the facilities than initially planned in some
cases. There are diverse reasons for this — technical improvement,
overinstallation, etc. In any case, this means that for these facilities the
compensation obtained is more than reasonable. [...]

 

In order to compensate the reduction that these measures could cause, the
period for receiving compensation for photovoltaic facilities under
[RD 66 1/2007] has been extended from 25 to 28 years.*!>

391. The regulatory impact report made the following statements regarding the anticipated

general economic impact of the measures introduced by RDL 14/2010:

The economic impact of the saving on extra costs from limiting the number of
equivalent operating hours at photovoltaic facilities under the special regime
until 31 December 2013 is estimated at 2,220 million Euros, i.e., 740 million
Euros per year in said period. This can be seen in the following table:

  

LJ

Reasonable profitability is guaranteed by the amendment to clause 36 of
[RD 661/2007], which regulates electricity production under the special
regime, replacing the references to the first 25 years with the first 28 years for
[illegible] facilities. The impact of the measure is equivalent to an actual net
value of 4,409.34 million Euros in January 2011, which more than
compensates producers’ loss of earnings for the period 2011-2013.""6

392. Also in December 2010, the following provision was included by Triodos Bank in one of

the loan agreements used for the purposes of financing the Claimants’ investments:

The electric power tariff contemplated in the previous point for the plant to be
financed under the regime contained in RD 1578/2008, the number of
equivalent hours paid for, the investments due to technological requirements
and other investments and project expenses, have been considered by the Bank
in drawing uP the CASE BASE (Annex VI of this document), which is the
fi ining the economic of the income and
expenses of the project, from which result the cash flow necessary for the
restitution of the loan and which constitute the fundamental guarantees for the
bank on which the financing is based. In view of the foregoing, any alteration
in the regulatory system of the essential elements of the remuneration of the
energy produced, the assigned tariff itself, the limitation of the production of
the plant that is paid for the aforementioned tariff (by reduction of equivalent
paid hours or any other formula), the period of application of said tariff, or its
indexation (periodic revision, in accordance with a pre-established index), the
investments and expenses necessary for the operation of the financed
installation, and any negative regulatory modification in general and
RD 1578/2008 in particular, or any other regulatory element that could affect
the income foreseen for the installation to be financed in the CASE BASE
(Annex VI of this document), implies an essential alteration of the
fundamental economic circumstances of the project, which should lead to the
non-granting of the loan or to modifications of its essential elements (amount
of the loaned capital, terms, relation of own or outside resources, personal or
real guarantees and cover for the bank, risk premiums in terms of commissions
and interest rates, etc.).4!7

RDL 14/2010: The Parties’ positions

According to the Claimants, RDL 14/2010 was, in essence, a tariff cut.*!? The Claimants
further argue that the consequences of setting a cap on operating hours were drastic, as it
immediately impacted the available cash flows.*”° Moreover, the Claimants argue that the
three-year extension of the temporal cap on FiT availability from 25 to 28 years was “an
explicit recognition by Spain that it had caused harm to the Claimants’ investments,”
whilst nevertheless constituting “inadequate” compensation.*7!
The Claimants further criticize the alleged absence of “any discussion of Spain’s
obligation to increase the regulated income of the Electricity System by raising Network

Access Tolls.”472

In their Reply, the Claimants dispute Spain’s contention that RDL 14/2010 was adopted
in order to preserve the economic sustainability of the SES and correct situations of over-
remuneration whilst still guaranteeing a reasonable return.*?? According to the Claimants,
Spain had failed to put forward “any evidence that Spain considered that to be the case at

the time.“

The Claimants also dispute the Respondent’s defense argument according to which the
PER 2005-2010, which set forth the relevant information on standard facilities used to
determine the tariff set under RD 661/2007, used a certain benchmark of operating hours,
equivalent to the number of capped operating hours introduced by RDL 14/2010.4?°
According to the Claimants, such an interpretation defeats the understanding “held by all

investors, lenders and legal advisors at the time.’476

According to the Respondent, RDL 14/2010 “introduced several measures that

potentially affected the Claimants [i-e.] (i) the limitation on the hours of performance with

standard facilities assumptions set forth in the 2005-2010 PER.*? The Respondent
moreover explains that the Spanish Supreme Court, in its judgment of 25 July 2013,
considered the limitation of maximum subsidized operating hours as permissible.**! In
addition, the Respondent argues, the limitation of subsidized hours was also applied to
thermo-solar and wind power installations and that industry representatives from those
sectors were aware that regulatory modifications might affect preexisting power
installations.43* The Respondent also refers to Charanne v. Spain as having rejected

claims against RDL 14/2010.4

Law 2/2011 Disputed Measure

Law 2/2011: Context and most relevant provisions

On 3 March 2011, the Spanish legislator adopted law 2/2011 on sustainable economy
(“Law 2/2011”),4° which concerned a variety of economic sectors, including energy

producers. Article 34 of 2/2011 announced that the General Administration of the State

would adopt a “plan of austerity”.*°°

Law 2/2011 also set out the principles of energy policy:

Article 77. Principles of the energy policy.

1. The energy policy shall be oriented towards guaranteeing supply, economic
efficiency and environmental sustainability. In particular, the model of energy
consumption, generation and distribution should be compatible with EU
regulations and targets, and with international efforts in the struggle against
climate change.

2. For this purpose, this Law fixes certain national targets for energy saving
and for the participation of renewable energies, establishes the procedural
framework for drawing up a global planning for the energy model, sets the
basis for drawing up plans for saving and energy efficiency and develops the
appropriate conditions for the existence of a competitive energy market.

3. With this goal in mind, the government shall promote the diversification of
energy supply sources, the efficient development of smart infrastructures and
networks, the transparency and competence of the energy markets, the
sufficiency of compensation, the growing incorporation of renewable energies
and saving and efficiency policies.”

402. Based on these principles, Article 79 of Law 2/2011 further provided for the following

cornerstones of Spain’s energy planning:

Article 79. Preliminary energy planning.

119

1. The government, within three months of the coming into force of this law,
after a report has been received from the Energy Sector Conference and after
the corresponding public information process, shall approve a planning
document, which shall establish an energy generation and distribution model
in accordance with the principles set forth in [Article] 77 and with the goals
established.

2. The planning shall include various indicative scenarios for the future
evolution of energy demand, the resources necessary to satisfy said demand,
needs for new power and in general, useful previsions for taking decisions on
investment by private initiative and for decisions on energy policies,
encouraging an appropriate balance between the efficiency of the system, a
guaranteed supply and the protection of the environment.

LJ

4. In accordance with this planning, the legislation shall order the necessary
public incentives to satisfy the goals fixed in the previous section, in
accordance with the following principles:

a) The guarantee of a suitable return on investment in technologies under the
special regime, promoting an installation volume that is compatible with the
goals established in the energy plans.

b) Consideration of the learning curves in the different technologies until a
point of competitiveness is reached with the cost of energy consumption, in
order to encourage technological changes to improve the stability of the
contribution of renewable energies to the electricity system.

c) The progressive internalization of costs assumed by the energy system to
guarantee the sufficiency and stability of supply, encouraging, furthermore,
the replacement of technologies which due to their low economic, technical
and environmental efficiency, have become obsolete, provided that this
implies general savings in the system.

d) The prioritization of facilities that incorporate technological or
management innovations, which optimize efficiency in production,
transmission and distribution, contributing to local electricity consumption by
increasing the generation distributed, which contribute greater manageability
to energy systems and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, analysing in
particular the rhythm of incorporation in time.

e) In all cases goals should be reached taking into account the principles of
economic efficiency among the different alternatives and the economic
sustainability of the measures adopted.***

403. Finally, Law 2/2011 amended certain provisions of RDL 14/2010 (and thus indirectly,
RD 661/2007) as follows:

Forty-fourth final provision. Modification of [RDL 14/2010] [...].
The following modifications are introduced in [RDL 14/2010] [...].
One. Section 4 of the additional provision is first worded as follows:

‘4. The Government is authorized to modify by means of Royal Decree the
provisions of section 2 [relating to the number of reference hours for subsidies
granted to PV installations], to adapt it to the evolution of technology. The
possible modifications will only affect the facilities that are not in operation
at the time of the entry into force of said Royal Decree, for what is considered
the date of registration in the register of pre-allocation of remuneration for
photovoltaic installations.’

Two. The first final provision is worded in the following terms:
‘First final provision. Modification of [RD 661/2007] [...].

Table 3 of Article 36 of [RD 661/2007], by which the activity of electricity
production under the special regime is regulated, is amended, substituting, for
the facilities of category b.1.1, the references in the first 25 years’ term for the
first 30 years.”

Forty-fifth final provision. Access of photovoltaic technology to the liquidity
lines of the ICO.

Within the framework of the impulse operations of renewable energies, the
titles of the installations of production of electrical energy with photovoltaic
technology can access the current liquidity lines of the ICO to facilitate
adaptation to its regulatory framework.*”

b. Law 2/2011: The Parties’ positions

404. According to the Claimants, Law 2/2011 “attempted to provide compensation to PV
installations and reassure investors that the regime was stable” by extending the period

during which the FiT was payable to 30 years.“

405. The Claimants further argue that Law 2/2011 “also provided another admission that the

[FiT] extension to 30 years was insufficient.”*#! Specifically, the Claimants contend that

the 45th final provision of Law 2/2011 (quoted above) “recognised that the RDL 14/2010
measures may have impacted negatively the terms of the financing obtained by investors
in developing their PV installations”, and that “Law 2/2011 therefore extended soft loans
or so-called liquidity lines of credit through the Instituto de Crédito Oficial [...], a public

entity that acts as a lender.”4?

The Claimants also argue that the first paragraph of the 44th additional provision was
“patently introduced in order to reassure and re-establish investors’ expectations that the

regulatory regime for PV in Spain was stable.”

According to the Respondent, Law 2/2011 set out the legal criteria for energy regulation,

to be followed in the context of the Spanish economic crisis at that time.*+

The Respondent relies on Article 79(2) of Law 2/2011 (cited above) to the effect that the
regulation of the SES was obliged to take into account different energy demand scenarios

and resources required.*#5

Moreover, relying on Article 79(4) (cited above), the Respondent contends that
Law 2/2011 “emphasizes the immediate link between the planning and the legislation that
regulates public subsidies[.]”##° Consequently, “an alteration of the basic economic data
on which the subsidies are established will necessarily entail an alteration of the level of
said subsidies.”*4’ At the same time, such alterations to subsidies must, according to the
Respondent, ensure the guarantee of a reasonable return.*“* In any event, this provision
required that the regulatory objectives set out in Law 2/2011 be “achieved taking into
account the principles of economic efficiency between the various alternatives and the

economic sustainability of the measures taken.”

c. Subsequent developments

410. On 10 March 2011, Mr. Salvador Armendériz, a member of the Cortes Generales
affiliated with the Navarrese People’s Union, a regional conservative party, made the

following critical statement during parliamentary debates:

[IJn our opinion the Royal Decree and the cutback infringes acquired rights,
causes legal uncertainty and discourages future investment in that sector. As
an example of the problems its approval has caused, look at what it says in the
letter we have seen, signed by two European Commissioners and sent to the
Minister of Industry, Tourism and Trade, on the retroactive nature of the
measure and also the announcement of claims for millions in some foreign
Court - in London to be precise - by foreign investment funds. In the
third place, in our judgment it makes it impossible in many cases for any
investment such as that which has been approved here to be reasonably
profitable. In the fourth place, we consider the measure radically unfair, unfair
because it is disproportionate and unfair because it seems to blame all the
problems of the world of electricity, of which there are many - the tariff deficit
included - on a sector like the photovoltaic industry, which until a few days
ago was a synonym for technological innovation, respect for the environment,
commitment to independent energy and new jobs. In the fifth place, because
any cutback should be preceded by fraud controls, checks on anyone who
entered the sector illegally, on the one hand, and therefore sanctions which
ought to have been applied, on the other. This, ladies and gentlemen, ought to
have been the Government’s first concern, but it has been overwhelmed by
the extent of the loss of control caused by its own energy policy and has opted
to make the people who are least responsible pay for its own mistakes. And
finally, ladies and gentlemen, in the sixth place, because the cutback - as we
have said on previous occasions - means a change, halfway through the game,
of the rules laid down by the Government itself, which may cause the ruin of
thousands of small photovoltaic energy producers, who in my community, of
course, in the Statutory Community of Navarre, acted with the strictest
regard for the law, fair competition and confidence in what had been agreed.**°

411. Mr. Delgado Arce, from the People’s Party, another conservative political party, similarly
considered RDL 14/2010 amounted to “real arbitrariness”, which had been imposed on
the PV sector “with no dialogue [with] a sector that had invested in these energies because

the Government had asked [it] to do so.”4>!

412. In April 2011, the Ministry of Territorial Policies and Public Administration published an
Evaluation of the 2005-2010 PER.**? This document noted, amongst others:

Aside from other considerations that will be examined later, according to
forecasts by the REP managers, photovoltaic technology will be in a condition
to produce under a market parity regimen by around 2020. And, according to
the REP managers, the lowering of related costs that is occurring is good news
for this purpose.

In 2007, photovoltaic technology had already met its overall targets for the
period. According to the REP managers, this early completion was due to the
fact that a regulated tariff system was chosen (up to almost 45 euro cents per
kW/h for facilities with less a 100 kW of installed power), which was an
excess incentive since this is a technology with a great added value in
manufacturing. The solar photovoltaic technology market experienced rapid
expansion during the two intervals of 2006-2007 (350%) and 2007-2008
(180%), as a result of the aforementioned excess incentive situation which,
although it allowed the REP’s installed power targets to be met three years
prior to the plan’s conclusion, it has caused two pernicious effects that have
to be corrected:

The first, an effect of inhibition of investment in technological innovation due
to the existence of profitability ratios for the projects higher (9.1% for
permanent facilities and 9.3% for facilities with monitoring) than those
estimated for calculation of the tariff in RD 661/2007 (7%).

The second, an effect of excess cost for the electricity consumer, which could
involve, according to CNE estimates, between 8.3% and 8.9% in 2007 and
2008, respectively.

This situation, in which the major increase in demand for components for
photovoltaic facilities has not gone hand-in-hand with a similar decrease in
operating costs of facilities, originates in the passing of RD 1578/2008 which,
with the aim of limiting high costs being passed on to electricity consumers,
aims on the one hand to decrease the number of new beneficiary facilities of
the special remuneration regimen, through the established pre-assignment
system and, on the other, to reduce tariffs by adapting them to the evolution
of the technological learning curve.

The players agree with that set out above. The believe that the key to
explaining the targets being exceeded early was the existence of a very
generous premium that guaranteed high profitability for investments in this
sector. In addition, the professional associations state that there has been a lot

of technological development, which would seem contradictory to the tariffs
scare incentive for R&D+1 until 2008.4

413. On 23 May 2011, the consultancy Deloitte issued a report to Grupo T. Solar Global S.A.
for the purpose of assessing the impact of RD 1565/2010 on certain projects of that

company.**4

Concept of reasonable return

+ The regulations governing the implementation of the Special Regime are
based on the concept of reasonable return, which is mentioned in Act 54/1997
on the Electricity Sector yet assigned no specific value.

+ In this report, reasonable return shall be defined as profitability of 7% (before
financing) and after taxes, which is the reference value used in PER 2005-
2010 and by the CNE in its reports.*°°

414. In December 2011, a new version of the “Invest in Spain” report was published, which,

inter alia, stated that the Spanish regulatory framework was “stable, but adaptable to the

current status of each technology as it matures” and that other aids were also available.*°°

415. On 19 December 2011, the newly elected Prime Minister, Mr. Mario Rajoy of the Partido
Popular, gave his speech of investiture before the Spanish Parliament, in which he

referred to the following circumstances, amongst others:

It is important for us to realise Spain has a major energy problem, especially
in the electricity sector, with an annual deficit in excess of 3,000 million
Euros, and an accrued tariff deficit of more than 22,000 million. Electricity
tariffs for domestic consumers are the third most expensive in Europe, and the
fifth highest for industrial consumers. [...]

If reforms are not made, the imbalances will be unsustainable, and increases
in prices and tariffs will place Spain at the greatest disadvantage in terms of
energy costs in the entire developed world. We must therefore introduce
policies based on putting a brake on and reducing the average costs of the
system, take decisions without demagoguery, employ all the technologies

available, without exception, and regulate with the competitiveness of our
economy as our prime objective.**”

416. On 28 December 2011, the CNE issued a press release stating that the CNE was analyzing

the revision of access tolling and certain tariffs and premiums under the Special Regime:

The lack of convergence between the income and costs of regulated activities
in the last ten years has generated a growing debt in the electrical system
which has entailed a progressive increase in the payments for its financing
through the present and future access tolling of electricity consumers as well
as a temporary impact on the indebtedness of those companies that are obliged
to finance the system deficit.

Consequently, the CNE is repeating the need to immediately implement,
amongst other measures, proposals for the regulation of activities, aimed at
getting rid of the system’s structural deficit and mitigating debt financing
costs. Notwithstanding, to attain sufficiency it would be necessary to make
larger scale additional adjustments to the costs of the activities regulated and
to the tolling paid by consumers. An analysis could also be carried out of the
introduction of measures to finance the costs of activities regulated externally
to the access tolling. With this in mind, in its report 18/2011 the Commission
indicated that for the purposes of lessening the impact on the [electricity]
sector of the financing of premiums under a special regime, one possible
option for mitigating the tariff deficit could consider other sources of
financing besides electricity access tolling, debiting other energy sectors or
other sources of income such as the income generated from the auctions of
CO2 emission licenses as from 2013.

In addition, it is deemed necessary to use the quarterly revisions in access
tolling to keep the deficit on the right track and attain sufficiency as soon as
possible as laid down by the regulations in force.***

RDL 1/2012

On 27 January 2012, Spain adopted Royal Decree-Law 1/2012 “implementing the
suspension of the remuneration pre-assignment procedures and the elimination of

economic incentives for new electrical energy production installations based on

cogeneration, renewable energy sources and waste” (“RDL 1/2012”).4°?

This measure does not appear to have been challenged by the Claimants. However, for

the sake of chronological completeness, the Tribunal recounts below its content.

The Respondent notes that RDL 1/2012 was the first measure with the rank of a

Law adopted with regard to reviewing the electricity sector.4
The statement of reasons of RDL 1/2012 provided as follows:

In recent years, the growth achieved thanks to the technologies included in the
special regime has allowed in 2010 the outperformance of the installed power
targets foreseen in the Renewable Energies’ Plan 2005-2010 for wind
technology and in particular for solar thermoelectric and solar photovoltaic
technologies.

However, this high level of development has not been without its critics.
Outperforming the targets has made it clear that there is an imbalance between
the production costs and the value of the premiums, entailing an increase in
the additional cost for the system in terms of premiums for solar technologies
of more than 2000 million in 2010, a figure that will increase by 2000 million
Euros per year as from 2014.

[...] However, the measures adopted to date have not proven sufficient,
putting at risk the ultimate aim of eliminating the tariff deficit as from 2013.

The tariff deficit constitutes, per se, a barrier to the proper development of the
sector as a whole and, in particular for the continuation of the policies to
promote electrical production from high-efficiency and renewable energy
sources.

On the other hand, the power targets for 2020 set out in the recently approved
Renewable Energies’ Plan give the Government significant room for
manoeuvre when setting the implementation schedule for electrical energy
production installations from renewable sources from now on.

It must be added that the present installed generation capacity is enough to
cover the demand expected for the coming years. [...]

“9 RDL 1/2012, 27 January 2012 (R-39). See also Counter-Memorial, para. 739.
+6 Counter-Memorial, para. 738.

127

The complex economic and financial situation would recommend the
temporary elimination of the incentives to build these installations at least
until solving the main problem threatening the economic sustainability of the
electrical system: The tariff deficit of the electrical system.

These measures are consistent with the adjustment measures being undertaken
with a view to getting our economy back on the path to growth.

LJ

In view of the above, it has been deemed opportune to eliminate the
incentivising economic regimes for certain installations under a special regime
and for certain installations under an ordinary regime for the same
technologies as well as the suspension of the remuneration pre-assignment
procedure for them in such a way that the problem of the high tariff deficit in
the electrical system could be tackled in a more favourable environment.
Adopting said measure, the Government opted to limit its remit to installations
under a special regime that have not yet been entered on the Remuneration
pre-assignment Register, with the exception of those assumptions whereby
said circumstance is the consequence of a breach of the relevant resolution
timeframe by the Administration. In a similar way, as far as installations under
an ordinary regime are concerned, not submitted to the pre-assignment
mechanism, it was decided to limit the scope of the measure under terms that
exclude its impact on investments that have already been made.

 

 

This measure must be adopted urgently. [...]

This Royal Decree maintains the remuneration regime set out in the legislation
for installations which are up and running and for those that have been entered
on the Remuneration pre-assignment Register.**!

421. The scope of application of RDL 1/2012 was limited to new RE installations, and did not
apply to installations that had been finally registered in the RAIPRE*, such as the
Claimants’ PV installations. RDL 1/2012 eliminated the economic incentives for new RE

installations.4

On the same day of the issuance of RDL 1/2012, the Cabinet of Ministers published a
press release stating, inter alia, as follows:
The standard is not retroactive, in other words it will not affect installations

that are already operating, premiums that have already been authorised or
installations which are already registered at the pre-assignment registers.’

Moreover, on the same day, the Secretary of State for Energy requested the CNE to
propose measures for regulatory adjustment, to address the increase of the Tariff Deficit
in the electricity sector and to decide on the remuneration of regulated activities in this

sector, amongst others.*5

On 23 February 2012, the president of Iberdrola S.A., Mr. Sanchez Galan, reportedly took
a position in favor of Government reform and called for the reduction of RE subsidies,

whilst noting:

Premiums and feedback: Everything can be modified. We just have to ensure
that the installation has a reasonable return. But this does not mean that the
return should be the cost of capital multiplied by two or three [as is the case
with the present system of premiums].

CNE Report dated 7 March 2012

On 7 March 2012, the CNE issued the report on the Spanish Energy Sector, which was
requested on 27 January 2012 by the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism.**’ The

report contained, inter alia, the following conclusion:

In conclusion, the transition to a retail market model without regulated prices
does not depend on a few isolated conditions, but on the implementation of a
comprehensive set of consistent measures for effective supervision, efficient
operation of contracting and switching mechanisms, and active consumer
participation. Amon the conditions required for this transition to take place as
soon as possible, the following are worth noting:

- Determine the regulatory framework for ensuring economic and financial
sustainability of the system[.] Comparably, while costs to be incorporated
with access fees are established, they should be determined on the basis of
a cost-allocation-based methodology that is objective, stable over time and
that provides for a path of progressive sufficiency of tolls.**

426. With respect to the cost of the Special Regime subsidies, the CNE’s report noted as

follows:

The following measures, which are proposed to be done urgently, would entail
some savings in 2012 [...].

INCREASE OF THE X FACTOR IN THE RATES AND PREMIUMS
DISCOUNTING INDEX [...] MEASURE APPLIED SINCE 2012. TYPE OF
ACTION: ROYAL DECREE. AFFECTS ALL TECHNOLOGIES

The rate or premium that incentivizes those facilities that use renewable
energy sources is updated based on the CPI corrected by an efficiency factor
X.[...]

The proposed measure, which would require a rule with the range of a Royal
Decree, would consist of increasing the value of the efficiency factor X. This
measure maintains the principle of obtaining a reasonable profit contained in
the Law.

Given that the values of the rates and premiums are calculated every year (or
quarter) in reference to the values from the previous period, this measure has
a cumulative economic impact: It would entail an annual reduction of the
overall amount of the equivalent premium of the special regime to the tune of
200 million cumulative Euros starting in 2013.4

427. The CNE report also proposed to consider a cap and floor of the premiums:

3.2.3 CONSIDERATION OF THE CAP AND FLOOR OF THE PREMIUM,
SO THAT WHEN THE MARKET PRICE IS ABOVE THE CAP, THE
PREMIUM IS RETURNED AS TAXABLE INCOME OF THE SYSTEM.
TYPE OF ACTION: LAW

Currently, for various renewable technologies (this is not the case for
photovoltaic, that is remunerated at a tariff rate) a “market plus premium
scheme” is offered whose sum is subject to a cap and floor. The aim is that
consumers and producers share risks in situations where market prices are
stressed upwards or downwards, respectively.

However, effective application of this mechanism is now asymmetric to the
detriment of the consumer: for very high market prices that by themselves are
above the cap, there would be no return of the excess on the cap, as the
producer would retain all of the market price. On the contrary, with depressed

market prices, the premium is complemented to the extent necessary to
achieve the floor level.

The measure proposed, that would require a regulation with the force of a
law [...], would consist in applying the full return to the system as taxable
income of all the amounts that exceeded the cap. This measure preserves the
principle contained in the law of obtaining a reasonable return. [...]

The economic impact of this measure has not been valued, as its application
presupposes a situation of very high prices that would distort the scenarios of
evolution of taxable income normally used, but in this case, the measure would
mean lower costs for the access tariff.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, its economic impact has been partially tested

through the following example based on wind in 2008: wind power facilities

under the market option are remunerated with a premium that varies

depending on the market price; if in a specific time it is greater or equal to the

cap, the facility does not receive a premium, but retains the full market price

for this time.*””
The Claimants contend that the CNE report of 2011 recognized numerous less harmful
ways of addressing the Tariff Deficit, including “‘a tax on the sale of petrol and gas, a tax
on CO2 emissions, and FiT profiling”.47!
The Respondent contends that the CNE, after having consulted the whole Spanish energy
sector, stated that the solution to the problem of the economic unsustainability of the SES
could not exclusively be addressed by increasing the access tolls paid by Spanish
consumers.*”” Furthermore, the Respondent states that “the CNE considered it essential
to adopt different regulatory measures that affected [...] multiple cost and income items

of the SES, which include the cost of the subsidies for renewables.”

Supreme Court Judgments regarding challenges against RD 1565/2010 and
RDL 14/2010

From April 2012 onwards, the Supreme Court rendered a series of decisions in appeal

proceedings brought by RE producers against RD 1565/2010 and RDL 14/2010.4*

431. Amongst others, RE producers contended that the changes introduced by RD 1565/2010
and RDL 14/2010 were retroactive and violated the principle of legitimate expectations

under Spanish law.

432. The Supreme Court rejected these challenges. Regarding the allegation of illegal

retroactivity, it held that:

The concept of ‘prohibited retroactivity’ is much more limited than that of
mere ‘retroactivity’ even though the latter is used frequently in the non-legal
debate [...].

Furthermore, it is true that for those who are not familiar with the use of legal
categories, the distinctions between a minimum, medium or maximum level
of retroactivity or the adjectives ‘proper’ and ‘improper’ applied to said term,
are usually ignored and everything is encompassed within an undifferentiated
notion of negative connotations, applied to regulatory measures endowed with
a very different remit. [...]

[T]he remit of prohibited retroactivity does not include provisions which,
lacking any ablative or pejorative effects towards the past (they do not require
the revision nor removal of past facts, they do not alter the reality already
experienced over time and they do not annul the legal effects exhausted), they
deploy their immediate effectiveness looking towards the future even if this
means impacting a relationship or legal situation which are still in progress.

 

Based on this premise, a regulatory measure such as the one challenged in the
present litigation, whose effectiveness is not planned ‘back’ in time but rather
‘forward’, once it has been approved, does not fall within the remit of
prohibited retroactivity. The projection towards the future is worthy of
particular note in this case, simply notifying that the ‘real’ effects of the
measure will occur within thirty years, until which time the regulated tariff, in
line with its original terms, is maintained for the owners of photovoltaic
installations. Classifying as retroactive over time something which, approved
today, will not be fully effective within thirty years is an example of an
inappropriate use of said adjective. Retroactivity would occur if the new
regulation required the owners of photovoltaic installations to return the
amount of those tariffs already received in previous financial years, but not
when it merely stipulates that their receipt will cease within thirty years.
Strictly speaking, it could not even be classified as a retroactive measure and
all the less so if we use this legal concept in its ‘proper’ sense.*”

433. Regarding producers’ legitimate expectations claim, the Supreme Court noted that the
regulatory regime provided under RD 661/2007, including the provisions relating to the
regulated tariff for an indefinite period of time after 25 years of operation of a PV facility,
were limited by the “implicit” restriction arising from the (limited) operating life of a

standard RE facility:

[T]he owners of electrical energy production installations under a special
regime do not have an ‘unmodifiable right’ to maintain unchanged the
economic regime regulating the receipt of its remunerations when they
themselves have decided not to opt for the market (a possibility which is still
open to them) but rather to benefit from a public system setting said
remunerations.

The virtual elimination of the entrepreneurial risk involved when subjected to
the regulated tariff, without competing pricewise with the other agents on the
market is, per se, an advantage over those electricity sector operators subject
to the fluctuations of free competition, an advantage whose reverse it is
precisely, inter alia, the possibility of altering the administrative measures in
the event of changes to subsequent circumstances (respecting some minimum
returns which are not relevant here).

Private operators or agents who ‘renounce’ the market, even if they do so more
or less ‘induced’ by the generous remuneration offered to them by the
regulatory framework, without any recompense for assuming major risks,
were aware or should have been aware that said public regulatory framework,
approved at a given time, in the same way as it was consistent with the
conditions of the economic scenario in force at that time and with the
electricity demand forecasts made at that time, could not subsequently be
immune to any relevant modifications to basic economic data in the light of
which it is logical for the public authorities to keep in step with the new
circumstances. If these entail adjustments in many other production sectors,
with obvious difficulties for their activity, it is not unreasonable for them also
to extend to the renewable energies’ sector which wished to keep receiving
the regulated tariffs instead of opting for the market mechanisms (bilateral
contracting and sale on the organised market). And this is all the more so in
the event of situations involving a widespread economic crisis and, in the case
of electrical energy, in view of the growth in the tariff deficit which, to a
certain degree, derives from the impact that the remuneration of the former
has on the calculation of access fees by way of the regulated tariff insofar as
it is a cost imputable to the electricity system.

The economic regime stipulated administratively endeavours to promote the
use of renewable energies by incorporating incentivising measures which, as
their permanence without any modifications in the future is not ensured, as we
have just set out, is based on a series of implicit assumptions which any
diligent market operator - or who had opted for prior quality consulting —
could not be unaware of.

One of said implicit constraints is that the promotional measures (in this case,
the receipt of a very favourable regulated tariff) cannot be regarded as
‘lifelong’ or unlimited over time. It is not reasonable to assume that
[RD 661/2007] guarantees the receipt of the regulated tariff for an infinite

133

period, in other words, without any time limit. On the contrary, even when
there is talk — in its original version — of a period ‘subsequent’ to the 25 years,
it can easily be assumed that this implicitly set as a ceiling or termination the
final date of the working life of the photovoltaic installations[.][...]

[...] Hence, the updating and revision system for tariffs, premiums and
complements set out in article 44 of [RD 661/2007] and specified in article 36
of the same Royal Decree for category b) installations may be modified by
[RD 1565/2010] whose determinations are not subject to that laid down by the
previous one. As there are no regulatory hierarchy relations between both, it
can hardly be asserted that the precept contained in one Royal Decree
‘breaches’ precepts of another which is just as equally binding: it does not
breach them but rather it derogates or modifies them, a clearly distinct legal
effect.47°

the Supreme Court based on similar grounds.*””

at a particular moment in time must remain unaltered, at other moments in time, cannot be shared. Depending on
changing economic and other circumstances, a rate of return percentage viewed as ‘reasonable’ in a first
instance, May require subsequent adjustments precisely in order to maintain the ‘reasonableness’ when faced with

441. The regulatory impact analysis report contained a chapter titled “legal analysis”, which
noted that the tax on the value of the production of electric power “taxes the realization

of energy production activities in the Spanish electricity system, which will mean greater

tax revenues and will promote a balanced budget.”4!

442. On 14 October 2012, the Minister of Industry, Energy and Tourism, Mr. Jose Manuel

Soria gave an interview in which he made the following statements:

[Q] The Secretary of State for Energy acknowledged this week that the
Minister had been under ‘tremendous pressure’ to reform the electric sector.

[A] It’s normal that the measures we have taken to tighten the reins on the
electric deficit haven’t pleased the companies, both with regard to the ordinary
arrangements as well as special arrangements. Why? Because there is part of
the deficit that they are going to take on, just as there is part of it that is going
to be taken on by the State and the consumers. The Government has to defend
the general interest, which is to have an electric system that is sustainable from
the environmental point of view, as well as economically and financially. If
we do not control the deficit, it will keep accumulating in the financial
balances of the companies, which are not obliged to absorb the cost, and the
State is committed to paying off interest of more than EUR2,000 million each
year. Therefore, although no one likes these measures, they are totally
essential. [...]

[Q] Is the Government able to prevent the electric companies from passing on
the increased costs in the bills they send to consumers?

[A] The taxes on the electric system have not been established in such a way
that the adjustment the companies have to bear would be passed on to the
consumers. The measures are there so that the companies pay the taxes and so
that they are they are the ones that bear the adjustment. We are going to make
the market work.

[Q] All energy sector stakeholders agree that what has been approved so far is
not a reform of the sector, but only tax rises.

[A] When the reform to introduce fiscal measures was put in place, this was
done to put an end to the generation of new deficit rates in 2013 and

subsequent years. The reform of the sector comes now, after generation of
deficit is controlled, and we can get into the regulatory framework.

[Q] Was there no other way?

[A] The Supreme Court has supported the reduction in the number of hours
paid at a premium rate for photovoltaic energy. We could have opted for a
reduction in premiums but we opted instead for the fiscal measures. There
were distinct alternatives on the table, it’s true, but finally the one that I took
to the Council of Ministers was the one for a tax on generation, of a fixed type.
It’s true that the possibility of a variable type was considered, one that
functions in various ways, not by technology, but according to the price to the
consumer.

[Q] Will these measures put an end to the deficit rate in 2013?
[A] Yes.
LJ

[Q] And do these measures make it possible to lower premiums on renewable
energy?

[A] That issue has not been raised at the moment, but certainly the Supreme
Court has opened a door.*””

443. On 27 December 2012, the Cortes Generales passed Law 15/2012 on fiscal measures for

energy sustainability and which entered into force on 1 January 2013 (“Law 15/2012”).

444. Amongst others, Law 15/2012 introduced a 7% tax on the value of the production of

electricity (the “T'WPEE™**) that was applicable to all revenues (including the FiT)

received by both traditional and RE producers.***
445. Inits preamble, Law 15/2012 stated, inter alia, as follows:

The objective of this Law is to harmonise our tax system with a more efficient
and respectful use of the environment and sustainable development, values
which inspire this tax reform, and as such, bring it into line with the basic
principles that govern the tax, energy and of course the environmental policy
of the European Union.

[...] one of the linchpins of this tax reform shall be the internalization of the
environmental costs that derive from the production of electricity [...].“°°

With respect to the TVPEE, the preamble of Law 15/2012 pursued:

For this purpose and also with a view to favouring budgetary balance, Title I
of this Act establishes a tax on the value of the production of electrical energy,
of a direct and real nature, which is levied on the performance of activities of
production and incorporation into the electricity system of electrical energy in
the Spanish electricity system.

This tax will be levied on the economic capacity of electrical energy producers
whose installations give rise to significant investments in the electrical energy
transport and distribution networks in order to be able to evacuate the energy
loaded thereto, and entail, by themselves or as results of the existence and
development of the said networks, unquestionable environmental effects, as
well as the generation of highly significant costs necessary for maintaining the
guarantee of supply. The tax will be applied to the production of all generation
installations.“

Law 15/2012: The Parties’ positions

According to the Claimants, the TVPEE “amounts to a disguised tariff cut” for RE
installations and to “an additional limitation to the RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008

economic regimes.”497

Specifically, the Claimants argue that the TVPEE is not a bona fide taxation measure of
general application. First, according to the Claimants, the fact that Law 15/2012 applies
to all RE producers is inconsistent with the stated objective of the Law, which was to
harmonize the Spanish tax system “with a more efficient and respectful use of the
environment and sustainable development” (preamble).*°* Second, Law 15/2012 was
particularly harmful to RE producers, as they operate in a regulated regime and cannot
pass the effect of the TVPEE to the consumer.*” Third, the TVPEE has effects equivalent
to a further limitation to the FiTs under RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008, and the real

purpose of the tax was to balance the budget of the SES, a measure that the government

RDL 2/2013 — Disputed Measure

RDL 2/2013: Context and most relevant provisions

measures in the energy sector and in the financial sector (“RDL 2/2013”).5*

The preamble of RDL 2/2013 stated:

The main source of revenue of the electricity system, in order to finance the
various cost items, are access tolls applied to the final consumers of electricity.

In recent years, the expansive evolution of cost items of the electricity system
has been causing the appearance of imbalances between these costs and the
revenues from regulated prices. In order to correct the imbalances, in 2012 a
series of urgent measures affecting both items were taken.

The data reported by the National Energy Commission in its report 35/2012
of the 20th of December on the order proposal establishing the access tolls are
established from the Ist of January 2013 and tariffs and premiums of special
regime facilities, has revealed the appearance of new deviations in estimates
of costs and revenues caused by various factors, both for the end of 2012 and
2013, that in the current economic context, would render almost unfeasible
their coverage with electric tolls and the items prescribed from the State
General Budget.

could have, but chose not to, achieve by cutting the FiT directly, as shown in the interview
of Minister Soria.*° Fourth, Spain’s conduct allegedly demonstrated that the TVPEE was
not a real tax measure, but a tariff cut, because the money raised by the TVPEE went to

the State budget and an identical amount was then returned to the electricity system.>”!

According to the Respondent, the TVPEE is a measure of general application that affects
both renewable and conventional energy producers.°°? The Respondent further argues that
the impact of the TVPEE has been neutralized, as the TVPEE is one of the costs

remunerated to RE producers through the specific remuneration (premiums) that they

On 1 February 2013, the Government adopted Royal Decree-Law 2/2013 on urgent

para. 380;

These deviations are due largely to a higher growth in the cost of the special
regime, due to an increase in the operation hours exceeding the projected and
an increase in the compensation values after indexing to the Brent price, and
a reduction of toll revenues due to a very sharp drop in demand which is
consolidated for this exercise.

The proposed alternative would be a further increase in access tolls paid by
electricity consumers. This measure would affect directly household
economies and corporal competitiveness, both in a delicate situation, given
the current economic situation.

Given this scenario, in order to alleviate this problem the Government has
decided to adopt certain cost-reduction urgent measures to avoid the
assumption of a new effort by consumers; helping them, through consumption
and investment, to collaborate as well for the economic recovery.

Consequently, with the purpose of using a more stable index which is not
affected by the volatility of unprocessed foods no those from domestic fuels,
all those remuneration updating methodologies that are linked to CPI shall
substitute it by the Consumption Price Index to constant taxes with no
unprocessed food nor energy products.*°°

452. On this basis, RDL 2/2013 replaced the CPI in the FiT inflation adjustment formula under
RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 with the Consumer Price Index “at constant taxes

excluding unprocessed foods or energy products”.*°°

b. | RDL 2/2013: The Parties’ positions

453. According to the Claimants, RDL 2/2013 had “a limited effect in practice as a result of:
(a) the existence of deflation in Spain after February 2013; and (b) the fact that the new
index was in force only for six months. The intention was nevertheless clear: to cut the
(FiT]."5°7

454. Elsewhere in their Memorial the Claimants state that “the new index reduced [FiTs] for

PV plants by about three percentage points.”>°*

According to the Respondent, the amendment of the consumer price index introduced by
RDL 2/2013 was justified from both scientific and legal standpoints.>® Indeed, the only
methodological change introduced by RDL 2/2013 consisted in “modifying the general
CPI for a type of underlying CPI at constant taxes.”*!° According to the Respondent, the
use of consumer price indexes at constant taxes is “broadly provided for in world
economics doctrine”, as recognized by the International Monetary Fund.*!! A CPI at
constant taxes also avoids distortions of the general index, which may be caused by the
volatility of some of its elements, as recognised, inter alia, by the Organisation for

Economic Co-operation and Development.*!”

The Respondent further argues that the modification of the CPI had been recommended
by the CNE, amongst others, in its report dated 7 March 2012 (referred to above at

paragraph 425),>!3

The Respondent also relies on the fact that the Spanish Supreme Court subsequently ruled
that RDL 2/2013 was in compliance with the Spanish Constitution because the price

indexes “have no reason to be the same for the different activities or to remain unaltered

over time.”5!*

In March 2013, the Commission issued a renewable energy progress report, which

contained the following observation:

Many national reforms have had a negative impact on the investment climate.
Most critical have been changes that reduce the return on investments already
made. Such changes alter the legitimate expectations of business and clearly
discourage investment, at a time when significantly more investment is
needed. Thus there is a need for guidance on the reform process itself, to

10. RDL 9/2013 — Disputed Measure

a. RDL 9/2013: Context and most relevant provisions

459. On 12 July 2013, the Government adopted Royal Decree-Law 9/2013 “which sets forth
urgent measures to ensure the financial stability of the electricity system” and which

entered into force on 14 July 2013 (“RDL 9/2013”).5'°
460. In its preamble, RDL 9/2013 stated, inter alia, as follows:

Since [Law 54/1997] began the process of liberalisation in the activities of
electricity generation and marketing, the electricity sector model in Spain has
been articulated on the principles of revenue sufficiency and receiving an
adequate remuneration for the various actors involved.

The ratification by Spain of the European Energy Charter Treaty dated
11 December 1997 and the continuous incorporation in our domestic law of
the Community legal system has involved, in turn, the assumption of the
principles that are its essence, and, therefore, the promotion of renewable
energies, the creation of conditions that promote the use of energy in the most
economical manner with utmost respect for the environment and the
encouragement of energy efficiency.

Together with these principles that define the model, the public intervention
through the regulation aims to ensure the security of supply, assuming that the
functioning of the market enables the economic and financial sustainability of
the electricity sector, and that the various actors involved must accommodate
the specific circumstances of a changing sector, if necessary for the sake of
guaranteeing the former.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Spanish electricity system has generated a
tariff deficit for a decade, which, over the passage of time, has adopted a
structural nature, due to the fact that the actual costs related to regulated
activities and the operation of the electricity sector are higher than the
collection of the tolls set by the Government, which are paid by consumers

Between 2004 and 2012, the electricity system’s income from consumer fees
has increased by 122%, while the increase in the system’s regulated costs in
the same period has been 197 percent. Prominent among the cost items that
have most contributed to such an increase are the special scheme premiums
and the accumulated deficit annual payments, items that have multiplied by
six and nine respectively during the said period.

According to the latest data provided by the National Electricity Commission,
as of 10 May 2013 there is an accumulated debt of 26,062.51 million euros.

516 RDL 9/2013, 12 July 2013 (R-43)/(C-115), Ninth final provision: “This Royal Decree-Law shall come into
force the day following its publication in the ‘Official State Gazette’.” See also Memorial, paras. 31, 191, 215-
219, 221-242, 398; Reply, para. 380; Counter-Memorial, paras. 323, 655-663, 791-814, 899, 907, 1164, 1207;
Rejoinder, paras. 225, 838-849, 861-888, 948.

142

In addition to the calculation of the electricity system debt, the Commission
notes that from 2003 to 10 May 2013 the amount paid out to fund the deficit
of the electricity system by means of the annual payments which are included
in consumers’ access fees, in current prices for each year, amounts to 11,823
million euros.

These figures testify to the unsustainable nature of the electricity sector debt
and to the need to adopt urgent and immediately-applicable measures that
make it possible to bring such a situation to an end.

Based on the fundamental issues that justify public intervention in the
industry, and in order to correct the imbalances produced by the rapid growth
of the electricity system’s costs, in recent years a series of urgent measures
have been adopted which have affected both costs and revenues.*!”

461. Based on the foregoing, the preamble pursued:

First of all, the Government is empowered to adopt a new legal and economic
scheme for the existing electricity production facilities based on renewable
energy sources, cogeneration, and waste. Therefore, the Government amends
Article 30.4 of [Law 54/1997], in order to introduce the specific principles that
shall articulate such regime, in order to narrow the scope of action of the
Government in the development of remuneration systems for these facilities.
It shall be based on receiving the revenue derived from participation in the
market, with an additional return that, if necessary, shall cover those
investment costs that an efficient and well-managed company does not recover
in the market. In this sense, according to community case law, a company shall
be deemed as being efficient and well-managed if it has the necessary means
for the development of its field, whose costs are those of an efficient enterprise
in that field and considering the corresponding revenue and a reasonable profit
for the execution of its functions. The aim is to ensure that the high costs of
an inefficient company are not taken as reference.

In this way the goal is to cover the additional costs of these facilities those of
the rest of technologies in the market.

This framework shall articulate a remuneration that shall allow renewable
energy, cogeneration, and waste facilities to cover the costs necessary to
compete in the market at an equal level with the rest of technologies and get a
reasonable rate of return.

In order to calculate the specific remuneration, the following shall be
considered for a standard facility: the proceeds from the sale of the energy
generated, valued at the market production price, the medium operating that
are necessary to carry out the activity, and the value of the initial investment
of the standard facility, all of this for an efficient and well-managed company.
This establishes a remuneration scheme on standard parameters per the
various standard facilities that are established.

517 RDL 9/2013, 12 July 2013 (R-43)(C-115), p. 1.

143

LJ

Furthermore, [Law 54/1997], stipulates the regulation on the concept of
reasonable rate of return, setting it, in line with the legal principles on the
particular case law developed within the last few years, within project
profitability that will be focused, prior to taxes, on the average yield in the
secondary market of State Obligations within ten years, by applying the
appropriate differential.>!*

462. Thus, RDL 9/2013 amended Article 30(4) of Law 54/1997, providing, inter alia, that the
Special Regime facilities “may receive a specific remuneration ... composed of an
amount per unit of installed capacity. Such amount shall cover, as appropriate, the
investment costs of a standard installation that cannot be recovered through the sale of
energy, as well as an amount for the operation of the installation to cover, as the case may
be, the difference between exploitation costs and the revenues obtained from the

participation of such a standard installation in the market”>!” (the “Special Payment”).

463. RDL 9/2013 consequently repealed RD 661/2007, thereby eliminating the FiT and

premiums for both new and existing RE installations.*”°
464. As regards the new economic regime, the second final provision of RDL 9/2013 provided:

At the proposal of the Minister of Industry, Energy and Tourism, the
Government, shall approve a Royal Decree of regulation of the legal and
economic schemes for electricity production facilities from renewable sources
of energy, cogeneration and waste with feed-in remuneration which shall
amend the remuneration model of the existing facilities.

This new model shall be adjusted to the criteria laid down in Article 30 of
[Law 54/1997], introduced by this Royal Decree-Law and shall be
implemented from the entry into force of this Royal Decree-Law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the specific remuneration schemes set for the
facilities of solar thermal energy technology awarded the scheme provided for
in the third additional provision of [RD 1565/2010], which regulates and
modifies certain aspects related to the field of the production of electricity
under special regimes, shall consist of a single term of the operation whose
value shall be the result of the economic offer for which they are the successful
bidders.**!

RDL 9/2013 and related subsequent measures (including Law 24/2013, Order
TET/1045/2014, and Royal Decree 413/2014)) are hereinafter referred to as the New

Regime.

The Special Payment remuneration regime introduced by the modified Article 30(4) of
Law 54/1997 was not to exceed the minimum level required to allow RE producers to
obtain a reasonable return which henceforth was to be defined every six years “by
reference to the standard installation” and over the regulatory life of PV facilities.*°? Such
reasonable return was to be determined by reference to the average return in the secondary
market of Spain’s ten-year bonds increased by 300 basis points*** (and which was
ultimately fixed at 7.398%°*4), RDL 9/2013 also provided that the remuneration schemes
established by RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 would continue to apply on a temporary
basis until the adoption of a new legal framework.** This was referred to as the “interim

period.”56

On 4 September 2013, the CNE issued its Report 18/2013 on the Royal Decree proposal
regulating the activity of electricity production from renewable energy sources,
cogeneration and waste, i.e., the draft regulations that were to be adopted based on

RDL 9/2013 (“CNE Report 18/2013”).°”
With respect to the new proposed methodology, CNE Report 18/2013 noted:

The proposal develops the change of the remuneration model applicable to
facilities that produce electricity from renewable energy sources, cogeneration
and waste which is already established in the recent [RDL 9/2013]. This

publication of Order IET/1045/2014 a settlement process began whereby facilities were required to refund, with
backdated effect, any regulated incentive collected in excess of the specific remuneration corresponding to the ...
interim period.” First KPMG Report, para. 302. Prof. Spiller further explains that upon the adoption of Order
IET/1045/2014, “a ‘claw-back’ payment was implemented requiring power plants or Spain, as applicable, to return
the difference between the payments actually received in the Interim Period and the payments that the power plants
would have received under the June 2014 Order.” First Compass Lexecon Report, para. 28.

model is new, as it is not reflected in the EU and must be developed by
ministerial order that will set some parameters which are difficult to specify
and quantify, particularly for existing facilities.

LJ

The economic incentives were envisaged in [Law 54/1997], such that the
facilities that use renewable energy sources, cogeneration and waste attain
reasonable profitability, taking into account the cost of money in the capital
markets. At the same time, these incentives were designed to incentivise
electricity production through innovative and immature technologies.

However, Royal Decree-Law 9/2013 modifies the structure of these
incentives: it establishes specific remuneration with a fixed term per installed
power unit, completed, as applicable, with an operation term, so that the
facilities receive the market price signal more clearly. The new methodology
aims to promote these energies by means of economic incentives calculated
so that the facility obtains reasonable profitability financed with its own funds.
This profitability is defined before taxes as the rate on ten-year state bonds in
the secondary market, increased with a spread of 300 basis points.***

  

469. As regards the design of the economic incentives under the New Regime, the CNE noted:

This Commission considers that the design of the aforementioned economic
incentives must be based on the definition of some adequate efficacy
(achievement of the objectives set) and efficiency parameters (ensuring that
said achievement is performed at the lowest possible cost). In this sense, it
must be indicated that there is no record of a remuneration model similar to
that reflected in the proposal in any jurisdiction of the European Union, or in
other countries whose support systems are known through international
associations of regulatory bodies. The new methodology could ensure
reasonable profitability insofar as it offers additional remuneration to facilities
during their useful lifespan, which would level the playing field so that they
can participate in the market, also receiving the market price signal with no
distortions.

The new methodology incorporates regular reviews of the specific
remuneration in order to ensure the obtainment of the so-called reasonable
profitability, avoiding under-remunerations and also over-remunerations;
however, it also presents great uncertainties for its application to the
approximately 60,000 existing facilities, as its application depends on a series
of standard parameters which will be defined in the implementing order of the
Royal Decree.

The specific remuneration is composed of two terms: one relating to the
investment and another to the operation. The first is a term per installed power
unit which aims to cover the investment costs of a standard facility which
cannot be recovered by the sale of energy, while the second is a term per

renewable energy, cogeneration and waste sources, 4 September 2013 (C-117), p. 3.

146

energy unit to cover the larger operation costs in relation to the revenue from
the participation of said standard facility in the market.*”

470. CNE Report 18/2013 also criticized the time span initially allotted for the public
consultation process relating to the regulations that were to implement the New Regime
whilst stating that it had previously not raised objections to the new remuneration

mechanism adopted under RDL 9/2013 during the preparation of RDL 9/2013:

It is considered that, with the urgent procedure with which the query is raised,
coinciding in time with an Electricity Sector Draft Bill and several Royal
Decrees and orders, the effective participation of the different agents involved
is not guaranteed.

On 31 July 2013, the Board of the Spanish National Energy Commission
approved Report 16/2013 on the ‘Electricity Sector Draft Bill’, which
included the ‘specific remuneration’ mechanism contained in [RDL 9/2013]
on which the proposal is based. The [CNE] did not raise any objections to this
mechanism, although it proposed to amend its form in the sense that the
incentives established only had a set component (per unit of installed power),
in order to make the market price signal more transparent for the owners.**°

b. | RDL 9/2013: The Parties’ positions

471. The Claimants argue that RDL 9/2013 “wipe[d] out the existing economic regime for RE
installations including, of course, the PV farms.”>*! The Claimants criticize the fact that
the New Regime was implemented by means of a Royal Decree-Law, which meant that
“the Government avoided the mandatory public consultation process”, including
consultations with the CNE.**? According to the Claimants, when the CNE finally issued
its opinion, it observed that “the New Regime marked a ‘comple[te] change’ of the

regulatory framework for the RE sector,” noting the absence of an effective involvement

of all relevant stakeholders in the rulemaking process as of 2013.°°3

The Claimants further argue that RDL 9/2013 “also made substantial modifications” to
Law 54/1997 and in particular, Article 30(4) of Law 54/1997, which “significantly
altere[d] the regime that was in place at the time the Claimants made their investment and

upon which they legitimately relied.”***

Specifically, the Claimants emphasize the following features of the amended

Article 30(4) of Law 54/1997.

First, according to the Claimants, the concept of “reasonable return” had no defined
meaning under Law 54/1997. Rather, the reasonable profitability was guaranteed by the
Special Payment provided for under “the Royal Decrees implemented pursuant to the
1997 Electricity Law.”°*> The New Regime constituted a radical change that bears no
relation to the prior regime. Under the New Regime, Spain has set the reasonable return
at 7.398% pre-tax return on the costs of a standard installation.>*° Under the amended
text, the reception of a remuneration in addition to the market price for PV installations

is at the Government’s discretion, rather than constituting a “legal obligation.”°*’

Second, the Claimants argue that under the New Regime, Spain implemented a “hitherto
non-existent cap on profitability” (citing Law 24/2013), whereas the previous legal
framework had granted the Government “broad discretion to decide how the goal to allow
RE generators to earn a ‘reasonable return’ would be achieved[,] which in practice was

implemented by incentivizing production.”>**

Third, the Claimants submit that whilst RD 661/2007 and 1578/2008 had incentivized the
owners of PV plants to maximize efficiency and productivity when constructing their
plants, the New Regime “operates to appropriate any efficiencies that Claimants may have
achieved” under the previous regime, by calculating the Special Payment by reference to
the investment costs of a Standard Installation, which are based on benchmarks that are

too low and are applied with hindsight.>°°

Fourth, the enjoyment of the Special Payment, according to the Claimants, is now subject
to “certain conditions” and based “only in part” on energy production, “unlike the [FiTs],

which were solely based on energy production.”>4?

Fifth, “RDL 9/2013 puts a definitive end to the stability of the regime[,]” in that the
Special Payment is “subject to governmental discretion” and may be changed every six

years, with certain calculation parameters subject to change every three years.**!

According to the Respondent, the measures adopted in 2013 and 2014, including
RDL 9/2013, were reasonable, proportionate and otherwise lawful, because the New
Regime maintains the essential elements of the remuneration system envisaged by
Law 54/1997, in particular, by guaranteeing a reasonable return to the investors.*4” As
regards specifically RDL 9/2013, the Respondent posits that it embodies the principle of
proportionality, as Article 1(two) of this act provides that the remuneration under the New
Regime “shall not exceed the minimum required level to cover the costs that are necessary
for installations to compete on an equal footing with the rest of the technologies in the

market in order to allow those installations to obtain a reasonable return [...]”°“7

As regards the Claimants’ criticism regarding the alleged lack of consultation, the

contents of the draft bill, many of which were accepted into the draft[.]”°**

Law 24/2013 — Disputed Measure

Law 24/2013: Context and most relevant provisions
On 1 October 2013, the Government instructed consultancy companies Roland Berger

and Boston Consulting Group to assist in defining assumptions under the new legal

regime for RE producers.

On 17 December 2013, the newly-created CNMC (defined above at paragraph 150),
which replaced the CNE, adopted a report on the decree proposal regulating the activity
of electricity production from renewable energy sources, cogeneration and waste

(the “2013 CNMC Report”).**°
The CNMC Report noted that the new proposed draft text contained improvements:

This Commission looks favourably on the consideration of the observations
made by the former National Commission of Energy, now known as CNMC,
which were produced in the Report 18/2013. In particular, in the project:

- Some remuneration groups/sub-groups considered in Royal Decree
661/2007 have been recovered.

- It is now unequivocally specified to what electricity production refers; this
aspect is not expressly defined in the previous version.

484. On 26 December 2013, Spain enacted Law 24/2013 on the electricity sector
(“Law 24/2013”) 548

485. The preamble of Law 24/2013 provides, inter alia, as follows:

Sixteen years on from the coming into force of Law 54 enacted on November
27th 1997, a large part of its aims can essentially be said to have been fulfilled.
The safety and quality level of supply is high, in view of the level of
investment made in networks in recent years and the existence of a mixture of
diversified energy sources, especially if we bear in mind the isolated nature of
the system owing to the physical configuration of the territory itself. In turn,
the liberalisation process has developed more quickly than that required by
European Directives, enabling consumers to choose their own supplier.
Finally, this whole process has been framed within the environmental
protection principles of a modern society.

With this in mind, Law 54 enacted on November 27th 1997 made a notable
contribution to compliance with the commitments set out in the Energy and
Climate change package which set as targets for 2020 a reduction in
greenhouse gas effects by 20 percent in the European Union compared with
the 1990 figure, the attainment of a 20 percent contribution by renewable
energies to primary energy and the accomplishment of a 20 percent
improvement in energy efficiency.*”

486. At the same time, the preamble notes:

Notwithstanding, during this period there have been fundamental changes in
the [Electricity] Sector which have brought about continuous action by the
legislator and have led to the need to endow the electrical system with a new
normative framework. In this regard, it is worth highlighting the high level of
investment in transmission and distribution networks, the high penetration of
renewable electrical generation technologies, the evolution of the wholesale
electricity market with the appearance of new agents and an increase in the
complexity of the offers and the emergence of excess capacity at combined
cycle gas thermal power stations, also required to back up the system. A
decisive element for undertaking this reform was also the accumulation during
the last decade of annual imbalances between the income and costs of the
electrical system which has brought about the appearance of a_structural
deficit.

The causes of this imbalance lie in the excessive growth of certain costs’ items
owing to energy policy decisions without ensuring their correlative income
from the system. This has all been exacerbated by the lack of growth in
electrical demand, essentially the consequence of the economic crisis.”

487. In addition, the preamble continues:

Law 54 enacted on November 27th 1997 has proven insufficient to ensure the
financial balance of the system, amongst other reasons because the
remuneration system for regulated activities has lacked the flexibility required
for its adaptation to major changes in the electrical system or in the evolution
of the economy.

Hence, the experience of the last decade has made it clear that the economic
and financial instability of the electrical system, brought about by the tariff
deficit, has prevented the assurance of a stable regulatory framework which is
necessary for the smooth carrying out of an activity like the electrical business
which is very capital intensive.

Hence, the economic unsustainability of the electrical system, along with the
continuous evolution in the sector during the last sixteen years, has required
the legislator to adapt, on numerous occasions, Law 54 enacted on November
27th 1997 regarding the [Electricity] Sector, often through the approval of
urgent measures by Royal Decree and at present there is a normative
dispersion which is not desirable in such a relevant economic sector.

LJ

Essentially, the continuous normative changes have entailed_an important
distortion to the normal operation of the electrical system and which needs to
be corrected through action by the legislator which lends the regulatory
stability that electrical activity requires. This regulatory safety, combined with

would recommend the approval of an overall reform of the sector, based on a
new income and expenses regime for the electrical system which tries to return
to the system the financial inability it lost a long time ago and whose
eradication has not been achieved to date through the adoption of partial
measures.**!

 

488. Moreover, the preamble announces the abolition of the distinction between the Ordinary

and the Special Regime based on the following grounds:

The high penetration of production technologies deriving from renewable
energy sources, cogeneration and waste, included in the so-called special
regime for electrical energy production, has meant that its unique regulation
connected with power and its technology lacks any object. By contrast, it
makes it necessary for regulation to consider these installations in a similar
way to those of other technologies which will be integrated into the market
and, in any case, for them to be considered because of their technology and
impacts on the system, rather than because of their power which is why the
differentiated concepts of ordinary and special regime are abandoned. This is
why unified regulation is being carried out without prejudice to any unique
considerations which need to be established.**?

489. Based on these considerations, Law 24/2013 provides that remuneration under the new
legal regime should be “compatible with the need to guarantee the technical and economic
sustainability of the electric[ity] system as a whole.”°>? Further, Law 24/2013 provides
that:

The remuneration regime will not exceed the minimum level required to cover
costs which allow production installations from renewable energy sources,
high-efficiency and waste cogeneration to compete on an equal footing with
the other technologies on the market and which allows a reasonable return to
be earned on the installation type in each licable case. This
return will refer, before tax, to the mean yield on the secondary market for
Ten-Year State Bonds, applying the appropriate differential.**

490. Law 24/2013 further provided for a mechanism meant to cover temporary mismatches

between system income and costs:

1. It will be assumed there have been temporary mismatches between the
income and costs of the electrical system if, as a result of the closing
settlements of the electrical system in a financial year, there is an income
deficit or surplus.

2. In the event that there is a mismatch owing to an income deficit in a financial
year, its amount may not exceed 2 percent of the estimated income of the
system for said financial year.

In addition, the accumulated debt owing to mismatches from previous
financial years cannot exceed 5 percent of the estimated income of the system
for said financial year.

Any relevant tolling, where applicable, or debits will be revised at least for a
total equivalent to the amount by which they exceed said limits.

3. That part of the mismatch which, without exceeding said limits, is not offset
by an increase in tolling and debits will be financed by the legal entities of the
settlement system in a manner proportional to the remuneration pertaining to
them for the activity they carry out [...}°°

  

491. While maintaining the reference made in RDL 9/2013 to the ten-year government bonds
increased by 300 basis points for purposes of calculating the reasonable return,
Law 24/2013 also confirmed that the reasonable return would be determined based on the

“regulatory life of the installation”:

Under the terms foreseen in Royal Decree 9 enacted on July 12th 2013,
whereby urgent measures were adopted to ensure the financial stability of the
electrical system, to out into place this new remuneration regime the
reasonable return throughout the regulatory life of the installation will be
based, before tax, on the mean yield on the secondary market for the ten years
prior to the coming into force of Royal Decree 9 enacted on July 12th 2013
regarding 10-year State Bonds plus 300 base points, all without prejudice to
its subsequent revision under the terms foreseen by law.**°

492. This is what the Claimants challenge in their submissions as the “claw back” effect of the
New Regime, as in practice this provision means that past payments exceeding the
periodically redefined reasonable rate of return must be discounted from future

payments.°>”

493. Law 24/2013 also confirmed the possibility of periodical revisions of the remuneration

under the New Regime.***

Finally, as regards the remuneration already received by RE producers, Law 24/2013
states that “[iJn no case may the new regime model result in claims on amount received
for power produced prior to 14 July 2013, even if it is noted that on this date, said return
could have been exceeded.”**? This provision, according to the Respondent, is a guarantee

against retroactivity.°~

Law 24/2013: the Parties’ positions

According to the Claimants, Law 24/2013 “introduced further harmful measures” by
abolishing the distinction between the Ordinary and the Special Regime and depriving
RE installations of priority of grid access and priority of dispatch.**! However, the “most
harmful aspect” of Law 24/2013 was the introduction of a reasonable return calculated
based on the “regulatory life of the plant”, which according to the Claimants results in a

“maximum degree’ retroactivity as it essentially claws back plants’ prior earnings.”°°

According to the Respondent, the measures adopted in 2013 and 2014, including
RDL 9/2013, were reasonable, proportionate and otherwise lawful, because the New
Regime maintains the essential elements of the remuneration system envisaged by
Law 54/1997, in particular, by guaranteeing a reasonable return to the investors.
As regards specifically Law 24/2013, the Respondent argues that according to the
preamble of Act 24/2013:

The parameters for setting the remunerations shall remain in force for six years

and in the review thereof, which will take place before the beginning of the

regulatory period, the cyclical situation of the economy will be taken into
account, along with electricity demand and a fair return for these activities.

The Respondent also argues that pursuant to Article 26 of the Law, the priority of access

and dispatch was maintained under the New Regime.*® Furthermore, the Respondent

498. As indicated at paragraphs 467-483 above, CNE Report 18/2013 and the CNMC Report

were released in September and December 2013 respectively.

presented its observations on what was later adopted as RD 413/2014 to

the CNMC.*® Protermosolar stated, inter alia, as follows:

5 Counter-Memorial, para. 837, referring to Article 14.4(1) of Law 24/2013 stating as follows: “[i]n no case,

This draft, as well as the draft Proposal for Royal Decree sent to the former
[CNE] on 16 July 2013, do not provide for any transitional regime to move
from an economic regime to another, as did [RD 661/2007] which regulates
the activity of production of electrical energy in special regime (RD 661/2007)
concerning [RD 436/2004] which establishes the methodology for the
updating and systemization of the legal and economic regime of the electric
energy production activity in special regime and, likewise, this RD 436/2004
regarding the Royal Decree 2818/1998, of 23 December 1998, for the
production of electric energy by installations supplied by renewable energy
resources or sources, waste or cogeneration.

Not only is the transitional regime not foreseen but, according to the Royal
Decree-Law 9/2013, of 12 July 2013, which adopts urgent measures to
guarantee the financial stability of the electricity system (“RDL 9/2013”), the
new regime is already in force although the Royal Decree that will determine
its content has not yet been approved and against which we are arguing, and,
much less, the orders that would fully develop it and that would ultimately
determine the viability of the regulated activities.

Moreover, in the calculation of the applicable [Special Payment], income
already received by each of the facilities from the date of their
[commissioning] are included. This implies a substantial retroactive reduction
in the remuneration to which existing facilities are entitled to because in the

Iculation of future ion (calculated in d; with the
provisions of the draft Proposal for Royal Decree) the remuneration already
received are included (calculated according to the special scheme of
RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008).

The wording of article 30.4 of [Law 54/1997] in force until its modification
by the RDL 9/2013 established that the special regime facilities were entitled
to a “reasonable profitability” but did not determine its calculation parameters.
Although in some documents, the IDAE guaranteed a return close to 15%, the
PER 2005-2010 set it at 7%. Now the First Additional Provision of RDL
9/2013 establishes that for those facilities that at the date of its entry into force
were entitled to the economic premium regime “the reasonable profitability
will be based, before taxes, on the average yield in the secondary market of
the ten years prior to the entry into force of this Royal Decree-Law of the ten-
year State Bonds increased by 300 basis points”. To the extent that this
calculation includes the income received by the installation throughout its
regulatory useful life, i.e., the tariffs received since the entry into service of
each installation, the new concept of reasonable profitability is extending its
effects to the past, thus undermining rights acquired by the owners of the
facilities. In this way, we find ourselves before restrictive regulatory
modifications of rights that incur retroactivity of maximum degree, prohibited
in article 9.3 of the Spanish Constitution, to the extent in which its
effectiveness is projected “backwards”. This has been stated by jurisprudence
of the Supreme Court: “Retroactivity would occur if the new rule required to
the owners of the photovoltaic installations to return the amount of the tariffs
already received in previous years” (STS of April 12, 2012, JUR
2012/146154).

 

Infringement of the principle of legal certainty

The draft Proposal of the Royal Decree clearly violates the principle of legal
certainty, linked in turn to the principle of legitimate trust protection,
recognized by article 9.3 of the Spanish Constitution.

501. On 9 January 2014, the Technical Secretary-General of the Ministry of Industry issued a
report, which, inter alia, defined the concept of “efficient and well-managed company”>”!

that was used throughout draft legislation and in RDL 9/2013:

The indeterminate legal concept of an efficient and well-managed company is
used in the application of European Union standards for state aid to the
compensations given for providing general economic interest services (GEIS)
in order to avoid not taking the elevated costs of an inefficient company as a
reference. According to the Communication from the Commission
(2012/C8/02) the mere fact of generating a return is not sufficient to obtain

this classification, but rather objective criteria must be applied that are
economically recognisable as representative of satisfactory management:
compliance with accounting standards and analytic coefficients representative
of productivity and supply quality. On the other hand, reasonable return is
understood to be the capital return coefficient, i.e., the one that an average
company would require in order to provide GEIS as a function of the risk level
of the activity. Capital return coefficient is understood to mean the IRR
(Internal rate of return) that the company achieves on its capital invested in
the life of the project.5”

a. RD 413/2014 and Ministerial Order IET/1045/214: Context and most relevant
provisions

502. On 6 June 2014, the Government adopted Royal Decree 413/2014 “regulating the
production of electricity from renewable energy sources, cogeneration and waste”

(“RD 413/2014”) 573

503. The stated purpose of RD 413/2014 was to develop and implement the principles
established in RDL 9/2013 and Law 24/2013:

[RDL 9/2013] ...presented an important measure in this area within the
process of reform of the electricity sector. This is so, given that it incorporates
a mandate to the Government to approve a new legal and economic regime for
the existing installations that produce electricity from renewable energy
sources, cogeneration and wastes, explicitly stating the concrete principles
upon which the regime applicable to these installations will be defined, the
terms of which have been further integrated in [Law 24/3013], and which are
developed in the present Royal Decree. Both regulations assume continuously
one of the main principles as per its original wording, as stated in Article 30.4
of [Law 54/1997]: that the defined remuneration regimes must allow these
types of installations to cover the necessary costs to compete in the market
equally with the other technologies and obtain a reasonable return on the
whole project.°4

504. As regards the specific parameters of the New Regime, RD 413/2014, inter alia,
described the components of the Special Payment.*”> RD 413/2014 also developed the
relevant parameters of a standard installation necessary for the calculation of the Special

Payment:

ones, inclusive but not limitative, shall be remuneration parameters. The most
relevant ones are:

RD 413/2014 further provided that a classification of standard installations shall be

established by a ministerial order.

On 16 June 2014, the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism adopted
Order IET/1045/2014 (“Order IET/1045/2014”) to further develop the regime
established by Law 24/2013.

In sum, RD 413/2014 and Order IET/1045/2014 defined the precise parameters of the

new remuneration regime for RE producers that was based on the following principles:

a) in addition to the market price, RE producers were also entitled to the Special
Payment “which would allow them to compete at an equal level with the rest of the
technologies in the market and to obtain a reasonable return” during their useful

regulatory life fixed at 30 years;>””

b) the Special Payment was based on the parameters of a “standard installation’”>’* and
consisted of (i) the “remuneration to the investment” (“that covers the investment
costs of each standard installation that cannot be recovered by selling electricity on
the market”*”*) and (ii) the “remuneration to the operation” (“which covers [...] the
difference between the operating costs and the revenue generated from the

participation in the market of this standard installation”;>*°

c) the pre-tax reasonable rate of return was set at 7,398% for the 2013-2019 regulatory

period;**!

13. The assessment of the Disputed Measures by the Spanish courts

511. In its Judgment of 17 December 2015, the Spanish Constitutional Court dismissed an
application concerning the unconstitutionality of certain provisions of RDL 9/2013
submitted by the Government Council of the Autonomous Community of the Region of
Murcia.>** In respect of the alleged violation of the principles of certainty and legitimate

expectations, the Constitutional Court ruled as follows:

The respect of said principle [of consistency in the application of legal
standards], and its corollary, the principle of legitimate expectations, is
compatible with the changes in the remuneration regime of renewable energies
conducted through RDL 9/2013, more so -as occurs in this case- in a sphere
subject to high administrative intervention by virtue of its impact on general
interests, and to a complex regulatory system that makes it unfeasible to claim
that the most favorable elements be vested with permanence or unalterability
[...] that obliges the public powers to adapt said regulation to a changing
economic reality.

L-

Said modification cannot be described as unexpected given the changing
circumstances affecting this sector of the economy, which made it necessary
to make adjustments to this regulatory framework, as an effect of the difficult
circumstances that the sector as a whole was experiencing and the necessity
to ensure the required economic balance and proper management of the
system. It is not therefore possible to argue that the modification of the
remunerative regime which is under examination was unforeseeable for a
“diligent and prudent economic operator”, attentive to the economic
i and to the inad y of the taken to reduce a
persistent and continually increasing electricity system deficit that had not
been adequately tackled by previous provisions.

The preamble of the [Royal Decree-Law] determines that its purpose is to
avoid the “over-remuneration” of certain special regime plants.**°

512. The Constitutional Court equally did not find a violation of the principle of non-

retroactivity of laws:

The owners of plants that produce electricity in a premium regime are subject
to this new remunerative regime from the effective date of Royal Decree-
[Law] 9/2013, [...] such subjection does not however entail an unfavorable
effect on their acquired rights, from a constitutional perspective, i.e., it does
not impinge on patrimonial rights that have been previously and definitively
consolidated and incorporated into the patrimony of the recipient, or on legal
situations that have already been exhausted or consumed.*”°

513. At the same time, the Constitutional Court observed that “it [was] not for this [c]ourt to

determine the compatibility or otherwise of a legal rule with an international treaty, nor

can they be set up in fundamental regulations and constitutional standards.”*?!

514. The Spanish Supreme Court also issued several decisions confirming the legality of the
Disputed Measures.**? For example, the Spanish Supreme Court dismissed a claim for
damages allegedly caused by RD 1565/2010 and RDL 14/2010.°”? In another case, the
Spanish Supreme Court ruled by majority that RD 413/2014 was not inconsistent with

the principles of non-retroactivity and legitimate expectations.”

The assessment of the New Regime by the European Commission

In November 2017, the European Commission issued a decision on State aid assessing
the New Regime from the perspective of the EU rules on State aid (the “2017 EC State

Aid Decision”).>*° In this decision, the Commission noted:

In 2015, the total cost of the scheme amounted to EUR 6 666.3 million.
46,88% (EUR 3 125.8 million) was financed from the State budget and 53.11
% (EUR 3 540.6 million) from charges, of which 33 % were imposed on
electricity consumption and 67 % on the connection capacity.*°
The Commission concluded that the remuneration scheme envisaged by the New Regime

constitutes State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) of the TFEU.>”

As mentioned above, since Spain notified the Commission only after it had started
implementing the remuneration scheme, the Commission found Spain in breach of the

standstill-obligation set forth under Article 108(3) of the TFEU.***

However, the Commission also found that the incentives paid under the New Regime and

the Special Regime were compatible with Article 107(3) TFEU:

The Commission has assessed the compensation that facilities receive under
the scheme over their entire lifetime. For existing facilities, this includes the
payments received under the [Special Regime]. On the basis of the
aforementioned assessment, it has decided not to raise objections to the aid on
the grounds that it is compatible with the internal market pursuant to Article
107(3)(c) of the TFEU.*”

 

Regarding the position of beneficiaries of the Special Regime and the New Regime, the

Commission made the following observations:

As a general comment, the Commission recalls that there is ‘no right to State
aid’. A Member State may always decide not to grant an aid, or to put an end
to an aid scheme. Where the aid has not been authorized by the Commission,
the Member State is obliged to suspend the scheme until the Commission has

European Commission, Decision regarding the Support for Electricity generation from renewable energy

sources, cogeneration and waste (S.A. 40348 (2014/NN)), 10 November 2017 (RL-57) noting that “[p]ayments

under the [Special Regime] are covered by the [Decision] in order to as:

declared it compatible with the internal market pursuant to Article 108(3)

In the present decision, the Commission has assessed the measure notified by
Spain [...]. As Spain has decided to replace the premium economic scheme
with the notified aid measure it is not relevant for the scope of this decision to
assess whether the originally foreseen payments under the previous schemes
would have been compatible or not.

520. In addition, the Commission noted:

The investors argue, both before investor-State arbitration tribunals and in
their submissions to the Commission, that by modifying the support scheme
with regard to existing installations, Spain has violated the general principles
of Union law of legal certainty and legitimate expectations.

In the very specific situation of the present case, where a Member State grants
State aid to investors, without respecting the notification and stand-still
obligation of Article 108(3) TFEU, legitimate expectations with regard to
those State aid payments are excluded. That is because according to the case-
law of the Court of Justice, a recipient of State aid cannot, in principle, have
legitimate expectations in the lawfulness of aid that has not been notified to
the Commission.[Footnote 64 citing “Case C-24/95 Land Rheinland-Pfalz v
Alcan Deutschland, EU:C:1997:163, paragraph 25, in which the Court of
Justice has concluded that ‘In view of the mandatory nature of the supervision
of State aid by the Commission under Article [108] of the Treaty, undertaking
to which aid has been granted may not, in principles [sic], entertain a
legitimate expectation that the aid is lawful unless it has been granted in
compliance with the procedure laid down in that article. A diligent
businessman should normally be able to determine whether that procedure has
been followed.’ (paragraphs 13 and 14)f.]”.°!

521. The Commission made the following observations on the compatibility of the Disputed

Measures with the fair and equitable treatment (“FET”) standard:

[N]o investor could have, as a matter of fact, a legitimate expectation
stemming from illegal State aid. This has been expressly recognised by
Arbitration Tribunals. It is in any event settled case-law that a measure that
does not violate domestic provisions on legitimate expectation generally does
not violate the fair and equitable treatment provision.“

522. The Commission also stated:
[...] any compensation which an Arbitration Tribunal were to grant to an

investor on the basis that Spain has modified the [Special Regime] by the

60 2017 EC State Aid Decision (RL-57), paras. 155 and 156 (footnotes omitted).

2 2017 EC State Aid Decision (RL-57), para. 164.

165

[New Regime] would constitute in and of itself State aid. However, the
Arbitration Tribunals are not competent to authorise the granting of State aid.
That is an exclusive competence of the Commission. If they
award compensation, such as in Eiser v. Spain, or were to do so in the future,
this compensation would be notifiable State aid pursuant to Article 108(3)
TFEU and be subject to the standstill obligation.“

523. Finally, as regards the legal effect of the 2017 EC State Aid Decision , the Commission
stated that “this Decision is part of Union law, and as such also binding on Arbitration
Tribunals, where they apply Union law.”®* The Commission added that the validity of

the 2017 EC State Aid Decision may only be challenged in “the European courts.”

V. PRELIMINARY ISSUES

A. Applicable law

531. The Parties agree that the ECT is the basic legal instrument that this Tribunal is bound to
apply in accordance with Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention and Article 26(6) of the
ECT.*!? At the same time, the Parties’ positions regarding the role of Spanish law and EU

law differ.

532. The Parties also seem to be in agreement regarding the characterization of Spanish law as
a fact to be taken into account, inter alia, when assessing the Claimants’ legitimate
expectations.°'* At the same time, the Parties disagree on the significance of Spanish

Jaw in the context of the present dispute.

533. The Claimants argue that “Spanish law may be relevant in assessing legitimate
expectations but it does not define them.”°'* In particular, it means, from the Claimants’

perspective, that if they had an expectation to be protected against retroactive changes to

the FiT scheme under the relevant Royal Decrees, it does not matter that they did not have

a constitutional protection against “medium retroactivity.”°'®

The Respondent argues that “Spanish law defines the expectations of the investor.”°!”

Specifically, the Respondent contends that “domestic law as a fact has to define the
expectations of the investor, because domestic law has to be known or should have been
known by the investor who is going to invest in a country.”°'® According to the
Respondent, this includes legal interpretations made by host State courts, and especially
supreme courts. Such interpretation, the Respondent argues, must be assumed to be

known by the investor at the time of his investment.°!”

b. EU law

. The Parties’ positions on whether EU law forms part of the applicable law under

Article 26(6) of the ECT differ.

. The Claimants argue that EU law does not apply to the merits of this dispute, as none of
their claims has been pleaded or brought under EU law.°?° Moreover, the Claimants
contend that EU law regardless of its characterization “is not relevant” to the merits of

this case.°?!

The Respondent argues that EU law is applicable to the merits as a “special kind of

international law”®”” but also as a fact shaping legitimate expectations.

The Tribunal’s analysis

Pursuant to Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, “[t]he Tribunal shall decide a dispute
in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties.” According to
Article 26(6) of the ECT, the Tribunal “shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance
with [the ECT] and applicable rules and principles of international law.” Whilst the ECT
does not specifically define the term “dispute”, Article 26(1) of the ECT makes clear that
Article 26 applies to disputes relating to alleged breaches of an obligation under Part III

of the ECT, which governs “Investment Promotion and Protection”.

As recalled above, the Parties agree that the ECT is the basic legal instrument that this
Tribunal is bound to apply.°4 The Parties also seem to be in agreement regarding the
characterization of Spanish law as a fact to be taken into account, inter alia, when

assessing the Claimants’ legitimate expectations.©>

The Parties’ positions on whether EU law forms part of the applicable law under
Article 26(6) of the ECT differ. The Claimants argue that EU law does not apply to the
merits of this dispute, as none of their claims has been pleaded or brought under EU
law.°° The Respondent submits that EU lawhas a dual nature as it qualifies as
international law within the meaning of Article 26(6) of the ECT whilst also constituting

a fact that shapes the Claimants’ expectations when investing in Spain.”

The Tribunal concludes that in order to adjudicate the present dispute, which has been
brought under the ECT and which seeks to determine the question whether the
Respondent’s international responsibility is engaged, it must apply the ECT and the
ICSID Convention (subject to the rules of treaty interpretation set forth in
the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the “WCLT”)) as well as other

applicable rules and principles of international law.

As regards Spanish law, the Tribunal agrees that for the purposes of this arbitration,
Spanish law, being the national law of the host State, is treated as a fact. However, to the
extent that the Claimants’ claims under the ECT are based on promises allegedly made
under Spanish law, the latter will inform the existence and the content of the commitments
(if any) made by Spain towards the Claimants. As summarized by the tribunal in E/ Paso
v. Argentina, “[t]he fact that the BIT and international law govern the issue of Argentina’s
responsibility for violation of the treaty does not exclude that the domestic law of
Argentina has a role to play too” which is “to inform the content of those commitments
made by Argentina [...] that the [claimant] alleges to have been violated.”°?* That tribunal
went on to conclude as follows:

[In order to establish which rights have been recognised by Argentina to the

Claimant as a foreign investor, resort will have to be had to Argentina’s law.

However, whether a modification or cancellation of such rights, even if legally

valid under Argentina’s law, constitutes a violation of a protection guaranteed

by the BIT is a matter to be decided solely on the basis of the BIT itself and
the other applicable rules of international law.”°”

Whilst Spanish law cannot per se govern the question of whether or not Spain’s
international responsibility is engaged, the Tribunal notes that the present case involves
claims based on alleged expectations that purportedly had their basis in Spanish law, and
that Spain’s international responsibility is sought with respect to the treatment of those
alleged expectations and the changes the Spanish legal framework underwent. The
Tribunal is of the view that the vantage point for resolving these claims consists in
analyzing the Spanish legal framework that created the purported rights which the
Claimants are seeking to vindicate under the ECT. Thus, the Tribunal’s analysis of the
Respondent’s obligations under the ECT requires a detailed assessment of the Spanish
legal and regulatory framework in order to identify the existence and content of any

commitment made by Spain towards the Claimants.

As regards EU law, the Tribunal is of the view that EU law must, in principle, be classified

as constituting both international law and as national law (and, in the latter situation, be

treated as a fact). In that regard, the Tribunal agrees with the tribunal in Electrabel v.
Hungary, which discussed this very question in great detail and concluded that “EU law
is international law because it is rooted in international treaties [i.e.] the EU Treaties,”
thus becoming “part of the international legal order” irrespective of whether an EU law
tule is of primary (droit primaire, such as the EU Treaties) or derivative nature (droit
dérivé, such as secondary legal acts).°° At the same time, as also noted in Electrabel v.

Hungary, EU law must be considered as being part of the national law of its Member

631 632

States®*! and hence can constitute a “fact”.

Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that, as a matter of principle, EU law sets
forth “rules and principles of international law” within the meaning of Article 26(6) of

the ECT.
The Tribunal also concurs with the below statement by the Blusun v. Italy tribunal:

The Parties in effect agree that the applicable law in determining this issue is
international law, and specifically the relevant provisions of the VCLT. The
Tribunal agrees, but would observe that this does not exclude any relevant rule
of EU law, which would fall to be applied either as part of international Law or
as part of the law of Italy. The Tribunal evidently cannot exercise the special
jurisdictional powers vested in the European courts, but it can and where
relevant should apply European law as such.°*

In the case at hand, the Respondent argues that EU law is “applicable” to two issues, the
question of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal®**, on the one hand, and the question of the
existence and extent of the Claimants’ legitimate expectations, on the other hand. The
Tribunal will limit its analysis under EU law to these two issues, in Sections VI.A.2 and

VILB.1. below.

Burden of proof and other evidentiary matters

The Parties do not seem to have a disagreement on the allocation of the burden of proof
in these proceedings. Therefore, the Tribunal’s analysis will be guided by the maxim

actori incumbit onus probandi.

At the same time, during the Hearing, the Claimants’ counsel expressed their concern that
the Tribunal’s decision to keep Mr. Montoya’s Witness Statement in the record of this
arbitration despite his failure to attend the Hearing might result in a reversal of the burden
of proof.°*°

The Tribunal takes note of the fact that the Claimants were unable to test Mr. Montoya’s
testimony at the Hearing despite their request to that effect, and that no valid explanation
for Mr. Montoya’s inability to attend the Hearing has been provided. Accordingly, the
Tribunal has decided to make use of its discretionary power in matters of evidence under
ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(1) in order not to rely on Mr. Montoya’s testimony at face
value and to draw, if necessary, adverse inferences from his failure to appear at the

Hearing.

The Tribunal also recalls its considerations on its power to freely assess the probative

value of evidence, as referred to above at paragraph 138.

Furthermore, the Tribunal wishes to stress that it may “take judicial notice of, refer to, or
rely on, any relevant legal principles or judicial or arbitral decisions in accordance with

>> 637

the principle of jura novit curia even if those principles or judicial or arbitral

decisions have not been referred to by the Parties.

JURISDICTION
The Intra-EU Objection
The Parties’ positions

The Respondent

The Respondent submits that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over this dispute because
both the Claimants’ home State, the Netherlands, and Spain are Member States of the
European Union. The Respondent argues on the basis of Articles 267 and 344 of the
TFEU that the power to resolve disputes involving EU law issues (concerning, for
example, State aid) is reserved exclusively for dispute settlement mechanisms that belong
to the EU’s legal order and that can guarantee the autonomy and primacy of EU law.
Investor-State arbitration under the ECT, in the Respondent’s view, does not belong to
such mechanisms. At the same time, Article 26(6) of the ECT requires this Tribunal to
apply EU law among other sources of international law. Thus, the Respondent submits
that this Tribunal must decline its jurisdiction over the present dispute in accordance with
the above-referenced principles of EU law. This jurisdictional objection is referred to

throughtout this Decision as the “Intra-EU Objection”.

In support of its Intra-EU Objection, the Respondent draws on the judgment of the Court

of Justice of the European Union (the “CJEU”) in Case No. C-284/16 (the “Achmea

638

Judgment”),””” as well as subsequent declarations made by certain EU Member States

discussed further below in more detail and more recently the Komstroy Judgment.

The Respondent summarizes its position as to why the Claimants are not investors “of

another Contracting Party” within the meaning of Article 26(1) of the ECT as follows:

The Netherlands, the home States of the Claimants, like Spain, are EU
Member States; [the] Claimants, like [the] Respondent, are therefore investors
from States that are part of a Regional Economic Integration Organization [a
“REIO”] as defined by Article 1(3) ECT. Since the EU is a Contracting Party
of the ECT as defined by its Article 1(2) [of the ECT], [the] Claimants are not

from “another Contracting Party” but rather from the same Contracting Party
as [the] Respondent.*?

556. The Respondent further argues that EU law has to be applied by the Tribunal when
deciding on its jurisdiction“? and that Article 26(3) of the ECT must be interpreted
consistently with the “basic principles of EU law (such as the principle of primacy of the
EU legal framework, the principle of competence of the CJEU or the EU regulations of

State Aid as a matter of public order).”!

557. The Respondent asserts that EU law is also applicable to the merits of this dispute. In
particular, the Respondent contends that any intra-EU investment is per se affected by the
fundamental freedoms guaranteed by EU law (“free movement of capital, freedom of
establishment, freedom to provide services and free movement of workers”) and that the
present dispute involves the issue of State aid which is “an essential institution of the
EU.”** The fact that EU law applies to the merits “determines the lack of jurisdiction of

this Arbitral Tribunal”, according to the Respondent.**+

558. In support of this position, the Respondent relies on the Achmea Judgment where the

CJEU ruled as follows:

Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a
provision in an international agreement concluded between Member states
[...] under which an investor from one of those Member States may, in the
event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring
proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose
jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept.“

The Respondent argues that the Achmea Judgment is applicable not only to intra-EU BITs
but also to multilateral treaties such as the ECT since its dispute settlement clause
“excludes disputes between an investor and a Member State of the EU from the
jurisdiction of their own courts” thereby preventing “these disputes, to which Community
law must be applied, from being resolved in a manner that guarantees the full

enforceability of [EU law], as required by [A]rticle 344 [of the] TFEU.”*°

The Respondent further contends that the EU’s participation in the ECT does not affect
the applicability of the Achmea Judgment to the present dispute despite the following

statements of the CJEU:

57. It is true that, according to settled case-law of the Court, an international
agreement providing for the establishment of a court responsible for the
interpretation of its provisions and whose decisions are binding on the
institutions, including the Court of Justice, is not in principle incompatible
with EU law. The competence of the EU in the field of international relations
and its capacity to conclude international agreements necessarily entail the
power to submit to the decisions of a court which is created or designated by
such agreements as regards the interpretation and application of their
provisions, provided that the autonomy of the EU and its legal order is
respected.

LJ

58. In the present case, however, apart from the fact that the disputes falling
within the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal referred to in Article 8 of the BIT
may relate to the interpretation both of that agreement and of EU law, the
possibility of submitting those disputes to a body which is not part of the
judicial system of the EU is provided for by an agreement which was
concluded not by the EU but by Member States.”

The Respondent argues that the first sentences of paragraphs 57 and 58 cannot be
interpreted in isolation from the second sentence of paragraph 58, which provides that
“Article 8 of the BIT is such as to call into question not only the principle of mutual trust
between the Member States but also the preservation of the particular nature of the law

established by the Treaties, ensured by the preliminary ruling procedure provided for in

97) (“Opinion 2/13”), the Respondent alleges that the Achmea Judgment “confirms a trend [in the jurisprudence

of

the CJEU] that dates back to the beginning of the year 2000.”

Article 267 TFEU, and is not therefore compatible with the principle of sincere

cooperation [...].”8

Thus, the Respondent concludes that an agreement establishing a dispute settlement
mechanism for intra-EU disputes that is not part of the European legal order would be “in

principle” compatible with EU law only if “the autonomy of the EU and its legal order is

respected.”

The Respondent argues that its Intra-EU Objection is thus supported by the following

“four steps of reasoning” of the CJEU in the Achmea Judgment:

(i) EU law must be applied and interpreted by [this Tribunal] to resolve [this]
dispute; (ii) [this Tribunal] does not form part of the judicial system of the EU
and cannot make reference to the [CJEU] for a preliminary ruling; (iii) the
lack of control from the judicial system of the EU cannot be remedied in the
stages of annulment or enforcement [...]; (iv) this renders the provision of the
ECT providing for arbitration incompatible with EU law and its basic
principle of autonomy.*°

The Respondent admits that the ECT does not contain a “disconnection clause”, i.e., a
provision that would ensure the priority of EU law over the rules of the ECT in case of
conflict.®! At the same time, the Respondent argues that it is the autonomy of EU law
that has “the effect of disconnecting even without a disconnection clause.”°?

In addition to the jurisprudence of the CJEU, the Respondent also invokes the
Communication of the European Parliament and Council of 19 July 2018 where the

Commission concluded that:

EU investors cannot invoke intra-EU BITs, which are incompatible with
Union law and no longer necessary in the single market. They cannot have
recourse to arbitration tribunals established by such intra-EU BITs or, for
intra-EU litigation, to arbitration tribunals established under the Energy
Charter Treaty. However, the EU legal system offers adequate and effective
protection for cross-border investors in the single market, while ensuring that
other legitimate interests are duly and lawfully taken into account. When

investors exercise one of the fundamental freedoms such as the freedom of

establishment or the free movement of capital, they act within the scope of

application of Union law and therefore enjoy the protection granted by that

law. Member States have the responsibility and the power to enforce EU law

in general and EU investors’ rights, in particular. The Commission strives to

increase the effectiveness of the enforcement system in the EU, including

actions to support administrative capacity building or to strengthen justice

systems, and to tackle breaches of EU law by national authorities.**
Further in support of its jurisdictional objection, the Respondent relies on the Declaration
of 22 Member States on Achmea and investment protection in the EU, the Declaration of
Finland, Luxembourg, Malta, Slovenia and Sweden on Achmea and investment protection

in the EU, as well as the Hungary Achmea Declaration.***

According to the Respondent, the January 2019 Declarations confirm that the conclusions
of the Achmea Judgment are relevant for intra-EU investment arbitration proceedings,
acknowledge the EC’s position on the incompatibility of intra-EU investment
proceedings with EU law, endorse the precedence of EU law over BITs, and, finally,
recognize such fundamental principles of EU law as the principle of distribution of
competences between the EU and its Member States, the principle of autonomy and

primacy of EU law, the obligation of the Member States to submit to EU law.®>

In particular, the Respondent refers to the following statement from the Declaration of 22

Member States on Achmea and investment protection in the EU:

[...] international agreements concluded by the Union, including the Energy
Charter Treaty, are an integral part of the EU legal order and must therefore
be compatible with the Treaties. Arbitral tribunals have interpreted the Energy
Charter Treaty as also containing an investor-State arbitration clause
applicable between Member States. Interpreted in such a manner, that clause

would be incompatible with the Treaties and thus would have to be
disapplied.°
This statement, in the Respondent’s view, supports its argument that the EU Member
States “never interpreted Article 26 of the ECT as a valid offer to arbitrate” intra-EU

investment disputes due to its incompatibility with EU law.’

As regards the Declaration of Finland, Luxembourg, Malta, Slovenia and Sweden on
Achmea and investment protection in the EU and Declaration of Hungary on Achmea and
investment protection in the EU, the Respondent submits that these Declarations do not
express a position different from that expressed in the Declaration of 22 Member States

on Achmea and investment protection in the EU.°*

In respect of relevant arbitral case-law, the Respondent argues that the awards that
dismissed the intra-EU objection do not contain “an adequate analysis of the principle of
primacy of EU law in Intra-EU relations.”°° In support of its criticism, the Respondent
refers to the decision of the Swedish Court of Appeal on the stay of enforcement of the

Novenergia II v. Spain award.°°

The amicus curiae brief submitted by MOL Hungarian Oil and Gas PLC in the
Novenergia II v. Spain enforcement proceedings before the US Courts referred to by the
Claimants in support of their arguments is, according to the Respondent, irrelevant and
should in any event be read together with the position on the intra-EU investment disputes
expressed by Hungary in other cases, including Electrabel, AES Summit, and UP and CD

Holding International.©!

Finally, as regards the Komstroy Judgment, the Respondent submits that the CJEU’s

reasoning in that case is “identical to that followed in the Achmea Judgment”.

The Respondent thus reiterates its arguments made in support of the Achmea Judgment.

In addition to these arguments, the Respondent submits that the autonomy of EU law must
be respected in accordance with the principle of pacta sunt servanda, which implies that
the EU Member States (including the Netherlands and Spain) “have accepted [...] the
autonomy and primacy of EU law and the compulsory effect of the CJEU rulings”. The
Respondent also invokes the principle of venire contra factum proprium non valet to
argue that the practice of respecting the principles of EU law “have created a reliance in

the Member States that they will be always observed”.°°

The Respondent further contends that the autonomy of EU law is respected “not only by
the Netherlands and Spain and by all the Member States of the EU, but by all the [S]tates

of the international community who have never opposed to the respect of that autonomy”.
666

Finally, the Respondent asserts that the Komstroy Judgment is binding on the Netherlands
and that “Dutch investors cannot have any rights different that the rights and legal

framework that is applicable to the Netherlands”.°”

The Claimants

The Claimants argue that the Tribunal has jurisdiction under both the ECT and the ICSID

Convention.

The Claimants submit that Article 26 of the ECT provides the Contracting Parties’
unconditional consent to arbitration which is subject only to the restrictions explicitly set
out in the ECT none of which is concerned with the intra-EU character of investor-State
arbitrations that may be initiated under the Treaty. According to the Claimants, EU law
does not govern the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. The Claimants also state that none of the
tribunals constituted under the ECT to hear intra-EU investor-State disputes concerning

the RE sector sustained the Intra-EU Objection. Finally, as regards the Achmea Judgment,

the Claimants emphasize that it does not address the ECT and thus cannot apply to the

present dispute.

Jurisdictional requirements under the ECT and ICSID Convention

The Claimants argue that the requirement ratione personae is satisfied under the ECT
because Spain is a “Contracting Party” to the ECT and each of the Claimants is an
“investor of another Contracting Party.” In particular, Sevilla Beheer and Cordoba Beheer
are incorporated in the Netherlands (a Contracting Party to the ECT) whereas Cross Retail
and the Spanish Project Companies are fully owned and controlled by the two Dutch
companies. Thus, Cross Retail and the Spanish Project Companies shall be treated as

nationals of another Contracting Party by virtue of Article 26(7) of the ECT.

With respect to jurisdiction ratione materiae, the Claimants submit that they made
“investments” associated with “an Economic Activity in the Energy Sector”, “which
include, without limitation, the Claimants’ direct and indirect shareholding and debt
interests in the Spanish Project Companies that own and operate the PV plants (Article
1(6)(b)[of the ECT]); claims to money (Article 1(6)(c)[of the ECT]); returns (Article
1(6)(e)[of the ECT]); and rights conferred by law [...] (Article 1(6)(f))[of the ECT]).*
The Claimants further submit that their investments were made in Spain after the ECT
entered into force for both Spain and the Netherlands, i.e., after the “Effective Date” in

compliance Article 1(6) of the ECT.

Regarding Spain’s consent to arbitration under the ECT, the Claimants state that in
compliance with Article 26(3) of the ECT the present dispute concerns “an alleged breach
of an obligation of a Contracting Party under Part III” of the ECT that includes Article
10, 69

The Claimants assert that they also complied with the three-month negotiation period
established by Article 26(1) of the ECT before serving their Request for Arbitration in

these proceedings. Specifically, the Claimants claim to have made a request for

68 Memorial, para. 267.

negotiations addressed to Spain in relation to the present dispute on 15 July 2016.9”

However, to date, Spain has not responded to the Claimants’ request.°”!

The Claimants further argue that the jurisdictional requirements of Article 25 of the
ICSID Convention are also met because the present dispute is a “legal dispute arising
directly out of an investment”, both Spain and the Netherlands are Contracting States, and
each of the Claimants is a “national of another Contracting State.”°” Finally, Spain’s
consent to arbitration given in Article 26(3) of the ECT together with the Claimants’
consent provided in their Request for Arbitration satisfy the requirement for “written

consent”.67

Claimants’ position on the Intra-EU Objection

The Claimants argue that the Intra-EU Objection must be dismissed, as the intra-EU
character of the present dispute does not affect the interpretation of Article 26 of the ECT
in accordance with the rules of treaty interpretation as set out in the VCLT. In support,
the Claimants, inter alia, rely on prior arbitral awards and emphasize the fact that not a
single tribunal composed to hear an intra-EU investment dispute declined its jurisdiction

on the basis of the Intra-EU Objection.°*

The Claimants disagree with Spain’s interpretation of Article 26 of the ECT as “a model
of consent to restricted arbitration” limited by various provisions of the ECT.*” In the
Claimants’ view, Article 26 “applies to disputes between any Contracting Party to the
ECT and an Investor of any other Contracting Party” and provides that the Contracting
Parties’ “unconditional consent” to arbitration is “subject only to subparagraphs (b) and

(c) [of Article 26(3) of the ECT]”.®”° Apart from these limitations, the ECT does not

Respondent’s position, the Swedish Court of Appeal has not made any pronouncements regarding the validity of
the Intra-EU Objection in its ruling on the stay of enforcement. See Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 14.

contain any other exceptions to the Contracting Parties’ consent given in Article 26. There
is no need, in the Claimants’ opinion, to explore the subjective intentions of the EU and
its Member States regarding the ECT, as the ordinary meaning of the text of Article 26 is
unambiguous and does not warrant recourse to any supplementary means of

interpretation.”

Thus, the Claimants conclude that in accordance with the ordinary meaning of Article 26
of the ECT, “there is no Intra-EU exception to the Contracting Parties’ unconditional

consent to arbitration.”°”8

The Claimants further address a number of specific arguments made by the Respondent.

The Claimants argue that EU law is not applicable to determine the Tribunal’s

jurisdiction.6”

The Claimants do not dispute that the ECT recognizes that REIOs can be party to the
ECT. At the same time, the Claimants contend that there is nothing in the ECT “to support
the idea that the ECT does not apply amongst REIO members” absent a “disconnection
clause”, i.e., a provision ensuring that the rules of the regional organisation prevail over
the rules established by a multilateral treaty to which the members of the regional

organisation are also party.°°

Community shall apply in their mutual relations the common rules in force in that Community.” Reply, para. 512.

589. Furthermore, the Claimants emphasize that the EU is not the Respondent in this
arbitration and that the relevant “Area” referred to in Article 26 (1) of the ECT is the
territory of Spain only.**! Thus, according to the Claimants, the “REIO Area definition
simply does not apply unless the REIO itself [...] is the party to the dispute.”°*? In this
connection, the Claimants refer to Novenergia II v. Spain where the Tribunal made the

following statement:

[In making this argument, the Respondent fails to recognise the fact that, even
though the EU itself is a Contracting Party of the ECT, this does not eliminate
the EU Member States’ individual standing as respondents under the ECT.
The Tribunal is convinced that with a correct application of Article 26(1) of
the ECT, interpreted in light of the VCLT, there is no basis for any
requirements other than that the investor shall be a national of an ECT
Contracting State other than the host State. Put differently, the Tribunal cannot
deduce from Article 26(1) of the ECT a limitation to the effect that an investor
is not a national of an ECT Contracting Party to the extent that such a
Contracting Party is also a member of the same REIO (i.e., the EU) as the host
State. The Tribunal therefore rejects the Respondent’s argument that the
Tribunal lacks jurisdiction on the basis of Article 26(1) of the ECT.

590. The Claimants also cite the following passage from Antin v. Spain:

Moreover, the Tribunal considers that the fact that the EU is also a Contracting
Party and a ‘Regional Economic International Organization’ as defined in
Articles 1(2) and 1(3) of the ECT does not bar the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.
Neither does the use of the terms ‘relating to an Investment of the latter in the
Area of the former’ in Article 26 of the ECT, nor the definition of ‘Area’ in
Article 1(10) of the Treaty. The ordinary meaning of Articles 1(2), 1(3) and
1(10) recognize the existence of REIOs as possible Contracting Parties and
identify that the ‘Area’ of a REIO, such as the EU, to mean the ‘Areas of the
member states of such [REIO].’ Under the terms of the ECT, a claim could
thus be brought against a REIO, regarding a dispute arising out of an
‘Investment’ made by an ‘Investor’ in that REIO’s defined ‘Area’.

591. In addition, throughout their arguments the Claimants repeatedly assert that EU law is

irrelevant to the present dispute and that the Tribunal is not called upon to apply or

interpret any of its provisions.°*> Thus, there is no conflict between the ECT and EU law
in the present case and the principle of primacy of EU law invoked by the Respondent is

inapplicable.

Moreover, the Claimants argue that EU law and the ECT cover different subject-matters:
“[iJnvestment protection under EU law is primarily focused on ensuring access to the
market of another [EU] Member State” whereas the ECT provides for a broad, sector-
specific protection after the making of an investment that includes, for example, the FET
guarantee.**° The Claimants also emphasize that Article 26 of the ECT is another example
of an additional guarantee that has no equivalent under EU law.°*” Thus, the Claimants
conclude that there is no conflict between EU law and the ECT.*® In the alternative, the
Claimants argue that the ECT must prevail over EU law pursuant to Article 16 of the
ECT, which provides that in case of conflict the provision more favorable to the investor

shall apply.°*?

As regards the issue of State aid, in the Claimants’ view, the question of whether an
award rendered by this Tribunal may be considered by the EU as State aid and thus face
difficulties at the enforcement stage is irrelevant as it does not affect this Tribunal’s

jurisdiction.©”

The Claimants note from the outset that the Achmea Judgment is not binding on this
Tribunal and that the CJEU’s findings are case-specific and cannot be interpreted
extensively.©! They further submit that the Achmea Judgment is irrelevant to this

arbitration for the following reasons.

First, the Achmea Judgment dealt with one agreement — the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT.”

Second, Article 26(6) of the ECT unlike Article 8(6) of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT
does not require that the tribunal apply the law in force of the contracting party and other
relevant agreements between the contracting parties. The ECT provides that disputes
shall be resolved solely on the basis of the Treaty itself and applicable rules and principles
of international law.°** Thus, the Tribunal, according to the Claimants, is not called to
apply EU law, which is in any event irrelevant for the resolution of the present dispute.>
At the same time, even if EU law is relevant, this fact alone cannot preclude intra-EU
investment disputes as that would equally exclude from the scope of the ECT non-intra-
EU disputes where EU issues also might arise.©° That, in the Claimants’ view, would

strip Article 26 of the ECT of its purpose as no investment dispute could ever be brought

against the EU or any of its Member States.”

Third, the Claimants state that these proceedings are brought under the ICSID Convention
and, unlike the Achmea Arbitration, are not seated in an EU Member State, governed by

the law of that State, and subject to review by its courts.°*

Fourth, the Claimants emphasize the fact that the EU is party to the ECT and that the EU
played a central role in the conclusion of this multilateral Treaty. This “critical
difference”, according to the Claimants, was expressly acknowledged by the CJEU which
drew a distinction between an international dispute resolution mechanism established
with the EU’s participation and the one without.®? In the Achmea Judgment the latter

situation was considered.””

the EU, unlike the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT that had been signed before Slovakia

Achmea Judgment’s reasoning, including, inter alia, the “erroneous distinction between
commercial and investment-treaty arbitration” made by the CJEU as well as the lack of
guidance regarding the consequences of the Achmea Judgment.” In support of their
arguments on the consequences of the Achmea Judgment for this arbitration, the
Claimants also rely on the amicus curiae brief submitted by MOL Hungarian Oil and Gas

PLC in the Novenergia II v. Spain enforcement proceedings before the US Courts.”

600. The Claimants also challenge the relevance of some other acts of the CJEU relied upon
by the Respondent in support of the Intra-EU Objection. In particular, the Claimants
submit that in its Opinion 1/91, the CJEU, inter alia, stressed that an international dispute
settlement mechanism established by a treaty to which the EU itself is party is compatible
with EU law.” Therefore, given that the EU is party to the ECT, Opinion 1/91 does not
support the Intra-EU Objection in the present dispute.

601.

The Claimants further submit that the Mox Plant case, mentioned by the Respondent, is
irrelevant because it concerned a dispute between two EU Member States that also

involved issues of EU law, whereas “[t]his ECT arbitration is between an investor and an
EU Member State and does not concern the application or interpretation of [EU law].”7°
For the same reason Opinion 2/13 of the CJEU is also inapplicable from the Claimants’

point of view.’°° The Claimants contend that the Kadi case is equally irrelevant as it does

not concern a treaty to which the EU is party.’°”

As regards the EC Communication of 19 July 2018, the Claimants assert that it has no
bearing on the interpretation of the ECT and that it is not binding on the Tribunal.”°° The
Claimants also challenge the relevance of the 2017 EC State Aid Decision on the grounds

that the Tribunal is not called upon to apply EU law.’

Finally, the Claimants state that the EU as a party to the ECT is under an obligation to
“make provision for the effective enforcement in its Area” of an arbitral award issued by
the Tribunal under the ECT.”!° Thus, the EU will be legally obliged to enforce the awards

of the Tribunal as the ECT prevails over acts of the EU.7!!

The Claimants argue that the January 2019 Declarations are equally irrelevant for this

arbitration.

In particular, the Claimants submit that the Declaration of 22 Member States on Achmea
and investment protection in the EU is “a mere political statement containing the steps
that EU Member States will take in the future to draw the pertinent consequences from
the Achmea Judgment (i.e., to seek to set aside awards and terminate bilateral investment
treaties).”7!? The Claimants also contend that the Declaration of Finland, Luxembourg,
Malta, Slovenia and Sweden on Achmea and investment protection in the EU as well as
the Declaration of Hungary on Achmea and investment protection in the EU demonstrate
that EU Member States “do not agree on whether the ECT is incompatible with EU
law.”7!3 The Claimants further argue that the January 2019 Declarations confirm that the
exclusion of intra-EU application of investment treaties was not the original intention of
the EU Member States and that “additional steps are required to ‘disapply’ these treaties”
as, inter alia, the CJEU is not competent to “nullify the provisions in international
treaties.””'4 The Claimants allege that the Respondent cannot submit any evidence

proving the intention of the EU Member States to exclude intra-EU disputes from the

As regards the Komstroy Judgment, the Claimants argue that it contains “serious flaws”7!*

and has “no bearing on the Tribunal’s jurisdiction”.”!°

In particular, the Claimants criticize the CJEU’s reasoning for adopting “the vantage point
of EU law”.”° According to the Claimants, the CJEU “has conspicuously not even
purported to interpret [Article 26 of the ECT] in accordance with the rules of treaty
interpretation laid down in [the VCLT].””*! The Claimants also contend that the CJEU’s
“complete disregard for the multilateral nature of the ECT runs afoul of another basic
principle of treaty interpretation: that it is the common intention of all parties to a treaty
[...] that must be established pursuant to Article 31 of [the VCLT].”” The Claimants
also point to a number of other alleged flaws in the CJEU’s reasoning, such as a “dubious
distinction between commercial and investment arbitration” as well as the finding that the
ECT itself is an act of EU law made by the CJEU solely on the basis that the EU is a
signatory to the ECT.’

608. Furthermore, the Claimants submit that “irrespective of its many flaws [...] the Komstroy

Judgment has no bearing on this Tribunal’s jurisdiction” ’** for the following reasons.

609. From the outset, the Claimants note that the CJEU’s views on whether Article 26 of the
ECT applies to intra-EU investment disputes “were expressed merely obiter [dicta] and,
as such, are devoid of binding force.””*> The Claimants further assert that the Komstroy
Judgment is in any event “not binding upon this Tribunal (or, indeed, any tribunal
established under the ECT)” because a tribunal constituted under the ECT and the CJEU

“sit within two different legal orders: the former under the ECT; the latter under the EU

treaties.””°

610. The Claimants also argue that the Komstroy Judgment cannot retroactively deprive the
Tribunal of its jurisdiction “since consent to arbitration was perfected in August 2016,
when the Claimants introduced their Request for Arbitration.””?’ In support of this

argument, the Claimants refer to the RREEF v. Spain Decision, where the tribunal found

that “[n]o post-hoc decision of the CJEU can somehow undo that consent once given.”7”

611. Furthermore, the Claimants submit that the Tribunal “must interpret the ECT in
accordance with international law, not EU law.”’”° According to the Claimants, the
Tribunal is not required to apply EU law “to determine whether Spain breached the ECT”,
as their claims “concern breaches of the ECT only; they do not rely on EU law in support
of these claims”.”*° The Claimants further contend that “even if EU law were applicable

to the merits, it would still not apply to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction”, as Article 26(6) of

the ECT is irrelevant in the context of establishing jurisdiction.”*! The Claimants thus
conclude that the Tribunal is only “bound to apply Article 25 of the ICSID Convention
and Article 26 of the ECT, and to interpret them in accordance with the rules of
international law codified in the [VCLT].””? In the Claimants’ view, “the ordinary

meaning of Article 26 [of the ECT] leaves no doubt that it applies intra-EU.”7*

Finally, the Claimants argue that to the extent their interpretation of Article 26 of the ECT
were contrary to EU law, “the Tribunal would still be bound to uphold its jurisdiction”
pursuant to Article 16 of the ECT, but also due to the fact that “EU law does not take

precedence over the ECT”.’*#

The Tribunal’s analysis

Applicable law and general principles

The Tribunal recalls that these proceedings were commenced on the basis of

Article 26 of the ECT, which provides in relevant part as follows:

(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another
Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the
former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under
Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.

(2) If such disputes cannot be settled according to the provisions of paragraph
(1) within a period of three months from the date on which either party to the
dispute requested amicable settlement, the Investor party to the dispute may
choose to submit it for resolution:

LJ
in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.
(3) (a) [...] each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to

the submission of a dispute to international arbitration or conciliation in
accordance with the provisions of this Article.

(4) In the event that an Investor chooses to submit the dispute for resolution
under subparagraph (2)(c), the Investor shall further provide its consent in
writing for the dispute to be submitted to:

(a) (i) The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes,
established pursuant to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment
Disputes between States and Nationals of other States opened for signature at
Washington, 18 March 1965 (hereinafter referred to as the “ICSID
Convention”), if the Contracting Party of the Investor and the Contracting
Party party to the dispute are both parties to the ICSID Convention; or

LJ

(b) a sole arbitrator or ad hoc arbitration tribunal established under the
Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade
Law (hereinafter referred to as “UNCITRAL”); or

(c) an arbitral proceeding under the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm
Chamber of Commerce.

614. These proceedings were initiated also pursuant to the ICSID Convention, which

establishes the following jurisdictional requirements in its Article 25(1)-(2):

1. The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising
directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent
subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that
State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the
dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given
their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.

2. “National of another Contracting State” means:

LJ

(b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other
than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented
to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person
which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that
date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be
treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this
Convention.

615. The Parties do not dispute that the conditions of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention are
satisfied except for the requirement that the Parties must consent in writing to submit the

dispute to ICSID.

The Tribunal further recalls that by virtue of the principle of compétence de la
compétence, “[{t]he Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence.””*> As confirmed

at the Hearing, the Respondent does not take issue with this principle.”*°

According to Spain, Article 26 of the ECT cannot be invoked by the Claimants to prove
the Respondent’s consent to submit this dispute to arbitration due to its Intra-EU
character.”°” In other words, the Respondent argues that Article 26 of the ECT does not
apply to disputes between an investor from one EU Member State who made an

investment in another EU Member State.

As a preliminary step in deciding on the Intra-EU Objection, the Tribunal must determine

the law governing its jurisdiction.

As recalled above, the Parties disagree in this respect. The Respondent argues that EU
law, to the extent it is part of international law, must be applied by the Tribunal to its
jurisdiction pursuant to Article 26(6) of the ECT, which provides that “[a] tribunal [...]
shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and
principles of international law.”7** According to the Claimants, this provision is only
concerned with the law applicable to the merits.”*? Thus, even if EU law is relevant, it

shall not be applied to the issues of jurisdiction.

The Respondent’s interpretation of Article 26(6) of the ECT as requiring this Tribunal to
apply directly EU law when ascertaining its jurisdiction cannot be upheld. Article 26(6)
is indeed concerned with the law applicable to the merits, as is made clear by sub-

paragraph (1) of Article 26, as observed at paragraph 538 above).’*° Thus, the question

whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction under Article 26 of the ECT must be established
first and foremost pursuant to the terms of Article 26(1)-(5) of the ECT as interpreted
pursuant to Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT.”!

Jurisdictional requirements of Article 26 of the ECT interpreted in good faith in
accordance with the ordinary meaning of the terms of the treaty in their context and
in the light of its object and purpose

Under Article 26(1)-(3) of the ECT, an arbitration may be initiated for the resolution of
“[d]isputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party
relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged
breach of an obligation of the former under Part III [...]””#? The terms used in Article
26(1) of the ECT are defined in Article 1 of the Treaty. According to Article 1(2),
“Contracting Party’ means a state or Regional Economic Integration Organization which
has consented to be bound by this Treaty and for which the Treaty is in force.” An investor
is “a company or other organization organized in accordance with the law applicable in
that Contracting Party” (Article 1(7) of the ECT). An “investment” means “every kind of
asset, owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an Investor and includes: [...] a
company or business enterprise [...]” (Article 1(6) of the ECT). Finally, according to
Article 1(10), “‘Area’ means with respect to a state that is a Contracting Party: (a) the

territory under its sovereignty, it being understood that territory includes land, internal

waters and the territorial sea [.

622. Article 26(7) of the ECT additionally provides as follows:

[a]n Investor other than a natural person which has the nationality of a

referred to in paragraph (4) and which, before a dispute between it and that
Contracting Party arises, is controlled by Investors of another Contracting

623. It is not suggested that either Spain or the Netherlands is not a Contracting Party to the
ECT.

624. The Tribunal also notes that the Respondent did not raise any objections concerning the

Claimants’ investment process and corporate structure.”

625. Sevilla Beheer and Cordoba Beheer are private liability companies incorporated under
the laws of the Netherlands and shall be considered as “investors of another Contracting
Party” vis-a-vis the Respondent.”*

626. Sevilla Beheer and Cordoba Beheer fully own and control Cross Retail, which is
incorporated in Spain.” Sevilla Beheer and Cross Retail in turn fully own and control
the Spanish Project Companies.”“° Thus, by virtue of Article 26(7) of the ECT,”47 Cross
Retail and the Spanish Project Companies shall also be considered as “investors of
another Contracting Party” and as “nationals of another Contracting State” vis-a-vis the

Respondent for the purposes of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.

627. It is equally uncontested by the Respondent that the present dispute has arisen in respect
of Spain’s obligations under Part III of the ECT, namely, its Article 10(1) towards the

Claimants’ PV investments in Spain.

628. The jurisdictional requirements of Article 26(1)-(3) of the ECT thus appear to have been
fully satisfied. However, according to the Respondent, the fact that both Spain and the

Netherlands are member States of the EU (which, in turn, is party to the ECT) should

preclude this Tribunal from concluding that Claimants are from “another Contracting

Party.””* In the Respondent’s view, Article 26 of the ECT does not apply in an intra-7EU

context.”

629. The Tribunal notes that the Respondent agrees that there is no “disconnection clause” in

the Treaty,’°° i.e., there is no provision that would exempt the rules established by the

regional organization, the EU, from the application of the rules established by the ECT.
In the Tribunal’s view, this is important. Given the EU’s participation in the drafting of
the ECT, the absence of such a clause suggests that at the time of the ECT’s signing the
EU did not consider Article 26 of the ECT inapplicable as between the EU Member
States. In this regard, the Tribunal finds instructive the below observation made by the

tribunal in The PV Investors v. Spain:

[...] the ECT shows that where the Contracting Parties deemed it necessary to
address the relationship with other treaty regimes, they did so expressly. One
example is contained in Annex 2 to the Final Act of the European Energy
Charter Conference which provides that in the event of a conflict between the
Svalbard Treaty and the ECT, the former shall prevail. It would seem striking
that the Contracting Parties made an express exception for the
Svalbard Treaty, which concerns an archipelago in the Arctic, but somehow
omitted to specify that the ECT’s dispute settlement system did not apply in
all of the EU member states’ relations. Compared to the Svalbard Treaty
exception, an exception with regard to the intra-EU relations would be of
much greater significance. It_would be extraordinary that_an_ essential
component of the Treaty, such as investor-state arbitration, would not apply
among a significant number of Contracting Parties without the Treaty drafters
addressing this exception. In the Tribunal’s view, it is irreconcilable with the
ordinary meaning of the Treaty to read into it an implicit intra-EU
disconnection clause.”*!

630. The Landesbank Baden Wiirttemberg v. Spain tribunal having analyzed the ECT’s
drafting history similarly concluded that the latter does not support the Intra-EU
Objection:

What the travaux préparatoires do make clear is that the EU proposed that a
disconnection clause be included in a Ministerial Declaration to be attached
to the ECT. The draft proposed that a declaration include the following
provision: In their mutual relations, Contracting Parties which are Members
of the European Communities shall apply Community rules and shall not
therefore apply the rules arising from [the ECT] except insofar as there is no
Community rule governing the particular subject concerned. While we do not
know why this proposal was not adopted, the fact is that it was not and, to the
extent that reference to the travaux préparatoires is permissible, the fact that it
was proposed and yet not adopted militates against the interpretation advanced
by the [r]espondent.’*

631. The Tribunal thus concurs with the conclusion reached in Stadtwerke Miinchen v. Spain
that “it cannot be concluded” from the fact that the EU is a member to the ECT as a REIO
that “the EU Member States when signing the ECT in 1994 have transferred competence
for the adjudication of energy disputes under the ECT to the EU”, as “[a]n express

stipulation to that effect would be necessary.””**

632. Thus, the fact that EU is a party to the ECT as a REIO does not deprive Spain and the
Netherlands of their status as Contracting Parties and as potential parties to a dispute that
may be initiated pursuant to Article 26. Indeed, as it was rightly observed by the Cube
Infrastructure v. Spain tribunal: “the words found in Article 26(1) of the ECT do not
differentiate between different classes of Contracting Parties.””*+ Consequently, the ECT,
when interpreted “in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to”
its terms does not exclude the EU Member States from the application of Article 26.

Therefore, the Claimants should be considered as being from “another Contracting Party”

under Article 26 of the Treaty regardless of whether the respondent State is a member of

the EU or not.

aK

Although the jurisdictional requirements of Article 26 of the ECT clearly confer
jurisdiction on this Tribunal, it will nevertheless consider whether Article 26 of the ECT
can be interpreted as incompatible with EU law, and whether such a conflict (if it existed)

could deprive the Tribunal of its jurisdiction over the present dispute.

Is there a conflict between Article 26 of the ECT and EU law?

Spain argues that by virtue of Article 344 of the TFEU any matters related to the
interpretation or application of EU law cannot be referred to investor-State arbitration,
because such matters are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts referred to in

Article 267 of the TFEU.”°>
Article 344 of the TFEU provides as follows:

Member States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation

or application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other than those

provided for therein.
The Tribunal notes that regardless of whether the present dispute involves issues of EU
Jaw a number of arbitral tribunals ruled in the past that this provision does not encompass
disputes between a national of an EU Member State and another EU State.” This position
found support, inter alia, in the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction rendered in The PV

Investors v. Spain:

Upon a plain reading of Article 344 TFEU, it is clear that such provision
applies only to disputes involving two or more EU member states but does
not prohibit the submission of disputes between other actors to a different
method of settlement not contemplated in the EU Treaties. Because there is

no provision in the EU Treaties dealing with investor -state arbitration, the
principle set out in Article 344 TFEU is not applicable to that mechanism.”

637. The Stadtwerke Miinchen v. Spain tribunal equally found that “Article 344 of the TFEU
only applies to disputes between Member States of the EU, and not between individual
or corporate investors and a Member State.””°* Both tribunals concluded that the scope
of the obligation undertaken by EU Member States under the TFEU was different from
that of the ECT. As summarized by the tribunal in The PV Investors, “[b]ecause there is
no provision in the EU Treaties dealing with investor-state arbitration, the principle set

out in Article 344 TFEU is not applicable to that mechanism.” ”°?

638. The Tribunal concurs with the above view. It is not persuaded of the existence of a conflict
between the mechanism envisaged in Article 26 of the ECT and the provisions of the
TFEU. Nevertheless, out of an abundance of caution, the Tribunal will further consider
the impact of the alleged conflict between EU law and Article 26 of the ECT on these

proceedings.

d. Assuming, arguendo, that EU law prohibits intra-EU investment arbitration under
the ECT, which “law” should prevail?

639. Assuming arguendo that EU law nevertheless contains a prohibition for intra-EU
investment disputes to be initiated pursuant to Article 26 of the ECT, the Tribunal will
further consider whether this assumption would lead to a conclusion different from that

reached in the preceding paragraphs.

640. First of all, the Tribunal shall analyze whether the alleged conflict between EU law and
the ECT can be resolved on the basis of Article 16(2) of the ECT, as suggested by the

Claimants.”

Article 16 of the ECT provides as follows:

Where two or more Contracting Parties have entered into a prior international
agreement, or enter into a subsequent international agreement, whose terms in
either case concern the subject matter of Part III or V of this Treaty,

(1) nothing in Part III or V of this Treaty shall be construed to derogate from
any provision of such terms of the other agreement or from any right to dispute
resolution with respect thereto under that agreement; and

(2) nothing in such terms of the other agreement shall be construed to derogate
from any provision of Part III or V of this Treaty or from any right to dispute
resolution with respect thereto under this Treaty, where any such provision is
more favourable to the Investor or Investment.

642. The Tribunal notes that despite the unanimous rejection of the Intra-EU Objection by

643.

ECT-based investment tribunals, there is no consensus regarding the applicability of
Article 16 of the ECT to the relationship between EU law and the ECT. A number of
tribunals, including, for example, Vattenfall v. Germany (II) and RREEF v. Spain ruled
that Article 16 is applicable and resolves the conflict between EU law and the ECT in
favor of the latter.”°' However, a different conclusion was reached, for example, by the
BayWa v. Spain and Electrabel v. Hungary tribunals on the grounds that the ECT and EU

law do not share the same subject matter.’

The BayWa v. Spain tribunal concluded that it would be inclined to hold that “Article 10
of the ECT, in conjunction with Part V, is more favorable to the Investor or the
Investment”, as “[nJothing in the TFEU allows a direct challenge by an Investor to a State
measure harmful to it on grounds specified in Article 10, or on more favorable grounds
[nor] does the TFEU provide for an international tribunal to decide disputes directly
between investors and host States, as Part V of the ECT does.””? However, the first

condition of the applicability of Article 16 namely, that the other agreement be concerned

with the subject matter of Part III or V of the ECT, was not met, according to the BayWa

v. Spain tribunal.”

644. At the same time, for the reasons that follow, even if Article 16 of the ECT does not
apply to the relationship between EU law and the ECT as the two regimes are not
concerned with the same subject matter, the Tribunal cannot support the conclusion that

the former shall prevail pursuant to the general law of treaties as codified in the VCLT.

645. The Respondent’s argument on the supremacy of EU law”® is based, inter alia, on Article
30 of the VCLT on the application of successive treaties relating to the same subject-

matter, which provides in relevant part as follows:

3. When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the later treaty
but the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in operation under article
59, the earlier treaty applies only to the extent that its provisions are
compatible with those of the later treaty.

4. When the parties to the later treaty do not include all the parties to the earlier
one:

(a) As between States parties to both treaties the same rule applies as in
paragraph 3;

(b) As between a State party to both treaties and a State party to only one of
the treaties, the treaty to which both States are parties governs their mutual
rights and obligations.

5. Paragraph 4 is without prejudice to article 41, or to any question of the
termination or suspension of the operation of a treaty under article 60 or to
any question of responsibility which may arise for a State from the conclusion
or application of a treaty the provisions of which are incompatible with its
obligations towards another State under another treaty.

648.

However, if the Tribunal decides that Article 16 of the ECT does not apply to the alleged
inconsistency between the ECT and EU law, this would inevitably lead to the conclusion
that Article 30 of the VCLT is not applicable to this situation either, as it only applies to
treaties relating to the same subject matter.” At the Hearing, the Respondent has

eventually agreed with this proposition:

PROFESSOR DOLZER: [...] The articles of the [VCLT] deal with conflict
of treaties inasmuch as the treaties cover the same subject matter. If they don’t
cover the same subject matter, then we have no conflict. That’s the way I
understand them. I guess you would agree with me that if they don’t cover the
same subject matter, then we have no conflict. So the rules on conflict only
operate when we have treaties that relate to the same subject matter?

 

 

MS. FROHLINGSDORF NICOLAS: On this point I must agree. And this is
precisely the reason why we consider that Article 16 of the ECT is not
applicable [...]"°”

 

 

 

Therefore, even if the two regimes were to be considered as having the same subject-

matter,’

then Article 16 of the ECT resolves the conflict in favor of the ECT, as it applies
to both prior and subsequent agreements entered into by the Contracting Parties.
Conversely, if the ECT and EU law are considered as having different subject matters (as
per the Electrabel approach advocated by the Respondent’) neither Article 16 of the

ECT, nor Article 30 of the VCLT is applicable.

The Tribunal will now turn to Article 41 of the VCLT, which concerns agreements to

modify multilateral treaties between certain of the parties only and which may indeed

78 In this scenario, the Tribunal would be minded to find that the ECT is more favorable to the investors than the
TFEU, as the latter does not allow a direct claim to be brought by an investor against a State on the grounds similar
to those provided in Article 10 of the ECT or on more favourable grounds.

have the effect of excluding the application of the ECT as between the EU Member States

if the circumstances of its application are met.””°
649. Article 41 of the VCLT provides as follows:

1. Two or more of the parties to a multilateral treaty may conclude an
agreement to modify the treaty as between themselves alone if:

(a) the possibility of such a modification is provided for by the treaty; or
(b) the modification in question is not prohibited by the treaty and:

(i) does not affect the enjoyment by the other parties of their rights under the
treaty or the performance of their obligations;

(ii) does not relate to a provision, derogation from which is incompatible with
the effective execution of the object and purpose of the treaty as a whole.

2. Unless in a case falling under paragraph | (a) the treaty otherwise provides,
the parties in question shall notify the other parties of their intention to
conclude the agreement and of the modification to the treaty for which it
provides.

650. Unlike Article 30 of the VCLT, the above-quoted rule is not limited to treaties with the
same subject matter.’’! At the same time, the Tribunal was not presented with any proof
that, as required by Article 41(2) of the VCLT, the EU Member States notified the other
parties to the ECT of their intention to conclude an agreement that would modify the
terms of the ECT as between the EU Member States. Furthermore, the Tribunal agrees
with BayWa v. Spain that “it is very doubtful whether the abrogation inter se of the ECT
as between EU Member States is compatible ‘with the effective execution of the object

and purpose of the [ECT] as a whole’.”””? The Tribunal thus concludes that Article 41 of

the VCLT cannot be relied upon to exclude the application of the ECT, including its

Article 26, as between the EU Member States.

The Respondent has also referred to Article 59 of the VCLT (termination or suspension
of the operation of a treaty implied by conclusion of a later treaty) as a provision resolving
the alleged conflict between the ECT and EU law in favor of the former.’
In this regard, the Tribunal observes that Article 59 of the VCLT applies only if: (i) all
the parties to the earlier treaty have entered into the later treaty (the congruence of the
personal scope of the two treaties follows, inter alia, from the general rule on the
termination of a treaty enshrined in Article 54 of the VCLT); and (ii) both treaties share
the same subject matter. At least one of the conditions of the application of
Article 59 is clearly unmet in the present case, as the ECT’s Contracting Parties include

both EU and non-EU countries. This argument is therefore dismissed.

Finally, at the Hearing, the Respondent also suggested that it would be contrary to the
rules of treaty interpretation to consider that “the European Union would have [...]
concluded a treaty, which, by itself, goes against the principle[s] of autonomy of the
primacy and of the mutual trust”, as that would be “an absurd result”.””* The Tribunal
agrees that, as a matter of principle, EU law can be taken into account for the purposes of
interpreting Article 26 of the ECT by virtue of Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT as “rules of
international law applicable in the relations between the parties”.””> The Tribunal
however considers that it would be inappropriate to use Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT in
order to essentially re-write the clear terms of Article 26 of the ECT and deprive the latter
of any effect in an intra-EU context. This is not the purpose of treaty interpretation,
especially when the suggested interpretation is not supported by all of the ECT

signatories.’”°

76 For the same reasons, the views expressed by certain EU Member States and the European commission in the
aftermath of the Achmea Judgment cannot inform the Tribunal’s interpretation of Article 26 of the ECT. See

In view of the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent has not succeeded
at demonstrating that EU law prevails over the terms of Article 26 of the ECT.

The Tribunal thus sees no other solution but to dismiss the Intra-EU Objection.

The fact that as of the date of this Decision, the Intra-EU Objection has not been granted

by any tribunal constituted under the ECT comforts the Tribunal’s conclusion.

The impact of the CJEU’s jurisprudence (the Achmea and Komstroy Judgments)

The Tribunal will first of all address the Achmea Judgment, the relevance and impact of

which has been hotly debated by the Parties in the course of these proceedings.’””

The Tribunal recalls that in the Achmea Judgment, the CJEU reached the following

conclusion:

Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in
an international agreement concluded between Member States, such as Article
8 of the Agreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection of
investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and
Slovak Federative Republic, under which an investor from one of those
Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the
other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before
an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to
accept.’

The Respondent stated at the Hearing that the Achmea Judgment as such is not binding
on this Tribunal.’”? Rather the Respondent’s argument seems to be that the Tribunal
should follow the Judgment’s logic when interpreting the ECT and conclude that its
Article 26 is incompatible with the fundamental principles of EU law.’®° The question
therefore is whether the Achmea Judgment is relevant in the ECT context. As
Respondent’s counsel put it at the Hearing: “the question is to decide whether the Achmea

Judgment, as it is now, has to be applied to the ECT.”7*!

The Tribunal has not been persuaded that the Achmea Judgment’s reasoning is
“applicable” to ECT-based investor-State arbitrations. A fortiori, the Tribunal is not
convinced that the Achmea Judgment’s reasoning implies an incompatibility of the ECT’s

investor-State dispute settlement regime with EU law.

The first distinguishing factor is the multilateral and “mixed” nature of the ECT. Indeed,
the Tribunal cannot ignore the fact that the ECT was entered into with the participation
of the EU, an element that appears to have been acknowledged in the Achmea Judgment’s

reasoning:

It is true that, according to settled case-law of the Court, an international
agreement providing for the establishment of a court responsible for the
interpretation of its provisions and whose decisions are binding on the
institutions, including the Court of Justice, is not in principle incompatible
with EU law. The competence of the EU in the field of international relations
and its capacity to lude international necessarily entail the
power to submit to the decisions of a court which is created or desi d by
such agreements _as_regards the interpretation and application of their
provisions, provided that the autonomy of the EU and its legal order is
respected.”*?

Further, the Tribunal has already established that the ECT does not contain a

disconnection clause exempting intra-EU relations from the scope of the Treaty.

Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal endorses the conclusion reached in the Masdar Solar

v. Spain award, according to which “the Achmea Judgment [...] cannot be applied to

multilateral treaties, such as the ECT, to which the EU itself is a party.””*°

The Tribunal also finds it noteworthy that in rendering the Achmea Judgment, the CIEU

abstained from addressing the below observation of the Advocate General Wathelet:

[the ECT] operates even between Member States, since it was concluded not
as an agreement between the Union and its Member States, of the one part,
and third countries, of the other part, but as an ordinary multilateral treaty in
which all the Contracting Parties participate on an equal footing. In that sense,
the material provisions for the protection of investments provided for in that
Treaty and the ISDS mechanism also operate between Member States. I note

that if no EU institution and no Member State sought an opinion from the

782 Achmea Judgment (RL-93), para. 57 (emphasis added).

Court on the compatibility of that treaty with the EU and FEU Treaties, that is
because_none of them had the slightest suspicion _that_it might be
incompatible.”

663. Thus, this Tribunal agrees with other arbitral awards that concluded that the Achmea

Judgment is “of limited application” to ECT-based arbitrations.’®°

664. The Tribunal will further address the Komstroy Judgment where the CJEU, according to
the Respondent, has applied the Achmea Judgment’s reasoning to investor-State arbitral

proceedings brought under Article 26 of the ECT.7*°

665. The Komstroy Judgment was rendered upon a request for a preliminary ruling made by
the Paris Court of Appeal in the context of an annulment proceeding in Komstroy
(formerly Energoalians) v. Moldova, an arbitration initiated under the ECT by a
Ukrainian investor. The Paris Court of Appeal posed the following questions before the
CJEU:

[(1)] Must [Article 1(6) ECT] be interpreted as meaning that a claim which
arose from a contract for the sale of electricity and which did not involve any
economic contribution on the part of the investor in the host State can
constitute an “investment” within the meaning of that article?

[(2)] Must [Article 26(1) ECT] be interpreted as meaning that the acquisition,
by an investor of a Contracting Party, of a claim established by an economic
operator which is not from one of the States that are Contracting Parties to that
treaty constitutes an investment?

[(3)] Must [Article 26(1) ECT] be interpreted as meaning that a claim held by
an investor, which arose from a contract for the sale of electricity supplied at
the border of the host State, can constitute an investment made in the area of
another Contracting Party, in the case where the investor does not carry out
any economic activity in the territory of that latter Contracting Party?

The Tribunal observes that none of these questions concerned the alleged incompatibility
of intra-EU investor-State dispute settlement clauses with the TFEU. The Tribunal further
notes that neither of the parties to the Komstroy v. Moldova arbitration is an EU Member
State or a national of an EU Member State. Despite these circumstances and in addition
to answering the questions posed to it by the Paris Court of Appeal, the CJEU found that
“Article 26(2)(c) ECT must be interpreted as not being applicable to disputes between a
Member State and an investor of another Member State concerning an investment made
by the latter in the first Member State”.”*” This conclusion however was not set out in the
operative paragraph of the Komstroy Judgment, which only addressed the questions

referred to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling:

On those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:

Article 1(6) and Article 26(1) of the Energy Charter Treaty, signed at Lisbon
on 17 December 1994, approved on behalf of the European Communities by
Council and Commission Decision 98/181/EC, ECSC, Euratom of 23
September 1997, must be interpreted as meaning that the acquisition, by an
undertaking of a Contracting Party to that treaty, of a claim arising from a
contract for the supply of electricity, which is not connected with an
investment, held by an undertaking of a third State against a public
undertaking of another Contracting Party to that treaty, does not constitute an
‘investment’ within the meaning of those provisions.’**
Therefore, the CJEU’s finding regarding the incompatibility between Article 26(2)(c) of

the ECT and EU law can only be considered as an obiter dictum.

Furthermore, the Tribunal recalls that it is empowered to provide its own interpretation
of the jurisdictional requirements of the ECT by virtue of the principle of compétence de
la compétence. The CJEU’s jurisprudence is not binding on the Tribunal in this respect.

This is uncontested by the Respondent in principle. ’*°

In any event, the Tribunal cannot accept the CJEU’s interpretation of Article 26(2)(c) of
the ECT as persuasive, as the reasoning of the Komstroy Judgment does not provide any
analysis of this provision and its alleged inapplicability in an intra-EU context from the

perspective of international law. Although it is true that the provisions of the ECT “form

an integral part of the legal order of the European Union, this does not prevent both

the ECT and EU law from also being part of the international legal order.

Indeed, the ECT is a multilateral agreement signed by the EU and its Member States as
well as a number of other States not members of the EU. As long as there is no evidence
that the Respondent’s interpretation of Article 26 of the ECT is supported by all the
parties to the ECT (including its non-EU signatories), it cannot guide the Tribunal’s
interpretation under Article 31(2)(a)-(b) of the VCLT. Furthermore, as the Tribunal has
already observed, if the EU Member States wished to amend the terms of Article 26 of
the ECT inter se, they would have to follow the procedure provided for in Article 42 of
the ECT in accordance with Article 41 of the VCLT (see paragraphs 648-650 above).

There is however no evidence that this procedure was followed.

In its comments on the Komstroy Judgment, the Respondent presents a number of
additional arguments in support of the CJEU’s findings.”! For the sake of good order, the
Tribunal will consider each of these additional arguments although it shall be emphasized
that none of these arguments features in the Komstroy Judgment’s reasoning and thus
cannot be considered as affecting the Tribunal’s conclusion regarding the lack of

persuasiveness of the CJEU’s analysis.

In its comments on the Komstroy Judgment the Respondent submits that pursuant to the
principle of pacta sunt servanda the EU Member States (including the Netherlands and
Spain) “have accepted [...] the autonomy and primacy of EU law and the compulsory
effect of the CJEU rulings”.’”” The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the principle
of pacta sunt servanda (“every treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must
be performed by them in good faith””*) indeed imposes an obligation of the EU Member
States to observe the TFEU and other sources of EU law. However, by virtue of the exact

same principle the ECT’s Contracting Parties are obliged to comply with the terms of the

7 Komstroy Judgment (RL-136), paras. 49, 23.

ECT. The pacta sunt servanda principle thus does not further Spain’s Intra-EU Objection,

as it does not resolve the alleged conflict between the ECT’s Article 26 and EU law.

For the same reason, the Respondent’s assertion that the Komstroy Judgment is binding
on the Netherlands and that “Dutch investors cannot have any rights different that the

74 cannot assist the

rights and legal framework that is applicable to the Netherlands’
Tribunal in its analysis of the Intra-EU Objection, as the ECT is equally binding on both
Spain and the Netherlands and provides their nationals with access to investor-State

arbitration.

The Respondent also invokes the principle of venire contra factum proprium, which
allegedly implies that the practice of respecting the principles of EU law has created
“a reliance in the Member States that they will be always observed”.”*° The Tribunal notes
that the Respondent’s allegations pertain to the relations among the EU Member States,
whereas the present proceedings were initiated to resolve a dispute between a State
(Spain) and multiple Dutch investors. The Claimants’ home _ State
(the Netherlands) is not a participant in these proceedings. The Tribunal therefore does

not need to consider this issue any further.

Spain further contends that the autonomy of EU law is respected “not only by the
Netherlands and Spain and by all the Member States of the EU, but by all the [S]tates of
the international community who have never opposed to the respect of that autonomy.”7°°
Although the Respondent has failed to articulate its position in terms of the law of treaties,
in the Tribunal’s view the Respondent’s argument can be understood as referring to the
subsequent practice of States in relation to the principle of the autonomy of EU law. Such
practice could indeed be taken into account for the purposes of treaty interpretation under
Article 31(3)(b) of the VCLT (“[t]here shall be taken into account, together with the
context [...] any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the
agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation”). At the same time, in the course of
these proceedings the Tribunal has not been presented with any evidence or any detailed

argumentation regarding this alleged subsequent practice of the non-EU Parties to the

ECT in respect of the principle of the autonomy of EU law. The Tribunal thus cannot
conclude, based on the Respondent’s statement made for the first time in its comments
on the Komstroy Judgment, that Spain’s interpretation of Article 26 of the ECT is
reflective of the subsequent practice of the ECT’s Contracting Parties and that it does not
amount to an impermissible amendment of the ECT’s terms by the EU Member States

inter se outside of the established procedure.

In view of the above, the Tribunal maintains its conclusion regarding the applicability of
Article 26 of the ECT in an intra-EU context despite the findings made in the Komstroy

Judgment.

Issues of enforcement do not affect the Tribunal’s jurisdiction

The Respondent submits that any award rendered by this Tribunal may constitute State
aid under EU law and may be refused enforcement on public policy grounds by national
courts of the EU Member States.”*” The Tribunal is of the view that the enforceability

issues are irrelevant for the purposes of deciding on this jurisdictional objection.’**

Conclusion on the Intra-EU Objection

In the preceding paragraphs the Tribunal has established that: (1) the jurisdictional
requirements of Article 26(1)-(3) of the ECT and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention are
satisfied (subject to the validity of the Respondent’s Intra-EU Objection); (2) the ECT
does not exclude, either expressly or by implication, intra-EU investor-State disputes
from the application of its Article 26(3); (3) the TFEU does not seem to contain an explicit
prohibition to refer investor-State disputes to arbitration under an investment treaty; (4)
even if there was a prohibition (i.e., a conflict between EU law and the ECT), EU law
would not have been able to displace the terms of Article 26 of the ECT (under which this
Tribunal was constituted) either by virtue of Article 30 or Article 41 of the VCLT. The

Intra-EU Objection is therefore rejected.

The TVPEE Objection
The Parties’ positions

The Respondent

The Respondent argues that pursuant to Article 26(1) of the ECT Spain consented to
arbitrate investor-State disputes that concern “an alleged breach of an obligation” existing
under the relevant part of the ECT.” The Respondent however insists that it has no
obligations under Article 10(1) the ECT with respect to the TVPEE because the latter is
a taxation measure exempted from the scope of the ECT by virtue of its

Article 21.8 Thus, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the TVPEE claim.

The Respondent submits that the TVPEE falls under the definition of a “taxation
measure” under the ECT as the relevant provisions of Law 15/2012 that introduced the
TVPEE are “provision[s] relating to taxes of the domestic law of the Contracting Party”,

in accordance with Article 21(7)(a)(i) of the ECT.*°!

The Respondent argues that the TVPEE is a tax from the perspective of Spanish law.*°
In this regard, the Respondent first of all relies on Article 1 of Law 15/2012 which
explicitly characterizes the TVPEE as “a tax of direct character and real nature.”
Referring to Article 2 of Law 58/2003 on General Taxation which defines the concept,
purposes and classes of taxes, the Respondent then enumerates the elements of the
TVPEE (the tax base, taxable period, applicable rate).*** The taxation nature of the

TVPEE, according to the Respondent, has also been recognized by the Institute of

80 Counter-Memorial, paras. 120-214; Rejoinder, paras. 187-247. While acknowledging the fact that Article 21 of
the ECT contains a number of exceptions the Respondent asserts that none of these exceptions applies to Article
10(1) of the ECT.

682. In the Respondent’s view, the TVPEE also meets all of the defining characteristics of a
tax under international law, namely: (i) the TVPEE is established by law — Law 15/2012;
(ii) such Law imposes an obligation on a class of people — “all those who perform the
activities of production and incorporation into the electric system”, and (iii) said
obligation involves paying money to the State for public purposes — the TVPEE is listed
as a type of State revenue in the General State Budget which is used to finance public
expenditures.*°8 Additionally, the Respondent emphasizes that the Commission has

confirmed the taxation nature of the TVPEE and its compliance with EU law.°?

683. The Respondent insists that the above analysis is sufficient to characterize the TVPEE as
a taxation measure for the purposes of Article 21 of the ECT. The Respondent argues that
the only exceptions to the carve-out are those provided in paragraphs 2 to 5 of Article 21
of the ECT.*!° For example, Article 21(5) of the ECT expressly carves out Article 13 of
the ECT on expropriation from the scope of Article 21(1). The Respondent emphasizes
that none of the exceptions provided in paragraphs 2 to 5 of Article 21 of the ECT is

applicable to the Claimants’ case.*!!

684. The bona fide analysis of the taxation measure is inapplicable to the present case as the
dispute where such an analysis was performed in the past, namely in the Yukos
arbitrations,*!? concerned extraordinary circumstances, in which taxation measures were
used to destroy a company and eliminate a political opponent.*'? According to the
Respondent, the Claimants failed to discharge their burden of proof in respect of the lack

of the bona fide character of the TVPEE.*'+

685. Referring to EnCana v. Ecuador the Respondent argues that the economic effects of a
taxation measure do not form part of the bona fide analysis.*'> Further, or in the
alternative, the Respondent submits that the TVPEE lawfully did not distinguish between
the traditional and RE producers, that the TVPEE was not discriminatory and that it did
not constitute a disguised tariff cut but a tax designed to raise Spain’s income to finance
public expenditure.*'® Specifically, the Respondent asserts that the lack of distinction
between the traditional and RE producers was a choice of the legislator that was within
its wide margin of appreciation as confirmed by the Spanish Constitutional Court.*!” As

regards the non-discriminatory nature of the TVPEE, the Respondent alleges that the

TVPEE “does not discriminate against renewable producers in terms of repercussion.”*!®

In particular, the TVPEE is one of the costs that is compensated through the specific

remuneration regime established for the RE producers.*!”

812 The reference to the “Yukos” arbitrations is to the following three arbitrations: Hulley Enterprises Limited

686. Finally, the Respondent emphasizes that its position on the lack of jurisdiction over the
TVPEE claim is shared by the arbitral tribunals in the /solux v. Spain, Eiser v. Spain,

Novenergia II v. Spain, Masdar Solar v. Spain, and Antin v. Spain arbitrations.”

b. The Claimants

687. The Claimants submit that the ECT carves out only bona fide taxation measures.**! Thus,
it is insufficient for the assessment of the TVPEE from the perspective of Article 21 of
the ECT to assert that the TVPEE is a “tax” under Spanish law.*? In the Claimants’ view,
in order to determine whether a measure falls within Article 21 of the ECT, State’s

conduct must be assessed in its totality under the balance of probabilities standard,

because no State would “expressly declare that [its] taxation measure is a sham.”*??

688. The application of this standard to the present case, according to the Claimants, requires
the Tribunal to determine whether the implementation of the TVPEE is more consistent
with the conclusion that it forms part of a series of measures designed to deprive the
Claimants of their rights under the Special Regime.*** The Claimants further submit that

if there is prima facie evidence that the TVPEE is “arbitrary and discriminatory, the

99825

Tribunal may draw inferences in favor of the Claimants”*”’, and that the burden of proof

shifts to the Respondent.*?¢

Among other precedents pertaining to the application of Article 21 of the ECT, the
Claimants particularly emphasize Antaris v. Czech Republic where an ECT-based tribunal
found itself competent to hear a claim brought against the Czech Republic by PV
investors in relation to the so-called “Solar Levy”.**? The Claimants attach particular
importance to the following paragraph of the Antaris v. Czech Republic tribunal’s
analysis:

If an ECT tribunal were to consider only the form of the measure rather than

its substance, it would provide the scope for abuse of the ECT’s tax carve-out,

as the contracting states would be able to escape their obligations under Part

III of the ECT, and thus liability from their violations thereof, simply by

labelling governmental actions as “taxation” measures. There is no indication

in the ECT that an ECT tribunal’s jurisdiction does not encompass the

determination of whether a particular measure constitutes a “Taxation

Measure” for the purpose of Article 21 of the ECT. An ECT tribunal must

therefore make a substantive determination of the measure in light of the

relevant facts rather than simply adopting the contracting state’s own, formal
characterization of that measure.***

Thus, the Claimants submit that the Tribunal “must determine in substance whether or

not [the TVPEE] has the characteristics of a tax.”*”

The following facts are referred to by the Claimants to demonstrate that the TVPEE does
not have said features of a tax and lacks the bona fide character. First, the Claimants point
out that the sum identical to the amount collected via the TWPEE
(i.e., 7%) is subsequently returned to the Electricity System. Thus, the TVPEE serves the
purpose of a tariff cut, which is “channeled” through the State budget.**° The Claimants
further assert that the TVPEE “was intended” as a tariff cut. Prior to the introduction of
the TVPEE, Mr. José Manuel Soria, the then Minister of Industry, Energy and Tourism

stated that the Ministry “could have opted for a reduction in premiums but [it] opted

827 § measure similar in its effect to the TVPEE. See Hearing Tr., Day 2, 19 March 2019, 129:14-18 (Ingle),

instead for fiscal measures”.**! The Claimants further mention the fact that at the time
when the TVPEE was implemented, Spain was already facing several investor-State

disputes concerning the changes to the Special Regime.
that “[t]he inference must be that [the TVPEE] was framed as a tax with the purpose of

avoiding liability for breaching investors’ rights under the ECT.”*?

Additionally, the Claimants assert that the TVPEE is discriminatory and unrelated to its
purported rationale.*** The TVPEE’s discriminatory character, in the Claimants’ view, is
due to the fact that the RE producers (unlike the traditional ones) had no ability to pass
on the TVPEE costs on the consumer.**> The Claimants also argue that the TVPEE is
arbitrary and mala fide as it runs against the aim declared in Law 15/2012 that introduced
the alleged tax:

The objective of this Law is to harmonise our tax system with a more efficient

and respectful use of the environment and sustainable development, values

which inspire this tax return, and as such, bring it into line with the basic

principles that govern the tax, energy and of course the environmental policy
of the European Union.**°

According to the Claimants, the introduction of the TVPEE does the opposite of what
Law 15/2012 claims to achieve by adversely affecting RE installations.*” The Claimants
further submit that Spain has not considered any alternative measure to reach the declared
environmental goal and that it did not demonstrate any rational link between the TVPEE
and its professed aim.88 Thus, the Claimants submit that the TVPEE is not an

environmental measure.

The Tribunal’s analysis

695. Article 21 of the ECT provides in relevant part as follows:

(1) Except as otherwise provided in this Article, nothing in this Treaty shall
create rights or impose obligations with respect to Taxation Measures of the
Contracting Parties. In the event of any inconsistency between this Article and
any other provision of the Treaty, this Article shall prevail to the extent of the
inconsistency.

LJ

(3) Article 10(2) and (7) shall apply to Taxation Measures of the Contracting
Parties other than those on income or on capital, except that such provisions
shall not apply to:

(a) impose most favoured nation obligations with respect to advantages
accorded by a Contracting Party pursuant to the tax provisions of any
convention, agreement or arrangement described in subparagraph (7)(a)(ii) or
resulting from membership of any Regional Economic Integration
Organization; or

(b) any Taxation Measure aimed at ensuring the effective collection of taxes,
except where the measure arbitrarily discriminates against an Investor of
another Contracting Party or arbitrarily restricts benefits accorded under the
Investment provisions of this Treaty.

(5) (a) Article 13 shall apply to taxes.

(b) Whenever an issue arises under Article 13, to the extent it pertains to
whether a tax constitutes an expropriation or whether a tax alleged to
constitute an expropriation is discriminatory, the following provisions shall
apply:

(i) The Investor or the Contracting Party alleging expropriation shall refer the

by the Investor or the Contracting Party, bodies called upon to settle disputes

Competent Tax Authorities;

LJ

(iii) Bodies called upon to settle disputes pursuant to Article 26(2)(c) or 27(2)
may take into account any conclusions arrived at by the Competent Tax
Authorities regarding whether the tax is an expropriation. Such bodies shall
take into account any conclusions arrived at within the six-month period
prescribed in subparagraph (b)(ii) by the Competent Tax Authorities
regarding whether the tax is discriminatory. Such bodies may also take into
account any conclusions arrived at by the Competent Tax Authorities after the
expiry of the six-month period;

(iv) Under no circumstances shall involvement of the Competent Tax
Authorities, beyond the end of the six-month period referred to in
subparagraph (b)(ii), lead to a delay of proceedings under Articles 26 and 27.

LJ
(7) For the purposes of this Article:
(a) The term “Taxation Measure” includes:

(i) any provision relating to taxes of the domestic Law of the Contracting
Party or of a political subdivision thereof or a local authority therein; and

(ii) any provision relating to taxes of any convention for the avoidance of
double taxation or of any other international agreement or arrangement by
which the Contracting Party is bound.

(b) There shall be regarded as taxes on income or on capital all taxes imposed
on total income, on total capital or on elements of income or of capital,
including taxes on gains from the alienation of property, taxes on estates,
inheritances and gifts, or substantially similar taxes, taxes on the total amounts
of wages or salaries paid by enterprises, as well as taxes on capital
appreciation.

(c) A “Competent Tax Authority” means the competent authority pursuant to
a double taxation agreement in force between the Contracting Parties or, when
no such agreement is in force, the minister or ministry responsible for taxes or
their authorized representatives.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the terms “tax provisions” and “taxes” do not
include customs duties.

696. Article 21(1) of the ECT provides for an exception to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal with
respect to “Taxation Measures” (the “Taxation Carve-Out”). The purpose of the
Taxation Carve-Out in the ECT is to preserve the Contracting Parties’ power to impose
taxes, which is an essential sovereign prerogative. This prerogative is subject to certain

limitations, as explicitly stated in Article 21. For instance, Article 21(5) of the ECT

220

provides that Article 13 of the ECT (which relates to expropriation) shall apply to “taxes”,
thereby limiting the Taxation Carve-Out set out at Article 21(1) of the ECT (the “Tax
Claw-Back”). In addition to such explicit limitations to the Taxation Carve-Out, there is
a question whether and to what extent the Taxation Carve-Out may be subject to implicit
limitations, such a requirement that in order to qualify as a “Taxation Measure”, a State
measure must constitute a bona fide taxation-related action that is not adopted with the

aim to achieve an entirely unrelated purpose.

697. This was one of the issues in the “Yukos” arbitrations.*“! In that case, the tribunal found
that the Taxation Carve-Out in Article 21(1) did not apply to the multitude of impugned
tax collection measures which were ultimately found to have caused the bankruptcy of

Yukos Oil Company in pursuit of an ulterior political purpose.*”

In reaching its
conclusion, one of the considerations by the Yukos tribunal was that an interpretation
under which the Tax Claw-Back was narrower than the Taxation Carve-Out would lead
to “a gaping hole in the ECT where investors would stand completely unprotected from
expropriatory taxation.”** The case at hand bears no resemblance to the Yukos
arbitrations as it neither involves the characterization of a multitude of measures relating
to the assessment or collection of taxes claims (as opposed to the legality of a “tax”), nor

allegations of illegal expropriation (as opposed to allegations of unfair and inequitable

treatment).

698. The Claimants are not arguing that the TVPEE as such is not a tax under Spanish law.*4
Thus, the Tribunal notes at the outset that there is no dispute between the Parties regarding

the characterization of the TVPEE as a tax under Spanish law.

UNCITRAL arbitrations: Hulley Enterprises Limited (Cyprus) v. The Russian Federation, UNCITRAL, PCA Case

699. In the Tribunal’s view, the TVPEE satisfies the largely accepted criteria of a tax: it was
established by law (Law 15/2012), in respect of a class of persons (conventional and RE
electricity producers), and imposed an obligation to pay money to the State for public
purposes.*4> In light of these circumstances, the Tribunal is not prepared to inquire

whether or not the TVPEE achieved the end for which it was purportedly adopted (i.e.,

an environmental purpose and budgetary balance*®).

700. The Tribunal is also of the view that the present circumstances differ from the facts
relating to the so-called “Solar Levy”**’ that was at issue in the Antaris v. Czech Republic
arbitration, which, in the Claimants’ view, provides a “better test” that the Tribunal should
follow when deciding on the TVPEE Objection.** In that case, the parties engaged in a
lengthy discussion on the characterization of the Solar Levy under Czech law that was
spurred by the conflicting positions of the Czech courts and authorities.*“? The Antaris v.
Czech Republic tribunal ultimately found that the Solar Levy did not constitute a tax under
Czech law.*°° As it follows from the text of the award and as confirmed by HE Judge
Peter Tomka in his Declaration appended to the award, the decision of 10 July 2014 of

the 9th Chamber of the Czech Supreme Administrative Court in which it found that the

Solar Levy was not a tax, was “the main basis” for the tribunal’s conclusion.**!

45 ‘These criteria were applied, inter alia, in Foresight Luxembourg Solar 1 S.A.R.L., et al. v. Kingdom of Spain,
SCC Case No. 2015/150, Final Award, 14 November 2018 (CL-164), para. 255; Burlington, paras. 164-165.

46 See Law 15/2012, Preamble.

7 The solar levy was initially set by the Czech Republic at 26% and subsequently at 10% for solar energy
producers under the [FiT] system. It was withheld by the grid operator who paid the [FiT] to the energy producers.

701. Inany event, regardless of whether the Tribunal can analyze the purpose of the challenged

tax, the Claimants submitted no evidence that in the present case the TVPEE was

construed as a tax with the purpose of avoiding international liability.*°

702. Based on the above, this Tribunal concludes that the TVPEE qualifies as a “tax” under
Spanish law and, consequently, as a “tax” within the meaning of Article 21(7) of the

ECT.*53

703. Having established that the TVPEE constitutes a tax within the meaning of Article 21(7)
of the ECT, the Tribunal finds that the TVPEE is covered both by the Taxation Carve-
Out under Article 21(1) as well as the Tax Claw-Back under Article 21(5) (which the
Claimants are not invoking). Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal is satisfied that the

TVPEE does not fall within its jurisdiction.

Interpretation of Article 10(1) of the ECT
The Parties’ positions

The Claimants

The Claimants argue that the five sentences of Article 10(1) of the ECT embody
commitments towards investments none of which is “merely preambular or hortatory”.***
The Claimants further submit that Article 10(1) of the ECT provides for the FET
standard of treatment that must be assessed on the basis of the following non-cumulative
criteria:

(a) whether the host State breached the investor’s reasonable and legitimate
expectations [...];

(b) whether the State failed to provide a stable and predictable legal and
business framework in relation to the investment;

(c) whether the State’s conduct was transparent;

(d) whether the State acted in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner; and

(e) whether the actions of the State were disproportionate.**°

The Claimants argue that the FET standard enshrined in Article 10(1) of the ECT is an
autonomous standard which is not limited to the minimum standard under customary
international law.8*° The Claimants also contend that the FET standard is absolute, as it
“provides a fixed reference point regardless of the treatment others receive.”**’ The

motive and bad faith, according to the Claimants, need not to be established to find an

FET breach.*°* Conversely, if an FET violation was committed in good faith or for a

legitimate cause — that does not excuse the Respondent.**?

706. Finally, the Claimants argue that the Tribunal must assess the Disputed Measures
collectively “to arrive at the conclusion that the totality of those measures, cumulatively,

fell below the FET standard, irrespective as to whether or not Spain can find any pretext

to justify any (or all) of the measures individually.”°°

b. The Respondent

707. The Respondent argues that Article 10(1) of the ECT contains only one commitment: the
FET standard of treatment.**! At the same time, the Respondent does not appear to be
taking issue with the elements of the FET standard identified by the Claimants.
In particular, the Respondent does not dispute that the FET standard embodies the

obligation to not upset the Claimants’ legitimate expectations.*

708. The Respondent further submits that “the main objective of the ECT is to grant foreign
investors domestic or non-discriminatory treatment, no lower than the minimum
protection standards admitted in international law.”*® The Respondent also argues that
the standard enshrined in Article 10(1) of the ECT requires a “balancing exercise” and

that there will be no violation of the FET standard if the host State “exercises its

regulatory power in a reasonable manner when pursuing a public interest.”*™*

709. The Respondent also asserts that each of the Disputed Measures must be assessed

2. The Tribunal’s analysis

710. Article 10(1) of the ECT provides as follows:

Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty,
encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions
for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area.
Such conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times to
Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable
treatment. Such Investments shall also enjoy the most constant protection and
security and no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or
discriminatory measures their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or
disposal. In no case shall such Investments be accorded treatment less
favourable than that required by international law, including treaty
obligations. Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it has
entered into with an Investor or an Investment of an Investor of any other
Contracting Party.

711. The Parties agree that Article 10(1) enshrines the obligation to provide fair and equitable
treatment (FET) (in addition to a so-called “umbrella clause” — the last sentence of Article

10(1)).

712. The Parties also seem to agree that the FET standard includes the following elements: the
protection of reasonable and legitimate expectations; the protection against arbitrary or
unreasonable, or disproportionate measures as well as the obligation to act in a transparent

manner.*® This list is also reflective of the obligations forming part of the FET

standard identified by other tribunals.°®”

713. The Tribunal needs to consider separately the language “shall, in accordance with the
provisions of the Treaty, encourage and create stable [...] conditions for Investors of other
Contracting Parties”, which is contained in Article 10(1) of the ECT. The Tribunal notes
that neither of the Parties argues that the obligation to ensure stable conditions (regardless
of whether it is considered as an autonomous standard or not) requires the State to
“freeze” its legal system.*®* The Parties appear to be equally in agreement that the
obligation to ensure stable conditions would only be breached if the disputed regulatory
changes were “drastic” and “unexpected”.*® To that effect, the Respondent refers to the
Blusun v. Italy award where the tribunal found that “the fair and equitable treatment
standard which, by virtue of the second sentence, is at the core of the obligation of stability
under the first sentence [of Article 10(1) ECT]” the obligation of stability imposes “a
relatively high” threshold. The tribunal in Blusun v. Italy cited with approval El Paso v.
Argentina where the tribunal spoke of “a total alteration of the entire legal setup for
foreign investments” as well as LG&E v. Argentina where the tribunal mentioned a

complete dismantling of the legal framework constructed to attract investors.5”°

714. In addition, the Tribunal adheres to the position expressed by a large number of authorities
that the first sentence of Article 10(1) of the ECT mentioning “stable conditions” cannot
be interpreted in isolation from the second sentence of the same provision, which refers

to the obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment.*”! It is also widely accepted that

the FET standard does not prevent sovereign States from exercising their regulatory

872

powers in a manner consistent with international law.°’~ In this connection, having

analyzed the object and purpose of the ECT, in The PV Investors v. Spain the tribunal

persuasively concluded as follows:

[...] the Parties to the ECT aimed at realizing a balance between the sovereign
rights of the State over energy resources and the creation of a climate favorable
to the flow of investments on the basis of market principles. In other words,
while the purpose of “promot[ing] long-term cooperation in the energy field”
which is stipulated in Article 2 of the Treaty may be facilitated by stability of
the investment framework, the requirement of stability is not absolute; it must
be balanced with other principles, including those that are directly derived
from “State sovereignty”, e.g., the State’s right to regulate and to adapt the
regulatory framework to changed circumstances. More generally, the
protection of investments and the right to regulate operate in a balanced way
under the ECT as in all other investment treaties.'”

 

The Tribunal concurs with the authorities referred to above which found that legal
stability does not constitute an obligation separate from the fair and equitable treatment
standard under Article 10(1) of the ECT.8” Rather, Article 10(1) of the ECT, which
includes the obligation to protect legitimate expectations, subsumes an obligation of
stability. Thus, the Tribunal will analyze the first and second sentences of

Article 10(1) together in the context of the Claimants’ legitimate expectations claim.

Professor Cameron disagrees with the Tribunal’s majority. In Professor Cameron’s view,
stability has a special meaning under the ECT: “the treaty protection of stability is [...]
stronger under the ECT than under any other international investment treaty”.*” This is
so because of an alleged “emphasis” on stable conditions in the text of Article 10(1) ECT,
which, according to Professor Cameron, is a an example of a deliberate “legal recognition

of a sector-specific investment feature”, acting as a constraint on the State’s right to

No. ARB/16/18, Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Directions on Quantum, 13 September 2021 (RL-137),

872 Which does not seem to be contested by the Claimants: Hearing Tr., Day 1, 18 March 2019, 53:9-13 (Vazquez-
Guillén: “Article 97 of the Spanish Constitution sets out very clearly the power to regulate of the state. So no one
is saying at all that there is no ability to regulate. So regulation — and of course the [FiT] — can change”).

regulate, which is allegedly necessary to achieve the objectives of promoting investments

in the energy sector.°”°

The majority wishes to note in this respect that even if the ECT’s protection of stability
is stronger than under other investment agreements, the practical implications of such a
conclusion on the analysis of the Claimants’ claims are unclear as long as it is not alleged
that the guarantee of stability is absolute.*”” Therefore, in order to decide whether there
has been a breach of this obligation the Tribunal would still be required to analyze Spain’s
conduct through the prism of the FET standard, which, as rightly noted by the BayWa v
Spain tribunal, takes into account both the prerogatives and responsibilities of
governments and the rights and interests of investors.*”® As part of its balancing

exercise®”

, the Tribunal would thus need to assess the Claimants’ expectations in respect
of the alleged guarantees of stability of the host State’s regulatory framework. In sum, the
majority believes that even if the arguments set out at paragraphs 8-17 of the Partial
Dissenting Opinion were accepted, the Tribunal would not have been dispensed from
analyzing the regulatory framework under which the Claimants’ made their investments
and from which they derived their alleged expectations. In this regard, the majority agrees
with Professor Cameron that “a central question for determination is whether the Disputed
Measures introduced by the Respondent in its energy law breached the Claimants’

legitimate expectations”.**°

720.

The Claimants propose the following test for the assessment of the Claimants’ legitimate
expectations: (i) the expectations must be assessed at the time of the investment; (ii) the
expectations must be legitimately and reasonably held; and (iii) the expectations may be

derived from the host-State’s regulatory framework.**!

As regards due diligence, the Claimants argue that “due diligence that informs an

investor’s subjective understanding of the regulatory framework is not determinative” for

a legitimate expectations claim***

and that “the only relevant enquiry is whether the
investor’s understanding was objectively reasonable.”**? The Claimants also argue that
the Tribunal must take into account the expertise of a particular investor as well as the
level of complexity of the provisions in reliance on which the investment was made.**+

The Claimants further argue that it is irrelevant from the international law perspective
whether a commitment was made in a law or in a regulation, as any kind of domestic act

can be amended by the State at will.**>

ii. The Respondent

721. The Respondent submits that the general approach to be followed in the assessment of
the Claimants’ legitimate expectations is the one proposed in Invesmart v. Czech
Republic,**° according to which “the test of whether [...] an expectation can give rise to

a successful claim at international law is an objective one.”**”

722. Based on Invesmart v. Czech Republic, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal is
required to investigate the regulatory framework and the objective circumstances under
which the Claimants made their investments in Spain.*** The Tribunal, according to the
Respondent, must also take into account the subjective circumstances of the investor, in

particular, the due diligence performed when the investor made its investment.

723. Finally, the Respondent asserts that State conduct, i.e., how State officials and various
State entities dealt with the investor must be assessed as well.*® In this regard, the
Respondent endorses the Jnvesmart v. Czech Republic award where it states that “it is
important to distinguish between the various entities of the [S]tate [...] One entity of the

[S]tate not vested with actual decision-making authority cannot be taken to bind the entity

which by law possesses the actual authority.”°°°

724. At the Hearing, the Respondent also argued that provisions of general legislation are not
sufficient to generate legitimate expectations that there would be no regulatory
changes.**! In support of this position, the Respondent quoted the following excerpt from

725. The Respondent equally invokes the principle of hierarchy of norms to argue that
regulatory acts cannot be the source of investors’ expectations in the absence of a

commitment provided in a law.**

However, elsewhere in their submissions, the Claimants stated that “RD 436/2004 [was]
the regime that was in place at the time the Claimants made their initial investment in the
PV Farms.”**” This is despite the fact that none of the Claimants’ PV Plants was registered

under this Royal Decree.

The Respondent

The Respondent argues that the Claimants’ investment process began in 2005, when
Mr. Bouman made his decision to invest in the PV sector in Spain.*°8 Thus, in the
Respondent’s view, the period of time the Tribunal must consider extends from 2005 to
2010.5 The Respondent’s position implies that (i) the Claimants’ initial expectations
could not have been based only on RD 661/2007 as this regulation was issued almost two
years after Mr. Bouman’s decision to invest in Spain and that (ii) the Claimants’
expectations could not have remained unchanged throughout 2005-2010 due to the
regulatory developments and announcements of further regulatory changes made during

this period”

ii. The content of the alleged expectations and their reasonableness

732.

The Claimants

The Claimants argue that their expectations were twofold: (i) regarding the nature,
amount, and duration of the FiTs under RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008; and

(ii) regarding the stability of the economic regimes under said Royal Decrees.””!

As regards the nature, amount, and duration of the incentives, the Claimants allegedly
expected that the installations registered in the RAIPRE would be able to: (i) sell
electricity at a FiT for the amounts indicated in RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008;
(ii) benefit from, the FiT on all of the electricity produced; (iii) benefit from the FiT

during the entire operational life of the installations registered under RD 661/2007 and

during 25 years for the installations registered under RD 1578/2008; (iv) benefit from the

CPI index provided in said Royal Decrees.*°”

733. Furthermore, the Claimants argue that the alleged stability commitment was core to their
expectations; absent such a commitment the Claimants would not have invested in the
Spanish RE sector. This element of the Claimants’ expectations was based on the
following alleged guarantees of RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008: (i) the provisions
establishing a specific FiT and the period during which it would apply (see paragraphs
254, 295 above and (ii) the commitment not to subject existing installations to future tariff

revisions.°™

734. The commitment not to subject existing installations to future tariff revisions, according

to the Claimants, was provided in Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007, which states as follows:

During the year 2010, on sight of the results of the monitoring reports on the
degree of fulfilment of [the 2005-2010 PER], and of the Energy Efficiency
and Savings Strategy in Spain (E4), together with such new targets as may be
included in the subsequent Renewable Energies Plan 2011-2020, there shall
be a review of the tariffs, premiums, supplements and lower and upper limits
defined in this Royal Decree with regard to the costs associated with each of
these technologies, the degree of participation of the special regime in
covering the demand and its impact upon the technical and economic
management of the system, and a reasonable rate of profitability shall always
be guaranteed with reference to the cost of money in the capital markets.
Subsequently a further review shall be performed every four years,
maintaining the same criteria as previously.

The revisions to the regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits indicated
in_this paragraph shall not affect facilities_for which the deed of
commissioning shall have been granted prior to | January of the second year
following the year in which the revision shall have been performed.”

735. According to the Claimants, the second paragraph of Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007
protected duly-registered installations from the changes introduced in 2010-2012 and
“most certainly from Spain’s complete withdrawal of the Special Regime in July

736. In support of their interpretation of Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007, the Claimants refer to
the Memoria Econémica of the Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Tourism in relation to
RD 661/2007, which allegedly confirmed that Article 44(3) was specifically included as
a guarantee against “any” revisions of the regulated tariffs, premiums and supplements

contained in RD 661/2007:

Revisions to the tariffs, premiums, and supplements will be done in the
following manner:

In 2010, in light of the monitoring reports on the degree of compliance with
the Renewable Energy Plan (PER) 2005-2010 and the Spanish Strategy for
Electricity Savings and Efficiency (E4), as well as the new objectives that are
included in the following Renewable Energy Plan for the 2011-2020 period,
the tariffs, premiums, supplements, and upper and lower limits defined in this
Royal Decree will be revised, their application starting on 1 January 2011,
attending to the costs associated with each of these technologies, to the degree
of participation in the special regimen in the coverage of demand, and to their
incidence in the technical and economic management of the system. A new
revision will be carried out every four years from then.

The regulated tariffs, premiums, supplements, and limits derived from any of
these revisions will be applicable only to those facilities that have been
registered definitively in the [RAIPRE] after 1 January of the year following
the year in which the revision is made.”

737. To demonstrate that their expectations were reasonable, legitimate, and objective, the
Claimants further refer to the 14 February 2007 report of the CNE on the draft
RD 661/2007 where the CNE proposed to maintain “regulated tariffs during the service
life of existing facilities (with a transparent annual adjustment mechanism).”°°* The
Claimants also refer to an excerpt from a press release of 25 May 2007 issued by the

Government and announcing the adoption of RD 661/2007:

Tariffs shall be reviewed every 4 years, taking into account compliance with
the established targets. Such a revision shall allow for adjustments to be made
to the tariff in virtue of new costs and the level of compliance with the targets.
Future tariff revisions shall not be applied to existing facilities. This
guarantees legal certainty for the electricity producer and stability for the
sector, thereby favouring development. The new legislation shall not be
applied retroactively. Facilities with a start-up date prior to 1 January 2008

may operate under the previous framework in accordance with the fixed-tariff
option for the duration of the facility’s working life.”

738. In addition to the above, the Claimants submitted three presentations of the CNE dated
29 October 2008, February 2009, and February 2010 in support of their interpretation of
Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007.°'° Two of the three presentations stated that the economic

incentives guaranteed a reasonable return, but “incentives that provide greater returns

[were] justified.”?!!

739. The Claimants further referred to a joint presentation of the Ministry of Industry, Trade

and Tourism and InvestInSpain, dated November 2009, that stated as follows:

[...] subsequent revisions of the tariffs will not affect the installations which
have already been commissioned [this guarantee] provides legal certainty to
the producer, ensuring the stability and development of the sector.”

740. A similar statement was also made in a presentation of InvestInSpain of November

2007.9'3

741. Although RD 1578/2008 did not contain a provision similar to Article 44(3) of
RD 661/2007, the Claimants argue that the CNE interpreted RD 1578/2008, at the time
of its passing, as exempting existing facilities from future revisions.°'* In particular, the
Claimants refer to the following written response provided by the CNE to a query

regarding the Fifth additional provision of RD 1578/2008:

This regulation is consistent with the regulation established in Article 44.3 of
Royal Decree 661/2007, where it provides for a revision of the remuneration
scheme in 2010, which would be applicable to those facilities commissioned
starting on | January 2012.°!5

742. Furthermore, the Claimants state that according to the Memoria Justificativa of
RD 1578/2008, potential reviews would only affect the percentage by which the FiT

could be reduced (or increased) between quarterly calls (2.5%):

During 2012, the percentage of reduction will be reviewed and, if necessary,
modified upwards, if, in view of the technological evolution of the sector, it is
found that the costs of this technology have fallen below the maximum
expected rate of decrease, in which case the installed capacity target for the
following call will be increased by the same percentage as the regulated tariff
will be reduced.”!®

743. By definition this kind of revision, in the Claimants’ view, can only be forward-

looking.?!”

744. The Claimants also attach importance to the registration of all of the PV plants in the
RAIPRE.*'® According to the Claimants, the RAIPRE registration certificates “constitute
a direct link” between the Claimants’ plants and the Government.?!? The Claimants note
that the Antin v. Spain and Masdar Solar v. Spain tribunals agreed that the registration in

the RAIPRE was not a mere formality but a circumstance that had “real value as a matter

of international law.”°”°

745. The Claimants insists that their expectations were reasonable and objective in view of the
following facts: (i) the Special Regime was part of a wider international and domestic
policy to promote renewable energy sources; (ii) RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008

provided for specific guarantees that were “sufficiently attractive to encourage the

necessary investments in RE projects”; the Special Regime was advertised by Spain
through presentations and promotional advertising materials.°*! The FiT scheme
implemented by RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008, according to the Claimants, was

reasonable as it was also consonant with good regulatory practice.°”*

Specifically, the
Claimants referred to the support schemes introduced in Denmark, Germany, and the

United Kingdom.”

Furthermore, the Claimants argue that their expectations were not limited to obtaining a
“reasonable return.”°* Specifically, they assert that “[i]n the event that the Tribunal were
to agree that the Claimants’ legitimate expectations were limited by Spain’s concept of a
‘reasonable return’ (which the Claimants maintain they were not), the Claimants’
legitimate expectations were to receive the reasonable return that was implicit in the
specific FIT scheme under which they invested, not to a ‘dynamic’ and ever-changing
return.”°?> According to the Claimants, even if their expectations were found to be limited
to a reasonable rate of return, the specific return they were entitled to was “at least in the
region of 7.2%-8.2% after tax — not 7.398% before tax, as Spain contends.”°”° As further
discussed below, the Claimants’ quantum expert argues that the CNE considered the rate
of return of 7.9%-8.2% (post-tax) as reasonable under RD 661/2007 and the rate of return
of 7% (post-tax) under RD 1578/2008.°?7

The Claimants assert that contrary to Spain’s arguments, the regulatory framework
contained “no warning” of the Disputed Measures.” In this connection, the Claimants
contend that the Respondent presented no proof of its allegation that RD 661/2007 was
introduced not to attract investment, but to resolve the situation of overcompensation that

was caused by the “loop effect” of the remuneration mechanism established under

RD 436/2004.°”? Moreover, the Claimants submit that Spain itself characterized Royal
Decree 661/2007 as increasing remuneration when it announced the adoption of the
Decree.” Therefore, the Claimants conclude that the adoption of RD 661/2007 could not

have warned them that harmful regulatory changes would be adopted.

748. The Claimants further argue that Spain omitted to mention that RD 1578/2008 (which
lowered the FiT) applied only to new installations in compliance with the
“grandfathering” principle.’*! Thus, the Claimants emphasize that before 2010 Spain did
not implement harmful regulation to existing plants without a proper transition or

compensation.?*

749. The principle of regulatory hierarchy, according to the Claimants, has no impact on their
legitimate expectations because from the international law perspective it is irrelevant
whether a commitment was made in a law or in a decree; both can be changed by the
State.°* It is equally irrelevant whether the Spanish state organs were authorized under
domestic law to make stabilization commitments.?*4 Furthermore, the Claimants note that
in any event neither RD 661/2007°*> nor RD 1578/2008 were inconsistent with
Law 54/1997.°%°

750. The Claimants further submit that the judgments of the Spanish Supreme Court referred
to by the Respondent were irrelevant to the formation of their legitimate expectations as

none of the judgments provides an interpretation of the key provisions of RD 436/2004,

RD 661/2007, or RD 1578/2008.°°7 The Claimants contend that the “macroeconomic
circumstances” as well as the Tariff Deficit were equally irrelevant to the Claimants’
legitimate expectations, as the Respondent made a deliberate choice to develop its RE
sector despite those circumstances.°** Moreover, the Claimants argue that the investor
could not forecast which policies future governments would adopt to solve the

aggravating Deficit.°*”

751. In the Claimants’ view, the 2017 EC State Aid Decision does not affect the Claimants’

legitimate expectations claim (see paragraphs 911-912 below).

752. At the Hearing, the Claimants were asked by the Tribunal to clarify the impact of the
“good regulatory practice” of other EU Member States including Germany, the United

replied that such practice confirms the reasonableness of their expectations.*!

RD 1578/2008 do not contain any self-standing “guarantee or promise to freeze their

regime in favor of the Claimants or their investments” that would exist independently

from the legal framework set out under Law 54/199’ According to the Respondent,

the regulatory framework only guaranteed a “reasonable profitability” of RE facilities

The Respondent further argues that Article 40(3) of RD 436/2004 did not contain any
“stabilization commitment”.*> According to the Respondent, Article 40(3) does not
apply to “any” revisions of the tariffs, premiums, and incentives, but only to those
“provided for in [Article 40(1)]” of the Decree, which is allegedly apparent from the
reference in the discussed provision to “the revisions provided for in this section”.*° As
the Respondent explains, the revisions envisaged in Article 40 have a limited scope of
ensuring the renewable energy promotion plan’s goals.°4’7 Thus, the Respondent
concludes that any other revisions were not prevented by Article 40(3) and were

permissible pursuant to the principle of hierarchy of laws.°4*

The Respondent also relied on the analysis of RD 436/2004 that was published by APPA
(and referenced at paragraphs 186-187 above).”!? The Respondent notably refers to the
fact that APPA was concerned with the “retroactive” application of the Decree to existing

facilities. °%°

The Respondent moreover argues that Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 did not contain any
stabilization commitments either due to essentially the same reasons as those summarized
above regarding RD 436/2004.°*! In addition, the Respondent states that Article 44(3) of
RD 661/2007 in any event does not cover all of the parameters of RD 661/2007 such as,

for example, the CPI.952

The Respondent submits that its interpretation of RD 436/2004 and RD 661/2007 is
consistent with the jurisprudence of the Spanish courts.°>* In particular, the Respondent

refers to the following observation made in the 2005 Supreme Court Judgment:

There is no legal obstacle that exists to prevent the Government, in the
exercise of the regulatory powers and of the broad entitlements it has in a
strongly regulated issue such as electricity, from modifying a specific system
of remuneration, provided that it remains within the framework of
[Law 54/1997].°*

758. The Respondent further refers to the 2006 Supreme Court Judgment where the highest

Spanish court ruled, inter alia, as follows:

[...] the_owners of electric power production facilities under the special
regime have no “unmodifiable right” to the financial regime that regulates the
receipt of premiums remaining unaltered. Indeed, said scheme attempts to
promote the use of renewable energies through an incentivising mechanism
that, like all mechanisms of this kind, has no assurance that it will remain
without being modified in the future.

The remuneration regime that we analyse does not guarantee, [...] owners of
facilities under the special regime the intangibility of a determined level of
profit or income in relation to those obtained in previous financial years, nor
the indefinite permanence of the formulas used to set the premiums.°>
759. The Respondent argues that in the same 2006 Supreme Court Judgment, it was confirmed
that regulatory changes are permissible as long as the principle of reasonable profitability
enshrined in Law 54/1997 is respected.?°
760. The Respondent contends that subsequent case-law of the Supreme Court confirmed and
developed the principles stated above. Therefore, the only two limitations on the State’s
regulatory power recognized by the Supreme Court were: (i) “that the change does not
affect earnings already received” and (ii) “that the principle of reasonable returns is not

infringed.”°>”

761. As regards RD 1578/2008, the Respondent refers to the text of the Fifth additional

provision which provides as follows:

Fifth additional provision. Modification of the

if ion for

During the year 2012, based on the technological evolution of the sector and
the market, and the functioning of the compensatory regime, compensation
for the generation of electric power by photovoltaic solar technology may be
modified.*°*

The Respondent contends that this provision has to be interpreted and applied without
recourse to any additional means of interpretation.*»? In other words, the Fifth additional
provision does not provide any stabilization guarantees. On the contrary, it clearly

envisages the possibility of changing the FiTs granted under RD 1578/2008.

With respect to the legal effect of registration with the RAIPRE, the Respondent submits,
relying on Charanne v. Spain, that the registration in the RAIPRE was a mere
administrative requirement which “by no means implied that registered facilities had a

vested right to a certain remuneration.”°

In support of its interpretation, the Respondent refers to Charanne v. Spain where the
tribunal recognized the absence of a specific commitment regarding the “freezing” of the
regulatory framework and Isolux v. Spain where the tribunal stated that the claimant’s
“only legitimate expectation was that of a reasonable return on their investment.”°*! The
Respondent also relies on Blusun v. Italy where the tribunal stated that “[i]n the absence
of a specific stability commitment, the State has no obligation to grant subsidies such as

feed-in-tariffs, or to maintain them unchanged once granted.”°*

The Respondent argues that the Claimants’ expectations are unreasonable, unjustified,

and not objective. The Respondent denies that there has been an “aggressive campaign to

Claimants can be considered as ensuring “the immutability of the [remuneration]
regime.”°°? Moreover, the Respondent argues that the Claimants cannot rely on these
presentations as they did not see them at the time before or at the time of making their

investments in Spain.?*

766. The Respondent submits that the Claimants should have been aware of the basic
principles of the Spanish electricity system, including, inter alia, the principle that the
remuneration regime established for RE producers guarantees a reasonable return “on the
investment cost of standard-facilities and in accordance with the cost of money in capital
markets.”®® According to the Respondent, this is a “dynamic” concept, in the sense that
“[d]epending on the change of financial circumstances and circumstances of other types,
a percentage of profitability could be ‘reasonable’ at that first moment and could require
subsequent adjustment to precisely maintain that ‘reasonableness’ due to the modification
of other financial or technical factors.”°° Thus, the Claimants, in the Respondent’s view,
could not reasonably expect that Spain would not attempt to correct the situation of over-

remuneration once it had arisen in the RE sector.°”

767. The Respondent also alleges that the Claimants’ expectations could not exist in isolation

from the principle of economic sustainability of the Spanish electricity system.°°*

should have been aware of the relevant decisions of the Supreme Court and which are

jurisprudence, according to the Respondent, proves that the Disputed Measures were
foreseeable and consistent with the essential elements of the RE remuneration scheme at

the time of the Claimants’ investment.°”°

769. The Respondent states that its understanding of the regulatory framework under which
the Claimants invested was also supported by various business associations (e.g., ASIF),

investors, analysts and law practitioners.°”!

770. The Respondent further argues that the Claimants should have been aware and should
have taken into account the highly subsidized nature of the market as 86% of the total

income of the Claimants’ plants was supposed to be coming from subsidies.°”*

771.

In addition to the above, the Respondent relies on the 2017 EC State Aid Decision that
assess the New Regime and where the Commission states that there is “no right to State
Aid”.°” According to the Respondent, this 2017 EC State Aid Decision confirms that the
State always maintains the power to change or to adjust subsidies.°”* Thus, no investor
can have an expectation that a specific amount of State aid, i.e., the remuneration under
the Special Regime, would remain unchanged.’”> The Respondent contends that the 2017
EC State Aid Decision takes into account payments under RD 661/2007 and
RD 1578/2008. Therefore, it is equally relevant for the assessment of the Claimants’

expectations under said Royal Decrees.”

iii. Due diligence/ assumption of risk of regulatory changes
(a) The Claimants

772. The Claimants argue that they were acting diligently throughout the investment process,
as Mr. Bouman was assisted by experienced advisors, Mr. Koot and Mr. Wicke
(see paragraphs 110-133 above).°’’ Additionally, the Claimants note that before making

his investments Mr. Bouman travelled to Spain “in order to gain first-handed

understanding of the regulatory framework from key stakeholders” including IDAE.°’

IDAE, for instance, stated that “PV installations would receive a guaranteed FiT for their
entire operational lifetime, with no limits on production.”*”? Finally, the Claimants submit

that the provisions of RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 were sufficiently clear and did not

0

require any particularly sophisticated analysis,*° as Mr. Bouman stated during the

Hearing: “[t]here was a guaranteed FiT [...] the framework was pretty clear and there was

no reason to doubt about that.”**!

773. Apart from the regulatory framework and its contemporaneous understanding by the

982

Respondent organs and entities,”*~ the reasonableness of Mr. Bouman’s expectations, in

the Claimants’ view, was also confirmed by the EPC contractors’ lawyers and Triodos
Bank’s lawyers.**? The Claimants emphasize that none of the involved legal advisors
raised a “red flag”.°** The Claimants submit that the clause in the loan agreement for
Fuentes de Ajfio plant that provided for the possibility of alteration of the conditions of

the loan in case of regulatory changes was prepared after the initial Disputed Measures

had been enacted (RD 1565/2010 and RDL 14/2010).°*° Thus, in the Claimants’ view, no
radical change to the Special Regime was foreseeable at the time when the investments

were made.°8°

The Respondent

774. The Respondent emphasises that Mr. Bouman had no prior experience in PV investments

and made his decision to invest right after meeting the Goossens during the business tour
in November 2005 (see paragraphs 122-124 above).°*’ In the Respondent’s view, this

conduct manifests “a notoriously irresponsible” approach.”

775. The Respondent further submits that the Claimants failed to properly analyze the

applicable legal framework “and the macroeconomic circumstances” before making their
investments in Spain.°*? In this connection, the Respondent refers to Charanne v. Spain
where the tribunal ruled that “in order to rely on legitimate expectations, the Claimants
should have conducted a diligent analysis of the legal framework applicable to their
investment.” The Respondent submits that since the PV sector is highly regulated, any
diligent investor should have enquired specifically about the prospects of regulatory

changes.”*! According to the Respondent, the Claimants have not done so.

776. In particular, the Respondent argues that the Solar Plaza Report, dated January 2005, is

985

not a legal report and in any case it does not address RD 661/2007 on which the Claimants
allegedly relied.°°? The Respondent further submits that Mr. Wicke’s legal advice was
sought principally prior to the enactment of RD 661/2007.”? But even those reports that

were received after RD 661/2007 address exclusively administrative issues and do not

contractors, the Respondent argues that those reports focus exclusively on the “status” of

the projects and in any event they were never seen by Mr. Bouman.°”>

777. Inrespect of Triodos Bank’s due diligence, the Respondent submits that it was performed
in 2012 (i.e. almost two years after the last of the Claimants’ PV plants, Fuentes de Afio,
had been commissioned) and in any event a bank and a “non-financial investor”, like
Mr. Bouman, assess different risks.°°° Alternatively, the Respondent states that in one of
the loan agreements Triodos Bank expressly acknowledged the possibility of regulatory
changes by including a provision according to which the conditions of financing could be

altered in case of any changes to the FiT scheme.°””

iv. Breach of the alleged expectations
(a) The Claimants

778. The Claimants contend that the Disputed Measures frustrated all their legitimate
expectations by radically changing the applicable regulatory framework (see paragraphs

459-510 above).?* According to the Claimants, the tribunal in Micula v. Romania found

in similar circumstances that Romania’s premature revocation of economic support

schemes created by legislation was in breach of the FET standard.°”

779. Specifically, the Claimants submit that Spain started with introducing significant cuts to
the economic incentives under the Special Regime and ultimately “dismantled” the
Special Regime via RDL 9/2013 in July 2013.!°° The Claimants contend that “the New
Regime was fundamentally different in that, inter alia, production [was] no longer
incentivized.”!°°' As a result, the Claimants had to “change the manner in which they

manage their plants.”!0°?

780. Moreover, according to the Claimants, the instability persisted after July 2013 for 11
months as the Respondent defined the specific parameters of the New Regime only in
June 2014.!° The Claimants note that the situation is still aggravating as “it is now
expected that the rate of return under the New Regime will be further reduced in

2019,71004

Furthermore, the Claimants argue that the New Regime amounted to a retroactive change
to the FiT scheme that was applicable to existing facilities.'!°° The Claimants submit that
it is irrelevant whether this kind of retroactivity was characterized as “medium”, as

suggested by Spain, and thus permissible under Spanish law because under international

law such concepts do not exist.!0°

782. The Claimants also contend that each of the “initial measures” adopted in 2010-2013,
before the implementation of the New Regime equally harmed the Claimants’
investments.!°”” In particular, RD 1565/2010 reduced the number of years during which
the PV plants could receive the FiT under RD 661/2007 to 25 years although initially the
support scheme was applicable “for the entire useful life” of the PV plant.'° The
Claimants furthermore note that the Respondent subsequently extended this period twice,
firstly to 28 years and then to 30 years which demonstrates that “Spain has been
inconsistent in its [...] understanding of PV installations’ operational life.”!° Therefore,
it is irrelevant whether the Claimants’ installations could operate for more than 30

years,!010

783. In respect of RDL 14/2010, the Claimants argue that contrary to Spain’s contentions, no
investor should have expected that a cap on operating hours covered by the FiT would be
imposed as the Special Regime offered the FiT for every kilowatt hour of electricity
produced in line with the Respondent’s goal to maximize production.!°!! Law 15/2012,
in the Claimants’ view, introduced a tariff cut in the form of the TVPEE.!°!? Finally,
regarding RDL 2/2013, the Claimants submit that even if the new FiT adjustment
mechanism could have become beneficial for them, “it was no longer applicable to [the

Claimants] as it had been overridden by the New Regime.”!°!3

784. The Claimants further argue that the Respondent itself recognized the unprecedented
character of the New Regime and the remuneration regime envisaged therein.'°!* For

example, CNE Report 18/2013 stated as follows:

similar to that reflected in the proposal in any jurisdiction of the European

Regime.”

787. The Claimants also posit that Spain in any event failed to provide the reasonable return
that was guaranteed under the Special Regime.'! In addition, the Claimants note that the
“newly-defined”!°” 7.398% rate of return referred to by the Respondent is set on a pre-
tax basis. If one estimates the post-tax rate using the nominal tax rate of 30%, the result
would be 5.2%.'°?> Furthermore, according to the Claimants’ quantum expert Compass
Lexecon, the actual internal rate of return with the Disputed Measures in place and the
Claimants’ actual costs constitutes 4.75% (with 31 May 2018 expectations), which is in
any case below the reasonable rate of return suggested by Spain.'°*4 Furthermore, the
Claimants submit that the concept of “reasonable return” is subject to change under the
New Regime and the Spanish authorities have already declared their intention to set it at

as low a rate as 4.2%,'0°5

788. Finally, the Claimants submit that the New Regime is retroactive, because of the so-called
“claw back” effect.!°?° As explained by Claimants’ regulatory expert, Mr. Solé, “[tJhe
new scheme applies from the start of the regulatory life of the facilities, rather than since
the entry into force of RD-L 9/2013...[it] is calculated so as to theoretically ensure the

obtained by a facility prior to July 2013 (according to the government’s methodology for
its calculation) exceeds the new ex post target return, this facility will no longer be entitled
to regulated revenue, irrespective of whether or not it has reached the end of its regulatory

life.”!°?” According to Mr. Solé, “the value of the overall regulated remuneration to which

was concerned with this aspect of calculating the Special Payment under the New

Regime'©” and that this type of claw-back of past remuneration was “unprecedented” in

Europe.!°*° The Claimants also note that the Eiser v. Spain, Antin v. Spain, and Greentech

v. Spain tribunals were very critical of this effect of the New Regime, whereas in RREEF

v. Spain the tribunal found that this element alone amounted to a breach of the ECT.'!

(b) The Respondent

789. The Respondent argues that there was no breach of the Claimants’ legitimate
expectations, because the applicable legal framework did not contain any guarantees of
immutability of the FiT-based support schemes provided under RD 661/2007 and
RD 1578/2008. 0

790. The Respondent further submits that the Disputed Measures were adopted in order to

maintain the sustainability of the electricity system and did not change the “essential

characteristics of the regulatory framework in which the Claimants investe as the

Claimants continued perceiving significant subsidies. The Respondent has provided the

As regards the periodically-defined reasonable return targeted by the New Regime, the
Respondent argues that the pre-tax reasonable rate of return of 7.398% guaranteed under
the New Regime “would be about 7% post-tax.”!°*5 According to the Respondent, this is
due to numerous tax deductions enjoyed by RE projects in Spain that allow RE investors
to apply an effective discounted tax rate of about 5.8% instead of the marginal corporate
tax rate of 25%.'°*° Thus, the New Regime, in the Respondent’s view, maintains the same
post-tax reasonable rate of return of around 7% that has been guaranteed to the RE

investors since 2000 (see paragraphs 960-972 below).

Finally, as regards the alleged retroactivity of the Disputed Measures, Spain argues that
under international law a regulation is retroactive if it damages or eliminates acquired
rights.'°7 The New Regime is not retroactive, according to the Respondent, as its
provisions “apply to future facts in relation to legal situations in progress” without
affecting rights already acquired (the so-called “medium retroactivity”).'** In particular,

RDL 24/2013 contains an express guarantee against retroactivity in its Third final

35 Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 73.

1036 The application of the effective tax rate of 5.8% gives a post-tax reasonable rate of return under the New
Regime of 6.969% (that is, 7.398% x (1-5.8%) = 6.969%. See Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 69-73.

c. The Tribunal’s analysis

793. The Parties agree that an investor cannot have legitimate expectations that the regulatory
framework will remain unchanged (“frozen”) in the absence of a specific commitment.!"4!
As noted above, the Parties also appear to agree that an expectation to benefit from stable
conditions would only be breached if the disputed regulatory changes were “drastic” and
“unexpected”.'°#? Moreover, the Parties do not dispute that the Claimants’ alleged
legitimate expectations should be assessed at the time when the relevant investments were
made.'°3 However, on the facts, whilst not requiring a “freezing” of the Spanish
regulatory regime,'°4 the Claimants argue that RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008
contained a commitment “to keep the fixed tariff’ set out therein! (see also, e.g.,
paragraph 816 below). The Parties also disagree as to the timing of when an investment

is “made”. The Claimants argue that an investment is made when an investor “irreversibly

committed” to invest.!4° According to the Claimants, the relevant dates here were the
dates the PV plants’ EPC contracts were signed.'°*” Following the Hearing and relying
on Mr. Bouman’s evidence, the Respondent argued in its Post-Hearing Briefs that the
date of the Claimants’ investment was the end of 2005 when Mr. Bouman took the
decision to invest in Spain.'48 The Claimants disagreed with this position, arguing in
response that “it was not until August 2006 that he made the first significant capital

commitment by entering into the EPC contract for the Mahora PV Farm. It is at this point

that the decision to invest became irreversible.”!°”

794. In order to ground the legitimate character of an investor’s expectations, the case law
prevailingly requires some specific kind of representation by the host State vis-a-vis the
investor.!°™ In the case at hand it is undisputed that before making their investments the
Claimants had not received any representations from the Spanish authorities addressed to

them personally. As Mr. Bouman stated at the Hearing, “Spain didn’t [make] an offer;

they set a set of regulations where investors could join. And that’s what I did.”!°>!

795. Therefore, one of the questions that needs to be resolved by the Tribunal from the outset
is whether the investor must show an individualized representation made by the State in

order to succeed in its claim for breach of the FET standard,!°>? or whether it is possible

addressed to a plurality of potential investors. !°?

796. The Tribunal accepts that in principle “an expectation may arise from what are construed
as specific guarantees in legislation” depending on the circumstances of a particular
case.'°*4 Consequently, the absence of a representation addressed specifically to the
Claimants will not be sufficient for the Tribunal to dismiss the legitimate expectations

claim.

797. At the same time, as held by the Philip Morris v. Uruguay tribunal, provisions of general
legislation applicable to a plurality of persons as such “do not create legitimate
expectations that there will be no change in the law.”!°° The Antaris v. Czech Republic

tribunal similarly held:

Provisions of general legislation applicable to a plurality of persons or a
category of persons, do not create legitimate expectations that there will be no
change in the law; and given the State's regulatory powers, in order to rely on
legitimate expectations the investor should inquire in advance regarding the
prospects of a change in the regulatory framework in light of the then
prevailing or reasonably to be expected changes in the economic and social
conditions of the host State.'°°°

The Tribunal agrees that in the absence of a specific commitment addressed personally to
the investor, it must “conduct an objective examination of the legislation and the facts
surrounding the making of the investment to assess whether a prudent and experienced
investor could have reasonably formed a legitimate and justifiable expectation of the

immutability of such legislation.”!°°7

. In accordance with the above principles, the Tribunal will analyze the content of the

relevant regulatory framework in place at the time when the Claimants’ investments were
made. It is against this background that the Tribunal will assess whether the Claimants’
expectations can be considered as legitimate and reasonable. The Tribunal will further
analyze whether and to what extent the disputed regulatory changes adopted in the context
of the New Regime were “drastic” and “unexpected” so as to violate an investor’s general
expectation of stability. As part of the relevant analysis, the Tribunal will need to inquire
whether and to what extent the regulatory framework at the time of the Claimants’

investments contained signs of future unfavorable changes or regulatory risk.

In order to perform this analysis, the Tribunal must establish the following: (i) the dates
of the Claimants’ investment process and (ii) the content and meaning of the provisions
of domestic laws and regulations relied upon by the Claimants during their investment
process. During this latter step, the Tribunal will be mindful of the principle that
“municipal laws are merely facts which express the will and constitute the activities of

States, in the same manner as do legal decisions or administrative measures.”!08

Such factual background is of particular relevance in the presence of a legitimate
expectations claim. Indeed, in order to be legitimate, expectations must be “objective”,
i.e. based on the investors’ prudent evaluation of the factual and legal background, which

also encompasses the hierarchy of legal sources in the Spanish legal system. !°°?

802. The Parties also extensively debated the requirement of due diligence, which the Tribunal

addresses separately at paragraphs 881-896 below.

803. Every tribunal that previously ruled on a case arising from the Respondent’s abolition of
the FiT-based incentive regime for RE installations has provided its understanding of the
Spanish regulatory framework. Some tribunals concluded that on the evidence before
them, the Spanish regulatory framework gave rise to the expectation that the FiT scheme
will remain unchanged during the projected lifetime of the facilities.'°°° Other tribunals
found that the investors could only expect to be protected from radical changes to the
Special Regime (and concluded that the abolition of the Special Regime altogether
amounted to such a radical change).'°' There is also a third line of reasoning suggesting
that the only expectation that the claimants could have was that of a “reasonable
return”, !062 Finally, the Tribunal is aware of only one case, Stadtwerke Miinchen v. Spain,

where it was held that the Spanish regulatory framework did not give rise to any

expectations of stability regarding the FiT scheme. !°

804. The Tribunal recalls that, even though the above decisions may bear some relevance for
the instant case, it is its duty to “make its own determination of the facts and then apply
the relevant rules of international law to the facts which it has found to have existed.”!0

other than those of other tribunals, based on the specificities of the facts before it.

805. As explained above, the Tribunal needs to establish the dates when the Claimants’

investments were made in order to identify the laws and regulations relevant to the

formation of the Claimants’ alleged expectations.

806. The Parties disagree on what constitutes the relevant period of the Claimants’ investment

process.

which would limit the relevant dates to the period from 10 August 2006 to 25 November

809. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that the RAIPRE registrations must be considered

as post-dating the actual making of the investments in the present case because the
Claimants’ funds had already been remitted by then. However, the Tribunal is not
convinced that the events preceding the signing of the first EPC contract (see paragraphs
101-122 above) should be ignored when determining the timing of the Claimants’

investments.

810. First, it must be recalled that according to the Claimants themselves, all of the claimant

entities “could be considered an alter ego of Mr. Bouman” and that “each of the 59
claimant entities share the expectations of Mr. Bouman.”!°%7 Therefore, it is the

expectations of Mr. Bouman that the Tribunal must analyze.

811. Second, the Claimants rely on events prior to the conclusion of the first EPC contract,

including the November 2005 business tour to Spain, during which Mr. Bouman attended
a presentation at the offices of IDAE.!° Mr. Bouman also seems to have attached
particular importance to the terms of RD 436/2004 when making his investment decision,
as it follows from his First Witness Statement.!°° The Tribunal finds that Mr. Bouman’s
First Witness Statement deserves special consideration, in line with the prevailing
international case law, which gives superior credibility to statements “contrary to the

interests or contentions of the [Party] to which the witness owes allegiance.”!°”

812. In particular, Mr. Bouman claims to have found favorable the then existing FiT-based

support scheme and “with this in mind ... decided to gauge the financial market of PV
investment in Spain.”!°”! Mr. Bouman further recounts that during the November 2005
business tour, at the offices of IDAE “the characteristics of the FIT regime in place at the
time, RD 436/2004” were discussed.!°7? During the same business tour, Mr. Bouman also

met the Goossens who presented him with a proposal to invest in a PV plant in the

province of Albacete.'°”? Soon after that, sometime between the end of 2005 and early
2006, following the above-mentioned business tour, Mr. Bouman “in reliance on the

predictability of the future revenues of the project”!°”

purchased from the Goossens
Natec, the company that was subsequently renamed Ra Solar and was later used to buy

and develop the Claimants’ PV Plants.

Additional steps towards making the Claimants’ investments prior to the adoption of
RD 661/2007 also included the incorporation of Cross Retail on 16 January 2006, initial
negotiations with banks regarding financing and the setting-up of the first 39 of the
Spanish Project Companies.'°” Therefore, it clearly follows from the Claimants’ own
witness testimony and documentary evidence that the Claimants’ investment process was

started under RD 436/2004.

In any event, even on the Claimants’ own case theory, the very first investment was made
at the time when RD 436/2004 was still in force.!°" The first EPC contract (for the
Mahora Plant) was signed in August 2006, i.e., almost one year before the entry into force

of RD 661/2007.'°7

For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants’ investment process had started
under the legal regime of RD 436/2004 and subsequently continued under RDL 7/2006,
which led to the adoption of RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008. It follows that the Tribunal
must analyze each of these Royal Decrees as well as other relevant elements from the
legal framework for the purpose of assessing the content of the Claimants’ legitimate

expectations.

Content of expectations

According to the Claimants, the stability of the FiT-based support scheme was critical for
their decision-making.'°”* As Mr. Bouman noted in his First Witness Statement regarding
RD 661/2007, “[t]he regulations set out a fixed, specific tariff in Euro cents per kWh [...]
Tunderstood it to be a stable and predictable regime — which was crucial to my investment
decision.”!°7? The Claimants further submit that Article 40(3) of RD 436/2004 and
Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 “set out, in unqualified terms, Spain’s undertaking not to
modify the FiT regime for plants that had already been commissioned as of the date of

any future reforms.”!°8°

The Tribunal will thus begin its analysis of the regulatory framework by considering
relevant Royal Decrees under which the investors were entitled to a particular FiT. As it
has been stated earlier, the Tribunal considers that the Claimants’ investment process (and
the formation of their legitimate expectations) began under RD 436/2004 and continued
under RD 661/2007 and then RD 1578/2008 (see paragraph 815 above). Therefore, the
Tribunal will consider the provisions of each of these Royal Decrees to verify whether a
stabilization commitment (i.e., an undertaking not to modify the FiT regime, see

paragraph 821 below) could be derived from their texts, as suggested by the Claimants.

Under RD 436/2004, the FiT was calculated by reference to the TMR.!°*! The FiT was
set at a particular rate for the first 25 years from the installation’s commissioning and at
a reduced rate thereafter. !°%

Article 40(1) of RD 436/2004 envisaged that tariffs and other incentives would be revised

every four years starting from 2006:

During 2006, in light of the result of the follow-up reports on the level of
compliance with the Renewable Energies Development Plan, the tariffs,
premiums, incentives and supplements defined in this Royal Decree will be
revised, thereby considering the costs associated with each of these

demand and its impact on the technical and economic management of the
system. A further revision will be conducted every four years as from 2006
[J 108
In respect of the temporal application of such revisions, Article 40(3) of RD 436/2004

stated as follows:

The tariffs, premiums, incentives and supplements resulting from any of the
revisions provided for in this section shall apply solely to the plants that
commence operating subsequent to the date of the entry into force referred to
in the paragraph above and shall not have a backdated effect on any previous
tariffs and premiums. !0*4

According to the Claimants, Article 40(3) of RD 436/2004 must be read as an undertaking
not to modify the FiT regime for the plants that had been commissioned under that Royal
Decree.'°*> According to the Respondent, Article 40(3) of RD 436/2004 is not a

“stabilization commitment”!°*

, as it does not apply to “any” revisions of the tariffs,
premiums, and incentives, but only to those “provided for in [Article 40(1)]” of the
Decree, which according to the Respondent is apparent from the reference in the
discussed provision to “the revisions provided for in this section”.!°*’ As explained by the
Respondent, the revisions envisaged in Article 40 have a limited scope of ensuring the
renewable energy promotion plan’s goals.!°** Thus, any other revisions are not prevented

by Article 40(3) and are permissible pursuant to the principle of hierarchy of laws.!°°

The Tribunal by majority is minded to agree with the Respondent’s interpretation of

Article 40(3) of RD 436/2004 for the following reasons.

In order to establish the actual meaning of Article 40(3) of RD 436/2004, it must be

analyzed in the context of the regulatory framework considered as a whole.!°° The

Spanish regulatory framework for RE producers consists of legislative acts, notably
Law 54/1997, and regulatory acts such as Royal Decrees (including RD 436/2004) that
are hierarchically subordinate to legislative acts. In addition, there are Royal Decree-Laws
— regulatory acts with immediate effect adopted for emergency purposes.'°?! Royal
Decree-Laws require subsequent parliamentary approval.!°°? The Spanish legal system
also includes inferior regulatory acts such as ministerial orders and resolutions.!°”? Thus,
Royal Decrees, including RD 436/2004 are adopted within the framework of

Law 54/1997, the only legal act with the status of a law on the matter.!

824. Law 54/1997 established two legal regimes governing energy producers: the Ordinary

Regime that applies to conventional energy producers and the Special Regime that applies

to RE producers registered with the RAIPRE (see paragraphs 151-159 above).

825. Under the Special Regime, qualifying facilities are entitled to a premium on top of the

remuneration earned at market prices. Such a premium is set in a governmental regulation
(i.e., a Royal Decree):
4. The remuneration arrangements for electric power generation installations

operating under the special regime shall be supplemented by the payment of a
premium under statutory terms set out in regulations [...].!°

826. Here the Tribunal must emphasize that regulatory regimes for energy differ from those

1091

1093

1094

1095

for most economic activities (finance, manufacturing, IT) because of the pervasive role
the State has, and which is commensurate with the strategic interests and policy
considerations involved in that sector. At the same time, investments in the energy sector
are usually highly capital-intense, which usually leads investors to favour legal
environments that place certain elements of constraint on State action. This applies across
the various energy industries: oil, gas, nuclear, renewables. The PV sector is particular,

in that the production costs of PV plants usually exceed those of traditional energy

producers. Without a premium, investments in the PV sector could hardly be made

profitably. Hence, Law 54/1997 needed to assure a premium.
Law 54/1997 further defines the criteria for fixing said premium in the following terms:

To work out the premiums, the voltage level on delivery of the power to the
network, the effective contribution to environmental improvement, to primary
energy saving and energy efficiency, the generation of economically
justifiable useful heat and the investment costs incurred shall all be taken into
account so as to achieve reasonable profitability rates with reference to the
cost of money on capital markets.

As it follows from the Tribunal’s analysis of Law 54/1997, the only remuneration
criterion that was fixed on the legislative level was that of reasonable profitability
profitability rates with reference to the cost of money on capital markets. The factual

record corroborates this analysis. !°°”

RD 436/2004 was one of the Royal Decrees adopted in implementation of Law 54/1997
(following RD 2818/1998). In its preamble, RD 436/2004 affirmed the pursuit of “the
dual goal of protecting the environment and guaranteeing quality electricity supply for all

consumers which is the premise underlying [Law 54/1997].”!08

The preamble of RD 436/2004 further clarified that the operators of qualified installations
could opt for either a wholesale-market price with a premium or a regulated tariff “taking
into account the criteria mentioned in article 30.4 of [Law 54/1997].”!0 It further

observed that:

Whichever remuneration mechanism is chosen, the Royal Decree guarantees
operators of special regime installations fair remuneration for their
investments and an equally fair allocation to electricity consumers of the costs
that can be attributed to the electricity system although incentives are offered
for market participation[.]'!°

831. The preamble of RD 436/2004 also noted that “the security and stability offered by this
new methodology to calculate the special regime remuneration should help it to foster

investment in this kind of plants.”!!°!

832. One of the declared purposes of RD 436/2004 according to its Article 1 was to:

[e]stablish a lasting economic regime for the plants eligible to be under the
special regime, based on an objective, transparent methodology to calculate
the remuneration that is compatible with the methodology to approve or
amend the average electricity or reference tariff regulated by Royal Decree
1432/2002 [...]!

833. The normative relationship between Law 54/1997 and RD 436/2004 was analyzed in the
2005 Supreme Court Judgment concerning a case, which involved a factual pattern (and
claims)!'! different from the present dispute,!!* but which ultimately pertained to the
characterization of rights granted by Royal Decrees. Having applied the principle of
regulatory hierarchy, the Supreme Court concluded that electricity “[p]roducers [did] not
have an un modifiable right that the economic scheme which regulates modifications to
premiums [would] stay the same”, that “[s]aid regime [was] not guaranteed to remain
unaltered in the future” and that “[t]here is no legal obstacle that exists to prevent the
Government, in the exercise of the regulatory powers and of the broad entitlements it has
in a strongly regulated issue such as electricity, from modifying a specific system of

remuneration [...]”.!!°

834. RD 436/2004 was further analyzed in the 2006 Supreme Court Judgment.!!° The case
was brought by six market operators against the Spanish Government and, amongst

others, several electricity distribution companies, regarding an amendment to

RD 436/2004, which was introduced by subsequent RD 2351/2004 (which is not

1103 Claimants in that case, inter alia, contended that RD 436/2004 did not set forth any mechanism to update the
“fixed tariff” pricing option (ie., one of the two pricing options provided for under previously available
RD 2818/1998). The claimants also argued that RD 436/2004 provided for stricter technical requirements than
RD 2818/1998, which applied not merely to new, but also to existing PV installations.

challenged in these proceedings). The claimant parties in that case argued that
RD 2351/2004 had altered the legal regime for calculating the premiums under the
Special Regime by modifying the methodology for revising premiums in the future and
by raising the minimum capacity requirement set forth in RD 436/2004 from 10 MW
to 15 MW in violation of their legitimate expectations.'!°’ The Supreme Court rejected

the appeal, holding similarly to its 2005 Judgment that:

E]lectricity producers under the special regime do [not] have an ‘unalterable
right’ to remain in an unchanged economic regime governing the collection of
premiums. The scheme is, in fact, to encourage the use of renewable energy
through an incentive mechanism, like all of this genre, and cannot be
guaranteed to remain unchanged in the future.

It is true that in this case the setting of premiums is subject to certain normative
standards, as stated above, but is also so that the Council of Ministers may,
respecting them, introduce quantitative variations in the formulas by which
the premiums are from time to time adjusted, or in the calculation of them. If
the change has not deviated from these legal guidelines and, again, there is no
allegation of infri of Article 30 of [Law 54/1997], it can hardly be
considered unlawful.

[...] Until it is replaced by another, the above outlined legal regulation (Article
30 of [Law 54/1997]) allows the respective companies to expect that the fixing
of the premiums can be included as a factor relevant to their obtaining
‘reasonable rates of return with reference the cost of money in the capital
market’ . However the payment regime under examination does not
guarantee t to special regime electricity producers that a certain level of profits
or revenues will be unchanged relative to those obtained in previous years, or
that the formulas for fixing the premiums will stay unchanged.'!*

is being debated with the Courts, as the party states in its brief”). See also Counter-Memorial, para. 353; Reply,

836. Although the above judgments of the Spanish Supreme Court did not specifically address
Article 40(3) of RD 436/2004, the Tribunal nevertheless finds them relevant for the
purposes of proper legal characterization of the state of Spanish law and the expectations
the investors could form thereunder.!!!° In the Tribunal’s view, the Spanish Supreme
Court confirmed that RD 436/2004 did not establish an intangible legal framework.
Contrary to the Claimants’ argument, RD 436/2004 could not be considered as having
contained an undertaking not to modify the FiT scheme. That being noted, the Spanish
Supreme Court systematically referred to the principle of reasonable profitability as being

enshrined in Article 30(4) of Law 54/1997.

837. It is in fact accepted by the Respondent (in line with the jurisprudence of the Spanish
Supreme Court) that “(1) the regulatory changes must enable plants to achieve a
reasonable return and (2) that return will only be reasonable if it is consistent with the

cost of money in the capital market.”!!!!

838. Moreover, some of the Spanish Supreme Court’s judgments referred to above were issued
either before or during the very first stages of the Claimants’ investment process. They
were indicative of the fact that premiums granted under Royal Decrees were not
unalterable and that Article 30 of Law 54/1997 provided the framework of what RE
investors were entitled to. These judgments therefore should have been considered as “red
flags” by a diligent investor. Consequently, the Tribunal by majority finds that the legal
regime under RD 436/2004 could not have given rise to the type of expectations the

Claimants are invoking in this case.

839. The next Royal Decree that was extensively relied upon by the Claimants in their
pleadings in order to demonstrate an alleged undertaking not to modify the FiT is

adopted, and notably the provisions of RDL 7/2006, are described in detail at paragraphs
212-249 above.

840. The reasons for adopting RD 661/2007 in place of RD 436/2004 were also set out in the
preamble of RD 661/2007:

Spanish society today, in the context of reducing dependence on foreign
energy, better use of available energy sources, and a greater awareness of the
environment, is increasingly demanding the employment of renewable
sources of energy and efficiency in the generation of electricity as basic
principles in the achievement of ble devel: from an

social, end environmental point of view. [...]

In view of the behaviour of the prices in the market, where certain variables
which were not considered in the cited compensation system for the special
regime have, over recent times, acquired greater importance, the economic
circumstances established by Royal Decree 436/2004, of 12 March, make it
necessary to modify the compensation system and de-link it from the [TMR],
which has been used to date.

LJ

The economic framework established in the present Royal Decree develops
the principles provided in Law 54/1997 [...] guaranteeing the owners of
facilities under the special regime a reasonable return on their investments

[el

To this effect, a system which is analogous to that provided in Royal Decree
436/2004 [...] is maintained, in which the owner of the facility may opt to sell
their energy at a regulated tariff, which will be the same for all scheduling
periods or alternatively to sell this energy directly on the daily market, the
term market, or through a bilateral contract, in this case receiving the price
negotiated in the market plus a premium.!!'*

841. Thus, according to the preamble of RD 661/2007, one of the aims of this regulation was
to adopt corrective mechanisms relating to the regime previously in place under

RD 436/2004 and the transitory regime created by RDL 9/2006.

842. Under RD 661/2007, photovoltaic installations were classified as “Group b.1” (“Facilities
which use solar energy as their primary energy”) and, within that group, as “Sub-
group b.1.1” (“Facilities which use solar radiation alone as their primary energy by means

of photovoltaic technology”).!!'*

843. Contrary to RD 436/2004, which defined the FiT with reference to the TMR,
RD 661/2007 defined the FiT as a specific income figure over a period of 25 years

(subject to an adjustment based on the CPI). After the first 25 years of operation of a PV

facility, the FiT would decrease.!!!5

844. RD 661/2007 similarly to RD 436/2004 contained a provision concerning future FiT

revisions — Article 44(3):

3. During the year 2010, on sight of the results of the monitoring reports on
the degree of fulfilment of [the 2005-2010 Renewable Energy Promotion
Plan], and of the Energy Efficiency and Savings Strategy in Spain (E4),
together with such new targets as may be included in the subsequent
Renewable Energies Plan 2011-2020, there shall be a review of the tariffs,
premiums, supplements and lower and upper limits defined in this Royal
Decree with regard to the costs associated with each of these technologies, the
degree of participation of the special regime in covering the demand and its
impact upon the technical and economic management of the system, and a
reasonable rate of profitability shall always be guaranteed with reference to
the cost of money in the capital markets. Subsequently a further review shall
be performed every four years, maintaining the same criteria as previously.

The revisions to the regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits indicated
in this paragraph shall not affect facilities for which the deed of
commissioning shall have been granted prior to | January of the second year

846. In the Tribunal’s view, by majority, RD 661/2007 cannot be read as altering the
conclusions reached earlier regarding RD 436/2004, namely that these Royal Decrees did
not guarantee that the subsidy scheme would remain unmodified: the hierarchical position
of these Royal Decrees as well as the relevant provisions of Law 54/1997 remained

unchanged.!!!9

847. Moreover, as it was rightly pointed out by the Respondent, RD 661/2007 by itself
represented a “retroactive” (in the Claimants’ terminology) change, because its provisions
were immediately applicable to PV _ installations already commissioned under
RD 436/2004.!!° The record also indicates that RD 661/2007 was adopted following the
transitory regime enacted under RDL 7/2006, which had sought to address the TMR
mechanism envisaged in RD 436/2004 because of a “feedback loop” that was causing an
artificial increase of the subsidies paid to RE producers.'!*! In the Tribunal’s view, by
majority, these facts were also indicative of potential adverse regulatory changes in the

future.

848. Finally, the last two of the Claimants’ PV plants, namely Matapozuelos and Fuentes de

Ajio, were regulated by RD 1578/2008.!!2?

849. The Tribunal observes that unlike RDs 436/2004 and 661/2007, RD 1578/2008 does not
contain any language regarding the inadmissibility of tariff revisions for existing

installations.!!?3 The Fifth additional provision that concerns tariff revisions merely states

1121 As explained by Counsel for the Claimants, Mr. Vazquez-Guillén: “{...] one of the components of that TMR
is precisely the special regime [FiT]. So as you can imagine, the higher the installed capacity of renewable energy,
the higher the cost of the special regime; and as a result, the higher the TMR. Likewise, the higher the TMR would
also lead to an increase of the [FiT]s, which would again lead to another increase of the TMR. It generated sort of
a feedback loop.” Hearing Tr., Day 1, 18 March 2019, 45:10-17 (Vazquez-Guillén). See also Counter-Memorial,

and at the Hearing.

The Claimants nevertheless insist that, according to the interpretation provided by the
CNE, RD 1578/2008 must be interpreted similarly to RD 436/2004 and RD 661/2007.!!8
Specifically, the Claimants refer to CNE Report 30/2008, which provides in relevant part

as follows:

Production facilities under the special regime usually are capital-intensive and
have long recovery periods. The regulation of generation facilities under the
special regime established in Royal Decree 661/2007 has tried to minimize
regulatory risk for this group, offering security and predictability for economic
incentives during the lifespan of the facilities, establishing transparent
mechanisms for the annual updates of said incentives and exempting existing
facilities from revision every four years because the new incentives that are
being put into place only affect new facilities.

The guarantees provided for in this regulation make it possible to find better
financing, lower costs for projects and less impact on the electrical tariff that
consumers ultimately pay.'!”°

852. The Claimants also refer to the CNE’s written response to a query regarding the Fifth

additional provision of RD 1578/2008:

This regulation is consistent with the regulation established in Article 44.3 of
Royal Decree 661/2007, where it provides for a revision of the remuneration
scheme in 2010, which would be applicable to those facilities commissioned
starting on 1 January 2012.1!%°

853. Other documents that allegedly interpret RD 1578/2008 as guaranteeing that there will be

no changes to the FiT regime are summarised at paragraphs 308-314 above.

854. In the Tribunal’s view, by majority, none of these documents is capable of modifying the

express terms of the Fifth additional provision of RD 1578/2008 (and the absence of any
stabilization guarantee). Moreover, even if RD 1578/2008 contained a provision similar
to Article 40(3) of RD 436/2004 or Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007, the Claimants’
argument would have been rejected nevertheless, as the Tribunal has found earlier that
both RD 436/2004 and RD 661/2007 fall short of providing a_ stabilization

commitment.!!3!

855. In view of the above analysis, it does not appear necessary to discuss the legal effect of

the registration of the Claimants’ PV Plants with the RAIPRE, as the Tribunal has already
concluded that the applicable regulatory framework did not contain the guarantees of non-
alteration of the FiT as alleged by the Claimants. Nevertheless, for the sake of
completeness, the Tribunal will now address the Parties’ arguments regarding the

RAIPRE certificates.

856. The Claimants argue that “registration in the RAIPRE confirmed that an [...] installation

had the right to receive the RD 661/2007 FiT.”!!*? The Claimants make a similar

observation regarding the RD 1578/2008 FiT.!!? In other words, the Claimants’ position

is that registration in the RAIPRE crystallized the economic rights under RD 661/2007
and RD 1578/2008.!!34

857. The Respondent contends that the RAIPRE was just an administrative tool, a requirement
that needed to be met by facilities whishing to become part of the SES.''*> Spain also
emphasizes the fact that both conventional and RE producers had to register with the

RAIPRE.!'*°

858. The Tribunal, by majority, agrees with the Respondent that the registration of the
Claimants’ PV installations with the RAIPRE must be considered as an administrative
requirement that did not generate any vested rights for the investors. This conclusion finds
support, inter alia, in a document issued by the Spanish Council of State in 2010, which

provides in respect of the legal nature of the RAIPRE registration as follows:

In essence, neither the resolution of registration in the Special Regime
Register, nor the actual act of registration imply a declaration of the right to
receive the premiums. Therefore, the right to a certain regime of premiums
depends on compliance with the corresponding requirements and conditions,
including, as indicated in the report of the National Energy Commission and
in the report on regulatory impact, that of having the necessary equipment for
the production of electrical energy on the corresponding date.'7

In addition, the Claimants argue that the legitimate character of their expectations is
underlined by the fact that the Special Regime was part of a wider international and

domestic policy of promoting renewable energy.

The Tribunal is generally sympathetic to this argument but finds it unpersuasive in the
instant case. The Tribunal agrees with the reasoning expressed in Allard v. Barbados,
according to which “consideration of a host State’s international [environmental]
obligations may well be relevant in the application of [a] standard to particular
circumstances.”!!*° This is in line with the general consideration that obligations
stemming from a treaty with investment provisions, such as the ECT, “has to be construed

in harmony with other rules of international law of which it forms part.”!!4°

However, the fact that a State is bound by international obligations in the field of
environmental law and participates in the international debate concerning renewable
energy sources does not as such give rise to a “State representation.” A fortiori, such a
participation can hardly be construed as creating an expectation that FiTs granted under
a host State’s legal framework at a given time could not be modified or replaced by
another subsidy system in the future. At best, such a participation could be said to
reinforce an expectation that any adjustment measures taken by a host State remain within

the realm of reasonableness.

The Tribunal will further address certain documents that are not normative acts or judicial
decisions, but that, according to the Claimants, confirm their interpretation of RDs

436/2004, 661/2007, and 1578/2008.

The Claimants refer to CNE Report 3/2007 where the CNE proposed to maintain
“regulated tariffs during the service life of existing facilities (with a transparent annual
adjustment mechanism).”!!4! However, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that this
document could have been read as corroborating the existence of any guarantee of

immutability of the FiT scheme provided under RD 661/2007. Indeed, CNE Report

3/2007 clearly states that even retroactive changes of the regulatory regime are not

precluded:

[...] the principle of legal certainty is not by definition an anti-evolutionary or
conservative principle; it does not mean that legislation is resistant or immune
to reform. In this sense, these principles do not impede dynamic innovation,
nor that new regulatory provisions be applied retroactively to existing
situations, but that they should continue upon entry into force of the new
regulations.!'”

865. The same holds true for CNE Report 30/2008, which noted that the Spanish PV market
had been “over-incentivized” by RD 661/2007.!'#3 CNE Report 30/2008 further observes

that:

Certainly, the principles of legal certainty and the protection of legitimate
expectations (Article 9.3 EC) do not constitute insurmountable obstacles to
the innovation of the legal system and cannot therefore be used as instruments
to petrify the legal framework in force at any given time. In this sense, these
principles do not prevent the dynamic innovation of the regulatory
frameworks, nor of new normative provisions which can be applied pro-future
to situations initiated before it comes into force. But these principles do
require that regulatory innovation - especially if it is abrupt, unforeseeable or
unexpected - is carried out with certain guarantees and cautions (transitional
periods to adapt to the new regimes, where appropriate compensatory
measures, etc.) that dampen, moderate and minimize, as far as possible, the
disappointing of any expectations generated by the previous regulations.''“*

866. If anything, rather than contributing to creating any positive expectation, the Tribunal, by

majority, considers that this language should have cautioned the Claimants.

867. Moreover, contrary to the Claimants’ contentions, the record contains numerous other
statements which seem to be drawing attention to potential risks contained in the Spanish
legal regime for the RE sector. For instance, as stated by APPA in its draft complaint

about the Second Draft of RD 661/2007:

[...] any rational investor, when planning facilities of this type, must bear in
mind not only the costs and the foreseeable remuneration, but it also must

consider the risk that such remuneration could be lowered; because, if the

according to the Claimants themselves, marked the making of their investments.''>! The
presentation also post-dates the November 2005 business tour during which Mr. Bouman
apparently formed his understanding of the applicable regulatory framework and took the
initial steps towards investing in Spain.!!>? Finally, Mr. Bouman also acknowledged that
he had not personally analyzed the text of the presentation.''** There is thus no evidence

of any reliance on the February 2008 presentation by the Claimants.

Therefore, the Tribunal, by majority, cannot accept that the February 2008 presentation
made by the IDAE or any other presentations, promotional materials and the like,
especially those materials that were issued after the Claimants’ decision to invest had
been made, could alter the Tribunal’s interpretation of the applicable regulatory
framework based on the language of the applicable laws and regulations and the
contemporaneous jurisprudence of the Spanish Supreme Court (see paragraphs 818-838

above).

To conclude, neither RD 436/2004, RD 661/2007 nor RD 1578/2008 could have served
as the basis for the types of expectations the Claimants seek to vindicate in this arbitration,

namely that the FiTs they had initially enjoyed would remain in place as originally set.

Rather, the Tribunal considers that the basis for the Claimants’ expectations is set out in
Law 54/1997 — the cornerstone of the Spanish electricity system as applicable at the time
of the Claimants’ investments. As discussed above, Law 54/1997 provided for the right

to a reasonable return.

The Parties’ positions on the quantification of such a reasonable return differ. The
Claimants, on the one hand, argue that the reasonable return was defined by the specific
premiums set forth under RDs 436/2004, 661/2007 and 1578/2008 or, alternatively, by
the average WACC for the RE sector calculated for the relevant period (see paragraphs
731-743 and 975-976 of this Decision).!!>+ The Respondent, on the other hand, argues

that the reasonable rate of return contemplated in Law 54/1997 was around 7%, as, inter

alia, was set forth in the successive PERs.!!5> Following a detailed review of the evidence
on the record,!!*® the Tribunal is not satisfied with the argument of the Claimants. To the
contrary, the record amply corroborates the Respondent’s approach (see paragraphs 983-

995 below).

874. Indeed, Law 54/1997 enshrined the principle that RE investors were entitled to receive a
reasonable rate of return. This right was to be given effect through the various regulatory
acts which Spain adopted between 1998 and 2009. These included RD 436/2004,
RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008. The subsidy regimes created in these Royal Decrees
constituted an implementation of the reasonable return principle. They did not themselves
define the (unalterable) amount of such a return.''*7 The Tribunal agrees with the
observation made in BayWa v. Spain that “[t]he stream cannot rise higher than its source,
or commit the state to more than the legislative framework allows.”!!°* Spain was thus
free to modify the applicable framework in the exercise of its regulatory powers, as long

as the reasonable return principle guaranteed by Law 54/1997 remained respected.

875. For these reasons, the Tribunal, by majority, concludes that the Claimants’ primary claim
based on the non-alteration of the FiT regime under RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008
cannot be upheld. Rather, the Tribunal considers that Spanish law contained indicators

such as, for example, the 2005 Supreme Court Decision, which noted explicitly that:

There is no legal obstacle that exists to prevent the Government, in the
exercise of the regulatory powers and of the broad entitlements it has in a
strongly regulated issue such as electricity, from modifying a specific system

of remuneration, provided that it remains within the framework of [Law
54/1997].

876. In that sense, the replacement of the FiT scheme with the New Regime based on a

different methodology was not prohibited under Spanish law. To the contrary, Spanish
law explicitly allowed for the modification of a specific system of remuneration, subject
to respecting the conditions set by Law 54/1997, namely the guarantee of a reasonable
rate of return. Thus, the replacement of the FiT regime does not per se qualify as a
modification so “drastic” or “unexpected” so as to constitute a violation of the FET

obligation under the ECT and the stability obligation it subsumes.!!®

877. At the same time, considering that reasonable profitability has indeed been guaranteed

to the investors under Law 54/1997, the Claimants could legitimately expect to receive a
reasonable rate of return. The Tribunal’s determination, by majority, of the specific rate
that was guaranteed, and which the Tribunal sets at 7%, is discussed at paragraphs 983 to
995 below. Given that the Parties disagree on whether such profitability is maintained
under the New Regime, the Tribunal will need to further analyze the economic impact of
the Disputed Measures (see Section VIII.A.2 below) in order to answer the question of
whether the Disputed Measures continued to assure a reasonable rate of return or whether

they undermined the Claimants’ expectations by not doing so.

878. The above analysis is not supported by Professor Cameron. Professor Cameron, inter alia,

1159

asserts that “[t]he Tribunal’s emphasis upon immutability in relation to stability does not
fit with the statements of the parties in the case itself, not least the statements about
expectations made by the Claimants”.''®! In the majority’s view, this is erroneous, as,
according to the Claimants themselves, their expectations concerned “the nature, amount
and duration of the FITs offered under RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008”!'® and “that
any future changes to the RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 FIT would only apply

prospectively”.!!® In essence, this amounts to an expectation that the FiT-based scheme

would remain unchanged (or immutable). This is also reflected in the Claimants’ case on
damages, which is based on the assumption that the FiT and other elements of the initial
investment framework would be maintained. For the reasons provided above, the majority
was unable to endorse the Claimants’ primary case. At the same time, the majority did
find sufficient evidence in the record of these proceedings supporting Spain’s proposition
that the regulator has always aimed at providing the investors with a reasonable rate of

return.

Professor Cameron also criticizes the majority’s reliance on the jurisprudence of the
Spanish Supreme Court as one of the elements defining the Claimants’ legitimate
expectations, inter alia, on the grounds that the Spanish Supreme Court did not analyze
the issue of regulatory changes under international law.'!™ The majority notes that neither
Article 10(1) of the ECT, nor any other rule of international law defines the scope and
content of the Claimants’ expectations. It is not disputed that the alleged expectations
were formed on the basis of the texts of the relevant Royal Decrees and other sources of
Spanish law. The jurisprudence of the Spanish Supreme Court is therefore relevant to the
extent it provides the interpretation of the laws and regulations relied upon by the
Claimants at the time or prior to the Claimants’ investment in Spain. For the reasons stated
earlier in this section at paragraphs 836-838, when assessing the limitations set out in
Spanish law at the time of the Claimants’ investment, the Tribunal cannot substitute its
interpretation of the domestic legal framework for that adopted by the Respondent’s
highest court. By contrast, and as stated at paragraph 904 regarding the Tribunal’s
analysis of the Respondent’s alleged claw-back of past remuneration previously received
by the Claimants, the Tribunal is not bound by the Spanish courts’ characterization of the

Disputed Measures for the purpose of assessing their international legality.

Lastly, in disagreement with the Tribunal’s majority, Professor Cameron takes the view
that the registration of the investors’ facilities with the RAIPRE had legal significance
(“[o]nce registered, the necessary pre-conditions in terms of planning, financing,
constructing, and commissioning within a specific time-period were fulfilled, and Spain’s

duty to carry out the promised inducements was activated. Registration, at this point,

initiated Spain’s obligations under Article 10(1) of the ECT and made them binding on
the Respondent.”).!!® The majority notes that this view is based on the premise that
RD 436/2004, RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 contained guarantees of stability, which
has been rejected for the reasons stated above. Moreover, in the Claimants’ own words,
the RAIPRE registration confirmed the rights provided under the applicable Royal

Decree.!!® This is indeed correct, as by the time of the registration with the RAIPRE, the

EPC contracts had already been signed and the investments had been made.!!°7

(c) Claimants’ due diligence/ assumption of risk of regulatory changes

881. The Parties dispute the relevance and sufficiency of the Claimants’ due diligence.
According to the Claimants, the investor’s due diligence is not decisive for their claim as

long as the alleged expectations were otherwise reasonable and objective.''® This

approach has been endorsed, for example, by the Cube Infrastructure v. Spain tribunal.!!®

By contrast, the Respondent argues that adequate due diligence is essential and the

Claimants ought to have enquired specifically about the prospects of regulatory changes,

in view of the highly-regulated nature of the RE sector in Spain.!!”°

882. The Tribunal observes that many tribunals indeed considered the requirement of due
diligence as part of their assessment of the facts under Article 10(1) of the ECT.'!7! The
Stadtwerke Miinchen v. Spain tribunal held that for an expectation to be reasonable it must

“arise from a rigorous due diligence process carried out by the investor.”!!”* The Masdar

Solar v. Spain tribunal similarly found that “[i]f the general legislation is to be regarded
as a source of an investor’s legitimate expectations, the investor must demonstrate that it

has exercised appropriate due diligence and that it has familiarised itself with the existing

laws,”!!73

883. The Tribunal also notes that a different view was articulated by other tribunals, for
example, the RREEF vy. Spain and The PV Investors v. Spain tribunals, on the grounds
that regardless of whether the investor’s due diligence was sufficient, the Spanish

regulatory framework did not provide for any alleged guarantees except for that of a

reasonable return.!!”4

884. As it was succinctly put by the RREEF v. Spain tribunal:

The Claimants’ diligence might have been due. However, due or not, the
Claimants were made aware that the Respondent’s legal regime was subject
to possible changes in the future. This is evidence of the fact that any
expectation of the Claimants that the applicable legal regime was never
subject to any change whatsoever was not legitimate.!'”°

present purposes. Indeed, whether the [c]laimants engaged in diligence or not and whether that diligence was “due”
or not, cannot alter the fact that on the basis of the law and the jurisprudence the [c]laimants knew or should have
known that changes to the regulatory framework could happen. As a x) ions that they would
not happen cannot be deemed legitimate.” See AES Solar and others (PV Investors) v. Spain, PCA Case No. 2012-

284

885. The Tribunal would be minded to agree with the view that if it is already apparent that
the regulatory framework did not contain any alleged stabilization guarantees, the
sufficiency or insufficiency of the investor’s due diligence becomes somewhat less
relevant. That being noted, the Tribunal considers that the deliberate assumption of the

risk of regulatory changes may need to be taken into account when assessing an investor’s

alleged expectations.!!7°

886. In any event, as the Tribunal finds in the below paragraphs, even if the Claimants’ due
diligence is considered as a relevant factor, the record indicates that no specific attention
was paid to the fact that the Spanish legal framework has been in constant evolution and
displayed signs of regulatory risk (i.e., of potentially unfavourable regulatory changes)
before Mr. Bouman first started considering an investment in the Spanish PV sector. The

alleged expectations therefore cannot be regarded as legitimate, reasonable or objective.

887. The Claimants have submitted a number of documents in an attempt to show that the

necessary due diligence was carried out at the initial stages of the investment process.!!77

The Tribunal observes that during the period preceding the signing of the first EPC
contract on 10 August 2006,''’8 the Claimants received only the following documents

presented as forming part of their alleged due diligence:

The Tribunal notes that the e-mails and report issued by Mr. Wicke and his firm, Dikeos

Abogados! !8°

are focused on various administrative procedures and the overall progress
on the Mahora PV Plant project. Those documents neither contain any analysis nor, at a
minimum, a description of the applicable regulatory framework. The Dikeos Abogados
report, dated 30 March 2006, contains the following conclusion:

The very firm attitude of Mrs. Gallardo[ 1181] on the individual transformator

for each 100 kW-unit being the only decisive criteria for the assignment of the

high remuneration tariff was convincing. She has a broad and close view on

the practice of the competent authorities in this question. The example of the

Iberdrola wind farm and her conclusion of a self-binding rule for the

administration was also convincing. My personal conclusion of the

conversation was that there are no serious doubts as to the assignment of the
high remuneration tariff in Castilla - La Mancha where one transformator is
installed for each 100 kW-unit.!!*?

This document reveals that at the initial stages of the Mahora Project, the Claimants’ legal
advisor was primarily concerned with the assignment (rather than stability) of the FiT.
The other two e-mails, dated 3 March 2006 and 6 July 2006, discuss permits, leases,
construction deadlines, and other formalities that were necessary to build and put in
operation the Mahora Plant.!!83 Therefore, these three documents cannot be considered
as proof of any relevant due diligence regarding the Respondent’s alleged commitment

not to modify the FiT regime for existing PV installations.

The very first document, the 2005 Solar Plaza Report, prepared by Solar Plaza,
Mr. Koot’s consultancy company, consists of 93 pages examining the Spanish PV market
(see paragraphs 115-120 above).'!** However, the Tribunal notes that this report was
issued long before the adoption of RD 661/2007 and even before Mr. Bouman’s decision
to invest. Therefore, the 2005 Solar Plaza Report does not evidence any kind of due
diligence with respect to the provisions of RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 on which,
according to the Claimants’ own position, they allegedly relied when making their

investments in Spain.!!*>

Furthermore, the 2005 Solar Plaza Report does not include any legal inquiry into the
overall stability of the contemporaneous Special Regime regulations. At the same time, it
contains some critical remarks, such as the following:

The only problem with the current feed-in tariff seems to be the presence of a

ceiling at 150 MWp and 200 MWp for systems up to 100 kW respectively

larger systems th[a]n 100 kWp. This could result in the dramatic interruption

of the rapid PV market development as the ceiling is approached. It is difficult

to predict when this will happen because the ceiling could itself be one of the
reasons for a slowdown in market growth.!!*°

In sum, none of these four documents adduced as proving the Claimants’ due diligence
can serve as evidence for any sort of prudent analysis of the Spanish regulatory

framework.

Moreover, according to the 2005-2010 PER referred to by the Claimants,!'” the PV sector
was not developing at a sufficient pace at the time when Mr. Bouman started investigating
the Spanish renewables market.!!** RD 436/2004, under which the Claimants’ investment
process began,''*? was considered as offering PV investors an “insufficient return”.!!°°

Despite this characterization of the existing remuneration model, the Claimants decided

to carry on with their investments without asking for legal or other advice regarding the

prospects of the regulatory framework’s evolution.

Based on the above, the Tribunal, by majority, finds it difficult to support the Claimants’
position regarding the alleged sufficiency of their due diligence. Rather, the Tribunal, by
majority, considers that the investors’ conduct was not deterred by the signs of risk of
potentially unfavourable regulatory changes that were apparent between 2005 and 2006,

when Mr. Bouman started considering to invest in the Spanish market.

In any event, the Tribunal observes that the possibility of regulatory changes was
envisaged by some of the economic actors involved in the RE sector, which is evidenced,
for example, by the contemporaneous land lease agreement, signed by Gamesa (developer
of the PV plant) in Fuentes de Afio, dated 25 May 2006 (see paragraph 215 above). This

agreement contained the following provision:

[Termination] of the Contract
LJ
B. Once the solar photovoltaic facility is installed:

If regulation of the [electricity] sector is modified, in such a way that operatin,
facilities is not economically profitable.'!"!

Thus, it follows quite clearly from the analysis of the record that the Claimants did not
enquire specifically about regulatory risks in connection with their investments made
under any of the Royal Decrees. In fact, at the Hearing Mr. Bouman confirmed that he
never asked his legal advisor to analyze the Royal Decree on which his expectation was
allegedly based:

MS. FROHLINGSDOREF NICOLAS: Did you ask Mr. Wicke to make a legal
report or due diligence report on the content of Royal Decree 436/2004?

MR. BOUMAN: Not that I remember.!!°?

897. As already indicated,!'!® the Tribunal considers this statement to be of high probative
value, since, mutatis mutandis, it is “contrary to the interests or contentions of the [Party]

to which the witness owes allegiance.”!!**

898. In light of the foregoing, the Tribunal, by majority, concludes that the Claimants must be
found to have made their investment without displaying a specific preoccupation about

the risk of unfavourable regultory changes.

899. Professor Cameron dissents on the majority’s assessment of the Claimants’ due diligence.
Specifically, Professor Cameron emphasizes the fact that none of the legal advisers
involved in the process of setting up and financing the Claimants’ investments “signaled
that there were regulatory risks such as a possible withdrawal of RD 661/2007 or
RD 1578/2008”.''°> Professor Cameron also notes that Mr. Bouman’s decision-making
style “reflected the fact that investors come in different shapes and sizes: in this case, as
the sole investor with no management board to report to, the style had a simplicity that
was in his view appropriate to that kind of ownership structure.”!!°® Professor Cameron
moreover underscores the “highly cooperative” character of the relationship between the
investor and the host State in relation to the development of the renewables and concludes
that it would be inappropriate to require investors “in newer forms of energy to adopt a

sceptical stance vis-a-vis the Respondent’s integrity [...]”!!°”

900. The majority observes that the absence of any “signals” or “red flags” as such cannot be
decisive or indicative of the fact that the Claimants performed proper due diligence before
or while investing in the renewables market in Spain. As stated earlier, especially at
paragraph 896, the risks of adverse regulatory changes were never explored, which
explains the absence of any caveats regarding the stability of the FiT-based regime in the
due diligence documents provided by the Claimants. In the majority’s view, this fact

cannot be disregarded depending on the investor’s “size”, its ownership and management

structure. After all, it has never been suggested that Mr. Bouman is not a professional
investor or that the risks shall be re-allocated in this particular case in view of the
Claimants’ management style. Finally, the majority has never suggested that Mr. Bouman
should have questioned the “Respondent’s integrity”. However, the majority believes a
higher degree of caution would have been appropriate in a regulatory context that
constantly evolved from the adoption of RD 436/2004 to the signing of the Claimants’
first EPC Contract in 2006''%*, and where the Spanish Supreme Court had adopted the
position that the government retained the power to modify a specific system of

remuneration provided that it remained within the framework of Law 54/1997.!!%

Breach of the Claimants’ expectations

In view of the Tribunal’s earlier findings, by majority, that the only expectation that the
Claimants could have legitimately had was the expectation of a reasonable return
(see paragraphs 816-874 above), the Tribunal is therefore called to determine whether
such a return was maintained for the Claimants’ PV Plants despite the changes in the
remuneration scheme introduced by the New Regime. In this regard, the Tribunal finds
pertinent the following conclusion from The PV Investors v. Spain:

[...] the principle of reasonable return serves as the limit of ECT-compliant

regulatory changes. If changes cross the “reasonable return” line, that is if they

deprive investors of a reasonable return, the State conduct transgresses the
standards contained in Article 10(1) of the ECT.!2”

Since this analysis requires assessing the actual performance of the Claimants’ PV Plants
under the New Regime, the Tribunal will address this issue as part of the discussion on

quantum at Section VIII.A.2 below.

The alleged retroactivity (or the “claw back” effect) of the New Regime

There is an additional aspect the Tribunal has to address here as part of its liability

analysis, i.e., the so-called alleged “claw back” effect of the New Regime. As explained

4198 See sections III.B.3-IIL.B.5 above.
1199 See, paragraph 207 above.

1200 AES Solar and others (PV Investors) v. Spain, PCA Case No. 2012-14, Final Award, 28 February 2020
(RL-129), para. 638.

290

above, the claw-back effect consists in discounting the past remuneration received by the
PV installations that was in excess of the reasonable rate of return in the period since their

commissioning until July 2013 against the periodically defined rate of return (i.e.,

7.398%) to which the installations have become entitled under the New Regime. !?°!

904. The Tribunal cannot agree with the Respondent, who based on decisions by the Spanish

1202

Constitutional Court,'“"~ argues that this element of the New Regime is not unlawfully

retroactive and that it applies “to future facts in relation to legal situations in progress”
without affecting rights already acquired.'?°> Under RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008,
there was an unlimited possibility to earn returns that could have been in excess of the
reasonable rate of return (whether the rate of 7% guaranteed under Law 54/1997 or the
7.398% defined under the New Regime). There were no limitations on the amount of
energy that could be produced and sold by the PV installations.'** On the contrary, the
regime implemented via RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 incentivized production: “the

more electricity is produced, the higher the remuneration” — as it was on several occasions

emphasized by the Claimants and their experts. !7°5

905. Furthermore, the Tribunal is not convinced that the jurisprudence relied upon by the
Respondent in support of its position regarding retroactivity, such as Nations Energy v.
Panama is directly applicable to the case at hand.'?°° As observed by the BayWa v. Spain
tribunal, Nations Energy v. Panama “concerned a situation remote from the present one:

it involved an expropriation claim under a BIT, not a claim to breach of the legal stability

guarantee in Article 10 of the ECT.”!°” Nevertheless, even if this Tribunal did apply the
approach of the Nations Energy v. Panama tribunal, the outcome would not necessarily
be favorable to the Respondent. The Nations Energy v. Panama tribunal considered that
the disputed legislation in that case would have had retroactive effects if it, inter alia, had
reintroduced the tax deductions previously granted in the form of income tax.'?°8 In the
Tribunal’s view, this situation may indeed be seen as analogous to the present case where
future entitlements to subsidies are determined — and decreased — by reference to subsidies

that exceeded the statutorily defined rate of return in the past, but that were nevertheless

lawfully granted and paid.!?

906. The Tribunal thus agrees with the BayWa v. Spain tribunal that taking the investors’ past
returns for the purposes of calculating the amount of subsidies under the New Regime
would amount to penalizing them for the successful operation of the plants before the

adoption of the New Regime:

[...] the subsidies paid in earlier years were duly paid and duly taken into
account in the operation of the SPVs, in their financing and (presumably) their
taxation arrangements. To claw back those profits on the basis of a subsequent
judgment that they were ‘excessive’ was inconsistent with the principle of
stability in Article 10.1 of the ECT and has not been shown to have been
necessary to resolve the tariff deficit problem, which would have been solved
in any event by the Disputed Measures without much further delay and
without the element of claw-back of payments earlier lawfully made. It may
have been reasonable to take into account, in calculating subsidies going
forward, the 7,398% that the Plants were deemed to be entitled to under the
Disputed Measures. To count against them the amounts previously earned in
excess of that threshold was to penalise the Plants for their successful
operation during those years.'?!°

For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that, as a matter of principle, this “claw back”
operation of the New Regime amounts to a violation of Article 10(1) of the ECT. As
discussed below, no specific quantification in this respect has been submitted by the

Claimants. !?!!

The impact of the 2017 EC State Aid Decision

As mentioned above (paragraph 515), in November 2017, the European Commission
issued its 2017 EC State Aid Decision containing a number of findings in respect of the
Spanish RE incentive schemes. Specifically, the 2017 EC State Aid Decision
characterized the New Regime as State aid under Article 107(1) of the TFEU. Since Spain
notified the Commission of the New Regime only after its implementation, the
Commission found Spain to be in breach of its stand-still obligation under Article 108(3)
of the TFEU. At the same time, the Commission found that the incentives accorded by
the New Regime and the Special Regime were not as such incompatible with the internal

market.

The Commission also opined on whether the incentives provided by Spain to its RE
investors created any legitimate expectations on their part. In the EC’s view, The
Commission recalled that “there is ‘no right to State aid’ [a] Member State may always
decide not to grant an aid, or to put an end to an aid scheme.”!?!? The Commission further

explained as follows:

In the very specific situation of the present case, where a Member State grants
State aid to investors, without respecting the notification and stand-still
obligation of Article 108(3) TFEU, legitimate expectations with regard to
those State aid payments are excluded. That is because according to the case-
law of the Court of Justice, a recipient of State aid cannot, in principle, have
legitimate expectations in the lawfulness of aid that has not been notified to
the Commission.'?!3

I Save to the extent that Prof. Spiller quantifies “claw-back payments” that he notes were “implemented
requiring power plants or Spain, as applicable, to return the difference between the payments actually received in
the Interim Period and the payments that the power plants would have received under the June 2014 Order.” First

[N]o investor could have, as a matter of fact, a legitimate expectation
stemming from illegal State aid. This has been expressly recognised by
Arbitration Tribunals. It is in any event settled case-law that a measure that
does not violate domestic provisions on legitimate expectation generally does
not violate the fair and equitable treatment provision.'?'4

910. The Parties disagree on the impact of EU law and the 2017 EC State Aid Decision on the

resolution of the present dispute.

i. The Claimants

911. The Claimants argue that the 2017 EC State Aid Decision has no impact on the existence
of their legitimate expectations for the following reasons: (i) the Decision was issued in
2017, whereas the Claimants’ expectations were shaped in 2005-2009; (ii) the Decision
gives assessment of the New Regime, not RD 661/2007 or RD 1578/2008;!2!5 (iii) the
applicable law in this arbitration is in any event international law, in particular, the
ECT;!2!6 (iv) moreover, Spain led investors to believe that RD 661/2007 and
RD 1578/2008 were not only compliant with EU law but implemented pursuant to EU

law, 1217

912. Furthermore, the Claimants argue that Spain was not required to notify the FiT scheme
as at the time of its implementations FiTs were not considered as State aid under EU
law.'?!8 The Claimants note that the Respondent itself has pointed out that the
characterization of FiTs was only clarified on 22 October 2014 when the CJEU issued its
preliminary ruling in Elcogds S.A. v. Administracion del Estado, Iberdrola S.A.'""° The
Claimants submit that Spain’s failure to notify the FiT scheme to the commission cannot

have any impact on their expectations as ex-post interpretations, according to the

1214 9017 EC State Aid Decision (RL-57), para. 164.

215 Reply, paras. 204-213; Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 74. The Claimants emphasize that the Decision
expressly states: “it is not relevant for the scope of this decision to assess whether the originally foreseen payments
under the previous schemes would have been compatible or not.”

Respondent’s own argument, do not define ex-ante expectations and, according to Micula
v. Romania, “[i]nvestors are entitled to believe that the government is acting legally.”!77°
Finally, the Claimants argue that Spain should not be allowed to benefit from its own

wrongdoing — i.e., from its own failure to notify the incentive scheme to the EC.!7?!

ii. The Respondent

913. The Respondent relies on the 2017 EC State Aid Decision to argue that there is “no right
to State Aid” and that a non-notified support scheme cannot create any legitimate
expectations as to its immutability.!? According to the Respondent, the State always
maintains the power to change or to adjust a support scheme.'?”* Thus, no investor can
have an expectation that a specific amount of State aid including the remuneration under
the Special Regime, could remain unchanged.'?”4 The Respondent contends that the 2017
EC State Aid Decision takes into account payments under RD 661/2007 and
RD 1578/2008 and thus it is equally relevant for the assessment of the Claimants’

expectations under said Decrees. !??°

tii. The Tribunal’s analysis

914. From the outset, the Tribunal must recall its earlier finding (see paragraphs 525-528
above) that EU law may be either taken into account as a fact (if the relevant provision of
EU law is accepted as being part of the national law of the Member States) or applied as
international law (if the relevant rule belongs to the international legal order). Therefore,

the Claimants’ argument that EU law, including the 2017 EC State Aid Decision, is

"T1226

irrelevant for these proceedings initiated under the EC must be rejected.

916.

The content of the 2017 EC State Aid Decision is recapitulated at paragraphs 494-502
above. As it follows from this Decision, the Special Regime, including the RDs on which
the Claimants allegedly relied when making their investment constituted unnotified State
aid and thus could not, according to the Commission, give rise to legitimate
expectations.'??7 At the same time, the Tribunal deems it important to emphasize that the
2017 EC State Aid Decision did not make a finding on whether the Special Regime
(including RD 436/2004, RD 661/2007, or RD 1578/2008) was (despite lack of
notification) compatible with the EU State aid rules.!??8 Instead, the Commission
provided its assessment of the compatibility of the New Regime, i.e., the Disputed
Measures in this arbitration, with 2017 EC State Aid Decision and concluded that “the
aid does not exceed what is required to recover the initial investment costs and the
relevant operational costs, plus a margin of reasonable return, based on the past and
estimated costs and market prices.”!72? The Commission ultimately decided not to raise
objections to the aid scheme envisaged by the New Regime on the grounds that it was
compatible with the internal market pursuant to Article 107(3)(c) of the TFEU.!?*°
Therefore, the Tribunal’s finding that the Claimants’ only expectation was the expectation
to areasonable return is not necessarily inconsistent with the 2017 EC State Aid Decision,
which appears to have endorsed Spain’s current support scheme as long as the guaranteed

returns remain within the range of reasonableness.

The Tribunal further notes the following statement of the Commission regarding arbitral

awards rendered against Spain in connection with the adoption of the New Regime:

[...] any compensation which an Arbitration Tribunal were to grant to an
investor on the basis that Spain has modified the [Special Regime] by the
[New Regime] would constitute in and of itself State aid. However, the
Arbitration Tribunals are not competent to authorise the granting of State aid.
That is an exclusive competence of the Commission. If they

award compensation, such as in Eiser v. Spain, or were to do so in the future,
this compensation would be notifiable State aid pursuant to Article 108(3)
TFEU and be subject to the standstill obligation.'?*!

917. The Tribunal agrees with the award rendered in The PV Investors v. Spain, which
concluded in this respect that the Commission’s statement appears to have been premised
on the possibility of awarding compensation along the lines of the investors’ primary
claim based on the immutability of the FiT scheme.!?*? Given that this Tribunal has
already rejected the Claimants’ primary claim and that the Commission’s decision does
not suggest that maintaining the reasonable return would result in granting incompatible
State aid, the Tribunal concludes that it does not need to address any further the
consequences of a potential award in the Claimants’ favor. In any event, the Tribunal

recalls that the present dispute must be resolved first and foremost pursuant to the ECT.

2. Whether the Disputed Measures were unreasonable or disproportionate

a. The Parties’ positions on the law

918. The Parties seem to be in agreement that a measure is reasonable if it “bears a reasonable
relationship to some rational policy.”!?* Referring to Micula v. Romania, the Claimants

further add that the measure must be “appropriately tailored to the pursuit of [the] rational

policy with due regard for the consequences imposed on investors.”!?*+

919. As regards proportionality, the Respondent argues that a measure is proportionate if “it

takes into account all the interests involved in a balanced way.”!??> According to the

b. The Parties’ positions on the facts
i. The Claimants

920. The need to tackle the Tariff Deficit cannot, in the Claimants’ view, justify the reasonable
character of the Disputed Measures as the existence of the Deficit is attributable to the
Respondent who “has consistently failed to raise regulated tariffs to the level necessary
to cover the costs of the Electricity System.”!7*” Moreover, the Claimants contend that
the Tariff Deficit emerged before the development of the PV sector which made only a
limited contribution to the Deficit.!?** According to the Claimants, the return guaranteed
by the FiT-based incentive scheme was reasonable, and there was no evidence of any

over-remuneration of PV investors.'*”

921. The Claimants further argue that there is no reasonable relationship between the burden
imposed on them by the Disputed Measures and their objective to address the Tariff

Deficit.!”4° In this connection, the Claimants submit that: (i) the FiT for PV installations

played only a limited role in the accumulation of the Deficit;!”4!and (ii) less intrusive

measures could have been used to achieve the pursued goal.!'?4 The Claimants emphasize
that in March 2012 the CNE itself proposed various alternatives that would have reduced

the Tariff Deficit and included “a tax on the sale of petrol and gas, a tax on CO2 emissions,

ignore the CNE’s proposals. Thus, the Disputed Measures failed to meet the

requirement of proportionality.

922. The “claw back” effect (see paragraphs 491-492 above) is another element of the New

Regime, which, in the Claimants’ view, is unreasonable and disproportionate. !745

ii. The Respondent

923. The Respondent argues that the Disputed Measures complied with the requirements of
reasonableness and proportionality in view of the following circumstances:
[...] (1) the existence of an international economic crisis that led to a reduction
in electricity demand; (2) the rise in consumer tariffs, (3) the existence of
excess remuneration in the RE sector and (4) the existence of expectations of

growth of the tariff deficit. All of these circumstances involved the economic
non-sustainability of the [Spanish Electricity System].'**°

924. The Respondent further states that “[t]he need to protect both consumers, already affected
by increases in their electricity bills, and the very sustainability of the [Spanish Electricity
System] compelled” Spain to adopt, inter alia, the Disputed Measures.'?4”? The
Respondent notes that the reasonableness of the Disputed Measures was confirmed by the

Charanne v. Spain and Isolux v. Spain tribunals. !?*

925. The Respondent contends that the Disputed Measures were proportionate as RE
producers were enabled to recover their CAPEX and OPEX and achieve reasonable

profitability.!4? The Respondent also emphasized that it is inappropriate to analyze the

alternative solutions proposed by the Claimants as the Tribunal should not “second-

guess” the legislative policy measures of the Respondent.!2°°

c. The Tribunal’s analysis

926. From the outset, the Tribunal deems it necessary to make the following observations in
relation to the Claimants’ argument that Spain cannot invoke the necessity defence under
customary international law in order to justify the Disputed Measures.!”°! Firstly, as
confirmed by the Respondent’s counsel at the Hearing, Spain is not pleading necessity as

. . - : . 2
a circumstance precluding wrongfulness in these proceedings. '?>?

927. Secondly, the Tribunal is of the view that the question of whether the Disputed Measures
were necessary, reasonable and proportionate is in any event different from the question
of whether there was a state of necessity (which, as recalled above, is not being invoked
by Spain).'?°* Therefore, the Tribunal does not need to analyze whether the requirements

for invoking necessity under international law were met in the present case.

928. As regards the factual circumstances surrounding the adoption of the Disputed Measures,
the Tribunal recalls that the changes to the Special Regime under which the Claimants
invested were made in the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2008. By 2009,
Spain’s GDP had become negative, which, in turn, led to a decrease in the demand for
electricity.!?4 The imbalance between the income and the costs of the SES resulted in a
significant increase of the Tariff Deficit.!2°> Therefore, the Tribunal finds it rather
uncontroversial that at the time Spain’s SES and the economy as a whole had been facing

serious problems that called for immediate action. The Tribunal also emphasizes that the

ultimate reform implemented by Spain to tackle the Tariff Deficit and other related

problems appears to have been an attempt to find a middle ground solution, which would,

inter alia, allow the investors to maintain a reasonable return.'2>°

929. Although, as noted by the Claimants,!”°’ different options were available to Spain, it is
not for this Tribunal to judge which of these options was the most appropriate one to
pursue. Indeed, the Tribunal agrees with the case law which pays considerable deference
to the exercise of regulatory jurisdiction in matters of public interests, which includes
national economic regulation.'*°* As it was observed by the Antaris v. Czech Republic

tribunal and subsequently cited with approval in BayWa v. Spain:

The host State is not required to elevate the interests of the investor above all
other considerations, and the application of the FET standard allows for a
balancing or weighing exercise by the State and the determination of a breach
of the FET standard must be made in the light of the high measure of deference
which international law generally extends to the right of national authorities
to regulate matters within their own border.'?*°

930. The RREEF v. Spain tribunal similarly held:

[...] the Respondent enjoys a margin of appreciation in conducting its
economic policy; therefore, it will not substitute its own views either on the
appropriateness of the measures at stake or on the characterization of the
situation which prompted them; in particular, the Tribunal will abstain to take
any position on the issue of the existence of other or more appropriate possible
measures to face this situation.'7°

Bearing these considerations in mind, the Tribunal will proceed to analyze the Claimants’
claims of the alleged unreasonableness and disproportionality of the Respondent’s

Disputed Measures.

The Tribunal notes that the Claimants’ allegations regarding the unreasonableness and
disproportionality of the Disputed Measures are partially based on the assumption that
the RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 regimes would not be altered in significant respect.
For instance, the Claimants assert that Spain’s “dismantling of the entire legal and
business framework applicable to the Claimants’ investments is contrary to the
expectations of the Claimants and, indeed, of any reasonable person” and “[i]t was thus
unreasonable to strip the Claimants of the key guarantees upon which their investments

were based.”!°!

Given that the Tribunal has already considered (and, by majority, dismissed) the
Claimants’ claims regarding the immutability of the FiTs they had enjoyed under the
Special Regime under which their investments were made (see paragraphs 816-874
above), this aspect of the alleged unreasonableness or disproportionality of the Disputed
Measures need not be addressed any further. Thus, the Tribunal dismisses the allegation
that the abolition of RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 and other regulations forming part

of the Special Regime was in itself unreasonable or disproportionate.

In order to assess the overall proportionality and reasonableness of the Disputed
Measures, the Tribunal needs to verify that there is “an appropriate correlation between
the policy sought by the State and the measure”!”®; that a reasonable correlation also
exists “between the burden imposed on the foreign investor and the aim sought to be
realized by the State measure.”!7© Such a verification, in view of the Tribunal’s earlier
finding that, in addition to the expectation that previously received subsidies would not

be “clawed back”, the only legitimate expectation the Claimants could have had was that

of a reasonable return, ultimately depends on the assessment of the economic impact of

the Disputed Measures on the Claimants’ investments. Indeed, if the Disputed Measures

ensure that the reasonable profitability is achieved by the Claimants’ PV Plants, there will

be no finding of either unreasonableness or disproportionality of the Respondent’s

Disputed Measures (see Section VIII.A. below).!?

935. Therefore, the Tribunal reserves its further decision on the Claimants’ claim regarding
the alleged unreasonableness or disproportionality of the Disputed Measures under

Article 10(1) of the ECT.

3. Whether Spain breached the guarantee of transparency

a. The Parties’ positions on the law
i. The Claimants

936. The Claimants argue that under the FET standard, the State’s conduct towards investors
as well as its “legal environment” must be transparent, i.e., “free from ambiguity and
uncertainty.”!7 The Claimants rely, inter alia, on Electrabel v. Hungary where the

tribunal stated as follows:

The reference to transparency can be read to indicate an obligation to be
forthcoming with information about intended changes in policy and
regulations that may significantly affect investments, so that the investor can
adequately plan its investment and, if needed, engage the host State in
dialogue about protecting its legitimate expectations.'7°

ii. The Respondent

1267 and that it

937. The Respondent argues that transparency is not an autonomous obligation
cannot be interpreted as a “perfection” standard.'?° Relying on AES Summit v. Hungary,
the Respondent submits that there can only be a breach of the transparency standard if
“State’s acts or procedures, procedural omissions, have been manifestly unfair or
unreasonable.”!7© The Respondent also refers to the same finding of the Electrabel v.
Hungary tribunal referred to by the Claimants stating that the State must be forthcoming

with information about intended changes.!7”°

b. The Parties’ positions on the facts

The Claimants

938. The Claimants argue: (i) the Respondent needlessly implemented some of the Disputed
Measures in the form of Royal Decree-Laws which deprived “stakeholders of the

possibility to influence or challenge the measures”;!?7!

(ii) after the adoption of
RDL 9/2013 the Claimants were “left completely in the dark” for 11 months in respect of
the applicable parameters of the New Regime.!”? This period, according to the Claimants,
demonstrates that there was no “extraordinary and urgent need” and hence no need to use

the form of a Royal Decree-Law.'?73

939. The Claimants further argue that the New Regime is in itself opaque and
unpredictable.'?’* The Claimants point out the lack of transparency regarding the

calculation of the incentives under the New Regime (e.g., it is unclear how the spread of

The Claimants also criticize the New Regime, inter alia, for empowering the Respondent
to change the remuneration parameters through the 3-year and 6-year regulatory
reviews.!?”° Specifically, the Claimants denounce the absence of a predictable

methodology for conducting such reviews.!2”7

The Respondent

940. The Respondent argues that it followed the legally established procedures without
incurring undue delays and by ensuring participation of the stakeholders. !?’* For example,
before RDL 9/2013 was enacted, a public consultation had been held in February 2012
with 477 submissions of national and international stakeholders.'2”? The Respondent also

sought comments on draft RD 413/2014 in July-December 2013 before its enactment.!?°°

c. The Tribunal’s analysis

941. The Tribunal notes that the Claimants’ arguments regarding the alleged lack of
transparency pertain not only to the manner in which the Disputed Measures were
adopted, but also to the content of the guarantees under the New Regime.'?*! As regards
the content of the guarantees, the Tribunal has already found that the Claimants’
legitimate expectations would be infringed and the measures unreasonable and
disproportionate if the New Regime failed to maintain the reasonable return guaranteed

under Law 54/1997. 1782

942. As regards the manner in which the New Regime was adopted, in the Tribunal’s view, by
majority, the record does not show a lack of transparency in Spain’s conduct either. Quite
the contrary, the parameters of the New Regime had been discussed by various
stakeholders before the enactment of both RDL 9/2013 and RD 413/2014 as well as

subsequent regulations.'?** Therefore, it cannot be held that Spain was not “forthcoming

with information about intended changes.”!7*4

4. Whether the Disputed Measures violated the ECT’s “Umbrella Clause”

a. The Parties’ positions on the law
i. The Claimants

944. The Claimants argue that Article 10(1) of the ECT covers both contractual and legislative

or regulatory undertakings.'?°°

945. In support of their interpretation of said provision, the Claimants rely, inter alia, on Khan
Resources v. Mongolia where the tribunal confirmed the applicability of the umbrella
clause to obligations that Mongolia had under its foreign investment law.'?8? The
Claimants also refer to SGS v. Philippines where the tribunal found that

Article X(2) of the Swiss-Philippines BIT (which is similar to Article 10(1) of the ECT)

was “not limited to contractual obligations.”!?8

ii. The Respondent

946. The Respondent argues that Article 10(1) of the ECT only applies to obligations deriving
either from a bilateral arrangement between an investor and a State or a unilateral act
specifically aimed at that investor or its investment.'?*? In support of its position, the
Respondent refers to a number of arbitral awards including, inter alia, Noble Ventures v.
Romania where the tribunal concluded, in a non-ECT context, that “the notion ‘entered

into’ indicates that specific commitments are referred to and not general commitments,

for example, by way of legislative acts.” !7°°

947. The Respondent emphasizes that the above analysis was supported in the Isolux v. Spain

b.

award that dismissed the claim brought under the final sentence of Article 10(1) of the
ECT on the grounds that the applicable provisions of the Spanish legislative framework
were not specifically aimed at foreign investors but applied to both domestic investors

and those of another Contracting Party to the ECT.'??!

The Parties’ positions on the facts

i. The Claimants

948.

The Claimants argue that the “umbrella clause” applies to the commitments assumed by
Spain under RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008.'?°? Those commitments, according to the
Claimants, were also reflected in the RAIPRE certificates issued for each of the plants. 1293
The Disputed Measures, in the Claimants view, violated the Respondent’s commitments
under the Special Regime and thus breached the last sentence of

Article 10(1) of the ECT.

ii. The Respondent

949.

950.

The Respondent argues that RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 were addressed to “the
public in general, not to promote specifically foreign investments.”!?** Therefore, the

final sentence of Article 10(1) of the ECT does not cover these Decrees. !7°°

The Respondent further submits that the registration of the PV plants in the RAIPRE is a
mere administrative requirement which does not create specific obligations towards the
Claimants. '?°® The Respondent emphasizes that by 2016 the Register contained more than

64,000 facilities owned by over 44,600 owners. 1297

c. The Tribunal’s analysis

951. The final sentence of Article 10(1) of the ECT provides as follows:

“[e]Jach Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it has entered into with
an Investor or an Investment of an Investor of any other Contracting Party.”

952. The Tribunal, by majority, agrees with the Respondent’s interpretation of this provision.

Indeed, as it was persuasively explained by the BayWa v. Spain tribunal:

“[w]hen enacting legislation, the State establishes binding rules of conduct,
but it does not make specific promises to each person entitled to claim under
the law, nor does it enter into obligations to specific investors or their
investments even when these entities are numbered among the beneficiaries
of the law. A general law is not a promise.'***

953. Therefore, legislative and regulatory acts addressed to a plurality of persons do not fall

within the ambit of the final sentence of Article 10(1) of the ECT.

954. The Claimants’ assertion that under international law unilateral declarations of States may
have the effect of creating legal obligations,!? does not change the above conclusion.
Indeed, unlike the domestic legislative and regulatory measures of the Respondent

addressed in this Decision, the unilateral acts discussed in the jurisprudence of the

1300

International Court of Justice referred to by the Claimants’*’” operate on the international

plane. The facts of these cases bear no resemblance to the present dispute. Furthermore,

legal obligations, the International Law Commission (the “ILC”) defines unilateral
unilateral acts stricto sensu as “those taking the form of formal declarations formulated

by a State with the intent to produce obligations under international law.”'*°! In this

regard, the BayWa v. Spain tribunal observed as follows:

Neither the [ILC Guiding Principles applicable to unilateral declarations of
States capable of creating legal obligations] nor the commentaries allude to
the possibility of characterizing domestic laws as binding unilateral acts. In
the ordinary course of events, a domestic law providing for subsidies for
renewable energy generation is no more made ‘on the international plane’ or
‘with the intent to produce obligations under international laws’ than a law on
any other subject.!*

955. Therefore, absent any evidence that the regulatory framework discussed in this Decision
was adopted with the intent to produce obligations under international law and given that
RDs 436/2004, 661/2007 and 1578/2008 did not distinguish between foreign and

domestic investors, the Claimants’ position cannot be supported.

956. The Tribunal, by majority, is equally unpersuaded that the registration of the Claimants’
plants with the RAIPRE can be considered as creating any “obligations [Spain] has
entered into with” the Claimants within the meaning of the final sentence of Article 10(1)
of the ECT, as the Claimants do not seem to be arguing that the RAIPRE certificates
conferred any additional rights besides those provided in RD 661/2007 and
RD 1578/2008.'*° Furthermore, this Tribunal has already decided (see paragraphs 858-

859 above) that registration with the RAIPRE was a mere administrative requirement that

it did not generate vested rights for registered PV investors. !3°

957. As explained in 2010 by the Spanish Council of State:

958. For these reasons, the Tribunal, by majority, rejects the Claimants

In essence, neither the resolution of registration in the Special Regime
Register, nor the actual act of registration imply a declaration of the right to
receive the premiums. Therefore, the right to a certain regime of premiums
depends on compliance with the corresponding requirements and conditions,
including, as indicated in the report of the National Energy Commission and
in the report on regulatory impact, that of having the necessary equipment for
the production of electrical energy on the corresponding date.'*°5

VIII. ASSESSMENT OF THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE DISPUTED

MEASURES ON THE CLAIMANTS’ INVESTMENTS AND QUANTUM OF
DAMAGES

Assessment of the economic impact of the Disputed Measures on the Claimants’
investments

959. In accordance with its earlier conclusion that the assessment of the lawfulness of the

Disputed Measures under the ECT depends on whether the New Regime maintains a
reasonable return (see paragraphs 877, 934 above), the Tribunal will now turn to the
assessment of the economic impact of the Disputed Measures on the Claimants’ PV

Plants.

The Parties’ positions'°°

Respondent

960. Econ One argues that in order to assess the economic impact of the Disputed Measures

on the Claimants’ investments, it is necessary to determine whether the Claimants’
internal rate of return (the “IRR”) after the enactment of the Disputed Measures is lower

than the reasonable return for renewable energy projects in Spain.'*°7

reasonable rates of return in other countries.'>!° For example, as reported by Renewables
International, the return on investment for onshore wind and PV installations Germany

963. The Respondent further submits that it “does have a principled objection” against the use
of the weighted average cost of capital (the “WACC’”) as a benchmark for the reasonable
return as proposed by the Claimants.'*!? In any event, in respect of Compass Lexecon’s
use of the average WACC in 2007-2010 to calculate the reasonable rate of return, Econ
One argues that Compass Lexecon relied on data not specific to the RE industry in
Spain.'*'* Moreover, according to Econ One, “the average WACC calculated by
[Compass Lexecon] is skewed by the WACC from 2007”, if the WACC from 2007 is
excluded “the average [WACC] would be about 7%”, which is consistent with the

Respondent’s assumption. !7!°

The IRR

964. In order to calculate the Claimants’ IRR, Econ One uses typical installed costs of PV
plants “based on publicly available sources, to estimate the initial investment costs of the
[Claimants’ PV plants].”!3!° According to Econ One, this approach is consistent with the
objectives of the State support scheme: “[i]f a subsidy was established to give a
reasonable 7% rate of return on actual initial investment costs, regardless of whether those
costs were efficient or inefficient, that would give an incentive to build installations at

inflated costs, since that would result in higher remuneration.”!?!7

965. Econ One argues that the Claimants’ actual initial investment as well as historical
operating costs are significantly higher than those of typical PV plants.'*!* In particular,
regarding the initial investment costs, Econ One notes that the financial statements used
by Compass Lexecon (EUR 56.6 million) are not reflective of the Claimants’ construction
costs.'*!9 Rather, these costs reflect the price that the Spanish Project Companies paid to
Cross Retail, a related entity, and that these costs do not capture

“the costs expected from a true arm’s length transaction between two unrelated

parties.”!° In addition, Econ One concludes that construction delays experienced by the

Claimants increased the initial investment costs.!3!

966. Econ One also submits that the Claimants’ documents indicate that “the initial investment

costs of the PV Plants include brownfield premiums.”!3?2 Brownfield investments, as
explained by Econ One, “are investments that are either nearly or completely developed
and operational.”'2> Thus, “[bJrownfield costs can also include payments to the
developers of a project before it actually becomes operational.”!*”4 Econ One also notes
that brownfield costs “can be significantly different from greenfield costs due to the lower
risk implied in the operational phase of the project” and that “[a]n investor can pay

significant premiums compared to the greenfield investment costs.”!??°

967. Therefore, according to Econ One, brownfield premiums should be excluded from the

1326

analysis of reasonable profitability, as the inclusion of brownfield costs would

incentivize investors to inflate their initial investment costs. 32”

968. Econ One further argues that the Claimants’ operating costs (operations and management

fees, general administration fees, insurance and land fees) were also abnormally high.!??
Thus, throughout its calculations Econ One uses the prices for operation and
managements services as re-negotiated in 2015 and 2017, as in Econ One’s view, there is

no reason to believe that the same prices were not available earlier.!*7°

969. Atthe Hearing Econ One also suggested that the Claimants “overpaid for the [PV] plants”

due to lack of prior experience in the industry.'**?

970. Thus, the initial investment costs applied by Econ One for its IRR calculation are set at

EUR 43.8 million.'33!

971. Furthermore, Econ One argues that its calculation of an “exit” rate of return using an

enterprise value at a given valuation date is more appropriate than the Claimants’
“holding” rate of return “because it represents the return under the scenario of a
hypothetical buyer acquiring the PV Plants as of the valuation date, which is consistent
with the approach used by Compass Lexecon to calculate damages in this case.”!*** Econ
One also notes that the “holding” IRR “ignores all valuation dates and assumes a stream

of cash flows until the end of the useful life of the PV Plants.”!773

972. Based on the above assumptions, Econ One then concludes that the Claimants’ IRR was

11.6% post-tax as at 20 June 2014.'*** Thus, according to the Respondent’s expert, the
Disputed Measures did not have any negative economic impact on the Claimants’ PV

plants.

Claimants

973. The Claimants’ three criticisms of Respondent’s calculations of the Reasonable and

1331

Internal Rates of Return were succinctly formulated by Professor Spiller from Compass

Lexecon at the Hearing:

My last point on Dr. Flores [from Econ One] is the IRR analysis [...] I have
three issues. Dr Flores uses the IRR to check whether the actual returns are
consistent with a benchmark return of 7% that he computes. There are three
problems with his IRR test: first of all, he has the wrong investment cost:

second, he has the wrong methodology to compute the IRR; and third, he has
the incorrect benchmark.'**

i. The reasonable rate of return

974. Compass Lexecon submits that Econ One uses an incorrect average benchmark of 7%.'3°°

Compass Lexecon observes that Econ One’s analysis does not differentiate between
returns of different types of technologies and wrongly refers to reasonable rates in

Germany, as the risk of investing in Germany is lower than the risk of investing in

Spain.'*97

975. According to Compass Lexecon, the minimum reasonable return should be calculated by

reference to the average WACC for a renewable energy project in Spain:!*7*

Corporate finance theory states that an investment only makes economic sense
if the expected return is greater than or equal to the rate of return required by
the investor (known as the hurdle rate). It follows that the return that would
be deemed reasonable by an investor would be the hurdle rate. [...] As
Damodaran notes, “the cost of capital is the minimum acceptable hurdle rate
that will be used to determine whether to invest in a project.” Consequently,
the minimum reasonable return would be the cost of capital for a renewable
energy investment in Spain, or WACC.'*°

976. Compass Lexecon states that the average WACC for renewable energy investments in
Spain in 2007-2010 was 8.01% post-tax.'*4° Contrary to the Respondent, the Claimants
argue that there is no basis to exclude the 2007 WACC, as the Mahora plant was built in

The IRR

Compass Lexecon criticizes Econ One’s IRR calculation methodology for using an “exit”
IRR, which assumes that the investor would exit the project as at the valuation date (June

2014) rather than operate it until the end of its useful life.'*4?

In Compass Lexecon’s view,
this is inconsistent with the concept of reasonable rate of return that represents long-term
returns.'*43 According to Compass Lexecon, an “operational” (rather than “exit”) IRR
should be preferred, as it “represents the return from operating the plants until the end of
their useful life.”!**4 In support of its position, Compass Lexecon refers, inter alia, to the
EU Communication “On the application of the European Union State aid rules to
compensation granted for the provisions of services of general economic interest” where
the rate of return is defined as “the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) that the undertaking

makes on its invested capital over the lifetime of the project.”!*4>

Compass Lexecon also criticizes the use of “reasonable” investment costs by Econ One
in their IRR calculations instead of the actual investment costs of EUR 56.6 million
incurred by the Claimants.!*4° As regards the criticism regarding the inclusion of the
brownfield costs in the Claimants’ initial investment costs, Compass Lexecon observes
that Econ One “ignores the fundamental fact that greenfield projects are subject to
substantially more risk than brownfield projects, such as construction risk”, “[t]herefore,
if the Spanish regulation were to only target greenfield investments, it should incorporate
in the allowed rate of return the additional construction risk inherent to greenfield projects

— which the regulation does not do.”!*47

Compass Lexecon’s criticism is essentially two-fold. First, Compass Lexecon argues that

Econ One’s reasonable costs are below and thus contradicted by the standard investment

costs set by Spain in the 2014 June Order.'*4® Second, Professor Spiller also argues that
the renewable energy projects used by Econ One are not comparable to the Claimants’

PV Plants:'*°

Of the [29] sources cited [by Econ One] there are 17 based on projects outside
of Spain and cannot be compared to the Claimants’ Plants in Spain, as
recognized by Spain’s IDAE cited by Econ One, stating that “[d]uring the
completion of the report, it was found that there may be differences with the
costs to which the modules can be obtained in other countries.” This is also
highlighted by IRENA, indicating that “[t]he total installed cost of PV systems
can vary widely within individual countries, and between countries and
regions. These variations reflect the maturity of domestic markets, local labour
and manufacturing costs, incentive levels and structures, and a range of other
factors.”

13 of the sources are based on estimates of a “model” PV plant and do not
reflect actual cost like the Claimants’ Plants incurred.

19 of the sources do not specify the technology, fixed or axis, of the PV project
being reviewed.

7 of the sources relate to small scale projects that are not comparable to the
Claimants’ Plants.

Only one of the sources is for the actual cost of a utility scale PV project in
Spain that can be compared to the Claimants’ Plants. However, this source is
for plants constructed in 2011, after the Claimants’ Plants had been
constructed.'*°

980. Compass Lexecon further adds that in any case Econ One did not provide any concrete
evidence that the Claimants’ transactions were not reflective of arm’s length transactions;

Econ One equally did not provide an independent benchmark that would represent an

arm’s length transaction cost for a PV plant in Spain.!*>!

The Tribunal’s analysis

In order to decide whether the New Regime maintains a reasonable return, the Tribunal
needs to perform the following analysis: (a) first, it must identify the benchmark — the
reasonable rate of return to which the Claimants were entitled; (b) second, it must
determine the internal (actual) rate of the investors’ PV installations — the IRR; and
(c) third, the Tribunal needs to compare the Claimants’ IRR with the reasonable rate of
return. If the IRR is below the reasonable rate of return, there will be a finding of liability
because the Disputed Measures will be considered as having violated Claimants’

legitimate expectations and as imposing a disproportionate burden on the Claimants.

Reasonable rate of return

By way of introduction, the Tribunal recapitulates the Parties’ positions regarding the
reasonable rate of return.'*°> According to the Respondent, the reasonable rate of return
for RE projects in Spain was around 7% from the beginning of the 2000s, whereas
according to the Claimants the reasonable rate of return at the time when they made their
investments was 8.01%.'*>+ The Parties disagree not only on the specific figure, but also
on the methodology for calculating the reasonable rate of return. The Respondent refers

to a number of publicly available sources providing for rates of return in the range of 5-

1353 See also paras. 961-963 and 974-976 above.

1354 See paras. 961-963 and 974-976 above. At paragraph 190 of the Reply, the Claimants also stated that
“the relevant rate of reasonable return for the purposes of assessing [their] expectations would be at least 7.2%
post tax”.

319

7%, whereas the Claimants calculate the reasonable return by reference to the average

WACC for renewable energy projects in Spain in 2007-2010.

984. In the Tribunal’s view, it would be more appropriate to set the relevant benchmark for
measuring any alleged harm caused to the Claimants by the Disputed Measures based on
the analysis of the laws and regulations as well as other contemporaneous documents that
were publicly available during the Claimants’ investment process (February 2005 —
November 2009!955) and should have been informing their decision-making process. This
is especially so, as in the present case (unlike in RREEF v. Spain where both parties seem
to have calculated the WACC for such purposes!*°) the Respondent has submitted a

principled objection against the use of the WACC as a benchmark.!?57

985. First of all, the Tribunal recalls that the 2000-2010 PER was based on the assumption of

a minimum return of 7% after taxes:

Profitability of the type project: calculated on the basis of maintaining an
Internal Rate of Return (IRR) [...] a minimum of 7%, with own resources,
before financing and after taxes. '*°*

986. Similarly, the 2005-2010 PER listed a return on a standard project “calculated on the basis

of maintaining an Internal Rate of Return (IRR), measured in legal tender and for each
standard project, around 7%, on equity (before financing) and after taxes.”!**?
Commenting on this source at the Hearing, Professor Spiller from Compass Lexecon

noted that it seemed reasonable to him.'3°°

987. The Memoria Econémica issued by the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism on
21 March 2007 in preparation of the future RD 661/2007 referenced the following rates

of return:

The regulated tariff has been calculated in order to guarantee a return of 7-8%
depending on the technology. The premiums have been calculated by
following the criteria found in Royal Decree, i.e., the premium has been
calculated as the difference between the regulated tariff and the average
futures market price for these technologies.

LJ

 

3.2.1. Solar Photovoltaic Sector

A new definition of power is drafted in Article 3 in terms of the applicable
economic regime in order to avoid inefficient configurations due to the large
number of transformers.

The payment for the regulated tariff is increased for 100 kW to 10 MW and is
maintained with the rest in order to adequately reflect the costs of these
facilities.

The market option is not considered for these facilities.

The payment corresponding to the solar photovoltaic sector is found in Table
3, Sub-Group b.1.1.

For facilities of up to 10 MW, these values of the regulated tariff provide a
reasonable IRR over 25 years of approximately 7%.

An IRR lower than 7% is considered within the power rating greater than
10 MW. Photovoltaic facilities of this size are not typical, and if there were,
they would not respond solely to criteria on returns.

The power targets considered to date were increased, establishing 371 MW as
the reference installed power target with right to payment for photovoltaic
plants.!%°!

that the rate “proposed by the Ministry” was of 7%.'°° The Claimants refer to this CNE

1366 CNE, Report 3/2007 on the proposed Royal Decree regulating electric power generation under the Special
Regime and specific technologies under the Ordinary Regime, 14 February 2007 (C-51), p. 52: “[a]ccording to
Article 40 of Royal Decree 436/2004, the NEC should propose the economic incentives to be applied to facilities
that start operation from | January 2008, and these should be calculated based on the actual costs of the facilities
started-up from the entry into force of the Royal Decree. For these purposes, the NEC is authorised to collect this
economic information, as published in Circular 3/2005. This Circular brings together the actual c of the
facilities started-up in the period between the years 2004, 2005 and the first half of 2006. Therefore, it is possible
to calculate the average rate of return of the tariffs and the premiums contained in the proposed Royal Decree for
more developed technologies during this period, such as wind energy, photovoltaic, hydropower, landfill biogas
and small cogeneration with natural gas. As an element of contrast and analysis of the tariffs and premiums
contained in proposed Royal Decree and also in compliance with the provisions of Article 40 of Royal Decree

a guaranteed rate of return. It seems that the only purpose of these calculations was to
demonstrate how the new tariffs would affect the profitability of PV installations and in
this respect, it is not necessarily surprising that the increase in FiTs would result in a
higher internal rate of return. The Tribunal however has already decided, by majority, that
the Claimants were not entitled to any fixed level of the FiT under RD 436/2004,
RD 661/2007 or RD 1578/2008. Therefore, these CNE calculations cannot serve as
benchmarks for the purposes of determining the reasonable rate of return referenced in

Law 54/1997.

At the Hearing, Compass Lexecon also referred to a number of sources besides CNE
Report 3/2007 that allegedly support the Claimants’ contention that the guaranteed level
of return was above 7% at the relevant times.'*°? In the Tribunal’s view, the EC
Commission’s decision SA N414/2008-UK indicating a rate of 15% is not applicable to
the present case, as it concerns the support system existing in the United Kingdom, which,
as explained by Econ One, is quite different from the one that was set up by Spain.!*%
Another document from the CNE dated 2009 similarly to CNE Report 3/2007 seems to
be setting out a calculation of rates of return based on a survey of existing facilities.'°°
The Tribunal, by majority, has already provided its explanation in the preceding
paragraphs as to why such calculations cannot be taken into account for the purposes of

establishing a guaranteed rate of return.

Finally, Compass Lexecon refers to four versions of IDAE’s presentation “The Sun Can
Be Yours”. The Tribunal notes that the calculations of rates of return in these
presentations depend on a number of variables, such as sources of financing of the project

(whether, for example, bank financing is used or not) and on the types of technology used.

Moreover, it is noteworthy that these presentations are formulated in cautious terms, when
discussing the reasonable return. For instance, the presentation dated 22 February 2006
states that the rate of profitability “occasionally may reach up to 9%”.'37° Therefore, the
Tribunal is not convinced that IDAE’s presentations accurately reflect the rate of return

that was guaranteed to the investors under the Special Regime.

In addition to the sources referred to in the preceding paragraphs, the 7% rate of return
was also mentioned in the October 2005 ASIF Report concerning the development of the

PV sector in Spain:

It is considered fundamental to maintain RD 436/2004 in the coming years so
that the economy that controls photovoltaic development in Spain is
efficiently structured. This regulation provides a reasonable rate of return on
investment for an average standard facility. This reasonable rate of return is
considered to be ten years or, taking another investment analysis parameter
and as pointed out by the Plan for Renewable Energies, having an internal rate
of return on the own equity invested of between 5 and 7%.'37!

 

In the April 2010 APPA Report it was stated that the 7% rate of return was used in the

jurisprudence of the Supreme Court to measure the reasonable profitability.'*7*

. In view of the available information, and although the reasonable rate of return has at

times been characterized as a “dynamic” concept, the Tribunal, by majority, concludes
that the Claimants could legitimately expect a reasonable rate of return for RE projects in
Spain of 7% after taxes. The Tribunal’s conclusion is comforted by the findings made in
similar cases. For example, the tribunal in The PV Investors v. Spain concluded that the
reasonable rate of return for photovoltaic plants in Spain was in the range of 7%.'”> The
RWE v. Spain tribunal found that a return figure of 7% post-tax has long been associated

with the renewables regime in Spain.!** In FREIF Eurowind v. Spain, the tribunal

similarly held that it saw “no difficulty with proceeding with 7% as the benchmark

understood by FREIF when it invested.”!37°

b. TheIRR

996. The Tribunal first observes that neither Party seems to have calculated an IRR separately
for each PV Plant. Rather, both Parties’ experts calculated a single IRR for all of the
Claimants’ plants. As summarised above, according to the Claimants, their IRR under the
Disputed Measures is 5.44% as at 20 June 2014,'>”° whereas according to the Respondent,

the Claimants’ IRR is 11.6% as at the same date.'*7”

997. The difference between the two figures provided by the Parties’ experts is largely driven
by their disagreement on: (i) whether the IRR should be calculated as an “operational” or
“exit” rate and (ii) the investment costs to be assumed for the purposes of the calculation

of the IRR.1378

998. The Tribunal will address each of these parameters in turn, but before doing so, it must
fix the date for performing the valuation of the Claimants’ IRR. Since the goal of this
analysis is to decide whether Spain ultimately breached its international obligations by
changing its regulatory framework, the appropriate date should be set at 20 June 2014 —
the date when the alleged breach was consummated by Order IET/1045/2014, according
to the Claimants.'*”? The same date was also used by the Respondent to calculate the

Claimants’ IRR.'*°°

i. “Operational” or “Exit” IRR?
999. To recall, as explained by Compass Lexecon, the “exit” IRR calculated by Econ One is

based on the assumption that the investor would sell the project at the valuation date,

whereas the “operational” IRR assumes that the investors would operate the PV plants

until the end of their useful life.!3*!

1000. In the Tribunal’s view, it seems more appropriate for the purposes of the present analysis
to calculate the so-called “operational” IRR, as it reflects the returns earned over the
lifetime of the project. This Tribunal agrees with the RREEF v. Spain tribunal, which
observed that “it is assumed that the profitability will be calculated during the whole life
of the investment, that is the lifetime of the plant”.'**? In The PV Investors v. Spain, the
tribunal similarly held that “for purposes of assessing the alleged harm to the Claimants’
investments, it is logical to have regard to the IRR that an investor would receive
throughout the entire regulatory lifetime of the plant”, “[b]y contrast, the Tribunal sees

little justification in assuming that an investor sells its investment at some point,
effectively cashing out the estimated fair market value of the assets through the sale.”!78
Similar reasoning was also followed by tribunals in Hydro v. Spain,'**+ BayWa v.

1385

Spain and Cavalum y. Spain.'**° Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal agrees with

Compass Lexecon’s approach on this count.

ii. Investment costs

1001.In the course of these proceedings three types of investment costs were addressed in the
Parties’ pleadings. First, the Claimants argued that the actual costs of EUR 56.6 million
must be used for the purposes of calculating their actual IRR.'**” Second, the Respondent
argued that hypothetical “reasonable” costs of EUR 43.8 million must be used instead, as
the regulatory framework guaranteed a return only on the costs that were reasonable. !*88
Third, Econ One also provided an additional calculation based on the standard facility
installed costs (calculated on the basis of Order IET/1045/2014) of EUR 52.2 million.
This last figure of EUR 52.2 million does not seem to be in dispute between the Parties’

experts, 138°

1002. Since the Tribunal’s task at this stage is to assess the impact of the Disputed Measures on
the Claimants’ plants, the Tribunal would have been minded to use the Claimants’ actual
costs to the extent that such costs are within the range of market prices and actual
construction costs. At the same time, there are certain indications on the record that
suggest that the Claimants’ costs might have been indeed above the average, reasonable

costs.

1003. For example, as pointed out by Econ One, in December 2009 Ra Solar (owned by the
Claimants) purchased the Matapozuelos PV plant from Cross Retail (also owned by the
Claimants) for EUR 4,847,876,'°°° whereas the price of the EPC contract for this plant
between Cross Retail and Enerpal was EUR 4,340,776 in September 2009.'39! Thus, the

declared purchase price for Matapozuelos incorporates an increase by EUR 507,099 that

1389 See Econ One’s calculations at Tab “Figure 3 - CAPEX” in Exhibit EO-124, based on Table 4 of the First
Compass Lexecon Report, p. 27. Professor Spiller from Compass Lexecon also mentioned the standard costs of
EUR 52.2 million at the Hearing. See Hearing Tr., Day 4, 21 March 2019, 243:6-11 (Spiller: “So if you tell us
what the investment cost is, if you think that what we did, which is to use the financial statements, is correct, or
you think his is, or the government own, which I believe is 52.2, we can directly compute for you an operational
IRR and give you the number.”) (emphasis added).

occurred between September and December 2009. Similarly, the purchase price paid for
the Fuentes de Aiio plant incorporates an increase by EUR 1.8 million.!7°?
as noted by Econ One, Cross Retail sold Ronda PV and Villar de Cafias PV to individual

project companies for EUR 10,691,460 and EUR 7,472,096, respectively.'*9 These

Furthermore,

amounts, rather than the turnkey project costs, are recorded as the initial capital expenses
in the 2013 financial statements for each of the Spanish Project Companies. Econ One

further explains in this respect:

Related companies can be incentivized to overstate the value of their assets,
as this may allow them to acquire more favorable third-party financing terms
and higher loans. In addition, related companies may have an incentive to
maximize their third-party debt in order to increase tax shields that may
become available to the Project Companies.'*

1004. Moreover, as observed by Econ One, the initial book value reported in the 2013 financial
statements that were used to assess the Claimants’ initial investment costs “represents the
price that the Spanish Project Companies paid to acquire the PV plants from Cross Retail,

arelated entity, and does not capture a true arm’s length cost resulting from a transaction

between two unrelated parties”. !3°>

1005. Furthermore, Econ One refers to the following circumstances as demonstrating that the

Claimants’ initial investment costs included brownfield premiums:

A draft of the 2012 Due Diligence Report for Matapozuelos PV by Gémez-
Acebo & Pombo established that Gamesa was the original promoter of the
project. As the original promoter, Gamesa acquired an “authorization for the
exceptional use of rural land for the [Matapozuelos] photovoltaic installation”
from the Regional Commission for Urban Development of Valladolid [...].
Gamesa was also responsible for the construction, installation and works tax
[...] for the Matapozuelos installation and bore the cost of the Medium
Tension Works installation for the project, before it was ever owned by
Claimants. After these costs were incurred, Enerpal acquired the permits from
Gamesa, presumably at a premium, and proceeded to develop the legal

prerequisites for the facilities before the involvement of Claimants in the
project.'96

The due diligence report further states that the “estimate for the execution of
the PV Plants provided by Enerpal amounts to EUR 140,363.7 for each
100Kw, including the photovoltaic generator. For that reason, the estimate for
the 925Kw, taking into account the PV modules, according to Enerpal,
ascends to EUR 1,298,358.4.” The final turnkey EPC price between Enerpal
and Cross Retail, however, was EUR 4,340,776, that is, 234% higher than the
original estimate provided by Enerpal.'*””

LJ

Similarly, the Due Diligence Report for Fuentes de Afio PV, prepared by
Ramén & Cajal, states that the original promoter of that project was also
Gamesa. Enerpal, the future EPC Contractor for the PV Plant, bought the
rights to develop the project from Gamesa for an unknown amount in 2007.
At that time, Gamesa had already acquired permits, such as the contract for
the right to the surface of the land and the administrative authorization from
the Fuentes de Afio municipality. At the time of the due diligence report,
Enerpal was the promoter and holder of the permits for the construction of the
facility, and had already invested capital in the project, for which it sought
compensation. Specifically, the due diligence report states that Enerpal
“intends to go ahead with the sale of the Project” to another entity. As
mentioned above, sales price includes premiums that compensate the
promoters for their work in the first phase of project development. This raises
the possibility that the reported costs of the EPC contract for the PV Plants do
not measure a true greenfield cost.'***

1006. Notwithstanding these criticisms, Econ One was unable to provide an alternative
calculation of the Claimants’ actual initial investments because the expert did not have
access to the entire cost information for the PV Plants,'*%? despite the fact that during the
document production phase of this arbitration, the Claimants were ordered to produce
“[d]etail on the historical capital expenditures breakdown for each of the five PV Plants

and the 56 Spanish Project Companies including, but not limited to, the costs of the

photovoltaic modules, the installation costs, and any data and information regarding cost
overruns and delays during the construction phase of the PV Plants.”!4°° Econ One states
that “in response to this request, [the] Claimants submitted limited new information about
the PV Plants’ historical capital expenditures” and that “[the] Claimants have not
produced sufficient cost information that could be used to assess the reasonability of the

initial investment costs reported in the PV Plants’ 2013 financial statements.”!4°!

1007.In response, the Claimants argue that (i) their costs were generally in line with the
standard costs set out by Spain under the New Regime; and (ii) “if the Spanish regulation
were to only target greenfield investments, it should incorporate in the allowed rate of
return the additional construction risk inherent to greenfield projects.”!*°? Thus, the
Claimants do not seem to be engaging directly with the specific criticisms made by Econ
One regarding their initial investment costs. Rather, the Claimants’ response is based on
the assumption that they did not have any incentives to inflate the initial costs, as “a higher
investment cost means lower profitability for the investors.”'4°? Therefore, Compass
Lexecon concludes that “investors had all the incentives to minimize investment
expenses, for the same quality of infrastructure and construction risk”.'4+

1008. The Tribunal considers the Claimants’ arguments insufficient to explain their failure to
produce the documentary evidence requested by the Tribunal in the document production
phase. This prevents the Tribunal from assessing with certainty the investment costs and,

thus, the economic impact of the disputed measures on the investment.

1009. Notwithstanding the above, the Tribunal considers that its “duty is to make the best
estimate that it can of the amount of the loss, on the basis of the available evidence”;

“[t]hat must be done even if there is no absolute documentary proof of the precise amount

lost.7!495

330

1010. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that, as a matter of principle, the Claimants’ initial
“greenfield” costs must be considered for the purposes of calculating the IRR. This

approach has also been upheld in The PV Investors v. Spain for the following reasons:

The Tribunal considers that greenfield investment costs are the costs borne at
the beginning of a project’s lifecycle that are necessary to bring a plant into
operation. This includes the engineering, procurement, and construction
(EPC) costs associated with the photovoltaic modules and the civil works
required to put them in place, the cost to connect the facility to the electricity
grid, initial inventory required for normal operation, permitting and licensing
fees. The Tribunal agrees with Spain that other costs that may be borne by
investors are not strictly necessary for the operation of the plant. These include
costs associated with debt financing, acquisition premiums paid to developers
or for brownfield assets (investments that are either nearly or completely
developed and operational).!°°

1011. However, in the circumstances, the Tribunal deems it appropriate to use for the purposes
of estimating the Claimants’ initial investment costs the figure that seems to be accepted
by both experts, namely EUR 52.2 million, which reflects the standard construction costs

for the Claimants’ PV Plants calculated pursuant to Order IET 1045/2014.

1012. In the absence of an alternative calculation of the Claimants’ actual greenfield investment
costs from the Respondent, the Tribunal believes that the standard installation costs
provide the best benchmark for estimating the cost that the Claimants could have
reasonably expected to recover. As acknowledged by Spain, the parameters that were
taken into account for the purposes of calculating the initial investment costs under Order
TET 1045/2014 were consistent with those that were taken into account when fixing the
FiT rates under RD 661/2007.'4"” Spain also emphasizes that the parameters of Order IET
1045/2014 are consistent with the 2000-2010 PER and the 2005-2010 PER.'4* The
Tribunal also notes the Respondent’s position on initial investment in The PV Investors

the Parameters’ [Order IET/1045/2014] are [...] representative of the real costs in the
market at the time of construction of the PV Plants”.'#°° Thus, the Tribunal concludes that
EUR 52.2 million must be used as the appropriate estimate for the Claimants’ initial

investment costs for the purposes of the IRR analysis.

1013. Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal has resolved the two major areas of disagreement
between the Parties regarding the calculation of the Claimants’ IRR, deciding that (i) the
“operational” IRR must be used and (ii) the Claimants’ initial investment costs must be

set at EUR 52.2 million.

1014. The Tribunal will now address some other areas of disagreement between the Parties that
manifested themselves in the course of the discussion on quantum and that appear to be
relevant for the analysis of the actual performance of the Claimants’ PV Plants.'*!°

tii. Operating costs

1015.Respondent’s expert, Econ One, argues that the historical operating and maintenance
costs of the Claimants’ PV Plants were “unreasonably high”.'*!! Therefore, Econ One
uses the operating costs as per the re-negotiated operating and maintenance

'412 The Claimants’ expert, Compass Lexecon, denies using the re-negotiated

agreements.

operating and maintenance agreements in the but-for scenario, as the re-negotiation was

the Claimants’ response to the Disputed Measures. '4!3

1016. Since the Tribunal’s task here is to assess the actual economic impact of the Disputed
Measures on the Claimants’ PV Plants, it seems appropriate to use the actual prices of the
operating and maintenance agreements. Therefore, the adjustment that resulted from the

re-negotiation must be applied.

iv. The tax effect of debt

1017. The Tribunal notes that both experts seem to be in agreement that the tax effect of debt
needs to be accounted for.'*!* The Tribunal thus directs the Parties and their experts to
endeavor to agree on a joint approach to account for the tax effect of debt pursuant to the

process outlined below at paragraphs 1019 and 1080.

v. Revisions of the reasonable rate of return

1018.Econ One assumed that no revision to the 7.398% rate of return guaranteed under the
New Regime would take place in 2020,'*!> whereas Compass Lexecon’s forecast was that
the New Regime rate would be reduced to 6.79% in the course of the 2020 revision. '4!
The Tribunal observes that the information about the revision of the 7.398% rate of return
is now publicly available. The Tribunal thus directs the Parties and their experts to take
into account the actual revision of the targeted reasonable rate of return to the extent

necessary to implement the process outlined below at paragraphs 1019 and 1080.

c. Conclusion on the economic impact of the Disputed Measures on the Claimants’
investments

1019. In view of the foregoing, the Parties are directed to provide a joint calculation of the IRR
of the Claimants’ PV Plants (the “Joint IRR Calculation”) that shall be based on the

following parameters:

(i) the Parties shall calculate an “operational” rather than an “exit” IRR, which will be
reflective of the profitability of the plants calculated throughout their entire

regulatory lifetime;

(ii) the Parties shall assume the initial investment costs in the amount of

EUR 52.2 million;

(iii) the Parties shall use the re-negotiated operating and maintenance contracts for the

purposes of calculating the Claimants’ historical operating costs;

333

(iv) the Parties shall endeavor to agree on acommon approach to calculating the tax effect

of debt; and

(v) the Parties shall apply (to the extent necessary) the actual revision of the 7.398% rate

of return.

1020. The Parties shall also attempt to agree on any other outstanding issues that may arise in

the course of the preparation of the Joint IRR Calculation.

1021. Based on the Tribunal’s conclusions in the preceding sections, the Tribunal, by majority,

holds as follows:

(i)

(ii)

In the event that the Joint IRR Calculation yields a rate of return equal or in excess
of 7%, the Respondent will not have any obligation to compensate the Claimants for
the effects of the New Regime on their investment, except for the “claw back”

retroactive element of the New Regime (see paragraphs 903-907 above).

As regards the “claw back” retroactive element of the New Regime, the Tribunal has
not been presented with the requisite information allowing it to calculate the effect
of the unlawful retroactive application of the Disputed Measures to the Claimants’
investments. Therefore, the Parties are directed to endeavor to agree on the amount

of compensation due to the retroactive element of the New Regime alone.

Income-based valuations of the Claimants’ damages
1. The Parties’ positions

The Claimants

1022.The Claimants request restitution of the regulatory framework that existed before the

Disputed Measures. In the alternative, the Claimants request compensation for the
decrease in fair market value (“FMV”) of their investments caused by the Disputed
Measures as per the standard of full reparation formulated by the PCIJ in the Chorzéw
Factory case.'*'7 In order to calculate the amount of compensation due, the Claimants’
quantum expert, Compass Lexecon implements the discounted cash flow (“DCF”)
approach and calculates the loss in value of the Claimants’ investments at two different
dates: 20 June 2014 (date of the alleged harm) and 31 May 2018 (used as a proxy for the
date of the award). The Claimants submit that the latter date should be used as the
valuation date. Compass Lexecon also performs an alternative valuation on the
assumption that the Claimants were only entitled to a return that was considered
reasonable at the time when the Special Regime was established. According to Compass

Lexecon, the Claimants suffered losses under the alternative scenario as well.

1023.The Claimants also request pre-award interest that must be compounded monthly and

established by reference to the Claimants’ cost of equity which Compass Lexecon
estimates at 7.58%. Post-award interest, in the Claimants’ view should be higher than

7.58% in order to ensure timely compliance with the award.

1024.The Claimants’ valuation of damages consists of the following elements: (i) the

Claimants’ lost historical cash flows incurred between November 2010'4'* and the
valuation date; and (ii) the loss to the Claimants’ equity and debt stakes as of the valuation

Beheer’s direct equity investment in Cross Retail, Sevilla Beheer’s direct equity investments in Cross Retail and
the Spanish Project Companies, and Sevilla Beheer’s participative loans provided to the Spanish Project
Companies.” See First Compass Lexecon Report, para. 64, fin. 66.

1025.In their Memorial, the Claimants argue that their damages must be valued as of 20 June
2014, the date of the publication of Order IET/1045/2014.'*?° This date represents “the
date of the harm”, when the Claimants allege to have lost 41% of the FMV of their stake
in the Spanish Project Companies.'*?! However, in their Reply, the Claimants argue that
their losses must be valued at the date of this Tribunal’s award and use 31 May 2018 as a
proxy for that date.'*?? The Claimants submit that the latter approach should be preferred
as it is more consistent with the principle of full reparation and enhances the accuracy of
the calculation by using updated production figures, market information and

macroeconomic data from 20 June 2014 to 31 May 2018.'4?3

1026. In order to assess the decrease in FMV of the Claimants’ investments as of 20 June 2014,
in its First Report, Compass Lexecon calculates the difference in the value of the
Claimants’ investments in the “But For” (had the Disputed Measures not existed) and
“Actual” (with the Disputed Measures in place) scenarios.'*4 In its calculations,
Compass Lexecon uses the DCF methodology implemented through two approaches: a)
the Free Cash Flows to the Firm (the “FCFF”) approach; and b) the Free Cash Flows to
the Equity (the “FCFE”) approach. !4?5

1027.In order to assess the Claimants’ losses prior to the valuation date of 20 June 2014,
Compass Lexecon calculates the difference in the value of the cash flows to the Claimants

as equity holders in the But For and Actual scenarios capitalized at the cost of equity as

of the valuation date.!47°

1029. An alternative calculation under the FCFE approach prepared by Compass Lexecon

estimates the lost value at EUR 20.5 million.'*?7

1030. In its calculations of the net present value of the cash flows, Compass Lexecon relies on

the following assumptions:

Claimants’ investment lifespan. Compass assumes that in both But For and
Actual scenarios, the plants operate until the end of their technical life, after
which they would be dismantled, that is a life of 30 years.

Revenues. In the But For scenario, Compass calculates revenues as the
product of electricity production and the unitary remuneration. To achieve
this, Compass projects the regulated tariff using the most recent inflation
forecast for Spain from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) minus 0.5%.
For the Actual scenario, Compass calculates the revenues as the sum of the
investment payment, the operating payment, and the revenues received from
the wholesale market as the plants receive no operating payment. In the Actual
scenario, Compass has also considered the claw-back payment intended for
repayment of the revenues collected during the Interim Period in excess of or
below the revenues that the plants were entitled to under the New Regime. As
part of the revenues, Compass has also considered the revenues for reactive
energy.

Electricity prices. In the Actual scenario, Compass has projected pool prices
for 2014- 2017 using future contracts traded in OMIP. Then, it assumes that

prices will converge to the variable costs of combined cycle gas turbine
generators in 2025, and that thereafter, prices will grow at the inflation rate.

427 First Compass Lexecon Report, para. 13.

337

In the case of the But For scenario, Compass uses the same prices, but
adjusting for the effect of the 7% Tariff Levy.

Inflation. Until 2019, Compass uses the inflation forecasts of the IMF. After
2019, as IMF forecasts are not available, Compass uses the European Central
Bank target inflation rate of 2%.

OPEX. Compass has projected the same operating expenses in both the But
For and Actual scenarios and has adjusted them pursuant to the inflation, with
the following exception (i) Compass has only considered the 7% Tariff Levy
in the Actual scenario; and (ii) certain of the plants operational maintenance
costs are different between the two scenarios.

Capital Expenditures. Compass projects no additional capital expenditures in
either the But For or the Actual for each project until the end of its useful life.

Financial Debt. Compass computes the present value of all scheduled debt
service at the company's cost of debt of 7.58%. Compass also assumes no
further issuance of debt.

Taxation. Compass calculates the income tax expense of the Claimants’
investments as 30%, the statutory Spanish income tax rate in force as of the
date of valuation.

Regulatory Rate of Return. In the Actual scenario, Compass adopts the
7.398% rate of return for the first regulatory period. For the following
regulatory periods, it has used the one-year average return of the ten-year
Spanish sovereign bond of 3.79% observed as up to 20 June 2014, plus 300
bps, which results in a pre-tax rate of return of 6.79%.'5

1031.Under the FCFF approach, Compass Lexecon uses the WACC of 6.03% as the discount

rate.“

1032. In order to calculate the cost of equity, one of the elements of the WACC,'*° Compass
Lexecon uses the Capital Asset Pricing Model (the “CAPM7”) and estimates the cost of
equity of 7.58%.'*3! The CAPM calculation is based on the following parameters: (i) a
risk-free rate of 1.61% representing the average yield on ten-year German sovereign
bonds during the 12 months prior to 20 June 2014;'**? (ii) the beta coefficient is estimated

at 0.76 on the basis of Bloomberg’s betas for RE companies adjusted to account for the

difference in the 12-month average yield on the ten-year Spanish and German euro-

denominated bonds between May 2013 and June 2014.!435

1033. The cost of debt, another element of the WACC, “measures the cost for an efficiently
financed firm to borrow funds to finance its operations and investments.”'**° Compass
Lexecon calculates the cost of debt at the rate of 5.79% (pre-tax) and 4.05% (post-tax) on

the basis of an approach that “adds the country risk and industry risk faced by lenders to
the risk-free rate.”!497

1034. Under the FCFE approach, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate. '49

1035.In its Second Report, Compass Lexecon updates the initial calculations in view of the
new valuation date chosen by the Claimants (31 May 2018) and the information that has
become available since the publication of the June 2014 Order. Compass Lexecon

summarizes the adjustments to the initial calculations as follows:

a) Financial and operational information: I have updated operational and
financial information for 2014-2017 based on the financial accounts of the
Spanish Project Companies.

b) Ministerial Order ETU/130/2017: this Order contains the remuneration
parameters for the second regulatory semi-period of 2017-2019, affecting the
plants’ remuneration under the actual scenario.

c) Historical generation: I have incorporated the actual volumes of energy
generated by the Claimants’ Plants up to and including 2017.

d) Electricity spot prices: I have added actual spot price information up to May
31, 2018. Thereafter, I apply the same forecasting methodology as in my First
Report using the futures contracts traded in OMIP (the Iberian Energy
Derivatives Exchange) for the May 2018-2022 period, assuming that prices

generators by 2025.

e) New macroeconomic information: I have included annual inflation
information up to and including 2017, and information on yields to maturity
on Spanish sovereign bonds up to May 31, 2018.

f) Corporate tax rates: I have updated the corporate tax rates to reflect the
changes in 2015 to 28% and 2016 to 25%.

g) Debt financing: I have incorporated in the actual scenario the fact that the
Claimants’ pre-paid the third-party debt outstanding, and in exchange issued
additional intercompany loans to the Spanish Project Companies.

h) Discount rate: I have updated the WACC and the cost of equity to

incorporate data available as of May 31, 2018. As of May 31, 2018, the
resulting WACC is 3.87% while the cost of equity is 5.36%."

1038. Additionally, the Claimants presented damages sensitivities to their assessment of
damages to account for the possibility where the Tribunal were to find that the limitation

of hours imposed by RDL 14/2010, the TVPEE, and the change to inflation factor

1041.In order to confirm the reasonableness of these calculations, Compass Lexecon
implements a relative valuation analysis “by comparing the EV/EBITDA multiple

implicit in the DCF valuation'* with the EV/EBITDA multiple of a sample of

'48 Compass Lexecon explains that “[tJhese implied multiples mean that in the but-for (actual) scenario a €1
million in EBITDA translates into approximately €10.2 (€11.2) million in enterprise value as of June 20, 2014.”
See First Compass Lexecon Report, para. 14, fn. 7.

transactions involving target PV companies operating in Spain.”'*4 On the basis of nine
comparable transactions, Compass Lexecon concludes that the Enterprise Value to
Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization Ratio (“EV/EBITDA”)
multiples from the DCF approach of 10.2x in the But For scenario and 11.5x in the Actual

scenario “fall within the range of multiples from comparable transactions.” !44°

1042.Compass Lexecon further argues that the selected transactions satisfy the comparability
criteria mentioned by Econ One.'**° In particular, all of the selected PV plants are subject
to the same regulatory regime and hence similar regulatory risks.'*7 As regards the
timeframe, Compass Lexecon submits that if market conditions (i.e., interest rates) have
not changed “there is no reason to believe that EV/EBITDA ratios would change
either.”!48 In respect of the other criteria, Compass Lexecon, inter alia, argues that the

EV/EBITDA ratio is used to control of the differences.'4?

1043. The Claimants have also provided an alternative DCF valuation, which is based on the
assumption that they were only entitled “to earn the returns that the Spanish regulator
considered reasonable” at the time of the implementation of RD 661/2007 and
RD 1578/2008.'*° Thus, in 2011, instead of introducing the Disputed Measures, the
Respondent would have reviewed the level of the FiT “so as to assure that plants would
not obtain more than their respective allowed rate of return.”!**! Compass Lexecon

accordingly calculates an alternative “but-for FiT” relying on the rates of return that were
1452

 

considered as reasonable by the CN!

1046.Compass Lexecon expressed the following criticisms regarding Econ One’s Adjusted
Present Value (“APV”) approach. Compass Lexecon states that the APV method is also
a variant of the income approach. !495 However, unlike the FCFF or the FCFE, the use of

the APV approach requires to separately estimate the expected probability of bankruptcy

4453 Second Compass Lexecon Report, paras. 152-154, Table 11.
454 Second Compass Lexecon Report, para. 154, Table 12.

344

and associated costs.'*°° According to Compass Lexecon, the APV approach thus
introduces a high level of subjectivity in the valuation analysis, as the probability of
bankruptcy and its associated costs cannot be estimated directly.'4*7 Compass Lexecon
adds that Econ One “does not even attempt to value either the probability of bankruptcy

or the bankruptcy costs associated to the leverage used to compute the tax shield.”!4*

1047.Compass Lexecon also disagrees with the need to apply the illiquidity discount on the
grounds that prior to the Disputed Measures, the Spanish Project Companies did not have
any major sources of cash flow volatility, as the tariffs, production and costs were
reasonably foreseeable and steady.'*° Compass Lexecon also argues that if the
application of an illiquidity discount had been indeed necessary, Spain would have
incorporated it into its calculation of the allowed pre-tax rate of return, which it did
not.'4°° Compass Lexecon argues that Econ One’s estimates of the illiquidity discount are
not supported by market data. For example, the time between announcement and closure
of a transaction in renewable assets was on average 3.5 months prior to the Disputed
Measures and 4 months between June 2014-May 2018, which was normal. Hence, no

illiquidity discount is necessary. '4°!

1048. Professor Spiller also criticizes the method that Econ One uses to calculate the illiquidity
discount. According to Professor Spiller, the Longstaff Method can only be used as a
proxy for a maximum estimate.'** Professor Spiller equally finds unconvincing the
assumption that in the but-for scenario the Claimants’ possibility to find buyers would be
reduced due to the Tariff Deficit. Professor Spiller contends that such an assumption
contradicts market data, according to which the transaction activity was stable despite the

growing Tariff Deficit.'4°

1049.Compass Lexecon accounts for risk in the discount rate (see paragraph 1032 above).
Specifically, Compass Lexecon uses the CAPM, which “postulates that the opportunity
cost of equity is equal to the return representing a company’s risk.”!4°t Compass Lexecon
contends that its calculations capture the risks affecting the market as a whole (via the
risk-free rate and market risk premium), the specific risks faced by RE generators (via the
beta parameter) and the risks related to investing in Spain (via the country risk

premium).'46

1050. Finally, Compass Lexecon criticizes Econ One’s risk adjustment on the grounds that: (i) it
introduces in the but-for scenario the probability of retroactive changes to the FiT scheme
—the very measure in dispute; (ii) Econ One provides no support for the conclusion that
in the but-for scenario the risk of negative changes should be higher than in the Actual
scenario; (iii) in fact, due to the Respondent’s measures, the regulatory risks have only
increased.'#°° At the Hearing, Professor Spiller from Compass Lexecon also stated that
“there is a fundamental principle in finance, in valuation, which is: you don’t double-
count the risk”, “[e]ither you put it in the cash flows or you put it in the discount rate, but

not in both.”!47

b. The Respondent

1051.The Respondent seems to be in agreement with the Claimants that the standard of full
reparation (Chorzow Factory) applies in the present case. At the same time, the

Respondent argues that the Tribunal “should be careful to apply it properly and

consistently with the rest of its findings and avoid overcompensating the Claimants.”!4*

1052.The Respondent criticizes both valuation dates selected by the Claimants, without
proposing any alternative date.'4 The Respondent argues that, in any event, an ex-ante

date (20 June 2014) is the appropriate one, as it is “more consistent with the only legal

and attribution, and with the principles of equality between the parties and legal

1053. Econ One calculates the Claimants’ losses using the APV approach, a variant of the DCF
method.!*7! Econ One explains that the main difference between the APV approach and
the FCFF and FCFE approaches “is their treatment of debt”!*””, in particular, the FCFF
and FCFE approaches implemented by Compass Lexecon are based on the assumption of
a constant ratio of debt to equity, whereas the APV approach allows to account for tax

savings that the Claimants can make by deducting interest on debt and thus have declining

levels of debt over time. !47%

1054. Econ One summarizes its corrections to Compass Lexecon’s valuation of the Claimants’

damages as at 20 June 2014 as follows:

(i) In the historical period, we assume that transitory limits on operating hours
for which financial incentives can be received apply in both the [Actual and
But For scenarios, according to Royal Decree 14/2010].

(ii) We assume in the [Actual scenario] a remuneration consistent with [Royal
Decree] 413/2014 and Order IET 1045/2014, without speculating about
contingent future reasonable rate of return revisions.

(iii) We correct the inflation rate projections. [...] We project long-term
inflation using an average of three long-term inflation forecasts. Based on
these sources, we project long-term inflation in Spain at 1.6%.

(iv) We correct the projected [operating and maintenance] costs in [the Actual
and But For scenarios] to reflect the lower prices of the renegotiated
agreements.

(v) We apply the expected corporate tax rate in Spain as of [20 June 2014].
[...] in 2014 Spain reduced the corporate tax rate to 28%, effective January
2015, and to 25% effective January 2016. These reforms were announced in
June 2014, so they were known as of the ex ante Valuation Date. We also
correct Compass Lexecon’s unlevered income tax expense calculation for
Mahora, Villar de Cafias, and Ronda in the “But For” Scenario.

(vi) We use an unlevered cost of equity of 5.05%. We apply this discount rate
to the future operating cash flows of the PV Plants in our APV approach.

(vii) We assume that the bank debt prepayment occurs in [the Actual and But
For scenarios]. In 2017, Claimants paid their third-party debt outstanding and
replaced it with intercompany debt. Compass Lexecon assumes this occurs in
the [Actual] Scenario only.

(viii) We account for the tax effect of debt. To properly value the PV Plants,
we incorporate the value of the tax benefit of interest payments on loans that
can be expected over the PV Plants’ useful life.

(ix) Compass Lexecon does not account for regulatory risk in its model. It is
inappropriate to assume that the regulations affecting the revenue of the PV
Plants in the [But For scenario] would be frozen in perpetuity, as Compass
Lexecon does. We conclude that the [Disputed] Measures have reduced the
tisk applicable to the PV Plants relative to the [But For scenario] and,
therefore, the risk adjustment in the [Actual scenario] must be lower than in
the “But For” Scenario. We apply a risk adjustment to the revenues of the PV
Plants of 2% in the [Actual scenario] and 10% in the “But For” Scenario.

(x) Compass Lexecon does not account for the lack of liquidity of the PV
plants in its model. Since the PV Plants are illiquid physical assets, the value
of the equity interests must be adjusted for their lack of liquidity. To account
for the lack of liquidity of the PV Plants, we follow Longstaff’s options pricing
method. We also show that after the enactment of the Measures, the market
for renewable energy assets in Spain has become more liquid. We apply an
illiquidity discount of 18% in the [Actual scenario] and of 26% in [the But For
scenario].

(xi) We correct Compass Lexecon’s working capital calculations in the [But
For Scenario]. In the [But For scenario], Compass Lexecon incorrectly relies

on operating expenditure values from the PV Plants’ [Actual scenario] to
model working capital.'4”*

1056. Econ One argues that the Spanish Project Companies are illiquid assets (as they are not
publicly traded) and therefore a discount must be applied in order to account for their
inability to be readily converted into cash.'47® Econ One estimates a discount for

illiquidity of 18% in the Prevailing Scenario and of 26% in the but-for scenario.'*7”

1057. According to Econ One, Compass Lexecon’s application of the risk is insufficient. Econ
One argues that the CAPM-based model only measures the risks that affect the market as
a whole (e.g., “the risk of an economic recession”), while not capturing any company-
specific risks (e.g., “the flooding risk of an oil refinery located near the coast”).!4”8 Econ
One argues that the main company-specific risk of a PV plant — the risk of an unfavorable

“regulatory revision” to revenues — is on the revenue side that thus must be accounted as

 

part of the income calculations, instead of the discount rate.'*”? Econ One also insists that

in the Actual scenario the risk adjustment should be larger than in the but-for scenario, as
in the former the chances of a downward revision were higher than in the latter. 1480 Thus,

Econ One applies a 10% downward adjustment to the Claimants’ revenues in the but-for

scenario and a 2% downward adjustment in the Actual scenario. '44!

1058. Econ One summarizes its corrections to Compass Lexecon’s valuation of the Claimants’

damages as at 31 May 2018 as follows:

(i) In the historical period, we assume that transitory limits on operating hours
for which financial incentives can be received apply in both the [Actual and
But For scenarios], according to Royal Decree 14/2010].

(ii) We assume a standard facility reasonable rate of return of 7.398%, i.e.,
with no downward adjustments in 2020 or thereafter.

(iii) We correct the inflation rate projections.

(iv) We correct the projected [operating and maintenance] costs in the [Actual
and But For scenarios].

(v) We correct Compass Lexecon’s double counting of the [7% TVPEE].

(vi) We remove non-recurring cost categories from the non-renegotiated CPI
driven OPEX from Compass Lexecon’s projection.

(vii) We use an unlevered cost of equity of 3.59% in our APV approach.

(viii) We assume that the bank debt prepayment occurs in the [Actual and But
For scenarios]. We account for the tax effect of debt.

(ix) We apply a 2% risk adjustment to the revenues of the PV Plants in the
[Actual scenario] and a 10% risk adjustment in the [But For] Scenario.

(x) We apply an illiquidity discount of 18% in the [Actual scenario] and 26%
in the [But For] Scenario.

(xi) We correct Compass Lexecon’s working capital calculations in the [But
For] Scenario.'4*?

1060. Finally, Econ One submits that the comparable transaction analysis implemented by
Compass Lexecon to check the reasonableness of the DCF valuations is generally
unreliable and in any event “fails to adhere to basic criteria for comparability.”!4*4 In
particular, Econ One asserts that Compass Lexecon “ignores the technology, location,
and the regulatory regime of each plant being sold” and that the selected transactions
“occur in a very broad time frame and include the sale of plants with varying installed

291485

capacity.

1061.Econ One further contends that Compass Lexecon’s alternative calculation'**° suffers

from flaws similar to those that can be found in the principal valuation.'4*” In particular,

Econ One lists the following alleged errors:

(i) it overestimates the reasonable rate of return in the [But For] Scenario;

(ii) it underestimates the reasonable rate of return in the [Actual scenario] as
of the beginning of the next Regulatory Period, 2020;

(iii) it double-counts the 7% [TVPEE] in its estimated operating expense in
the [Actual scenario];

(iv) it excludes the operating hour cap for the Mahora, Villar de Cafias, and
Ronda PV Plants for 2011 through 2013; and

(v) it uses an incorrect tax rate to calculate its alternative FiT.'“**

1062. In particular, regarding the tax rate used to calculate the alternative FiT, Econ One argues

2.

that companies generally do not pay the marginal tax rate of 30% used by Compass
Lexecon due to a variety of tax deductions existing in Spain, including depreciation,
investment tax credits, interest on shareholder loans, and interest on third-party debt.!489
Once those deductions are taken into account, the effective tax rate is around 12% for all
companies.'*°° Econ One further argues that over their useful life RE projects “pay
relatively little corporate tax” and that it tends to be higher in the projects’ later years as
the tax benefits of depreciation and debt diminish. '49! Thus, Econ One concludes that for
a typical RE project the effective discounted'*” tax rate is about 5.8%.'4?? Finally, Econ
One asserts that if the above flaws of the Claimants’ alternative calculation are corrected,
the valuation will show that the Claimants have not suffered economic damages as a result
of the Disputed Measures.'** In its corrected valuation Econ One assumes the reasonable

rate of return of 7% for all of the Claimants’ Plants.

The Tribunal’s analysis

1063.In view of the fact that it cannot be determined at this stage whether the Disputed

Measures (with the exception of the “claw back” retroactive element of the New Regime)
violated the ECT (see paragraphs 1019-1020 above), the Tribunal, by majority, reserves

its decision regarding compensation and interest.

a.

Tax gross-up

The Parties’ positions

The Claimants

1064. The Claimants request the Tribunal to award their claim for gross-up “to reflect the taxes

payable on an award of damages” and to ultimately achieve full reparation.'4°° The
Claimants submit that depending on the recipient of the payment of the award, they will

be subject to corporate taxation either in Spain or in the Netherlands. '4°°

1065. The Claimants posit that in Spain the award will be treated as taxable income subject to

the Spanish corporate income tax (the “CIT”) at a rate of 25%.'4°” In support, the
Claimants refer to a tax opinion provided by EY Abogados titled “Spanish CIT treatment
of a compensation payable by the Kingdom of Spain to the Spanish Project Companies
as a result of an ECT arbitration proceeding.”'“°* The Claimants add that for the sake of
fairness they have applied in their tax gross-up calculations the impact derived from the
offset of carry-forward tax losses generated in previous years (subject to the limitations

established under the Spanish CIT law).'4%

1066.The Claimants submit that Sevilla Beheer is a Dutch taxpayer and the award will be

subject to the Dutch CIT at a rate of 25% as an ordinary taxable profit.!°°°

1067. In response to the Respondent’s counter-arguments, the Claimants contend that they will

not be able to benefit from the “participation exception” in the Netherlands as Sevilla

Beheer has “a right of its own” under the ECT, according to the Dutch tax authorities.'°°!

The Claimants further assert that although Sevilla’s right is connected with its

shareholdings in the Spanish Project Companies, “this is not sufficient for it to qualify as

an ‘exempt benefit’ from a qualifying participation.” In support of this contention, the

Claimants refer to Dutch jurisprudence.'°°? The Claimants thus conclude as follows:

The Tribunal should therefore award damages, including a tax gross-up of an
appropriate amount, in order to achieve full reparation of the harm suffered by
Sevilla Beheer B.V. as Claimant. As for the Spanish tax gross-up, the
Claimants have offset the carried-forward tax losses currently available.
Therefore, the additional amount requested only refers to the Dutch CIT
liability that would imply a cash-out payment for Sevilla Beheer BV based on
the current carry-forward position, after applying such carried-forward tax
losses.!5

1068. In response to the Respondent’s jurisdictional objection, the Claimants submit that the
Tribunal is competent to decide on the tax gross-up issue as it is unrelated to the question

of whether any of the Disputed Measures is a taxation measure under Article 21 of the

ECT. 1595

b. The Respondent

1069. The Respondent submits that pursuant to Article 21 of the ECT the Tribunal has no
jurisdiction to hear the tax gross-up claim.'*° In the alternative, the Respondent argues
that the tax gross-up claim is unfounded for the following reasons. First, Spain cannot be
held responsible for the decision of another sovereign State (the Netherlands) to impose
any taxes on the Claimants.!>°” In support of its position, the Respondent refers to Rusoro

v. Venezuela where the tribunal made the following observation:

In its Memorial and Reply, Rusoro sought indemnity in respect of any double
taxation of the Award that may rise in Canada (or elsewhere), to the extent
this liability would not have arisen had Venezuela observed its international
commitments under the Treaty. This claim seems to have been abandoned in
Rusoro’s Post Hearing Brief. In any case, the claim lacks merit. Any tax
liability arising under Canadian tax laws (or from any other fiscal regime,
other than the Venezuelan), does not qualify as consequential loss arising from

1070. Second, the Respondent submits that it is not responsible for the “acts or private decisions

1071. Third, the Respondent argues that any future award in this arbitration will be exempt

pursuant to the “participation exemption.”'!>!°

1072.Fourth, the Respondent submits that the tax gross-up claim is speculative and

uncertain,!>!!

2. The Tribunal’s analysis

1073. The Tribunal dismisses the Respondent’s jurisdictional objection regarding the tax gross-
up claim under Article 21(1) of the ECT, because this provision is not concerned with the
issue of awarding a tax gross-up payment on the amount of compensation due as a result

of a breach of the ECT.'5!

1074. On the merits, the Tribunal is not convinced that it would be appropriate to award any tax
gross-up payment on the sums that may be taxable in the Netherlands. As it was observed
by the Rusoro v. Venezuela tribunal, “[a]ny tax liability arising under [the home State’s]
tax laws (or from any other fiscal regime, other than the [respondent State]), does not
qualify as consequential loss arising from [the respondent’s] breach of the Treaty and

does not engage [the respondent's] liability.”!5!> The Tribunal also finds that the evidence

Claimants provided in support of their tax gross-up claim to be insufficient. In light of

Claimants’ failure to suffi

 

‘iently substantiate their tax gross-up claim based on the Dutch

CIT, the Claimants must be considered as not having met their burden of proof. In any

event, their claim must be rejected due to the lack of a showing of the requisite

causation. !5!4

1075. As regards the tax gross-up claim in relation to the Spanish CIT, the Tribunal observes
that the tax opinion of EY Abogados submitted by the Claimants is based on a number of
assumptions regarding future events. For example, at paragraph 3.5 the tax opinion
mentions the following assumption “the Spanish Project Companies do not have material
tax credits pending to be applied nor will generate tax credits in the financial year of
accrual of the Compensation and/or of the Compensation being due.”!*!5 Based on this

and other assumptions, EY Abogados conclude as follows:

4.20. Once the Spanish Project Companies have determined their CIT taxable
base, as partially offset by the corresponding carry-forward tax losses (if
applicable), the CIT tax due should be obtained by applying the ordinary CIT
rate.

4.21. In this regard, according to Article 29 of the Spanish CIT Act, the
ordinary Spanish CIT rate is of 25%.

4.22. Therefore, the Spanish Project Companies should apply a 25% rate over
their final CIT taxable base to obtain the CIT due which could be reduced if
tax credits were applicable. However, as assumed under 3.5 above, no material
tax credits are available to the Spanish Project Companies.'*!®

1076. This tax opinion confirms the Tribunal’s view that the extent of the Claimants’ tax

liabilities under Spanish law cannot be established with sufficient certainty at this

moment. The tax opinion also rightly states that it “does not provide assurance that a court

or other tribunal, or any relevant tax authority, will not form a different conclusion.”!5!7

1077.The Tribunal joins the long line of decisions that found similar tax gross-up claims

uncertain and speculative.'>!*

1078. Therefore, the Tribunal dismisses the Claimants’ tax gross-up claim.

IX. OPERATIVE PART
1080. For these reasons, the Tribunal decides as follows:
(i) Unanimously, that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Parties and the subject-matter of

this dispute with the exception that it has no jurisdiction to determine whether the TVPEE

breached Spain’s obligations under the ECT;

(ii) Unanimously, that the Respondent breached Article 10(1) of the ECT to the extent that it
applied the New Regime retroactively to the remuneration already received by the

Claimants’ PV Plants under RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008;

(iii) By majority, that the Respondent has breached Article 10(1) of the ECT to the extent
(if any) that the New Regime does not provide a reasonable return to the Claimants’ PV

Plants at a rate of 7% after taxes; and
(iv) By majority, that all other claims under Article 10(1) of the ECT are dismissed.

1081.The procedure to be followed by the Parties for the purposes of quantifying damages
(if any) resulting from the majority’s findings on liability and the principles of quantum

will be set out by the Tribunal in a separate procedural order.

1082. The issues of damages (if any) and costs are reserved for the Award.
