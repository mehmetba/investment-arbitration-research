B. Overview of Other Relevant Entities Involved

1. “AES Entities”
5. The dispute involves various entities affiliated to Claimants. These include in particular:

1.1 Entities outside Kazakhstan

6. AES Suntree Power Limited (hereinafter “AES Suntree”) is a company wholly owned
by AES Corp and incorporated under the laws of Ireland. From 1997-2007 it held full
ownership of and managed AES Ekibastuz*.

It was disputed between the Parties whether AES Suntree was owned by AES Corp at all
relevant times® and its history of ownership is therefore summarized below:

(i) On 2 April 1996, Fernlock Limited (later named ‘AES Suntree’) was a
company incorporated under the laws of Ireland with a registered address at 29,
Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin 2, Ireland. At that time, its sole shareholders were
Earlsfort Nominees Limited and Earlsfort Registrars Limited with a total
issued capital of STGE 2 (hereinafter “the Original Shareholders”®.

 

(ii) On 20 June 1996, the name of Fernlock Limited was changed to “AES Suntree
Power Limited” by special resolution of Fernlock Limited’.

On_22 July 1996, upon approval of the Minister of Enterprise and
Employment, this change was registered with the Irish Registrar of
Companies’.

(iii) As of 31 December 1997, the Original Shareholders were still the holders of
the only issued shares of AES Suntree’.

 

According to Claimants, AES Electric Limited (hereinafter “AES Electric”), a
wholly owned subsidiary of AES Corp, was the beneficial shareholder of AES
Suntree at all relevant times from 22 May 1997 onwards, including 23 July
1997 to 28 July 1997 inclusive. Claimants further assert that they provided
Respondent with the documents establishing this ownership on 3 January
2012”.

In this regard, section 8 of the “Notes to the Account” forming part of AES
Suntree’s financial report for the period from 2 April 1996 to 31 December
1996 stated as follows:"!

“The company is owned 70% by AES Electric Limited and 30% by

Suntree Power BV. Financial statements of AES Electric Limited may be

obtained from Burleigh House, 17-19 Worple Way, Richmond, Surrey,

TWIO0 6AG.

The ultimate parent company is The AES Corporation, a company

incorporated in the State of Delaware, U.S.A. Copies of the ultimate

parent company’s financial statements can be obtained from the Securities

and Exchange Commission, 450 5th Street NW. Washington DC 20549,

USA.”

   

On 23 January 1998, 99,000 shares of AES Suntree, which were part of the
99,998 unissued shares were cancelled. Out of the remaining 998 unissued
shares, 699 were issued to AES Electric Limited and 299 to a company called
“Suntree Power B.V.”!?. In addition, two other issued shares remained allotted
to the Original Shareholders’.

On 19 August 1999, Earlsfort Registrars Limited transferred its sole share to
Suntree Power B.V., bringing the total number of share held by Suntree Power
B.V. to 300".

On 13 September 1999, Suntree Power B.V. transferred its 300 shares to AES
Electric Limited”.

On 30 November 2000, Earlsfort Nominees Limited transferred its sole share
in AES Suntree to AES Electric!®. Therewith, AES Electric became the sole
shareholder of the 1,000 issued shares of AES Suntree.

In its Rejoinder, Respondent accepted that AES Corp. was the ultimate owner of the
relevant AES Entities, including AES Suntree, throughout the period in question'”,

C. Chronological Overview of the Background of the Dispute

The following presentation is summary in nature. It is not meant to be a comprehensive
overview of the facts of the dispute. It sets out only the main facts that the Arbitral
Tribunal considered relevant for its decision. Where necessary, further issues of fact are
discussed in the next section “The Law” (II).

I. The Context

. From its declaration of independence on 16 December 1991 up until the mid-1990s,

Kazakhstan was in dire need of restructuring its electricity sector to prevent it from
collapsing. To achieve this objective, the Government sought out foreign investment
through a process of privatization of its state-owned power generation companies™ 6.

. In the mid-1990s, Kazakhstan undertook a series of legal reforms to facilitate and attract

foreign investment. A report of the World Bank issued on 1 December 1999 (Technical
Paper No. 451 “Privatization of the Power and Natural Gas Industries in Hungary and
Kazakhstan”) found that in 1996 Kazakhstan had to attract private investors in order to
prevent the electricity sector from collapsing’.

In 1995, Kazakhstan started a reform of the power industry with the intent to privatize it.

On 28 July 1995, Resolution No. 1033 on the “Reorganization of the power industry
management of the Republic of Kazakhstan” was passed **, which created NES
Kazakhstanenergo (see above para. 13) with the aim to restructure the various state-
owned power sector entities. At the regional level, new “energos” were formed to
handle the regional distribution system™.

On 28 February 1996, Resolution No. 246 “On the Programme for Privatization and
Restructuring of the State-Owned Property in the Republic of Kazakhstan for 1996-
1998” was issued. This Resolution laid down Kazakhstan’s plans for the power
industry, in particular its intention to corporatize state-owned entities prior to
privatization, and included the transformation of regional generators into independent
joint stock companies for the purposes of their privatization“ :

On 30 May 1996, Resolution No. 663 “Concerning the Programme of Privatization and
Restructuring of the Electric Energy Sector” was issued (hereinafter referred to as the
“Restructuring Resolution val

a

se

(i) According to Claimants, this Resolution sought to create the conditions for the
development of a competitive wholesale market for electricity generation by 1998,
by, inter alia, opening the door to privatizations and providing as follows”?

“ The sector of electric energy will have the features of monopoly and
i (the ion of hi; li and I

electricity networks, activities associated with transportation of electric

and thermal energy) shall be regulated by the state, and the competitive

elements (manufacturers of the electric energy) shall be regulated by the

market itself.”

(ii) According to Respondent, the statements made in this Restructuring Resolution were
nothing more than statements of intent that it would seek to develop a market based
on competitive principles

In the summer and autumn 1996, various further Resolutions were adopted regarding the
restructuring of the electricity market in Kazakhstan in view of its privatization,
including — inter alia — (i) Resolution No. 929 “On the State Regulatory Commission on
Electrical Power Generation”*’, (ii) Resolution No. 1188 “On Certain Measures to
Restructure the Management of the Energy System of the Republic of Kazakhstan’”*°,
(iii) Resolution No. 652 “On Certain Measures to Restructure the Management of the
Energy System of the Republic of Kazakhstan”.

These reforms continued throughout the year 1997, including — inter alia — (i)
Resolution No. 369 “On Holding an International Tender To Sell the Irtysh Cascade of
Hydroelectric Stations”“*, and (ii) the “Program for the Further Development of the
Electrical Energy Market in 1997-2002”

2. The Investment

On 4 July. 1996, AES Suntree acquired the newly privatized Ekibastuz Plant (see above
para. Bi).

On 14 July 1997, AES Suntree was announced the winner of a tender process relating to
the concession of two HPs and the sale of four combined heat and power plants

On 23 July 1997, Kazakhstan, acting through its Department for the Management of
State Property and Assets of the Ministry of Finance (hereinafter “DAMPSA”) and the
Privatization Department of the Ministry of Finance (hereinafter “DP”), entered into an
agreement with AES Suntree entitled: “Agreement relating to the Sale and Purchase of

Companies and the Grant of a Concession in Respect of the Assets of Two (2)
Hydroelectric Companies” with amendments of 2 October 1997 (hereinafter referred to
as the “Altai Agreement”).

Through this Agreement, AES Suntree acquired 100% of the voting shares in (i) four
combined heat and power plants, among which were the UK and Sogra CHPs (see above
para. 8(ii)), (ii) and a 20-year concession in relation to the Hydros (see above
para. 8(ii))*4).> The Altai Agreement was later subject to some modifications in 2006
regarding payment provisions”.

On 28 July 1997, Mr. Morgan, a Director of AES Suntree, gave notice by letter to Mr.
Kalmurzaev, Director of the DAMPSA, and Mr. Utepov, Director of the DP, that AES
Suntree had assigned its rights under the Altai Agreement to Tau Power with effect as of
29 July 1997. This notice was counter-signed by Mr. Kalmurzaev and Mr. Utepov, who
also affixed the seal of the DAMPSA and the DP”.

On_1 October_1997, UK Hydro and Shulba Hydro entered into two additional
agreements with Kazakhstan (represented by the Department for the Management of
State Property and Assets of the Ministry of Finance) and JSC UK and JSC Shulba
respectively, providing for the transfer of all the hydroelectric concession assets and
rights of the state-owned entities JSC UK and JSC Shulba to UK Hydro and Shulba
Hydro respectively™*.

On 2 October 1997, through signing a “Deed of Adherence” between Kazakhstan
(represented by the DAMPSA and the DP), Tau Power, JSC UK and JSC Shulba, the
latter two companies became parties to the Altai Agreement”.

On the same day, an “Assignment Agreement relating to Energy Supply Contracts with
the Electricity Distribution Networks as well as other Contracts Supporting
AltaiEnergo’s Business” (hereinafter referred to as “Assignment Agreement”) was
further passed between JSC AltaiEnergo and AES Kazakhstan, through which
AltaiEnergo assigned its contracts with the distribution networks and other thereto
relating supporting contracts to AES Kazakhstan.

On _ 15 October 1997, furthermore, two “Asset Sale and Purchase Agreements” were
passed between JSC Sogra and Sogra CHP, and between JSC UK and UK CHP

 

Exh. C-1 to C3 and Exh. R-6.
These amendments consisted in a Deed of Adherence according to which JSC Shulba and JSC UK, the holders of
the concession assets, became parties to the Altai Agreement (see below para. 32) and an Assignment Agreement
(see below para. 33).

CL Memo 28.04.2011, para. 74; RSP C-Memo 7.10.11, para. 109.

It appears that Claimants later on sold two of the four combined heat and power plants (i.e. JSC Leninogorsk
TETS and JSC Semipalatinsk TETS) in October 2002 (CL Memo 28.04.2011, para. 76 fn. 52).

(hereinafter referred to as the “1999 Electricity Law 776) establishing the “economic,
legal and organizational bases of state policy in the field of generation, transmission,
distribution, and consumption of electrical capacity, electricity, and heat” (para. 1) and
that its main objective was to organize state management in the electric power industry
so as “to ensure that consumers’ demand for power was satisfied to the maximum extent
and that the right of electricity and heat market participants are protected, by way of
maintaining the reliable and stable functioning of the electric power complex of the
Republic of Kazakhstan based on competition and unity of ” (Article 3(1)).
One of the particularities of this law was that it implemented the right of power
generators to independently enter into contracts with users and electricity distribution
companies for the sale of power (Article 14).

On 30 April 1999, the Agency for the Regulation of Natural Monopolies and Protection
of Competition (hereinafter referred to as “ARNM”) adopted by Order No. 25-OD the

On 25 April 2001, Kazakhstan adopted the “Rules for Forming and Keeping the
Official Register of Market Entities with a Dominant (Monopolistic) Position in a
Particular Commodity Market” by Order No. 86-OD (hereinafter referred to as
“Order No. 86-OD”*'), which repealed the previous system in place under the
Original Competition Law, in particular Order NO. 25-OD (see above para. 39).

On 9 July 2004, the “Law On the Electric Power Industry” came into force, the
purpose of which was to “regulate social relations emerging in the process of
generation, transmission and usage of electric and heating energy”. According to
Claimants, this law provided that the wholesale electricity market prices were set
by power generators and the retail market prices were set by energy supplying
companies, such as Shygys®.

On_10 September 2004, Kazakhstan issued the “Rules for Organizing and
Conducting Centralized trading in Electric Power in the Republic of Kazakhstan”,
as amended and supplemented on 26 June 2006 (hereinafter referred to as “2004
Electric Power Law”**), fixing specific percentages of the amounts of electricity

4.3 Impact of the New Legislation on Claimants’ Business

42. It is Claimants’ case that under the privatization regulations implemented in the wake of
1996 and the Natural Monopolies Law, the Hydros and the CHPs were no longer
classified as natural monopolies and were thus able to enter into bilateral contracts with
customers for the sale of power at freely-negotiated tariffs (though they had to pay the
state-owned distribution companies a tariff for the use of the electricity networks and
KEGOC for the use of the national transmission grid).® The bulk of these sales between
1998 and 2001 were made to AES Kazakhstan which, in turn, on-sold power to
customers. While Claimants consider that their modus operandi was consistent with
their rights and legitimate expectations under the Altai Agreement and the Restructuring
Resolution, the legislation promulgated between 2001 and 2008 affected Claimants’
business in various ways”.

43.

a

In summary, the impact of the new legislation on Claimants’ business was threefold:

44. The first direct impact of the new competition law regime was the placing of some of the
AES entities on the Monopolies Register as dominant market entities: °

(i) On 17 May 2001, and by Order No. 63, the Competition Agency placed the
Hydros of the EKO plant on the Monopolies Register for the period of 2001-
2002”,

(ii) On 29 July 2002, and by Order No. 75, the Competition Agency placed the
Hydros on the Monopolies Register for the period 2002-2003 3.

(iii) On 6 May 2003, and by Order No. 63-OD, the Competition Agency placed
UK CHP on the Monopolies Register for the period of 2003-2004” .

(iv) On 25 May 2004, and by Order No. 89-OD, the Competition Agency placed
the Hydros and UK CHP on the Monopolies Register with effect as of its date
of signature for an unspecified duration on the basis that those entities had an
aggregate share in excess of 70%°>. Pursuant to this order, fixed tariffs were
set for UK HPP and UK CHP”.

(v) On 14 December 2004, and by Order No. 189-OD, the Competition Agency
placed AES Shygys Energy on the Monopolies Register with effect as of its
date of signature for an unspecified duration on the basis that it had a market
of over 35% in the EKO”.

* These distribution and transmission tariffs continued to be set by ARNM (CL Memo 28.04.2011, para 94 fn. 74).
% CL Memo 28.04.2011, para. 94.

(vi)

On 18 June 2008, by Order No. 132-OD, the Kazakh authorities placed the
Hydros and CHPs on the Monopolies Register with effect as of 18 June 2008
for an unspecified duration”. In September 2008, pursuant to this order, the
EKO and Pavlodar Inspection carried out an analysis of the retail market for
electricity in the EKO and concluded that the AES Entities had a dominant
share exceeding 80%”.

By 10 December 2008, by virtue of Order No. 388-OD, Sogra CHP in a
group with UK CHP, UK Hydro, Shulba Hydro and AES Ekibastuz were
added on to the Monopolies Register with effect as of its date of signature for
an unspecified duration!”°.

45. By the end of 2008, most of the AES Entities had been placed on the Monopatirs
Register, based on the orders made pursuant to the 2001 and 2006 Competition Laws’?

46.

a

The second indirect impact was the imposition by the Competition Agency of fines and
other penalties on the AES entities with regard to alleged violations of competition law
and/or abuse of their market position. These orders mainly concerned the organization
of the business among the various AES entities and in particular the use of a trading
company to centralize the sales of electricity: '

(ii)

(iii)

On 4 March 2004, the Competition Agency issued an “Opinion on Concerted
Acting by UK Hydro and AES Kazakhstan LLP and the Resulting Monopolistic
Incomes Derived by AES Kazakhstan LLP”, according to which AES
Kazakhstan should — inter alia — terminate its alleged concerted acting with
other AES entities and transfer the income derived in January-February 2004
from electricity rates increases as a result of such concerted action!

 

On 12 March and 12 April 2004, the Competition Agency issued Orders No.
23 and No. 30 requiring, inter alia, that the AES Entities stop using the trading
company AES Kazakhstan, stop creating obstacles to the market entry of other
participants and transfer to the state budget the monopoly earnings and gains as
received by it in January-February of 2004 as a result of the anticompetitive
collaboration (collusive trade) or anticompetitive practices'™*,

On 16 March 2004, The Competition Agency issued Order No. 16 in relation
to UK Hydro, finding that it entered into concerted actions with AES
Kazakhstan, which led to an increase in electricity prices, and ordered UK
Hydro to pay a fine’,

and 8 against the Hydros, according to which certain agreements between the
Hydros and Nurenergo breached the 2001 and 2006 Competition Law and
ordering the Hydros to terminate all agreements with Nurenergo and to pay the
state approximately USD 23 million’.

On 3 April 2007, the Competition Agency issued Order No. 15, ordering Sogra
CHP to, inter alia, terminate the contract with Nurenergo and cease alleged
violations of the antimonopoly legislation with regard to “concentration of

economic activity”!””.

On 13 June 2007, the Competition Agency issued Order No. 16, ordering UK
CHP to, inter alia, stop its alleged ‘concerted actions’ with other AES Entities
and fixing of pricing terms, discontinue its contract with Nurenergo and
transfer to Kazakhstan the “monopolistic profits” it was said to have earned’.

On 21 June 2007, the Competition Agency issued Order No. 17 against Shygys
following an investigation carried out during the period from 11 April 2007 to
8 June 2007. The Agency considered that Shygys had been engaging in
concerted actions with other AES Entities and overcharging its customers, and
therefore ordered it, inter alia, to stop its concerted actions, set lower prices
and pay damages to its customers!”

On 23 July 2007, the Competition Agency issued Order No. 20 against
Nurenergo. After investigations, the authorities determined that Nurenergo
had been fixing prices at below market levels for three years with UK Hydro,
Shulba Hydro, UK CHP, and AES Ekibastuz and decided that such business
resulted in a restriction of access of other buyers to the electric energy market.
Nurenergo was therefore ordered, inter alia, to cease activities with other AES
Entities in the EKO market, cancel existing agreements and transfer the income

derived as a result of violations of anti-monopoly legislation! 10.

Further orders were issued in August and September 2007, ordering Nurenergo
to cease violating Kazakh antimonopoly laws and pay fines of several millions
usp".

On 15 August 2007, the Competition Agency issued Orders Nos. 18, 19 and 20
against UK Hydro, Shulba Hydro and Sogra CHP respectively 2 which
replaced some of the orders previously issued and annulled by the Kazakh
courts. These orders established that the three entities had from late 2005 sold
electricity only through Nurenergo and that their business practices had

restricted the competition. The Hydros were ordered to cease these activities,
pay damages, terminate their contracts with Nurenergo and enter into direct
contracts with named customers. Fines were further imposed in September
2007 in the approximate amounts of USD 100,000 against UK Hydro and USD
80,000 against Shulba Hydro'".

(x) On 24 December 2008, the Competition Agency issued Order No. 2] against
UK Hydro, ordering it to cease concerted actions with other AES Entities,
including Nurenergo, to conclude agreements with specific named entities and
to transfer income it had derived from violations of anti-monopoly
legislation! an

In the period from May 2001 to December 2010, a total of 53 orders and/or fines were
issued against the AES Entities based on the newly issued competition laws and
regulations. Many, but not all, of these orders were challenged by the AES Entities.
Some of these challenges against such orders were taken all the way up to the Kazakh
Supreme Court (hereinafter “Supreme Court”) (see e.g. Order No. 63''), While some of
these orders were cancelled or modified in favor of the AES Entities, the majority of the
orders and the substance of the decisions made in respect of the AES Entities
competitive behavior were confirmed by the Kazakh courts!!®,

According to Claimants, the decisions by the Competition Agency (as upheld by the
Kazakh judiciary) to place AES Entities on the register and further orders and fines
issued against some of the AES Entities were based on an incorrect determination of the
relevant concepts of Kazakh competition law, such as the concepts of ‘relevant market’,
‘market share’ attributable to the AES entities, ‘dominance’, ‘group of companies’,
etc.!!7, Claimants say that as a result of the orders the Hydros and UK CHP suffered the
following harm!''®:

 

(i) They became subject to price controls and were required to sell electricity to
EKO consumers at tariffs capped by the Competition Agency;

(ii) They were unable to negotiate tariffs freely with customers in the EKO and could
not raise their tariffs without approval of the Competition Agency, which
curtailed their access to the wholesale electricity market;

(iii) They were required to sell electricity directly to any EKO customer who
requested power from them without using the trading company AES Kazakhstan.
They were not entitled to refuse to sell un-contracted electricity to any EKO
customer who requested power from them.

The third indirect impact of the new legislation was that from 2007 onwards various
employees of the AES Entities were allegedly subject to interrogations and threats of
arrests and criminal prosecutions by Kazakhstan’s Agency on Fighting Economic and
Corruption Crimes and other local authorities (hereinafter referred to as “the Financial
Police”’”:

(i) In February 2006, Mr. Jonagan was summoned to a meeting by the new Akim
of the EKO, Mr. Karubzhanov, who allegedly exerted pressure on Mr.

Jonagan to lower the prices of electricity sales by AES entities'”!.

(ii) On 5 March 2007, Ms. L. Kosmenyuk, Director of Finance of the Hydros,
was interrogated by the Financial Police'”.

(iii) On 18 March 2008, Mr. M. A. Salibenov, General Director of UK CHP, sent
a letter to the Prosecutor of the EKO (and other officials), complaining about
illegal actions taken by some Antimonopoly Administration officials of the
EKO against AES Entities in requesting certain documents and asking the
officials to conduct investigations'**.

 

  

(iv) On 29 May 2008, a meeting was held between Mr. Boris Anpilogov, Director
of UK Hydro, representatives of the Akimat and the Competition Agency, in
which, according to Mr. Anpilogov, he was allegedly pressured to sign new
contracts and tariff agreements and was threatened by the officials
representing the Competition Agency and the Akimat with criminal
proceedings and arrest!”4,

(v) On 24 June 2008, Mr Jonagan, Head of the AES Group of Companies in
Kazakhstan, wrote to the Akim expressly stating that Claimants were
agreeing to the Akim’s demands only under protest, and “due to your insistent
demands accompanied by interrogations of AES employees and attempts to
arrest their family members, as well as threats to apply various sanctions
against AES employees, py

From June 2008 onwards, Claimants proceeded to sell the majority of the Hydros’ power
inside the EKO, allegedly because of the various actions taken by Kazakhstan authorities
against the AES entities'”®, According to Claimants, these incidents further led senior
employees, including John Woodham (the General Director of Nurenergo) and Mr Jim

5. Further Legislative Evolution from 2009-2012 and the Escalation of the Situation

On 1 January 2009, amendments to the Law “On the Electric Power Industry” of 9 July
2004 came into force (hereinafter referred to as the “2009 Tariff Amendment”)! :
These new regulations provided for a more regulated electricity sector, making the sale
of electricity by every generator in Kazakhstan subject to a specific capped tariff. This
legislative amendment led to the promulgation of a series of complementary regulations,
including:

(i) On 10 March 2009, the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources issued Order
No. 61 by which it re-organized the electric power industry into groups of power
generating companies based on the type of power generation, rated capacity,
type of fuel used and remoteness from fuel location. Pursuant to this Order, UK
CHP was placed into Group 3, Sogra CHP in Group 6, and UK Hydro and
Shulba Hydro were place into Group 1317,

(ii) On 25 March 2009, pursuant to the 2009 Tariff Amendment, Kazakhstan by
virtue of Resolution No. 392, published the maximum tariffs that each generator
was entitled to charge”,

(iii) On 3 December 2009, the Kazakh authorities issued Order No. 366-OD
approving a new version of the Monopolies Register extending the geographic
boundaries of the register to the EKO and Pavlodar regions!" Notwithstanding
this new determination of ‘relevant market’ the AES Entities remained on the
Monopolies Register as ‘dominant entities’.

52. In connection with the promulgation of these laws and regulations, the AES Entities

were subject to further government actions and decisions directed at them, including
, 133,
inter alia ~~:

(i) On 15 May 2009, the Vostochno-Kazakhstanskaya Region Ust-Kamenogorsk
Specialized Administrative Court issued Ruling No. 3-5430/2009 in relation to
UK Hydro, establishing that UK Hydro had violated the Administrative Code
and ordering it to pay a fine of 10% of the profit received from its monopolistic

In early 2010, the Financial Police initiated criminal proceedings against officers
of UK Hydro in relation to alleged illegal activities of UK Hydro”. In particular
Mr. Jim Doak, the General Director of both UK Hydro and Shulba Hydro, was
indicted on 4 January 2011 136,

On 19 February 2010, the Financial Police made an Order to Commence a
Criminal Case and Allow it to Proceed against persons who performed
management functions within UK Hydro (without naming such persons)'*’,

On 23 April 2010, following an investigation of the activities of UK Hydro, the
Competition Agency issued an Order on an Administrative Offense against UK
Hydro, according to which UK Hydro had abused its dominant position by
refusing to enter into a contract with a specific entity and was ordered to pay a
fine”.

On 6 August 2010, following an investigation of the activities of UK HPP, the
Competition Agency made Order No. 334-OD, in which it approved the results
of the investigation, according to which UK HPP had — inter alia — been charging
monopolistically high prices and discriminating against certain customers in
terms of prices, and resolved to transmit the records of the investigation to the
Financial Police and/or to initiate administrative proceedings under the

Administrative Code’.

In parallel, the 2009 Tariff Amendment required power generators to enter into
“Investment Obligation Agreements” (hereinafter “IOAs”, also known as “Obligations
Performance Agreements”) with the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources of
Kazakhstan. The role of the IOA was to specify the investment obligations undertaken
by power generators, in the light of which tariffs were approved. This led to the
conclusion of, inter alia, the following IOAs with AES Entities:

(i) On_ 12 May 2009, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources of
Kazakhstan and UK CHP entered into “Agreement No. 21 on the fulfillment
of investment commitments by AES Ust-Kamenogorsk TE[TS] for 2009-
20107",

(ii) On 26 June 2009, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources of
Kazakhstan and UK Hydro entered into “Agreement No. 31 on the fulfillment
of investment commitments by AES Ust-Kamenogorsk GES LLP?!

On 21 October 2009, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources of

54. These IOAs were concluded for a duration of one year, i.e. including 2010, and had to
be renewed for the following years. It appears that the renewal of such IOAs was
subject to substantial difficulties:

On 9 July 2010, Mr. Jim Doak, the General Director of the Hydros, by letter
requested Mr. Ishekeshev, the Minister of Energy, to review UK Hydro’s
proposal concerning an “Agreement on the Fulfillment of Investment
Obligations of UK Hydro for 2011-2013 between UK Hydro and the
Government of Kazakhstan”'*. This request was reiterated by letter of 15
September 20104,

On 13 August 2010, Mr. Mergaliev, General Director of UK CHP by letter
requested Mr. Ishekeshev, the Minister of Energy, to review UK CHP’s
proposal concerning an “Agreement on the Fulfillment of Investment
Obligations of UK CHP for 2011-2013 between UK CHP and the Government
of Kazakhstan”.

On 30 October 2010, Mr. Turganov, the Vice-Minister of Energy, informed the
Hydros and CHPs that they had to submit agreements on the fulfillment of
investment obligations for 2011 by 20 November 2010'4°,

On 11 November 2010, Mr. Jim Doak sent further relevant documents of the
Hydros and CHPs as requested by Mr. Turganov on 30 October 2010'47,

On 3 and 6 December 2010, Mr. Turganov, Vice Minister of the Ministry of
Energy, sent two letters to UK Hydro and UK CHP ordering them “to revise
the submitted Obligations Performance Agreement for 2011 or to establish the

tariff corresponding to the planned amount of investment”.

On 29 November 2010, Mr. Jim Doak by letter, and referring to his previous
letters, requested Mr. Ishekeshev, the Minister of Energy, to review UK
Hydro’s proposal for an “Agreement on the Fulfillment of Investment

Obligations of UK Hydro for 2011-2013 between UK Hydro and the
Government of Kazakhstan”!”.

On the same day, Mr. Konyrbayev, a general director of UK CHP, in response

On_13 December 2010, Mr. Jonagan, for and on behalf of Tau Power,
responded to Mr. Turganov’s letters of 3 and 6 December 2010, complaining
that “the unjustified refusal to approve the Investment Obligations
Performance Agreements with the AES UK Companies will result in the
suspension of a number of important projects [...] and is likely to prejudice the
reliability of the power facilities operated by them”'*!,

On 22 December 2010, a telegram entitled “extremely urgent” was sent to the
Hydros and the CHPs by Mr. Bokenbayev, Department Director of the
Ministry of Energy, informing them that, as they had not signed any IOAs for
2011 they were invited to a meeting at the Ministry on 23-24 December

2010.

On 30 December 2010, after the talks around 23-24 December 2010, Mr.
Turganov, sent a letter to UK CHP with the Ministry of Energy’s suggestions
and comments on the drafts regarding the IOA of UK CHP for the years 2011-
2012, in particular with regard to the duration of such agreement, which should
be limited to one year, and the specific amount of investment to be made 58.

On 21 January 2011, Mr. Konyrbayev, Executive Director of UK CHP,
responded to Mr. Ishekeshev, the Minister of Energy, regarding the
Government’s comments of 30 December 2010 on the amendments to the IOA
for 2011-2012'*. Mr. Konyrbayev rejected the limitation of IOAs to one year
and further stressed that the generating companies should be free to define their
investment obligations.

By letter of 27 January 2011, Mr. Turganov, the Vice-Minister of Energy,
requested Tau Power (without specifying any person as addressee) to revise
and submit to the Ministry the IOA and to hand in profits received for 2009-
2010.

On 5 July 2011, Mr. J. Woodham, General Director of UK Hydro, sent to

On 2 and 12 August 2011, Mr. Jonagan, for and on behalf of Tau Power, sent a
letter to Mr. Jaxaliyev, Vice-Minister of Energy, drawing the Government’s
attention to the fact that for the period from 2011 onwards, the draft IOAs with
UK CHP and UK Hydro that had been sent to them had not been executed.
Mr. Jonagan further indicated that absent such agreement, UK CHP and UK
Hydro had been forced to suspend a number of projects, and therefore urged
the Government to go into an agreement with UK CHP and UK Hydro'™* :

On 1 September 2011 and 8 December 2011, referring to the letters of 2 and 12
August 2011, Allen & Overy LLP on behalf of AES Corp and Tau Power
requested the Ministry of Energy to urgently approve the draft Investment

possibility to cover their costs'®, Respondent asserts that this law merely clarified the
2009 Tariff Amendment and tightened up the mechanisms for enforcement of what
remained the same underlying policy'® (see further below paras. 346-348).

On 20 December 2012, new IOAs were finally signed between MINT and each of the
following AES Entities, UK Hydro, Shulba Hydro, UK CHP and Sogra cHP'®

6. Kazakhstan’s Challenge to the Altai Agreement and the Arbitration Clause

On_23 November 2002, Kazakhstan, through the Committee of State Property and
Privatization of the Ministry of Finance, launched proceedings against AES Suntree and
Tau Power before the Court of First Instance of the EKO seeking a declaration of the
Altai Agreement as invalid 'e8 The proceedings aimed at invalidating the Altai
Agreement on the grounds that it had not been validly entered into according to the
principles of the Kazakh Civil Procedure, as the parties to the Altai Agreement had not
been able to reach an agreement on fundamental terms thereof.

On 19 December 2002, upon Claimants’ request, the Court of First Instance dismissed
Kazakhstan’s claim on the grounds of no jurisdiction

On 30 January 2003, after an appeal procedure initiated by Kazakhstan, the Supreme
Court upheld the judgment of the Court of First Instance of 19 December 2002
confirming that the Kazakh courts lacked jurisdiction due to the existence of an
arbitration clause’. However, the Supreme Court in its judgment pointed out that
Kazakhstan could reintroduce a separate claim requesting that the arbitration clause of
the Altai Agreement (hereinafter the “Arbitration Clause”) be declared invalid'”'.

On 9 April 2003, Kazakhstan filed a new claim with the Court of First Instance of the
EKO seeking the annulment of the Arbitration Clause contained in the Altai
Agreement! ”.

On 26 September 2003, the Court of First Instance dismissed Kazakhstan’s claim to
annul the Arbitration Clause of the Altai Agreement!

On_26 January 2004, on appeal from the judgment of the Court of First Instance
rendered on 26 September 2003, the Supreme Court overturned the judgment, ruling in
Kazakhstan’s favor and annulling the Arbitration Clause of the Altai Agreement!™*

Later on, in 2009, the state-owned entity JSC UK sought information from UK Hydro on
the value of concession assets'”. When UK Hydro refused to provide this information,
JSC UK initiated an action against UK Hydro before the court of First Instance of the
EKO. UK Hydro considered this to be a violation of the Arbitration Clause and
ancillary agreements and sought anti-suit relief before the English courts in London!”°.

 

- On 31 July 2009, the English court issued an anti-suit injunction in favour of UK Hydro,

but the Court of First Instance of the EKO nevertheless granted JSC UK’s request on
5 August 2009!7”.

On 16 April 2010, the English court issued a final judgment in favour of UK Hydro and
holding that the Arbitration Clause in the Altai Agreement was valid, contrary to the
findings of the Kazakh Supreme Court!”®, Notwithstanding the appeal by Kazakhstan,
the judgment of the English court was upheld 7.

D. Procedural History

. In view of the length of the proceedings, the present section does not aim to provide a

comprehensive overview of all procedural steps and is limited to presenting the main
stages of the proceedings.

I. The Commencement of the Proceeding

On 11 June 2010, Claimants filed their Request for Arbitration before ICSID. It was
registered on 20 July 2010 as ICSID Case No. ARB/10/16 and a Notice of Registration
was transmitted to the Parties on that date.

On 7 October 2010, the Claimants informed ICSID that the Parties had not reached an
agreement on the method for constituting the Tribunal, and that the Claimants had
therefore chosen the default mechanism provided in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID
Convention. By the same letter, Claimants appointed Dr. Klaus M. Sachs, a national of
Germany, as arbitrator.

On_22 October 2010, Claimants requested that the Chairman of the Administrative
Council of ICSID appoint the arbitrators not yet appointed and designate an arbitrator to
be the President of the Tribunal under Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 4 of
the ICSID Arbitration Rules.

. On 21 November 2010, the Respondent appointed Prof. Vaughan Lowe QC, a national

of the United Kingdom, as arbitrator.

On 7 December 2010, the Parties agreed, pursuant to Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID
Convention, that the party-appointed arbitrators would appoint the presiding arbitrator.
On 23 December 2010, the co-arbitrators informed ICSID that they appointed Mr. Gary
Born, a national of the United States, as President of the Tribunal. The Parties confirmed
their agreement to this appointment.

2. Constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal

On 5 January 2011, the Tribunal was constituted with Mr. Gary B. Born as its Chairman,

between the Parties and the Arbitral Tribunal in relation to the fact that Mr. Joe Smouha
QC is a member of the same barristers’ chamber, namely Essex Court Chambers, as a
member of the Tribunal, Prof. Vaughan Lowe QC.

completing the Supplementary Report of Professor Yarrow and Dr. Decker were
submitted on 6 July 2012.

On 27 June 2012, the Parties, the President of the Arbitral Tribunal and Ms. Aissatou
Diop from ICSID participated in a pre-hearing telephone conference. During this
conference call, Respondent voiced its wish for a bifurcation of the proceedings.
Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal allowed Claimants until 6 July 2012 to file their
comments on the Respondent’s application for bifurcation.

On 11 July 2012, after an extension of time granted by the Arbitral Tribunal, Claimants
submitted their comments on Respondent’s request for bifurcation and other matters
addressed during the pre-hearing conference. In this submission, Claimants agreed to a
split hearing (separating issues of liability and quantum). Claimants further requested
inter alia that (i) Respondent’s submissions on quantum be excluded because they were
made belatedly and were in response to the Claimants’ Memorial and not to Claimants’
Reply Memorial, or in the alternative that Claimants be granted eight weeks to file
submissions in response to Respondent’s arguments on quantum, and that (ii) Claimants
be given permission to bring an additional claim (“Additional Claim’) pursuant to
ICSID Rule 40(2) in view of the recent promulgation on 4 July 2012 of the new Kazakh
Electricity Law, which allegedly adversely affected Claimants’ claims.

On 18 July 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, in which it
rejected Respondent’s request to bifurcate the proceedings and granted the Parties an
additional three days of hearings to be held on either 17, 18, 19 October 2012, or on 5, 6,
7 February 2013. The Arbitral Tribunal invited the Parties to agree on the dates.

On 23 July 2012, Respondent submitted its comments to Claimants’ submission of
11 July 2012 (see above para. 90) and requested the Arbitral Tribunal to (i) reject
Claimants’ application for permission to file an additional claim and for a split of the
issues dealt with during the hearing, or alternatively, (ii) to arrange for a new hearing.

On 26 July 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 in which it
decided on the various requests and objections raised by the Parties within the context of
the pre-hearing telephone conference of 27 June 2012 (see above para. 89). In particular,
the Arbitral Tribunal decided to (i) admit the Jones Report I into the record and granted
Claimants an opportunity to respond thereto, and (ii) to grant Claimants’ request to
submit a new claim providing Respondent with an opportunity to respond thereto.

On 6 August 2012, Claimants submitted their ‘Claimants’ Supplementary Submission
on the Additional Claim’ (hereinafter “CL Suppl. Subm. 06.08.2012”) together with a
Witness Statement of Mr Douglas Herron of 6 August 2012 (“C-WS Herron”). In this
submission, Claimants laid out their Additional Claim relating to Kazakhstan’s
enactment of the 2012 Electricity Law. According to Claimants, the application of this
law constitutes multiple breaches by Kazakhstan of its obligations under international
law, further increasing the loss caused to the Claimants.

On 10 August 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 ruling on the

admissibility of certain parts of Claimants’ submission on its Additional Claim which
had been subject to objections from Respondent. While the Arbitral Tribunal decided to

40

96.

97.

strike specific paragraphs of Claimants’ submission, it maintained and accepted into the
records other parts. On the same day, the Arbitral Tribunal provided further
clarifications concerning the decisional part of Procedural Order No. 6.

On 27 August 2012, Respondent filed its “Response to the Claimants’ Supplementary
Submission on the Additional Claim” (hereinafter “RSP Suppl Subm. 27.08.2012”),
together with (i) a third Expert Report of Prof. George Yarrow and Dr. Christopher
Decker dated 24 August 2012 (“R-Yarrow/Decker III”), (ii) a third Expert Report on the
Law of Kazakhstan by Prof. William Butler dated 23 August 2012 (“R-Butler IIT’), (iii)
a third witness statement of Ms Lyudmila Ustyantseva dated 27 August 2012 (“R-WS
Ustyantseva III”) and (iv) a second witness statement of Vice-Minister Bakhytzhan
Jaxaliyev dated 27 August 2012 (“R-WS Jaxaliyev II”). In summary, Respondent
contended that the 2012 Electricity Law merely clarified the law and maintained the
original scheme implemented in the original 2009 Tariff Amendment. Respondent
therefore rejected Claimants’ claims that the 2012 Electricity Law involved “departures
in critical respects” from the scheme applicable under the original 2009 Tariff
Amendment.

5. The Hearings and thereto related Submissions

From 10 to 14 September 2012, a Hearing on the issues of liability took place in London

41

98. On 5 October 2012, after having consulted the Parties, the Arbitral Tribunal issued
Procedural Order No. 7, in which it ruled on the next steps of the procedure and issued
a timetable for the submission by the Parties of their submissions regarding the quantum
of the claims. With regard to the Post-Hearing Briefs, the Arbitral Tribunal limited their
scope to issues addressed during the London Hearing and provided a list of the particular
issues the Parties should focus on.

99. On 2 November 2012, after having been granted an extension, Claimants filed their
“Suppl a Submission” (I ft “CL Quantum Subm.
02. I. 2012”), including a third Witness Statement of Mr. Michael Jonagan (“C-WS
Jonagan III”) and a fourth Expert Report from FTI Consulting (hereinafter “FTI Report
IV”) both dated 2 November 2012. The object of this submission was twofold: it was (i)
to respond to the Jones Report I, and (ii) to set out the quantum of Claimants’ Additional
Claim.

 

100. On 23 November 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8, in
which it ruled on the admissibility of an additional document Claimants sought to
introduce in relation to the examination of Prof. Butler during the London Hearing.
After having given Respondent the opportunity to respond, the Arbitral Tribunal rejected
Claimants’ request to enter such document into the record.

101. On _ 30 November 2012, Claimants and Respondent filed their respective Post-
Hearing Brief according to Procedural Order No. 7 (see above para. 98).

102. On 18 December 2012, Respondent filed its “Response to the Claimants’
Supplementary Quantum Submission” (hereinafter “RSP Quantum
Subm. 118.12.2012”), including a second Expert Report from Wynne Jones (hereinafter
“R-Jones IL’ or “Jones Report II’). This submission aimed to respond to Claimants’
comments on the Jones Report I.

103. On 4 January 2013, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9, in which it
tuled on the admissibility of certain parts of the Jones Report II, which Claimants
considered to go beyond the prescribed scope of Respondent’s Response to Claimants’
Supplementary Quantum Submission. After having given Respondent the opportunity to
comment, the Arbitral Tribunal granted Claimants’ request and struck certain parts of the
Jones Report II from the record.

104. On 14 January 2013, after an extension of time granted by the Arbitral Tribunal,
Respondent filed its “Submission on the Quantum of the Additional Claim” hereinafter
“RSP Quantum Subm. II 14.12.2013”), including (i) a third Witness Statement of Mr.
Jaxaliyev (“R-WS Bakytzhan Jaxaliyev III’), (ii) a third Expert Report from Wynne
Jones ( “R-Jones III” or “Jones Report IIT”) and (iii) a fourth Expert Report from Prof.
George Yarrow and Dr. Christopher Decker (“R-Yarrow/Decker IV”). The object of this
submission was to reply to Claimants’ case on quantum regarding their Additional
Claims.

105. On 21 January 2013, Claimants raised objections concerning certain passages of the

Mr. Jaxaliyev’s third Witness Statement and requested that these passages be struck
from the record. After a further exchange of correspondence with Respondent, the

42

106.

107.

108.

109.

180

Parties eventually agreed that these passages would be deleted from the statement and
that Claimants would, in exchange, refrain from cross-examining Mr. Jaxaliyev on the
subject matter addressed in these paragraphs. On 28 January 2013, the Arbitral Tribunal
took note of the Parties’ agreement and concluded that no action on its part was
necessary.

On 24 January 2013, after having consulted the Parties concerning the agenda of the
hearing to be held in Paris from 5-7 February 2013, the Arbitral Tribunal sent directions
to the Parties on certain logistical issues, which the Parties had not been able to agree
upon.

From 5 to 7 February 2013, a Hearing was held in Paris regarding the quantum of
Claimants’ claims (hereinafter “Paris Hearing”). During this hearing, the Arbitral
Tribunal heard the following fact and expert witnesses:

(iii) On behalf of Claimants:
- Mr. Michael Jonagan.
- Mr. Joseph P. Kalt;
- Mr. Howard N. Rosen;

(iv) On behalf of Respondents:
Mr. Bakytzhan Jaxaliyev;
- Prof. George Yarrow;
- Dr. Christoph Decker;
- Mr. Wynne Jones.

A transcript of the Paris Hearing was prepared. After corrections made thereto in
consultation with the Parties, a final and approved version was circulated on
2 April 2013.

During the Paris Hearing, it appeared that Claimants had updated the total amount of
their claims, in the light of the testimony of Mr. Jaxaliyev in his third Witness Statement
(“Updated Claim”). A discussion arose as to the admissibility of this update.

On 12 February 2013, the Arbitral Tribunal sent a letter to the Parties concerning
various procedural matters. In this letter, the Arbitral Tribunal invited — among others -
Claimants to submit their Updated Claim, after which Respondent would have an
opportunity to comment thereon before a decision of the Arbitral Tribunal as to its
admissibility. The Arbitral Tribunal further informed the Parties that they would be
invited to file Post-Hearing Briefs once the Arbitral Tribunal had agreed on a list of
issues to be addressed therein, and that each Party would be given an opportunity to
respond to the other Party’s response to the issues laid out by the Arbitral Tribunal. The
Arbitral Tribunal specified that the Post-Hearing Briefs “should not exceed 40 pages and
shall not touch upon the substance of the case”.

Paris Transcript p. 240 1. 11 —p. 2521. 18.

43

110. On 12 February 2013, Claimants sent a letter to the Arbitral Tribunal setting out their
Updated Claim. In this letter, Claimants stated that updated figures “reflect{ed] the
updated computation of the Claimants’ losses from 2016 onwards based on the
testimony of Vice-Minister Jaxaliyev in his Third Witness Statement dated 13 January
2013 [...] and his testimony on 5 February 2013 (Day I of the February Hearing)” and
that Claimants were “not asserting any new claims in relation to damages”.

111. On 15 and 22 February 2013, Respondent indicated that the updates made by
Claimants were not a “straightforward exercise” and that it needed to consult with its
experts. Respondent indicated that it would revert to the Tribunal with its position as
soon as possible.

112. On 4 March 2013, after an enquiry by Claimants and a reminder from the Arbitral
Tribunal, Respondent sent a letter to the Arbitral Tribunal setting out its position
regarding Claimants’ Updated Claim. Respondent requested the Arbitral Tribunal to
exclude the Updated Claim on the basis that it had been raised too late and in an
inappropriate manner. Alternatively, Respondent requested that in case the Updated
Claim was to be allowed, the Arbitral Tribunal defer consideration thereof, or in case the
Arbitral Tribunal was inclined to move forward, to issue directions for its disposition.

113. On 8 March 2013, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 10, in which
the Arbitral Tribunal ruled as follows:

(60) With regard to the admissibility of Claimants’ Updated Claim, the Arbitral
Tribunal deferred consideration thereof;

(ii) With regard to the Post-Hearing Briefs and the relevant issues to be addressed
therein, the Arbitral Tribunal provided the Parties with relevant instructions and
invited them to file their Post-Hearing Briefs by Friday 5 April 2013, and their
reply thereto by Friday 19 April 2013.

114. On 5 April 2013, Claimants filed their “Post-Hearing Submission Following the
5-7 February 2013 Hearing” and Respondent filed its “Post-Hearing Brief on
Quantum” (hereinafter referred to as “CL PHB on Quantum 5.04.2013” and “RSP PHB
on Quantum 5.04.2013” respectively).

115. On 9 April 2013, Respondent sent a letter to the Arbitral Tribunal complaining that
Claimants’ Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum exceeded the admissible scope and
addressed issues relating to the substance of the case. Respondent therefore requested
that relevant parts of Claimants’ Post-Hearing Brief be struck out, on the basis that it
was in breach of Procedural Order No. 10 (see above para. 113), or alternatively that
Respondent be given an opportunity to respond to the positions taken by the Claimants.

116. On 16 April 2013, upon invitation by the Arbitral Tribunal, Claimants responded to
Respondent’s letter of 9 April 2013 requesting that Respondent’s application be rejected

in its entirety.

117. On 18 April 2013, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 11, in which it
(i) rejected Respondent’s request to strike out certain parts of Claimants’ Post-Hearing

44

Brief on Quantum, (ii) granted Respondent’s the right to comment on these parts in its
response to Claimants’ Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum of 5 April 2013, and (iii)
postponed the deadline for submission of the Parties’ responses to the Post-Hearing
Briefs on Quantum to 23 April 2013 COB (CET).

118. On the same day, Respondent requested certain clarifications of Procedural Order
No. 11 and to be given an additional allowance of 5 pages to provide separate comments
on the relevant sections of Claimants’ Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum.

119. On 19 April 2013, the Arbitral Tribunal clarified the decisional part of Procedural
Order No. 11 and granted Respondent the requested additional 5-page allowance.

120. On the same day, Claimants objected to Respondent’s request for an additional
allowance of 5 pages. Alternatively, it requested to be given the same additional
allowance. This letter crossed with the Arbitral Tribunal’s letter of the same day.

121. On 22 April 2013, the Arbitral Tribunal replied to Claimants’ letter of 19 April 2013
and rejected Claimants’ requests. The Arbitral Tribunal stated that it did not consider it
necessary to re-consider its decision taken in Procedural Order No. 11 and as clarified in
its message of 19 April 2013 and that it saw no reason to provide Claimants with an
additional 5-page allowance.

122. On 23 April 2013, Claimants filed their “Reply Post-Hearing Submission on the
Tribunal’s Question” and Respondent filed its “Response to the Claimants’ Answer to
the Tribunal’s Question” (hereinafter “CL Reply PHB on Quantum 23.04.2013” and
“RSP Reply PHB on Quantum 23.04.2013” respectively) in accordance with Procedural
Order No. 10 (see above para. 113). In addition, Respondent also filed its “Response
Pursuant to Procedural Order No. 11: Re Paragraphs 6 to 23, and 33 to 53 of the
Claimants’ Post-Hearing Brief” (hereinafter “RSP Response to PO No. 11 of

123. On 17 May 2013, Claimants filed “Claimants’ Schedules of Costs” and Respondent
filed “Respondent’s Submission on Costs”, jointly referred to as “Submissions on

Costs”.

124. On 12 September 2013, the proceeding was declared closed in accordance with Rule
38(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.

consent of the Investor given pursuant to paragraph (4) shall be
considered to satisfy the requirement for:

(i) written consent of the parties to a dispute for purposes of Chapter
II of the ICSID Convention and for purposes of the Additional Facility
Rules;

[.]

A tribunal established under paragraph (4) shall decide the issues in
dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles
of international law.

An Investor other than a natural person which has the nationality of a
Contracting Party to the dispute on the date of the consent in writing
referred to in paragraph (4) and which, before a dispute between it and
that Contracting Party arises, is controlled by Investors of another
Contracting Party, shall for the purpose of article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID
Convention be treated as a “national of another Contracting State” and
shall for the purpose of article 1(6) of the Additional Facility Rules be
treated as a “national of another State”.

[.]”
Article VI of the BIT provides:
“Article VI

1.

For the purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is a dispute
between a Party and a national or company of the other Party arising out
of or relating to (a) an investment agreement between that Party and such
national or company; (b) an investment authorization granted by that
Party's foreign investment authority to such national or company; or (c)
an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with
respect to an investment.

In the event of an investment dispute, the parties to the dispute should
initially seek a resolution through consultation and negotiation. If the
dispute cannot be settled amicably, the national or company concerned
may choose to submit the dispute for resolution:

48

(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Party that in a Party to the
dispute; or

(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute-settlement
procedures; or

(c) in accordance with the terms of paragraph 3.

3. (a) Provided that the national or company concerned has not . [sic]
submitted the dispute for resolution under paragraph 2 (a) or (b) and that
six months have elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose, the
national or company concerned may choose to consent in writing to the
submission of the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration:

(i

to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes
("Centre") established by the C ion on the Settl of Inves
Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, done at
Washington, March 18, 1965 ("ICSID Convention"), provided that the
Party is a Party to such Convention; or
(ii) to the Additional Facility of the Centre, if the Centre is not available; or
(iii) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations
Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL); or
(iv) to any other arbitration institution, or in accordance with any other
arbitration rules, as may be mutually agreed between the parties to the
dispute.

 

(b) Once the national or company concerned has so consented, either Party to
the dispute may initiate arbitration in accordance with the choice so
specified in the consent.

4. Each Party hereby consents to the submission of any investment dispute
for settlement by binding arbitration in accordance with the choice
specified in the written consent of the national or company under
paragraph 3. Such consent, together with the written consent of the
national or company when given under paragraph 3 shall satisfy the
requirement for:

(a) written consent of the parties to the dispute for purposes of Chapter II of
the ICSID Convention (Jurisdiction of the Centre) and for purposes of the
Additional Facility Rules; and
[.]

8. For purposes of an arbitration held under paragraph 3 of this Article, any
company legally constituted under the applicable law and regulations of a
Party or a political subdivision thereof but that, immediately before the
occurrence of the event or events giving rise to the dispute, was an
investment of nationals or companies of the other Party, shall be treated
as a national or company of such other Party in accordance with Article
25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. ”

127. Further relevant provisions of the 1994 FIL, ECT and BIT will be dealt with as the
analysis proceeds.

128. The present procedure is further subject to the ICSID legal framework, including the
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of
Other States of 1965 (hereinafter “ICSID Convention”), the Rules of Procedure for the
Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (hereinafter the “ICSID
Institution Rules”), the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (hereinafter the
“ICSID Arbitration Rules”), and the Administrative and Financial Regulations, in their
versions as amended in 2006. In this regard, both Parties confirmed during the First

49

Session their common agreement that the ICSID Arbitration Rules as amended in 2006
should apply to these proceedings (see Minutes of the First Session , para. 1.1).

129. While Respondent does not contest the application to the present dispute of the BIT
and the ECT, it contends that some of the necessary requirements set out in these treaties
for initiation of ICSID arbitration proceedings are not met. With regard to the FIL,
Respondent generally objects to its application to the present dispute. These objections
by Respondent are dealt with below in the analysis of the existence and scope of the
Arbitral Tribunal’s jurisdiction (see section ILC.).

2. The Arbitral Procedure

130. The Arbitral Tribunal has been validly constituted (see above paras. 73 fol.), as
confirmed by the Parties during the First Session.

131. | Through the various rounds of exchange of written submissions and at the London
Hearing and the Paris Hearing, both Parties have been given wide and equal opportunity
to present their case with regard to the issues of the present case.

132. At both Hearings, each Party confirmed that it had no objections to the way the
Arbitral Tribunal had conducted the proceedings.'*°

133. | Having read the Parties’ written submissions and listened to their oral submissions
and testimony of their witnesses and experts during the Hearings, and based on the
deliberations held among the members of the Arbitral Tribunal, the Arbitral Tribunal
considers itself in a position to render the present Award.

3. Relief Sought

3.1 Claimants’ Requests for Relief

134. In their latest submission on the matter (see above para. 99), Claimants filed the
following Requests for Relief (the various requests have been numbered by the Arbitral
Tribunal)!*°:

“For reasons set forth above, as well as those set out in the Memorial, Reply
Memorial and the Supplementary Submission, the Claimants request that the
Tribunal enter an award in their favour and against the Republic of Kazakhstan
as follows:
(i) (CL-1] DECLARING that Kazakhstan has

(A) breached Articles 6, 8, 10 and 13 of the FIL;

(B) breached Articles 10 and 14 of the ECT;

185 See London Transcript p. 289 1. 3 to p. 291 1. 9 (the issue regarding the time allocation between the Parties was
later on clarified and settled in the Tribunal’s letter of 18 September 2012, whereafter neither Party raised any
objection). See also Paris Transcript, p. 256 1. 13-18.

186 CL Quantum Subm. 02.11.2012, para 67.

 

50

135.

136.

(C) breached Articles II and IV of the BIT; and
(ii) ORDERING that Kazakhstan
(A) [CL-2] provide full restitution to the Claimants by re-establishing the
situation which existed prior to Kazakhstan's breaches of the FIL, ECT
and BIT; or
(B) (CL-3] pay the Claimants compensation for all losses suffered as a
result of Kazakhstan’s breaches of the FIL, ECT and BIT, including
moral damages; and
(C) [CL-4] pay the Claimants pre-award interest; and
(D) [CL-5] pay the Claimants the costs of this arbitration, including all
expenses that the Claimants have incurred or will incur in respect of
the fees and expenses of the arbitrators, ICSID, the Secretary of the
Tribunal, legal counsel, experts and consultants; and
(E) [CL-6] pay post-award interest, compounded monthly at a rate to be
determined by the Tribunal on the amounts awarded until full payment
thereof: and
(F) (CL-7] any such other and further relief that the Tribunal shall deem
just and proper.
The Claimants reserve their right to amend or supplement this Supplementary
Quantum Submission and to request such additional, alternative or different
relief as may be appropriate, including conservatory, injunctive or other
interim relief”

These Requests for Relief are slightly different from those filed previously, to the
extent they rely on additional provisions of the relevant legal frameworks (in particular
Article 14 ECT and Article IV BIT).

As concerns the specific amounts claimed by Claimants, these will be dealt with - if
necessary - in the section on Remedies (see below II.G).

3.2 Respondent’s Request for Relief

137.

187

In its Supplementary Submission of 27 August 2012 (see above para. 96),
Respondent filed the following Requests for Relief (the various requests have been
numbered by the Arbitral Tribunal)'*’:

“241. [...] Respondent respectfully requests the Tribunal to adjudge and
declare in its Award or Awards in the present proceedings that:

a. [RSP-1] it has no jurisdiction over the Claimants’ claims of breach
of the 1994 FIL under the 1994 FIL (including the Additional Claims
of breach of the 1994 FIL set out in its Supplementary Submission)
and those claims are to be dismissed;

. [RSP-2] that the Claimants’ Original Claims of breach of the BIT,
ECT and 1994 FIL as a result of application of the competition
legislation to the AES Entities are not admissible and those claims
are to be dismissed.;

>

242. To the extent that the Tribunal should hold that it has jurisdiction over
the Claimants’ claims, and that those claims are admissible, to adjudge
and declare that:

RSP Suppl. Subm., paras. 241-242.

138.

139.

140.

a. [RSP-3] Kazakhstan has not violated any of its obligations under
the BIT as regards AES Corp, whether as alleged or in any other
fashion;

b. [RSP-4] Kazakhstan has not violated any of its obligations under
the ECT as regards Tau Power, whether as alleged or in any other
fashion;

c. [RSP-5] to the extent that any obligations thereunder are
applicable, Kazakhstan has not violated its obligations under the
1994 FIL, whether as alleged or in any other fashion;

d._ [RSP-6] the Claimants’ claims for compensation fail and are to be
dismissed;

e. [RSP-7] the Claimants are entitled to no further or other relief,
whether as requested in the Memorial and Reply, or at all; and

f [RSP-8] the Claimants shall pay Kazakhstan’s costs and expenses
incurred in relation to the present proceedings, including any
payments by way of advance that Kazakhstan has made or will
make on account of the costs and expenses of the Tribunal, the
Secretary to the Tribunal and/or ICSID. “

These Requests are almost identical to the Requests filed in Respondent’s previous
submissions, 88 With the exception of the inclusion of a reference to the Additional
Claim. In its later submissions, including its Post-Hearing Brief (see above
paras. 99, 101, 102, 104), Respondent has not formally amended its previous Requests
for Relief. As concerns Respondent’s position with regard to the quantum of specific
claims, it will be dealt with in the relevant section on Remedies (see below II.G).

4. Issues before the Arbitral Tribunal and Structure of the Award

The main issue in dispute is whether the new laws and regulations of Kazakhstan
and/or the way they were implemented by the relevant Kazakh authorities, led to
violations by Kazakhstan of any of its obligations under the ECT and/or the BIT or any
other obligation that it undertook towards Claimants (in particular alleged obligations
deriving from the 1994 FIL and/or the Altai Agreement) and which fall under the scope
of protection of any of these treaties.

In determining these issues, the Arbitral Tribunal considers it necessary to determine
the following sub-issues:

(i) Does the Arbitral Tribunal have jurisdiction over the entirety of the claims filed
by Claimants? If so, are there any procedural impediments preventing the
Arbitral Tribunal from hearing Claimants’ claims?

(ii) If the Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction, did Kazakhstan breach any of the

standard of protection awarded under the relevant treaties when promulgating
and/or implementing its new laws and regulations?

See RSP Rejoinder 25.06.12, paras. 929-930, see also RSP Memo 7.10.11, para. 847-848.

(iii) In case a breach by Kazakhstan of any of its treaty obligations should be found to
have occurred, what are — if any -the remedies to be afforded to Claimants and,
in case of monetary compensation, what amount would Claimants be entitled to?

141. In particular, the Arbitral Tribunal is called upon to determine whether the Kazakh
laws and regulations and/or the way in which they were applied, entailed a violation of
certain provisions in the ECT, the BIT and the FIL. The questions that arise are as
follows:

(i) With regard to the ECT and BIT:

a. Whether Kazakhstan breached the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard
under Article 10(1) ECT and II(2)(a) BIT.

b. Whether Kazakhstan breached the prohibition on the taking of arbitrary and
unreasonable measures under Article 10(1) ECT and II(2)(b) BIT.

c. Whether Kazakhstan breached its duty to provide ‘Full Protection and
Security’ under Article 10(1) ECT and II(2)(a) BIT.

d. Whether Kazakhstan breached its obligation to guarantee Claimants the right
to repatriate returns under Article 14 ECT and IV BIT.

e. Whether and to what extent the Umbrella Clause in Article 10(1) ECT and
II(2)(c) BIT is applicable to breaches of the Altai Agreement and/or the 1994
FIL.

(ii) With regard to the FIL:

a. Whether Kazakhstan can be seen to have breached the stabilization clause of
Article 6 of the 1994 and/or the standards provided in Articles 8 and 13 of the
FIL.

b. If so, to what extent does such breach amount to a treaty breach?

142. Accordingly, the present award will first determine and examine the relevant legal
framework underlying Claimants’ claims (B). It will then examine whether or not the
Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide over Claimants’ claims (C). Next, the
Arbitral Tribunal will consider Claimants’ main claims, breaking them down into three
different periods: from 2004 to 31 December 2008 (D), from 1 January 2009 to 31
December 2015 (E) and from 1 January 2016 onwards (F). Finally, the Arbitral Tribunal
will examine the appropriate remedies to be afforded to Claimants (G) and rule on the
costs issues (H).

B. Relevant Provisions

I. The Relevant Treaty Framework
143. Claimants’ claims are primarily based on the ECT, the BIT and the 1994 FIL.

1.1 The ECT”

144. The ECT is an international agreement which establishes a multilateral framework
for cross-border co-operation in the energy industry. It plays an important role as part of
an international effort to build a legal foundation for energy security, based on the
principles of open, competitive markets and sustainable development. The ECT was
developed on the basis of the 1991 Energy Charter. Whereas the latter document was
drawn up as a declaration of political intent to promote energy cooperation, the ECT is a
legally-binding multilateral instrument. The fundamental aim of the ECT is to
strengthen the rule of law on energy issues, by creating a level playing-field of rules to
be observed by all participating governments, thereby mitigating risks associated with
energy-related investment and trade.!”°

145. Kazakhstan was among the first countries to ratify the ECT and deposited its
instrument of ratification on 6 August 1996, although the internal ratification procedures
had been completed already on 18 October 1995 (RSP Memo 7.11.2011, para. 160).
While the Netherlands is also a member state of the ECT since 16 April 1998, the United
States is not a party thereto.

146. Therefore, in the present case, the ECT applies only to the relationship between Tau
Power and Respondent, and not to the relationship between AES Corp. and the
Respondent.

147. According to Claimants, the way in which Respondent reformed and/or applied its
new competition law breached several protection standards set forth in the ECT, in
particular those provided for in Articles 10 and 14.

148. In contrast, Respondent contends that, in the light of the obligations undertaken by
Kazakhstan under the ECT, and in particular under Article 6 read together with Article
32, Kazakhstan was required to undertake a wholesale overhaul of its Soviet-era
competition legislation and the mechanisms of enforcement and Claimants had to expect
that this would be done by no later than 1 January 1998, and in any case by 1 July 2001.

 

149. | The main provisions relied upon by the Parties are the following (Exh. R-9):

(i) Article 1(6) and (9), which provides as follows:

whether existing at or made after the later of the date of entry into force of this
Treaty for the Contracting Party of the Investor making the investment and that
for the Contracting Party in the Area of which the investment is made

Rights, whichever is more favourable to the Investor.
(4) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) to (3), a Contracting Party may protect
the rights of creditors, or ensure compliance with laws on the issuing,
trading and dealing in securities and the satisfaction of judgments in civil,

With regard to Article 32, Kazakhstan is one of the countries listed in Annex T as a
country entitled to transitional arrangements.

1.2. The US-KAZ BIT”!

150. The BIT was signed by the US and Kazakhstan on 19 May 1992 and entered into
force on 12 January 1994.

151. The BIT applies only to the relationship between AES Corp. and Respondent, and
not to the relationship between Tau Power and Respondent.

152. According to its preamble, the BIT concluded between the US and Kazakhstan aimed
at encouraging and protecting investments based on the following core statements:

Desiring to promote greater economic cooperation between them, with
respect to investment by nationals and companies of one Party in the
territory of the other Party;

Exh. C-112.

153. | According to Claimants, the way in which Respondent reformed and applied its new
competition law breached several protection standards set forth in the BIT, in particular
those set out in Article II(2)(a)-(c). In contrast, Respondent contends that — in addition to
its jurisdictional and admissibility objections (see below section II.C) - the reform and
implementation of its laws was at all time in compliance with international standards and

Recognizing that agreement upon the treatment to be accorded such
investment will stimulate the flow of private capital and the economic
development of the Parties;

Agreeing that fair and equitable treatment of investment is desirable in
order to maintain a stable framework for investment and maximum
effective utilization of economic resources;

Recognizing that the development of economic and business ties can
contribute to the well-being of workers in both Parties and promote
respect for internationally recognized worker rights;

[.”

(e

owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of

155. Article II(2) (a)-(c) of the BIT provides as follows:
“Lad
2. (a) — Investment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable
treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be
accorded treatment less than that required by international law.

 

(b) Neither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary. or
discriminatory measures the management, operation, maintenance, use,

be arbitrary or discriminatory notwithstanding the fact that a Party has
had or has exercised the opportunity to review such measure in the courts
or administrative tribunals of a Party.

(c) Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into
with regard to investments. “

156. Article IV of the BIT provides as follows:

“I. Each Party shall permit all transfers related to an investment to be made
freely and without delay into and out of its territory. Such transfers
include: (a) returns; (b) compensation pursuant to Article IT; (c)
payments arising out of an investment dispute; (d) payments made under a

and (b) imposing income taxes by such means as a withholding tax
applicable to dividends or other transfers. Furthermore, either Party may
protect the rights of creditors, or ensure the satisfaction of judgments in
adjudicatory proceedings, through the equitable, nondiscriminatory and
good faith application of its law.”

2. Provisions of National Law and Contract Applicable between the Parties

157. To support their claims of breach of treaty obligations by Kazakhstan, Claimants
further rely on obligations that allegedly arise for Kazakhstan as a result of assurances
said to have been made by Kazakhstan in connection with Kazakhstan’s Foreign
Investment Law and the ‘Altai Agreement’.

2.1 The 1994 FIL’?

158. Kazakhstan was among the first of the former Soviet Union Republics to adopt a
foreign investment law, on 7 December 1990.'°3 The 1994 FIL was adopted on 27

ee Exh. C-11.
198 See C-Butler I, para 38.

December 1994 and amended on 23 July 1997, and thereafter remained in force until it
was replaced by the 2003 FIL.

159. According to its preamble, the 1994 FIL was to “determine the main legal and
economic foundations for attracting foreign investments to the economy of the Republic
of Kazakhstan, consolidate the state guarantees of the protection of foreign investments,
and determine the organizational forms of their implementation and the procedure for
the settlement of disputes with the participation of foreign investors” (Exh. C-11).

160. Claimants allege that, under the 1994 FIL, Respondent made a series of assurances
on which Claimants legitimately relied and which were later on breached by
Respondent. As such, the 1994 FIL is relevant in three respects:

(i) As an independent undertaking the breach of which would directly engage
Respondent’s liability under this law.

(ii) As a basis relied upon by Claimants to establish the existence and scope of
certain legitimate expectations, the breach of which may constitute a breach of
the FET standard under the ECT and BIT. '*°

(iii) | As an undertaking covered by the Umbrella Clauses of the ECT and BIT, the
breach of which would also constitute a breach of the relevant treaty, thereby
triggering Respondent’s liability thereunder. '°°

161. In particular, Claimants rely on the following provisions:

(ji Article 4(1), which provides as follows:

“The Legal Regime for Foreign Investments

1. Any forms of foreign investments and related activity not prohibited by the
applicable legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan shall be carried out
under conditions no less favourable than those which are granted in a
similar situation to the investments of individuals or legal entities of the
Republic of Kazakhstan or any other foreign individuals and legal entities,
depending on which conditions are most favourable.

[.1*

(ii) Article 6 (hereinafter referred to as the “Stabilization Clause”), which provides as
follows:

Guarantees against Change in Legislation and the Political Situation
1. Should a foreign investor’s position be adversely affected as the result of
change in legislation and/or the enactment and/or amendment of the terms and
conditions of international treaties, the legislation which was in effect at the

participation shall be audited by state agencies in the procedure

established by the legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

3. Inspections by the state tax, sanitary and other inspectorates and state
monitoring and supervisory agencies shall be carried out in accordance
with their competence. Foreign investors shall have the right not to
execute the requirements of such agencies which are outside their
competence and not to provide them with materials not related to their
activity.”

 

2.2. The Altai Agreement

162.

163.

164.

197

The Altai Agreement is the instrument by which Claimants acquired, through the
relevant subsidiaries, the rights over the CHPs and the Hydros (see above para. 29) and
Claimants therefore consider this agreement to constitute the basis of their investments
in Kazakhstan.

In summary, Claimants’ position is that Respondent gave in the Altai Agreement
certain assurances and undertook certain obligations towards Claimants, which
Claimants legitimately relied upon and which were later breached by Respondent. Thus,
in Claimants’ submission, the Altai Agreement is relevant in two respects:

(i) As one of the bases relied upon by Claimants to establish the existence and scope
of certain legitimate expectations, the breach of which constitutes a breach of the
FET standard under the ECT and BIT; 197 and

(ii) As an undertaking covered by the Umbrella Clauses of the ECT and BIT under
which a breach by Respondent of the Altai Agreement would constitute a breach
of the relevant treaty, thereby triggering Respondent’s liability thereunder. '°*

In contrast, Respondent contends that Claimants’ reliance on the Altai Agreement is
based on a misunderstanding and misinterpretation of the relevant provisions of the Altai
Agreement, the ECT and the BIT, and that in any event Kazakhstan has not breached
any of the provisions of the Altai Agreement (RSP Memo 7.7.2011, paras. 114 fol.).

165. The main provisions of the Altai Agreement, which are particularly relevant to the
issues at stake are the following:

(i) With regard to tariffs, Articles 2.8 and 17 provided as follows (Exh. R-006 / C-
001):

“2. Transition Period

 

2.8 Tariffs During the Transition Period, the Company, with the active
support and assistance of the Grantors, shall meet with DAMP and the
Eastern Kazakhstan Territorial Antimonopoly and Pricing Committee and
shall begin work on the determination of an appropriate Tariff structure
for the duration of this Agreement and the adoption of new Tariffs, both in
accordance with Clause 17. If a competitive market for Energy develops
in Kazakhstan, the Company and Concession Company shall have a right
to switch to using market rates for Energy it sells or otherwise realises.

LJ]

17. Tariffs

17.1 The Tariffs will be determined in accordance with Kazakhstan
Legislation.

17.7 In respect of Energy produced, transiting through and transported
for Customers or users outside of the Republic, the Republic
confirms to the Concession Company, their Affiliates and the JSCs
that the Tariffs and contractual conditions are not regulated by
DAMP or any other State Agencies under applicable provisions of
Kazakhstan Legislation and that, accordingly the Company (and/or
its Affiliates), the Concession Company, and the JSCs shall be
entitled to negotiate freely, determine and agree the levels of
Tariffs and all of their other contractual terms.

17.8 Expert

17.8.1 If, in its reasonable opinion, the Company and/or the Concession
Company believes that the Tariffs and the level of payment defaults
by its Customers makes it impracticable to carry out any or all of
the Investment Programme or other Commitments the Company
and/or the Concession Company will be entitled to refer the matter
to the Republic by Notice with a view to agreeing to:

17.8.2 an appropriate immediate adjustment of the Tariffs; or

17.8.3 an adjustment of the level or terms of the Commitments in which
case the Company's obligations will be suspended or adjusted until
resolution of these matters; or

17.8.4 agreements are reached in writing between the Parties as to off-
sets or other mutually acceptable methods of achieving resolution
of all such matters.

179 If no agreement can be reached, the Republic and the Company
will refer the matter to an independent Expert (not being a national
of Kazakhstan or the US) agreed by the Parties, or in default of
agreement, to one (1) Expert appointed by the President or Vice-
President for the time being of the International Chamber of
Commerce of London who shall act as an Expert, but not as an
arbitrator, and whose Costs (in an amount and manner agreed by
both Parties) shall be borne by the Company and whose decision
shall be binding on all Parties.

63

(ii)

17.10 In accordance with clause 2.8, during the Transition Period the
Parties have met, discussed and made progress towards
negotiating an Agreed Tariff Structure, which, when finalised, shall
be initialled by Authorised Representatives of the Parties and
attached to the Sale and Purchase and Concession Agreement as a
new Schedule 18. When this has been done, the Agreed Tariff
Structure will be applied and utilised in determining the Tariffs in
accordance with the provisions of this Clause 17.

With regard to the use of a trading company, Article 7 provides as follows:

“7. Services to Customers

7.1 The Company and its Affiliates shall have the unrestricted right (but not
the exclusive right or any obligation) to supply, transport and sell Energy

collect payments directly from such Customers who are end-users, and in
the absence of prepayment to suspend delivery of Energy to such
Customers who are end-users, provided always that, where appropriate,
the Company or Concession Company will pay reasonable transportation
Costs to any party whose networks the Company or Concession Company
uses. The Company anticipates creating a Kazakhstan Affiliate which will
be responsible for selling Energy to Customers. Customers shall not have
the right to require any one or more of the individual power plants to
provide Energy to them directly, circumventing such Kazakhstan Affiliate,
and the Company and its Affiliates shall have the right to sell such Energy
through the Kazakhstan Affiliate at a blended tariff, which also takes into
account the Cost of Energy to the Kazakhstan Affiliate as well as its Costs
of selling Energy and carrying on its business and operations, subject also
to the provisions of this Agreement on Tariffs.

7.2. The Grantors will facilitate, assist and ensure that the Company, the JSCs
and the Concession Company are able to exercise the rights referred to in
Clause 7.1 and further that they are provided with all rights necessary or
desirable to manage and collect their cash-flows, including:

7.2.1 the right to invoice and collect monies directly from all Customers;

and

7.2.2 the right to install, read and maintain meters at all Points of
Connection with all Customers.

Customer unless:

7.3.1 such services have been ordered by such Customer;

7.3.2 sufficient Energy is available to the Company;

7.3.3 the capacity of the Assets and the Business (taking into account
the demands of other Customers and availability of Energy from
producers and suppliers to the Company) is sufficient payment in
advance is made by such Customers; and provided that provisions of
Clauses 7.3.2 and 7.3.3 will be without prejudice to and shall not
affect the liability of the Company under the provisions of any of the
Company's contracts with Customers for the sale and delivery of
Energy or which otherwise arise in accordance with Kazakhstan
Legislation;

provided always that the Company shall take reasonable measures to mitigate

the matters covered by the indemnity in this Clause 10.1, there shall be no

double- recovery by the Company (including by way of off-set or within the

C. The Arbitral Tribunal’s Jurisdiction and Admissibility of the Claims

I. The Relevant Legal Basis

It is not contested between the Parties that the Arbitral Tribunal’s competence derives
from ICSID’s jurisdiction under Article 25 ICSID Convention and the relevant provisions
of the ECT and BIT, although it is disputed whether such competence can also arise under
the 1994 FIL and the Altai Agreement (see above paras. 125 fol.). What is further disputed
is the Arbitral Tribunal’s scope of competence as deriving from these instruments and
provisions.

To recall, Article 25 of the ICSID Convention provides:

“(l) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising
directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent
subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that
State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the
dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have
given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.

(2,

(a

‘National of another Contracting State’ means:

any natural person who had the nationality of a Contracting State other than
the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to
submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration as well as on the date on
which the request was registered pursuant to paragraph (3) of Article 28 or
paragraph (3) of Article 36, but does not include any person who on either
date also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute;
and

(b,

any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other
than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented
to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person
which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that
date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be
treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this
Convention.

[eed

Article 25 of the ICSID Convention contemplates four fundamental conditions for
jurisdiction of ICSID:

(i) Existence of a legal dispute;
(ii) A dispute arising directly out of an “investment”;
(iii) A dispute between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State;

(iv) Existence of a written consent of both Parties.

2. The Parties’ Positions

2.1 Respondent’s Position

170. Respondent raises the following objections towards the competence of the Arbitral
Tribunal and/or admissibility of the present proceedings: (i) lack of consent to arbitrate
claims arising out of the 1994 FIL, (ii) certain restrictions regarding Respondent’s consent
to arbitrate with regard to Claimants’ investment, (iii) the inadmissibility of Claimants’
claims to the extent they rely on a breach of Kazakhstan competition law.

(i) Lack of Alleged Consent with regard to Claims Under the 1994 FIL

171. By basing part of their claim on an alleged breach by Respondent of the 1994 FIL,
Claimants ignore the following facts:'”

- The 1994 FIL does not apply to electric power regulation and thus does not apply to
any part of their claim. The electricity sector, as a natural monopoly, falls under the
exclusion of “legislation relating to public health and morality”. As such, the
Stabilization Clause in the 1994 FIL was not applicable, and the jurisdictional
provision contained in the 1994 FIL cannot provide a basis for the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal over Claimants’ claims in this regard.”

The 1994 FIL has been repealed by the 2003 FIL and contained no provisions
continuing or “grandfathering” the effects of the 1994 FIL. As such, upon its repeal,
the 1994 FIL in its entirety simply ceased to have effect, and this also applies to the
offer of arbitration contained in Article 27 of the 1994 FIL. In this regard, the
reasoning of the tribunal in Rumeli Telekom A.S. v. Republic of Kazakhstan
(hereinafter “Rumeli”),! ie., that, as a matter of international law, accrued rights
cannot be taken away by domestic legislation, is neither convincing nor strong
authority.” 2

- As aconsequence, at the time of the filing of the Request for Arbitration there was
no existing and valid offer of arbitration by Kazakhstan deriving from the 1994 FIL
which could have been accepted by the Claimants and under which the Tribunal
could have jurisdiction. Thus, disputes under the 1994 FIL are not disputes which
Kazakhstan has consented to submit to ICSID.°

172. Even if the 1994 FIL were to apply, any claim made thereunder would be deemed to be
made on the basis of Kazakh law, and would accordingly be subject to the general 3-year
statute of limitations applicable under Article 178 and 179 of the Kazakh Civil Code. As a
consequence, under the FIL, the Arbitral Tribunal only has jurisdiction over claims of
breach of the FIL which occurred after 11 June 2007 (i.e. less than 3 years prior to the
filing with ICSID of the Request for Arbitration on 11 June 2010), and any claims relating
to events prior to that date are time-barred. This is also the case insofar as the alleged

breaches of both the Altai Agreement and the 1994 FIL are relied upon by Claimants as
constituting a breach of the relevant Umbrella Clauses contained in the ECT and BIT. This
is because, based on CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic (hereinafter
“cms” and El Paso Energy International Company v. Argentine Republic (hereinafter
“EL Paso”),°°° the fact that a claim of breach of obligations under domestic law may
become actionable as a breach of international law does not affect the nature of the
obligations, nor the law applicable to them, including the period of limitation.2°°

173. Finally, even if the Tribunal were to conclude that the 1994 FIL is applicable in the
present case, there has been no material worsening of the position of the Claimants as
regards the law which was applicable at the time of making of the investment. Accordingly,
there can be no breach of the stabilization clause in the 1994 FIL and there is thus no
admissible claim.”

(ii) Restrictions Regarding Respondent’s Consent with regard to Claimants’ Investment

174. | Respondent initially contested the existence of an investment, due to an alleged lack of
clarity surrounding the relationship between Claimants and the entities that negotiated and
concluded the Altai Agreement and Claimants. In particular it was said to be unclear
whether AES Corp. and Tau Power had at the material times an investment in the AES
Entities for the purposes of the Bir*

175. In its Rejoinder, Respondent accepted that AES Corp. was the ultimate owner of the
relevant AES Entities throughout the period in question. However, Respondent stresses two
issues arising from the structure of the AES Group:

- Certain AES Entities in relation to which Claimants claim damages have been held by
AES Corp through structures that did not involve any significant shareholding held
through Tau Power. This would be relevant as regards the assessment of damages,
insofar as Tau Power had no significant ownership in the CHPs and did not own 100%
of the Hydros.

- Claimants did not have and could not have had any investment for the purposes of the
ECT and the BIT until, at earliest, the assignment of the Altai Agreement by AES
Suntree to Tau Power on 28 July 1997.

(iii) — Inadmissibility of Claimants’ Claims in Relation to Alleged Breaches of Kazakh
Competition Law

176. Respondent contends that in putting forward allegations of non-compliance with
Kazakhstan’s competition legislation, Claimants effectively invite the Tribunal to assess de
novo each and every one of the Orders adopted by the Kazakh authorities. Such an
approach would be impermissible and Claimants’ claims would be inadmissible for the
following three main reasons:7!°

(i) Claimants’ claims relating to the application by Kazakh authorities of the
competition legislation to the AES Entities are inadmissible as a consequence of
Claimants’ recourse to the domestic courts in connection with the “fork in the road”
provisions contained in Article 26(4) of the ECT and VI(3)(a) of the BIT and the
wider underlying principle that it is impermissible to bring claims before ICSID
having the same “fundamental basis” as disputes which have already been
submitted and ruled upon by the domestic courts.

In this regard, the relevant test should be that enunciated by the tribunal in
Pantechniki S.A. Contractors & Engineers v. Republic of Albania (hereinafter
“Pantechniki”),”'! which involves assessing whether “the fundamental basis of the
claims sought to be brought before the international tribunal is autonomous of
claims to be heard elsewhere”. The essential and fundamental question as to
whether the competition legislation was correctly applied to the AES Entities by the
competition authorities has already been litigated before the Kazakh courts, and the
Claimants cannot seek effectively to have a second bite at the cherry by now
seeking to challenge those measures as a misapplication of Kazakh law before the
present Tribunal.”!

(ii) It is impermissible for Claimants to disregard the decisions of the Kazakh courts,
and as a consequence, it is only possible for them to submit claims relating to the
application of the competition legislation to the AES Entities insofar as they are
able to establish a denial of justice, in the sense that there was either some serious
procedural shortcoming in the manner in which the Kazakh courts dealt with their
complaints, which rises to the requisite level under international law, or that the
decisions of the Kazakh courts were obviously and manifestly wrong. It is a
precondition of any such claim that all available and effective local remedies have
been exhausted. To the extent that avenues of appeal have not been exhausted, the
Claimants are precluded from complaining of a denial of justice.

In this regard, Claimants based the majority of their claims on legitimate
expectations and breach of the umbrella clause arising out of their interpretation of
the Altai Agreement. Assuming for the sake of argument that the Claimants are
correct in their interpretation of the various provisions of the Altai Agreement,
those arguments (and the arguments based on the supposed stabilizing effect of the
1994 FIL) were undoubtedly relevant to the application of the competition
legislation to the AES Entities. However none of those arguments was raised or
relied upon in the proceedings before the Kazakh domestic courts. In this regard,

22 RSP Rejoinder 25.06.2012, para. 247(a), 248 fol

(iii)

the fundamental problem with Claimants’ claims as to the application of the
competition legislation before this Tribunal is that these claims are purely domestic
law complaints of breach of alleged contractual rights, which Claimants have
attempted to dress up as international claims.7""

Because the AES Entities and Claimants did not raise any of the arguments now put
forward, based on the 1994 FIL or Altai Agreement, before domestic courts, their
claims relating to the application of competition law to the AES Entities are barred
by waiver, acquiescence or extinctive prescription. As a result, the Tribunal is
precluded from hearing Claimants’ claims that the application of the competition
law to the AES Entities constituted a breach of the ECT or BIT.?'*

According to Claimants, the Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction over the present dispute

Legal Disputes: The matters subject to this proceeding are “legal disputes” within
the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, as they turn on the
Claimants’ claims that Kazakhstan has violated their rights under the BIT, the ECT
and the FIL.

Investment: Claimants’ investments in Kazakhstan include in particular:
- Their investment in, and ownership of, the AES Entities;

- Tau Power’s contractual rights under the Altai Agreement and AES
Corp’s interest in those contractual rights;

- Claims to money and claims to performance having an economic value,
including monies improperly confiscated by Kazakhstan and investment
returns.

AES Corp’s investment constitutes an investment under Article I(1)(a) of the BIT
and Tau Power’s investment constitutes an “investment” under Article 1(6) of the
ECT. Claimants’ investments further constitute an “investment” under Article 1 of
the FIL.

Moreover, since the signing of the Altai Agreement in 1997, the Claimants have
invested approximately USD 140 million into the EKO power sector.

Contracting States: The Parties to the dispute are a State (Kazakhstan), a US
company (AES) and a Dutch company (Tau Power). All three countries are
Contracting States within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.

Claimants’ position is in summary as follows:

(i)

(ii)

Written Consent: Kazakhstan’s written consent to submit the current dispute to
ICSID arbitration is established under Article VI(4) of the BIT and Article 26(3) of
the ECT, as well as under Article 27(2)(b) of the 1994 FIL. Citing Rumeli,
Claimants submit that Respondent consented in the 1994 FIL to arbitrate disputes
relating to the electricity sector and to matters of competition, and that this consent
cannot be revoked or ‘repealed’ because it created legitimate expectations in the
investors who reasonably relied upon them when making their investments as set
out in Rumeli?'°

Claimants further contend that both AES and Tau Power have standing to initiate this

AES is a national of the USA and a “company” pursuant to Article I(1)(b) of the
BIT;

Tau Power, as a national of the Netherlands, is a qualifying “investor” pursuant to
Atticle 1(7)(a)(ii).

With regard to Respondent’s objections to the admissibility of Claimants’ claims,

Contrary to Respondent’s assertions, the fork-in-the-road clauses of Article VI(3)(a)
of the BIT and Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT do not operate to bar Claimants’
claims because the dispute presented to this Arbitral Tribunal is different from the
disputes which were submitted to the Kazakh courts by the AES Entities. The
relevant standard to apply to determine whether the disputes are the same is the
‘triple identity test’, i.e. (1) same parties, (2) same object and (3) same cause of
action. Applying this test, it is clear that the Kazakh court proceedings and the
present ICSID proceedings concern different disputes, as they involved different
parties, concerned a different object and rely on different causes of action.
However, even if applying the standard promoted by Respondent, i.e., the
‘fundamental basis’ standard developed in Pantechniki, the claims in this arbitration
are still different as they have an ‘autonomous existence’ outside the failure to
comply with Kazakh law and on legal grounds which have never been relied upon
before the Kazakh courts."

As to the question whether the initiation of arbitration requires the exhaustion of
local remedies, such requirement is not prescribed as a condition for invoking
international arbitration in either the BIT or the ECT. Moreover, the objection is
dependent on Respondent's wholly artificial re-characterization of the claims
advanced in this proceeding as claims for denial of justice, notwithstanding that the
overwhelming majority of Claimants’ claims cannot be characterized as denial of
justice claims. Finally, the AES Entities have exhausted local remedies in all
proceedings where the Kazakh courts are alleged to have failed to comply with
basic due process requirements.

(iii) | Claimants’ claims are not and cannot be time barred because Articles 178 and 179
of the Kazakh Civil Code do not apply to proceedings outside Kazakhstan and
limitation under national law cannot bar claims before ICSID tribunals. In any
event, the statute of limitations does not apply to a claim for full restitution to the
extent that there is a continuing violation of Claimants’ rights under the FIL, the
ECT and the BIT.”

(iv) Claimants’ claims are not barred by extinctive prescription. Notwithstanding the
fundamental doubts whether extinctive prescription is available as a separate
ground to bar treaty claims, it may not apply to the present case in the light of the
absence of any inclusion of a specific limitation for bringing claims by the parties to
a treaty.

3. The Arbitral Tribunal’s Assessment

3.1 Introductory Remarks

180. In this section, the Arbitral Tribunal will examine whether the four basic conditions for
jurisdiction are given (see above para. 169), i.e. (i) the existence of a legal dispute, (ii)
arising out of an investment, (iii) between a Contracting State and a National of another
state, and (iv) based on a written consent. The Arbitral Tribunal will then further examine
whether there may be any procedural admissibility issues preventing it from hearing the
case.

3.2 Legal Dispute

181. The existence of a legal dispute between the Parties is not disputed and clearly arises
from the nature of Claimants’ claims through which they allege a breach by Kazakhstan of
treaty obligations in relation to the promulgation and/or application of national laws and for
which they claim full restitution and/or compensation for the damages arising therefrom.

3.3 Arising out of an Investment

182. It is not disputed between the Parties that the AES Entities as well as the activities
conducted by these entities in Kazakhstan constitute an ‘investment’ (and/or relevant
‘economic activity’) in the sense of Articles 1 of the 1994 FIL, Article 1 of the BIT and
Article 1 of the ECT, as well as Article 25(1) ICSID Convention.”

183. | However, Respondent nevertheless raised a series of issues with regard to the nature of
the dispute as arising out of such investment (see above paras. 170 fol.):

~ RSP C-Memo 7.10.2011, para. 518.

74

(i) Qualification of Claimants as ‘Investors’

184. Respondent initially disputed that Claimants had established their ownership of the
investment made in Kazakhstan (RSP Memo, paras. 24-28; 86 fol.; 545 fol.). However, in
its Rejoinder, Respondent stated that “[i]n the light of the documents disclosed by the
Claimants, the Respondent accepts that AES Corp was the ultimate owner of the relevant
AES Entities in the period in question (i.e. from 2004 onwards)” (RSP Rejoinder
para. 320).

185. | As such, Respondent accepts that AES Corp. owned the concerned ‘investments’ and/or
thereto related ‘activities’ in Kazakhstan and qualifies as ‘investor’ in the meaning of
Article I(1)(a) BIT and Article 1 1994 FIL.

186. | Respondent does not dispute that Tau Power was assigned the rights under the Altai
Agreement and that it further owned several of the concerned AES Entities. Thus, it is not
disputed that Tau Power owned the concerned ‘investments’ and/or thereto related
‘activities’ in Kazakhstan and qualifies as ‘investor’ in the meaning of Article 1(6) of the
ECT and Article 1 1994 FIL. As concerns Respondent’s arguments regarding Tau Power’s
shareholding in the CHPs and Hydros (see above para. 175), they relate to the issue of
quantum and are irrelevant to the question of jurisdiction or competence. They will
therefore be dealt with, to the extent necessary, when dealing with the quantum of
Claimants’ claims (see below paras. 444 fol.).

(ii) Time of the Investment

187. | Respondent argues that Claimants did not have and could not have had any investment
for the purposes of the ECT and the BIT until, at the earliest, the assignment of the Altai
Agreement to Tau Power on 28 July 1997 (see above para. 175).

188. It is true that Tau Power only acquired the relevant ‘investment’, i.e. the contractual
rights deriving from the Altai Agreement, once it became a party to the Altai Agreement,
i.e. on 28 July 1997 (see above para. 30). However, since the ECT only entered into effect
between Kazakhstan and the Netherlands on 16 April 1998, the precise time at which the
investment occurred prior to that date is not material for jurisdictional purposes under the
ECT.

189. As concerns the time of investment and its relevance to jurisdiction under the BIT,
Respondent does not dispute that AES Corp. was at all relevant times the ultimate owner of
the AES Entities, which were partly established before the entering into of the Altai
Agreement. Further, it appears that AES Corp. was at all material times (including the date
of signature of the Altai Agreement) the beneficial owner of AES Suntree, which was the
original party to the Altai Agreement (see above para. 6). As such, AES Corp. made the
relevant investment relating to the Altai Agreement with the signature of such agreement
by AES Suntree.

190. Claimants’ ‘investments’ consist in a set of assets and rights, the rights arising under
the Altai Agreement being only one of them. The date of entering into and/or of assignment
of the rights under this Agreement cannot determine the temporal scope of Claimants’
entire investment. It is not possible to determine one single date at which Claimants’ entire
investment was made, and the Arbitral Tribunal will examine relevant dates where

75

necessary when dealing with Claimants’ specific claims and in the light of the specific
investments subject to those claims.

(iii) | Contractual Claims vs. Treaty Claims

191. | Respondent argues that the present legal dispute is actually a claim about the breach of
contractual rights, which has been dressed up as international treaty claim.

192. It is generally accepted that the concept of ‘investment’ under Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention does not necessarily extend to every general commercial dispute, and in
particular not to every contractual dispute. It is however also widely accepted that a breach
of contract may under certain circumstances also constitute a breach of treaty, where the
standard breached and the rights affected by such breach fall within the scope of protection
of the treaty.

193. In the present case, the Arbitral Tribunal is of the opinion that Claimants’ claims as
submitted before the present Arbitral Tribunal are not of a purely contractual nature. While
it is true that Claimants’ claim relate to an alleged breach of the Altai Agreement, the basis
for Claimants’ claim for restitution and/or compensation is not that the Altai Agreement
itself has allegedly been breached. Claimants’ claims are based on the argument that the
alleged breach of the Altai Agreement also constitutes (i) a breach of Claimants’ legitimate
expectations thereunder of such nature that it violates the substantive protections afforded
by the provisions of the 1994 FIL, the ECT and the BIT, and (ii) a breach of the Umbrella
Clause of the ECT and BIT. The relevant breaches are the alleged breaches of the FIL, the
ECT and the BIT, not the alleged breach of the Altai Agreement. In addition, the alleged
breaches directly relate to the promulgation and the application of Kazakh law by Kazakh
administrative and judicial authorities. The enactment of laws is necessarily an exercise of
state power and is thus different from a dispute over the performance or non-performance
of contractual obligations.

194. As such, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that Claimants’ claims arise ‘directly out of an
investment’ in the sense of Article 25(1) ICSID Convention.

3.4 A dispute between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State

195. | While Respondent had initially raised a series of objections regarding the qualification
of Claimants as ‘investors’, which it later on withdrew (see above para. 185), it has never
contested the fact that AES Corp. is a US company and Tau Power is a Dutch company.
Kazakhstan, the United States of America and the Netherlands are all three members to the
ICSID Convention.

196. The majority of Claimants’ claims relate to acts and decisions taken by the competition
authorities, the Kazakh courts and/or Ministries and departments. It is well-established that
acts and omissions of State organs such as administrative authorities and judicial bodies are
attributable to the State, and this is not disputed by Respondent. Respondent however
contends that some of Claimants’ claims involve actions of a state-owned company and/or
individual members of legislature that are only attributable to the State to the extent that

A i - st, 223 . . .
they constitute an exercise of governmental authority.“~ The Arbitral Tribunal considers

~ RSP C-Memo 7.10.2011, paras. 664 fol.; RSP Rejoinder 25.06.2012, paras. 815 fol.

16

the issue of attribution as a matter relating to the merits of the case and will thus deal with
any issue of attribution where relevant for any specific claim.

197. As such and as a matter of principle, the present dispute is admittedly between ‘a
Contracting State’, i.e. Kazakhstan, and nationals of two other Contracting States, i.e. AES
Corp as US company and Tau Power as Dutch company. To the extent that the Arbitral
Tribunal would be inclined to grant a claim based on the actions of a non-state organ, it
would beforehand decide on any issue of attribution.

3.5. Written Consent
198. It is undisputed that Respondent has consented in writing to the following:

(i) According to Article 26(1)-(5) of the ECT, to submit disputes “relating to an
Investment [...], which concern an alleged breach of an obligation [...] under Part
III [of the ECT]” to ICSID arbitration (see above para. 126 (ii)).

(ii) According to Article VI(1)-(4) of the BIT, to submit disputes concerning “an
alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an
investment” to ICSID arbitration (see above para. 125126(iii)).

199. It is further undisputed that Claimants’ initiation of the present ICSID proceedings
constitutes an acceptance by Claimants of Respondent’s offer to submit disputes arising out
of investments falling under the scope of the ECT and BIT respectively to ICSID
arbitration.

200. Respondent submits, however, that there is no valid written consent to refer disputes
arising out of the 1994 FIL to ICSID arbitration for the reasons mentioned above (see
paras. 171- 172).

201. In this regard, the issues with regard to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over disputes arising
out of the FIL are twofold: (i) ratione materiae, does the 1994 FIL apply to the electricity
sector? ; (ii) ratione temporis, can Claimants base a claim on the 1994 FIL after the latter’s
repeal?

202. With regard to the scope of application ratione materiae of the 1994 FIL, Respondent’s
main argument is that the electricity sector falls within the matters excluded from the 1994
FIL under Article 6(3), namely “defence potential, national security, ecological safety and
public health and morals’, or alternatively under the exception of “questions of taxation
and other measures of State regulation” of Article 6(4).*4

203. The Arbitral Tribunal is not convinced by that argument for the following reasons:
204. First, it should be noted that the electricity sector is not explicitly named in Article 6(3),
which lists specific excluded fields. One could only consider the electricity sector as

excluded by Article 6(3) if one considered that (i) the list of excluded fields is for
illustration purposes only, i.e., not exhaustive, and any area similar to those listed therein

24 R-Butler I, paras. 44-45; R-Butler II, paras. 22 fol.; London Transcript Day 4 p. 237 1. 22-24 —p. 2381. 1.

77

should be treated as being excluded, or (ii) the electricity sector is part of one of the listed
fields.

205. Given the importance of a law such as the 1994 FIL, one should not simply assume that
a list as the one mentioned in Article 6(3) is for illustrative purposes only. On the contrary,
given the importance of the 1994 FIL, the need for legal security and predictability and the
specific wording of Article 6(3), one should rather presume that the list of excluded fields
is exhaustive. Respondent has not asserted the contrary and has in particular not tried to
demonstrate the non-exhaustive character of the list. Thus, the Arbitral Tribunal considers
that the list of excluded fields of Article 6(3) is exhaustive.

206. Second, given the exhaustive nature of the list, the only possibility left for the
electricity sector to be excluded from the scope of application of the 1994 FIL is if it can be
subsumed under any of the listed categories. In this regard, Prof. Butler makes the
argument that the electricity sector can be considered part of ‘national security’ and or
‘public health and morals’. While the Tribunal concedes that certain aspect of the
electricity sector, such as ensuring supply of energy, may under certain circumstances give
rise to issues of ‘national security’, this is hardly the case for issues relating to the
management of competition in the electricity market. The fact that electricity may qualify
as ‘strategic goods’ under the 1998 Natural Monopoly Law is in this regard irrelevant.
The same reasoning applies with regard to the concept of ‘public health and morals’. The
electricity market is of a commercial nature, and while being an important component of a
country’s economy, it is not of a nature to constitute per se and in its entirety a matter of
‘ordre public’, even supposing that the phrase ‘public health and morals’ can be given that
wide meaning. As concerns the concept of ‘taxation and other State regulation’, there is
no indication that these terms would have been meant to include competition regulations in
the field of electricity supply. The Arbitral Tribunal accordingly decides that the present
dispute is not excluded from the ambit ratione materiae of the 1994 FIL by the terms of
Article 6(3)-(4) of that law.

207. | With regard to the scope of application ratione temporis of the 1994 FIL, Respondent’s
arguments touch upon two main questions: (i) is it possible for a State to revoke its consent
to ICSID arbitration given in a national law ?, and — if so — (ii) what are the conditions for
such revocation, and how does revocation affect rights that an investor may have acquired
under the 1994 FIL ?

208. As to the question whether Respondent may revoke its consent to ICSID arbitration as
contained in a national law by simply revoking this law, there are two main ways to
approach this issue:

(i) The first one, is to consider that a host State is free to change its investment
legislation and this freedom includes the right to change the provision concerning
the State’s consent to ICSID’s jurisdiction. In case of the repeal of a law, an offer of
consent that is contained in that law and that has not been taken up by the investor
will lapse. This approach relies on the same reasoning as applicable with regard to
the submission and withdrawal of offers in a contractual context.

78

(ii) The

retract a unilateral commitment.

second approach is to rely more on principles of international public law, and
in particular on the concept of ‘unilateral declarations’, according to which, upon
the fulfillment of certain conditions, a State does not have complete freedom to
This approach may also be supported by the
principle of the doctrine of estoppel and the principle of interpretation of treaties in
good faith. In accordance with these principles, a party is precluded from acting
contrary to its own declaration, when such declaration was made in unequivocal

terms and the other party has relied upon it.

209. While Respondent relies on the first approach to make its argument that Kazakhstan
validly withdrew its consent to arbitrate and that the Arbitral Tribunal therefore does not
have jurisdiction to hear claims arising out of the 1994 FIL, Claimants rely on the second

approach as well as on the Rumeli award.

210. In the Rumeli award, which involved the very same provision of the 1994 FIL, the

arbitral tribunal ruled as follows:
“333. [...] The fact that the [1994 FIL] was repealed as of January 8, 2003, does

334.

335.

336.

not have an impact on ICSID jurisdiction. The [1994 FIL] was indeed valid
and effective at all times relevant to this dispute. Article 6(1) of the Law
provides that “[i]n the case of a deterioration of the position of a foreign
investor, which is a result of changes in the legislation and (or) entering into
force and (or) changes in the provisions of international treaties, to foreign
investments during ten years the legislation shall be applied which had been
current at the moment of making the investment, and with respect to the
investments which are carried out in accordance with the long-term (more
than ten years) contracts with the authorized State bodies, until the expiry of
the effect of the contract, unless the contract stipulates otherwise.” Jn other
words, Article 6(1) grants foreign investors protection against adverse
changes in legislation for a period of ten years from the date they made their
investment, or for the entire duration of the contract exceeding ten years
entered into with authorized State bodies. This is the case here. The relevant
investments were made by Claimants from 1998 to 2002, and the Investment
Contract entered into between Claimants and Respondent on May 20, 1999,
was valid until June 31, 2009, i.e., for a period of more than ten years.

 

Respondent has expressed its consent to ICSID arbitration on December 28,
1994, the date of the entry into force of the FIL, and it remains applicable to
the dispute pursuant to Article 6(1). On the other hand, Claimants have
consented to ICSID jurisdiction by filing their Request for Arbitration. The
Arbitral Tribunal has therefore jurisdiction under the FIL.

 

Besides Article 6(1), it is also well established in international law that a
State may not take away accrued rights of a foreign investor by domestic
legislation abrogating the law granting these rights. This is an application of
the principles of good faith, estoppel and venire factum proprium.

The Arbitral Tribunal has therefore jurisdiction under the FIL. It notes
however that the FIL is invoked by Claimants only as an alternative basis for
the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. In this respect, the Tribunal has reached the
conclusion that since the protection granted to foreign investors by the FIL is
fully covered by the provisions of the BIT, it need not refer to it to decide the
claims submitted by the parties in this arbitration.”

 

79

211. Claimants rely on the Rumeli award to make the argument that “Kazakhstan's offer or
consent to ICSID arbitration is irrevocable if it creates legitimate expectations in the
investors who reasonably relied upon it and reasonably considered it to be irrevocable by
making their investments”.2*> Claimants say that they reasonably relied on the terms of the
FIL at the time their investment was made, and that in view of further relevant legal
principles such as pacta sunt servanda and the principle of non-retroactivity, and the
application of the Stabilization Clause, Respondent’s consent to arbitrate must be seen to
have remained in force for the entire duration of the Altai Agreement.””°

212. In contrast, Respondent alleges that the “observations of the Tribunal in Rumeli are not
strong authority” and make a “self-referential boot-strapping use of the Stabilization
Clause” which finds no basis in Kazak law.??” Respondent contends that, to the extent that
the 1994 FIL as a whole was repealed, both the jurisdictional provision and Article 6(1)
ceased to have any effect. Article 6(1) could therefore not operate to keep the jurisdictional
provision alive following the repeal of the 1994 FIL in 2003.

213. The Arbitral Tribunal is of the following opinion:

214. It is widely acknowledged that a party’s consent to submit a dispute to ICSID
arbitration jurisdiction must be in writing and once given the withdrawal of that consent is
not a matter that falls entirely within the unfettered discretion of that party (Article 25(1)).
This is a fundamental principle of ICSID arbitration.

215. | However, it cannot be accepted that a State is always unable to revoke its consent, even
where such consent is established by a provision in a national law which the State remains
free to amend or repeal. The specific scope, duration and effectiveness of a party’s consent,
in particular where such party is a State, is a matter to be considered in the specific context
of each treaty and each such provision.

216. Thus, in the view of the Arbitral Tribunal, the question as to the extent to which the
repeal of a national law containing a written consent of the State to submit a particular
dispute to ICSID arbitration has the effect of revoking the State’s consent given thereunder
is not a question that can be answered in general terms. This question is very much case-
specific and must be examined in the light of the specificities of ICSID arbitration, the
sovereignty of States with regard to their national legislation, the aim and object of the
relevant national law and the protection afforded therein, as well as the specific wording of
the relevant legal instruments.

217. As far as the 1994 FIL is concerned, Article 27 of such law constitutes a standing
consent on part of the State to submit “[d]isputes and differences which arise in connection
with foreign investments or activity related thereto” to ICSID arbitration. Such standing
consent can be ‘activated’ by either the State or the investor, on condition that the investor
also gives its written consent. The question is whether the State’s acceptance of jurisdiction
can be revoked, and if so, on what conditions.

80

218. Firstly, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that the question of the revocation of consent to
arbitrate is, as a matter of law, a different question from the revocation or repeal of a
statute. A State remains free at all times to amend its legislation. This does however not
mean that the change or repeal of such legislation automatically has the effect of changing
or repealing any consent to arbitrate that had been established by such legislation.

219. Secondly, the question is whether the possibility of revoking a State’s consent to
arbitrate depends on whether such consent has already been activated by the concerned
investor. While such a difference is usually made in contract law, allowing an offeror to
withdraw its offer with immediate effect as long the offeree has not accepted it, the Arbitral
Tribunal considers that in view of the objectives of the ICSID Convention and the nature of
treaty claims, it would not be appropriate inflexibly to apply this simple principle regarding
offer and acceptance borrowed from general contract law. Here again, the answer to this
question will therefore depend on the specific instrument at stake and the scope and nature
of the consent given therein.

220. In the present case, the 1994 FIL itself provided an assurance that there could be no
immediate unilateral withdrawal of rights by the State that adversely affected foreign
investors. The Arbitral Tribunal has given careful consideration to (i) the nature and
purpose of the 1994 FIL, i.e. to encourage and protect foreign investment including through
the possibility of ICSID arbitration in case of a breach of such protection, (ii) the wording
of Article 27 of the 1994 FIL, which (like the remainder of the FIL) does not indicate any
possibility of revoking the consent to arbitrate given therein, and (iii) Article 6 of the 1994
FIL (the ‘Stabilization Clause’, which is analysed further below), which creates an
expectation on the investor’s side that its investment will benefit from such protection for a
duration of at least 10 years. All point to the conclusion that the right to arbitrate given by
the 1994 FIL cannot be terminated unilaterally and with immediate effect by the repeal of
the FIL. There is, indeed, no evidence beyond the general repeal of the 1994 FIL that
Respondent had any intention of cancelling its ‘standing consent’ to arbitration.

221. Accordingly, the answer to the question whether a particular dispute arising out of an
investment is covered by Kazakhstan’s consent to arbitrate should depend on the time of
making of the investment, and not on the time of filing of the claim. This is because
Kazakhstan must be held accountable for the specific expectations it raised through the
promulgation of a specific law in place at the time of the investment, and this
accountability includes in the present case the right to resort to specific remedies and
procedures in case of breach. Thus, Claimants were entitled to expect that Kazakhstan
could be held liable for any breach of the FIL according to the remedies and procedures
stipulated in that law to be available. A later change of remedies should not influence the
accountability of Kazakhstan with regard to investments that were made before such
change and which were meant to be protected for a certain duration. Thus, the Arbitral
Tribunal agrees with the tribunal in Rumeli to the extent that it considers that a consent
given by a State in a national law to submit certain disputes to ICSID arbitration may not
be revoked without due regard for the legally-recognized expectations raised by the State
under such law, which include inter alia expectations concerning available legal remedies.

81

222. In conclusion, while Kazakhstan remained free at all times to amend the 1994 FIL
according to its own agenda, to the extent that any such amendment led to the revocation of
its consent to ICSID arbitration, in view of the aim and objective of the 1994 FIL, the
nature and scope of the protection afforded therein (and in particular Article 6(1)), as well
as the overall circumstances of the case, such revocation may only be effective for the
future, i.e. in relation to investments made after the repeal of the 1994 FIL.

223. Therefore, with regard to claims arising out of investments made during the
effectiveness of the 1994 FIL, Kazakhstan’s consent remains in force. The fact that
Claimants raised such claims only after the repeal of the law has no impact on the consent,
and may only become relevant with regard to the question whether such claims may be
considered time-barred. The Arbitral Tribunal is however of the opinion that this is not a
matter of jurisdiction, but rather of substance. It will therefore be dealt with, so far as is
necessary, when examining Claimants’ claims arising out of the 1994 FIL.

3.6 ‘Admissibility’ Requirements

224. Respondent contends that Claimants’ claims are inadmissible. It raises three main
arguments relating respectively to (i) Article 26(4) the ECT and VI(3)(a) BIT and their
alleged fork-in-the road nature, which would prevent Claimants from bringing the same
claims before two different instances, (ii) the alleged failure by Claimants to exhaust local
remedies, and (iii) the alleged waiver, acquiescence and/or extinctive prescription of
Claimants’ claims.

(i) Fork in the Road?

225. Respondent argues that Claimants’ recourse to the Kazakh courts had the effect of
barring Claimants from submitting ‘fundamentally the same claims’ to ICSID arbitration
based on the fork-in-the-road provisions of Article 26(4) of the ECT and VI(3)(a) of the
BIT.

226. In this regard, and referring to what has been said above (see paras. 191 fol.), the
Arbitral Tribunal is of the opinion that Claimants’ claims as submitted in the present ICSID
arbitration are different from those filed by Claimants with the Kazakh courts and that they
can thus not be barred by any fork-in-the-road provision.

227. The Arbitral Tribunal is of the opinion that this is the case irrespective of the standard
applied, i.e. whether applying the ‘triple identity test’ or the ‘fundamentally same’ test
under Pantechniki. While it is true that the claims before the Kazakh courts and in the
present proceedings are based on the same facts and in particular the same alleged basic
wrongdoings by Respondent (i.e., the implementation of new laws), they present important
differences which do not justify considering these claims as having “fundamentally the
same [normative] basis”.

228. The key difference between the claims is as follows: through the court proceedings
before the Kazakh courts, Claimants mainly sought to invalidate decisions of the
competition authorities with regard to the listing of the AES Entities on the Monopoly
Register and to challenge orders through which fines and penalties were imposed on the
AES Entities for allegedly anti-competitive behavior. Claimants did so mainly arguing that
the relevant authorities had misapplied the relevant Kazakh competition law.

82

229. Claimants’ claims in the present proceeding have a different dimension and meaning:
While the implementation by the Kazakh authorities of the new Kazakh competition law
plays an important role in the present proceedings, it does so only from a factual
perspective in the sense that it is one of the factual causes for Claimants’ treaty claims in
the present ICSID proceedings. In other words, it is the result of the Kazakh court
proceedings, i.e. the confirmation by Kazakh courts that the Kazakh competition law was
applied correctly by the administrative authorities, which led Claimants to file a claim for
breach of the protection allegedly afforded to Claimants under the ECT, BIT and 1994 FIL
in connection with legitimate expectations arising out of and other assurances made in the
Altai Agreement. Had the Kazakh courts decided differently, the treatment of Claimants
under the law would have been different and the effect on Claimants’ alleged legitimate
expectations would also have been different.

230. In summary, the Kazakh court proceedings are a factual foundation of Claimants’ treaty
claim. They determined whether the new laws were applied correctly and to what extent
Claimants’ legitimate expectations and/or other treaty protection rights were adversely
affected. Thus, depriving Claimants of the possibility to file treaty claims in the present
ICSID proceedings because of the prior conduct of such proceedings before the Kazakh
courts would be inadequate.

(ii) Exhaustion of Local Remedies

231. Respondent’s argument is that Claimants’ claims with regard to the application of
Kazakh law (which was already subject to the Kazakh court proceedings) may only be
examined under the standard of ‘denial of justice’ and this would firstly require that all
local remedies have been exhausted.

232. There are different views among scholars and arbitral tribunals regarding the
qualification of a requirement of ‘exhaustion of local remedies’ as a matter of jurisdiction,
admissibility and / or substance. As concerns Respondent, it submits that the question of
the standard to be applied to examine whether Claimants’ claims are well-founded is a
question of substance and not of jurisdiction. 228

233. As to whether the exhaustion of local remedies is a jurisdictional requirement, suffice it
to say at this stage that neither Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, nor Article 26 of the
ECT, Article VI of the BIT, nor Article 27 of the 1994 FIL provide for such requirement.

234. As such, the Arbitral Tribunal is of the opinion that the exhaustion of local remedies is
not a jurisdictional requirement in the present case. Whether or not a similar argument may
operate as an admissibility requirement is a question that may remain open, to the extent
that it would apply only in case the Arbitral Tribunal agreed with Respondent with regard
to the application of the standard of ‘denial of justice’. It will therefore be dealt with, if
necessary, when examining the relevant standard for measurement of the alleged breach of
treaties.

(iii) | Waiver, Acquiescence and/or Prescriptive Extinction

235. Respondent contends that Claimants’ claims relating to the application of competition
law to the AES Entities are barred by waiver, acquiescence or extinctive prescription,
because neither the AES Entities nor Claimants previously raised before domestic courts
any of the arguments now put forward and based on the 1994 FIL or Altai Agreement.

236. With reference to what has been said above with regard to the nature of Claimants’
claims (see paras. 191 fol.) and for the same reasons that the Arbitral Tribunal rejected
Respondent’s argument of fork-in-the-road (see above paras. 225 fol.), the Arbitral
Tribunal considers that Claimants’ claims cannot be deemed to have been waived,
acquiesced or extinguished on the ground of Claimants’ non-invocation of certain
arguments at an earlier stage.

237. In this regard, it should be stressed that it clearly arises out of the record that Claimants
repeatedly and insistently objected to the way in which the local authorities applied Kazakh
law. The fact that they first resorted to local authorities to raise claims under Kazakh law
does not prevent them from later on resorting to ICSID arbitration where the proceedings
before the local authorities laid part of the factual foundation of the claims and where the
dispute presented to the Tribunal consists of alleged breaches of relevant treaty protections.

4. First Conclusion

238. Based on the above considerations, the Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear
Claimants’ claims as submitted in this proceeding and there is no procedural
impediment preventing it to hear such claims.

D. For the Period from 2004 to 31 December 2008

I. The Issues

239. Claimants’ claims against Respondent for the period from 2004 to 31 December 2008
relate primarily to the way Kazakhstan promulgated and then applied new laws and
regulations in the field of competition law to the AES Entities.

240. In this regard, Claimants’ case is that Kazakhstan did not apply those laws in a rational,
proportionate, non-arbitrary and reasonable way in pursuance of a rational policy goal, and
thereby improperly frustrated the Claimants’ legitimate expectations and further breached
relevant standards of protection under the 1994 FIL, the ECT and the BIT.

241. Based thereon, Claimants raise two sets of claims, i.e. one set of claims relating to
alleged breaches of the 1994 FIL and one set of claims relating to alleged breaches of the
ECT and BIT.

(i) With regard to the 1994 FIL, Claimants contend that Respondent’s breach is
threefold:°°

- Kazakhstan’s promulgation and application to the AES Entities of the
changes in Kazakh legislation was inconsistent with the guarantees
provided under the Stabilization Clause of Article 6 of the 1994 FIL as
their effect was to worsen Claimants’ position compared to their position
under the legal regime applicable to them at the time of entering into the
Altai Agreement.

- Kazakhstan breached Article 8 of the 1994 FIL by adopting ‘acts and
decisions’ in respect of the AES Entities, which were not in accordance
with, or not envisaged under the legal regime applicable to them at the
time of entering into the Altai Agreement.

- Kazakhstan breached Article 13 of the 1994 FIL by repeatedly failing to
comply with its own laws.

(ii) With regard to the ECT and BIT, Claimants raise four different types of claims:

- A breach of the FET standard under Article 10(1) of the ECT and Article
II(2)(a) of the BIT consisting in the failure (i) to respect Claimants’
legitimate expectations, (ii) to provide a transparent, stable and
predictable legal environment, (iii) to prevent coercion and harassment,
(iv) to act in good faith, and (v) to accord due process.”*

230 CL Reply 30.03.2012, paras. 386 fol.

85

- A breach of the duty to refrain from adopting unreasonable or arbitrary
measures under Article 10(1) of the ECT and Article II(2)(b) of the BIT
by (i) unreasonably and arbitrarily applying competition law to the AES
Entities, (ii) determining that activities of AES Entities contemplated
under the Altai Agreement are in breach of competition law and (iii)
resorting to coercion and harassment.”*!

- A breach of the Umbrella Clauses contained in Article 10(1) of the ECT
and Article II(2)(c) of the BIT consisting in the failure by Kazakhstan to
comply with its obligations under the 1994 FIL and the Altai
Agreement.”

- A breach of the standard of full protection and security under Article
10(1) of the ECT and Article II(2)(a) of the BIT consisting in the failure
to provide a secure investment environment.”

242. In Respondent’s view, Claimants claims are entirely unfounded. Claimants’ claims rely
primarily on the issue of stabilization. Without stabilization, and subject to Claimants’
other alleged legitimate expectations, this arbitration is simply about the meaning of
Kazakhstan legislation, and the application of the legislation to Claimants, taking into
account their activities in Kazakhstan. In this regard, Respondent’s position is that
Claimants were not stabilized in a manner that precluded subsequent changes to Kazakh
competition law under the 1994 FIL, the 2003 FIL or the Altai Agreement and as such,
they were fully subject to Kazakh competition law as it evolved over time. As to the
meaning and application of Kazakh competition law, Respondent contends that the Kazakh
authorities applied the new laws to the best of their knowledge and such application was
largely in line with standards applied in other countries, namely the European Union. In
this regard, it is insufficient for Claimants to allege only that the Republic’s competition
agency got it wrong and there is no basis in international law that would permit an
international tribunal to treat as international wrongs the mere alleged misapplication of
domestic legislation and principles, whether by the courts or by administrative bodies.
Claimants would have to prove a substantive denial of justice.”

 

243. It is not disputed between the Parties that the legal framework of Kazakh competition
law changed and that Kazakhstan was entitled to amend that legal framework. It is also not
disputed that Claimants were in principle subject to this framework.”** What is disputed is
(i) whether the application of such new laws and regulations were in breach of any relevant
treaty protection standard, and (ii) to what extent the answer to this question depends on
whether or not Claimants’ rights were stabilized under the law in place at the time of the
investment and/or whether or not Claimants were frustrated in their legitimate expectations.

244. Based thereon, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that there are three key issues to be
determined in connection with Claimants’ claims:

(i) The issue of stabilization, i.e. whether Claimants were stabilized and, if so, whether the
promulgation and application of the changes in the Kazakh Competition Law was in breach
of the stabilization guarantee;

(ii) The issue of legitimate expectations, i.e. what were Claimants’ legitimate expectations,
were these legitimate expectations frustrated and to what extent may such a frustration give
rise to a treaty claim; and

(iii) The issue of other breaches, i.e. whether Kazakhstan’s application of the law can be
deemed to have breached relevant treaty standard and how this question may be influenced
by the previous two.

2. Stabilization

2.1 Introductory Remarks — the Role of the Stabilization Clause

245. While Respondent alleges that Claimants’ case relies primarily on the issue of
stabilization,?* Claimants contend that their case is primarily a claim that the measures
taken by Kazakhstan were irrational, arbitrary and unreasonable, and were not taken in
pursuance of a rational policy goal.?*” Thus, the Stabilization Clause is only one among
several aspects of Claimants’ claim and, even if the Stabilization Clause does not apply,
Claimants submit that Kazakhstan has still breached its obligations under the ECT, the BIT
and other provisions of the FIL.

246. After examining the structure of Claimants’ claims, the Arbitral Tribunal is of the
opinion that the Stabilization Clause plays an important role in the present proceedings:

247. Claimants’ claim regarding the Stabilization Clause of Article 6 of the 1994 FIL
constitutes the legal basis giving rise to the following treaty claims:

(i) An independent claim for breach of Article 6 of the 1994 FIL for which the Arbitral
Tribunal has direct jurisdiction based on Article 27 of the 1994 FIL;

(ii) An independent claim for breach of the BIT and ECT pursuant to the operation of
the Umbrella Clauses in those treaties.

248. In addition, the issue of stabilization is also relevant as a factual basis for the following
claims:

(i) Claimants’ claim of breach of Article 8 of the 1994 FIL, to the extent that this claim
is based on the argument that “acts or decisions against the AES Entities were
based on competition laws that were not in effect when the investment was made”
and thus amount to illegal acts prohibited under Article 8 of the 1994 FIL.** The

premise of this claim is that Kazakhstan was not entitled to apply the new
legislation to the AES Entities, i.e., that the AES Entities were stabilized;

(ii) Claimants’ claim of breach of the FET standard in connection with alleged
legitimate expectations: Claimants rely on the Stabilization Clause to establish the
‘legitimate expectation’ that no detrimental changes in legislation would be applied
to the Claimants’ investments.””

249. Thus, the issue of stabilization is an issue affecting various aspects of Claimants’
claims, and will therefore be dealt with first.

2.2 Existence, Scope and Effect of Stabilization (Relevant Standard of Measurement)
(i) The Parties’ Positions

250. Claimants’ case is that while the Stabilization Clause does not prevent Kazakhstan from
enacting new legislation, it does require Kazakhstan to refrain from applying those laws
against covered investors when such application would have an adverse effect on their
investments. In other words “the Stabilization Clause effectively froze the legal regime that
was in place at the time the parties entered into the Altai Agreement, insulating the
Claimants’ investment from any adverse changes in the legal environment as a result of
legislation, decrees, regulations, rules, or orders issued under those regulatory
instruments” >“

251. Respondent in contrast contends that Claimants are not entitled to claim the benefit of
stabilization under the FIL for the following main reasons:*"!

- The 1994 FIL does not apply for the reasons set out above in para. 171;

- Even if stabilization had taken place, Claimants would have been stabilized as a Natural
Monopoly, listed on the Natural Monopoly Register and subject to strict price control
under the 1995 Electricity Law, namely in a far less beneficial regime than that to
which it is presently subject;

- The findings made against Claimants in the Kazakh courts were also made pursuant to
the Kazakhstan Constitution and Civil Code, which would apply to Claimants even in
case of stabilization;

- Thus, there would have been no worsening of the situation of the Claimants, as required
by Article 6 of the 1994 FIL. In this regard, the term ‘worsening’ of Article 6 of the
1995 of the 1994 FIL should not be interpreted as preventing modifications to the law
through an incremental process of reform, to the extent that the position of the investor
has not in fact been substantially affected. Instead, it should be understood as having
provided protection against substantial changes in the law having a material effect on
the situation of an investor, such as, for example, the passing of a law resulting in the
prohibition of an activity (constituting an investment) which was previously permitted.
“Its role was not and cannot reasonably be argued to have been, as the Claimants

240 CL Memo 28.04.2011, paras. 282-283.

allege, to preserve the law in aspic as at the date at which an investment was made.
Such an interpretation of Article 6 of the 1994 FIL is wholly unreasonable and would
be unworkable in practice; it would result in a fragmented legal system, with different
investors subject to different laws, despite the fact of their formal repeal” (RSP Memo,
para 586);

- In any event, the choices made by the Kazakh legislature in regulating matters of
competition or prices within the electricity energy sector were entirely reasonable,
transparent and fully in accordance with internationally accepted approaches to
regulation of competition and of pricing in the electrical energy sector. In such
circumstances, the Stabilization Clause may only be relied on against an alleged breach
by the imposition of new regulations where the host state is also in breach of separate
international law obligations. With no breach of a separate international law obligation,
there can be no basis for encroaching Kazakhstan’s sovereign right to enact legislation.

(ii) The Arbitral Tribunal’s Assessment

252. The Arbitral Tribunal is of the opinion that the Stabilization Clause of Article 6 of the
1994 FIL applies to Claimants’ investment for the following reasons:

253. At the time Claimants made their investment, the 1994 FIL was effective and Claimants
were therefore entitled to expect to be granted the protection afforded by the 1994 FIL and
that, for the same reasons as mentioned above in paras. 214-223, such protection could not
simply be revoked unilaterally without due regard to Claimants’ expectations as raised
under such law. Thus, the Stabilization Clause applies to Claimants’ investments.

254. The next question concerns the scope of the Stabilization Clause and whether the
changes in Kazakh competition law implemented by Kazakhstan breached the scope of
stabilization afforded thereunder. This requires the interpretation of Article 6 of the 1994
FIL.

255. Article 6 of the 1994 FIL is construed as follows: Article 6(1) provides for a
stabilization effect in case of ‘adverse effects’, meaning that new legislation shall not apply
to Claimants in case such new legislation would “adversely affect the position of the
foreign investor” (see above para. 161(ii)). However, Article 6(3) provides for certain
carve-outs stating that the stabilization shall not apply to changes in the legislation of the
Republic of Kazakhstan in “the area of ensuring defence potential, national security,
ecological safety and public health and morals”. In such areas, Kazakhstan remains free to
change its laws, although Kazakhstan may have a duty to compensate Claimants for such
changes where they “adversely affect the position” of Claimants. In summary, the key
element of Article 6 is the effect of changes of law and its purpose is to provide
stabilization only where changes in law would ‘adversely affect’ the investor’s situation.
The nature of such stabilization is however different depending on the area of the
concerned law varying from a ‘freezing’ effect to a duty to compensate Claimants for the
adverse effects. Further, the duration of stabilization is afforded for a minimal period of 10
years, and where such investments are made under long term contracts of more than 10
years, for the entire duration of the contract.

256. Thus, Article 6 of the 1994 FIL does not provide for an absolute stabilization, and

instead limits the scope of the stabilization based on three factors : (i) the effects produced
by the changes, by requiring in any event that such changes ‘adversely affect’ the investor’s

89

rights, (ii) the nature of laws subject to change, whereby changes in “the area of ensuring
defence potential, national security, ecological safety and public health and morals” are
subject to a limited protection in the sense that the investor may not be ‘frozen’ in its rights
and may only claim for compensation for the adverse effects, and (iii) based on a time limit
determined according to the short or long term nature of the investment at stake.

257. Thus, the key question under Article 6 of the 1994 FIL is whether the changes in the
Kazakh competition law and its application to Claimants had the effect of ‘adversely
affecting’ Claimants’ situation. If no such adverse effects affect Claimants’ investment, the
Stabilization Clause does not provide any protection, be it a ‘freezing’ of Claimants’ rights
or a compensation for the adverse effects.

258. That being said, besides the 1994 FIL, a further duty of stabilization may arise out of
the FET standard. It is generally admitted that the FET standard, as contemplated in Article
TI(2) lit. (a) of the BIT and Article 10(1) of the ECT, includes certain guarantees of stability
and transparency of the applicable legal framework. However, under such FET standard,
‘stabilization’ simply means that changes in law may not be of such nature to compromise
the basic transparency, stability or predictability of the existing legal framework.

259. The Arbitral Tribunal does not consider it necessary to determine whether the standards
under Article 6 of the 1994 FIL and the FET principle are actually different, because the
Arbitral Tribunal considers, as further elaborated below (paras. 261 fol.), that the
concerned changes in legislation effected and implemented from 2001 to 31 December
2008 were not of a nature to breach either of these two standards.

(iii) — Conclusion

260. In summary, Article 6 of the FIL 1994 applies to Claimants and protects them, at least
for the duration of the Altai Agreement, from changes in the Kazakh competition law
which would have adversely affected their position, and the key question is therefore
whether the changes in the law as implemented by Kazakhstan had the effect of ‘adversely
affecting’ Claimants’ rights.

2.3. Application and Breach of Stabilization
(i) The Parties’ Positions

261. According to Claimants, the relevant applicable legal framework at the time of the
investment was the Original Competition Law. Claimants maintain that based on Article 2
and 7 of the Original Competition Law, Claimants were subject thereto. In addition, the
1995 Electricity Law and the Original Competition Law occupy altogether different fields.
The 1995 Electricity Law is sector-specific legislation which simply does not deal with
competition regulation and it cannot be cogently compared with the 2001 and 2006
Competition Laws. Therefore, the effect of the changes resulting from the 2001
Competition Law and the 2006 Competition Law should be assessed in comparison to the
position prevailing under the Original Competition Law.”

Compared to the legal framework in place at the time of the investment, Claimants

With regard to the 2001 Competition Law, Claimants contend that it introduced the

it provided for the establishment of a “Monopolies Register”, which would list
entities considered ‘dominant’;

it provided the ‘Anti-Monopoly Agency’ (hereinafter referred to as
“Competition Agency”) with new powers, such as the establishment and
maintenance of a ‘Monopolies Register’ listing entities deemed to have a
dominant position and the application to such entities of regulated tariffs;

it lowered the structural dominance threshold by introducing new standards for
so-called “joint dominance”, whereby the market share of several market
entities could be combined in order to deem those entities “jointly” dominant.
In this respect, in addition to the 35% market share threshold for a single entity,
the 2001 Competition Law provided that market entities would also be
considered structurally dominant if: (1) the aggregate share of two entities
amounted to 50% or more of the relevant goods market; or (2) the aggregate
share of no more than three entities amounted to 70% or more of that market.

New provisions on liability (Articles 23-24), supplemented by a new Article 147
of the Code for Administrative Violations dated 30 January 2001 (hereinafter
referred to as “the Administrative Code”). These provisions changed the
amount of fines that could be imposed on dominant entities.

However, it is Claimants’ position that the 2001 Competition Law maintained the ‘two-
limb test’ requiring proof of both a structural and a behavioral dominance in order to
establish that an enterprise is to be considered dominant as a matter of Kazakh law."

With regard to the 2006 Competition Law, Claimants contend that it introduced the
lowing changes:”*°

it removed the requirement that a market entity had to abuse its position of
structural dominance in order to be listed on the Monopolies Register: under the
2006 Competition Law, that entity could be placed on the Monopolies Register
if it simply had a high market share. However, in order to submit them to price
controls, the Competition Agency was still required to find that an entity had
actually abused its dominant position (Articles 9 and 31);

 

it further expanded the concept of joint market dominance by lowering the
relevant thresholds of market shares necessary (but not sufficient) to qualify as
‘dominant’ to 15% (instead of 35% under the Competition Law 2001). It further
introduced the concept that a group of companies should be treated as a “single
market player” for competition purposes;

- it expanded the types of agreements which could be invalidated on the basis that
they are “anti-competitive” or constitute “concerted actions”, by listing eight
types of separate types of illegal agreements (compared to four types under the
Competition Law 2001);

- it conferred additional discretionary powers on the Competition Agency, namely
with regard to the issuance of fines and administrative penalties.

265. With regard to the 2008 Competition Law, Claimants contend that while it did not
represent a dramatic change from the 2006 Competition Law, it remained — as the 2006
Competition Law had been - vastly different from the Original Competition Law.”

266. Consequently, the application to the AES Entities of the 2001 Competition Law, 2006
Competition Law and 2008 Competition Law and the regulations related thereto constituted
a breach of the stabilization guarantee provided by Kazakhstan under Article 6 of the 1994
FIL and Article 2.8 of the Altai Agreement to the extent that it worsened their position in
comparison to that prevailing under the Original Competition Law in force at the time they
made their investment in Kazakhstan.*4”

267. According to Respondent, at the time of entering into the Altai Agreement, the
electricity sector was not subject to the Original Competition Law but to the 1995
Electricity Law and associated tariff setting regulations. Under the 1995 Electricity Law,
all electricity generation companies were classified under Kazakh law as “natural
monopolies” and were, for that reason, subject to tariffs set by the State Regulating
Commission on a ‘cost plus’ basis in accordance with Article 6(3) of the 1994 FIL.
Therefore, even if the 1994 FIL imposed continuing obligations (which is denied), the
Stabilization Clause could not have “frozen” obligations under the Original Competition
Law (which was not applicable to Claimants at the time of the investment).”

268. With the entering into force of the Natural Monopolies Law 1998, the electricity
generation sector ceased to be qualified as “natural monopoly” and thus became subject to
the Original Competition Law. Thus, from that point on, AES Entities could have been
placed on the Monopolies Register if and to the extent that they were deemed to hold a
dominant position." This is eventually what happened:

(i) Firstly, the Original Competition Law did not provide for a 2-limb test: structural
dominance was in itself sufficient to qualify an entity as dominant, and behavioral
dominance was only relevant to determine whether conduct was prohibited and
whether sanctions should be applied.”

 

(ii) With regard to the 2001 Competition Law, Respondent’s position is that this law
constituted a “restatement of preceding law as to the regulation of anti-competitive
conduct, although it also included elements of consumer protection”.?>

(iii) | With regard to the 2006 Competition Law, Respondent contends that the approach
to definition of the relevant market remained broadly similar. In particular, the
central concept remained, as it had done under the Original Competition Law, the
notion of interchangeability of goods from the perspective of purchasers. However,
in contrast to the position under the Original Competition Law, detailed provision
as to applicable criteria for determination of the geographical boundaries of the
relevant market was contained in the 2006 Competition Law itself, rather than being
contained in regulations adopted by the relevant agency.”

(iv) With regard to the 2008 Competition Law, Respondent contends that Claimants
actually accept that the 2008 Competition Law did not represent a dramatic change
from the 2006 Competition Law.

269. Further and in any case, Respondent maintains that none of the modifications to the
competition law are in fact of a character or seriousness such as to engage Respondent’s
international responsibility. Fundamental concepts under the original Competition Law
have not changed throughout the evolution of Kazakhstan competition law, such as the
concepts of relevant market, market share, finding of dominance, abuse of dominant
position, fines and damages as sanctions of abuse, and the tariff regime. Changes to
Kazakh law have of course been made, but this was envisaged by the ECT, and would and
should have been anticipated as at the period of conclusion of the Altai Agreement.?

(ii) The Arbitral Tribunal’s Assessment

270. The key issue is whether the above mentioned changes fall within the scope of
protection of the Stabilization Clause, i.e. whether they adversely affected Claimants’
position as an investor. For the purpose of this examination, the Arbitral Tribunal will rely
on the way the Kazakh authorities applied the relevant provisions.

271. The Arbitral Tribunal considers that the changes made by Kazakhstan to its competition
legislation and applied to the AES Entities cannot be deemed to have ‘adversely affected’
Claimants’ position under Article 6 of the 1994 FIL for the following main reasons:

272. Where a new law is promulgated and implemented, it must be looked at in its entirety,
and it must also be put into its general context. Stabilization cannot mean that an investor
is entitled to cherry-pick favorable provisions in a new legislation and request to be
exempted from the application of unfavorable provisions. This would not only be
unmanageable, but it would also create problems of transparency and predictability as to
which provisions apply to a particular investor and which do not. The fact that specific
provisions within the general legal framework may have had adverse effects on Claimants’
operations and business cannot therefore be sufficient to conclude that Claimants’ position
was ‘adversely affected’ under Article 6 of the 1994 FIL.

273. In this regard, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that at the time of entering into the Altai
Agreement (which forms the main basis for Claimants’ position that the changes in Kazakh
competition law adversely affected their position), i.e. in 1997, the relevant legal
framework applicable to Claimants’ activities was primarily the 1995 Electricity Law.
While the Arbitral Tribunal acknowledges that the Original Competition Law and the 1995

os RSP C-Memo 7.10.2011, para. 206 fol.
~ RSP C-Memo 7.10.2011, paras. 176, 193-194, 334 fol.

93

Electricity Law may have had different scopes of application, the key issue which
constitutes the core of Claimants’ claims, i.e., the prices which electricity generators were
entitled to charge, was strictly regulated by the 1995 Electricity Law. Under this Law, all
generation companies were classified under Kazakh law as ‘natural monopolies’ and were
for that reason subject to regulated tariffs set by the State Regulating Commission (see
Article 6 of the 1995 Electricity Law).

274. Thus, the starting point for measuring any adverse effects on Claimants’ situation is
their situation under the 1995 Electricity Law, and not under the Original Competition
Law.

275. Claimants are not alleging that the ‘adverse effect’ consists in the application of the
Original Competition Law to the AES Entities as compared to the application of the 1995
Electricity Law. Instead, Claimants rely on the various subsequent changes made to the
Original Competition Law through the 2001 Competition Law, the 2006 Competition Law
and the 2008 Competition Law to establish an adverse effect compared to the regime in
place under the Original Competition Law.

276. Thus, the relevant standard for measurement of the adverse nature of any effects on
Claimants’ position is the 1995 Electricity Law and Claimants have failed to establish that
the promulgation of the 1998 Natural Monopolies Law, which had the effect of subjecting
Claimants’ activities to the Original Competition Law, led to any such ‘adverse effects’.

277. In addition, even if Claimants were right that the relevant standard for measurement of
‘adverse effects’ should be the Original Competition Law, Claimants would still have
failed to establish the existence of an adverse effect under Article 6 of the 1994 FIL. The
amendment of the Kazakh Competition Law in 2001, 2006 and 2008 followed a political
will to further develop competition. The privatization of the electricity generation sector
constituted a clear improvement beneficial to Claimants and the aim of the various legal
amendments implemented by Kazakhstan was to establish a competitive market in the field
of energy generation and trading. It is undisputed that the establishment of a competitive
market would have been to the benefit of Claimants. Moreover, the changes made to the
Kazakh Competition Law and which are the subject of Claimants complaints are not of an
extraordinary nature and similar principles exist in other countries. They follow a common
approach to the regulation of markets in the general public interest.

278. In this regard, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that Claimants reliance on the
amendment of specific elements of the law, such as the threshold for qualifying as
dominant, the definition of relevant market, etc. is not sufficient per se to establish an
‘adverse effect’ under Article 6 of the 1994 FIL and is therefore not sufficient to trigger the
protection of the Stabilization Clause.

279. As concerns the question of breach of ‘stability’ as afforded under the FET standard,
the Arbitral Tribunal finds that there is no such breach. In view of the general purpose of
the changes made to Kazakh competition legislation, which was to develop competition
within the electricity market, it was clear from the very beginning of the investment that
Kazakhstan would be reforming its competition law. Such reforms were expected and
encouraged, as they were to benefit all market players, i.e. including Claimants. Therefore,
the mere fact that some of these changes may have resulted in certain circumstances in
disadvantages to Claimants is not sufficient to result in a breach of the guarantee of
‘stability’ provided under the FET standard under Article 10(1) of the ECT and Article

94

II(2)(a) of the BIT. Whether further aspects of the FET standard may have been breached
through the application to Claimants of the Kazakh competition legislation will be
examined further below (paras. 308 fol.). At this point, suffice is to say that the FET
standard did not provide Claimants with a right to be stabilized in their previous position so
as to be exempt from changes in Kazakh competition legislation.

(iii) — Conclusion

280. Claimants have failed to establish that, compared to the situation under the 1995
Electricity Law which was the key legal regime in place at the time of their main
investment (i.e., the execution of the Altai Agreement), the promulgation and application
by Kazakhstan of the various iterations of its competition law ‘adversely affected’
Claimants’ position.

281. Accordingly, Claimants have failed to establish that they should have been ‘protected’
from the promulgation and application by Kazakhstan of its competition legislation. To the
extent that this competition legislation did not lead to adverse effects, it does not fall within
the scope of guaranteed stabilization afforded under Article 6 of the 1994 FIL. To the
extent that it brought a major improvement to the general market condition and framework,
it can also not lead to a breach of the ‘stability’ protection afforded under the FET standard
of Article 10(1) of the ECT and Article II(2)(a) of the BIT.

282. Whether or not the effect of any such specific change may be in breach of relevant
protection standards afforded under the ECT and/or the BIT will be dealt with when
examining the relevant standards (see below paras. 305 fol.). It may however not give rise
to a separate claim based on the Stabilization Clause.

3. Legitimate Expectations

3.1 Claimants’ Alleged Legitimate Expectations

283. According to Claimants, the provisions of the Altai Agreement, together with
provisions of the FIL, the Restructuring Resolution, the Original Competition Law and the
ECT, considered in conjunction with the circumstances in which the Altai Agreement was
concluded, reflected and gave rise to, inter alia, the following legitimate expectations on
the part of Claimants as concerns the period prior to 2009:5

(i) Based on Article 2.8 of the Altai Agreement and the Restructuring Resolution,
Claimants would have the right to charge market-based tariffs once the electricity
generation sector changed to a competitive market structure.

(ii) Based on Article 7.1 of the Altai Agreement, Claimants’ power generation
companies would have the right to pool the energy they produced and sell it
centrally through locally incorporated trading affiliates and would not be required to
make direct sales to customers which would circumvent sales through the trading
affiliate, and Claimants would also have the right to pool the energy they produced

and make sales at a blended tariff taking into account the cost of purchasing energy
from multiple generators.

Based on Article 13.1 of the Altai Agreement and Article 8 of the 1994 FIL,
Kazakhstan would refrain from taking any action that would have a material
adverse effect on the Claimants’ investments or their enjoyment of their rights
under the Altai Agreement and, further, would ensure that any enforcement action
taken by the Kazakh authorities would be consistent with applicable requirements
of the then-prevailing Kazakh law.

Based on Article 10.1 of the Altai Agreement, Claimants would be indemnified for
losses resulting from any breaches of the Altai Agreement and from any change of
law (including new legislation) that materially reduced, prejudiced or otherwise
adversely affected their investments. Moreover, based on Article 6 of the 1994 FIL,
Claimants would not be subject to legislation which was more adverse to their
investment than legislation prevailing at the time of the signature of the Altai
Agreement.

Based on Article 13.1 of the Altai Agreement, Article 8 of the 1994 FIL and Article
6 of the ECT, the AES Entities would only be subject to rational competition
policies which are applied in a reasonable and proper manner for the purpose of
deterring or redressing anti-competitive conduct.

The AES Entities would not be subject to price control or other sanctions by the
Kazakh Government in a competitive market setting merely because the AES
Entities (i) were the owners of assets transferred to them under the Altai Agreement
or (ii) collaborated with each other to pool the energy they produced and market it
through locally incorporated trading affiliates.

Based on Article 32 of the Altai Agreement, Kazakhstan would resolve disputes by
way of international arbitration.

In view of the changes brought by the revisions of the Kazakh competition law,
according to Claimants, these legitimate expectations have been unduly frustrated by the
actions of Kazakhstan and such actions cannot be justified by reference to valid

wpe . 2
competition policy concerns.

55

According to Respondent, Claimants’ asserted legitimate expectations relate principally
to Claimants’ claims as to the application of the competition law, and there are two broad
categories relating to (i) the asserted expectation of a right to charge market prices in a
competitive market and not to be subject to intervention in their pricing policies, and (ii)
the asserted expectation of a right to use a trading company and to charge a blended tariff.
However, Respondent disputes Claimants' interpretation of the various provisions of the
Altai Agreement relied upon in that regard, and denies that Claimants could, or in fact did,
hold any legitimate expectations having the content alleged as at the time of making their
investment.

3.2 The Arbitral Tribunal’s Assessment

286. The Arbitral Tribunal considers that — for the period up to 31 December 2008 —
Claimants assert four different kinds of expectations:

(i) Expectations of a stabilization of their position towards legislation being more
adverse to their investment;

(ii) Expectations regarding the way in which Claimants were allegedly entitled to be
treated under relevant Kazakh competition law, in particular with regard to their
asserted right to sell electricity at market rates and to do so through central trading
companies using blended tariffs;

(iii) | Expectations that Kazakhstan would only apply rational competition policies in a
reasonable and proper manner for the purpose of deterring or redressing anti-
competitive conduct.

(iv) | Expectations that Kazakhstan would resolve disputes arising out of the Altai
Agreement by way of arbitration.

287. Claimants’ submissions under this heading are all directed to the effects, actual and
potential, of the revisions of the Kazakh competition law.

288. With regard to Claimants’ asserted expectation that they would not be subject to
legislation with adverse effects on their situation, the Arbitral Tribunal has already
indicated, in its analysis of Claimants’ arguments under the Stabilization Clause in the FIL
(see above paras. 280-282), that it does not consider that Claimants had any legitimate
expectation that Respondent would not amend its general competition law in the general
public interest, or that Claimants would be exempt from the application of any such
revisions.

289. Similarly, the Tribunal does not consider that any of the successive amendments of the
competition law were of such a nature as to violate any legitimate expectations under the
ECT and / or the BIT. Investments are made in the context of the general regulatory
framework of the host State, and it would require the very clearest of commitments on the
part of the State to refrain from adjusting that regulatory framework in some specified
manner to give rise to any expectation that an investment would be insulated from the
effects of normal legal and regulatory evolution. This is particularly the case where (as
here) that evolution takes the form of the introduction of commonly-used regulatory
mechanisms in pursuit of goals that had been clearly announced at the time when the
investment was contemplated and made.

290. With regard to Claimants’ alleged expectations as concerns market prices and trading
practices, they derive primarily from the Altai Agreement, in particular Articles 2.8 and 7.1
of the Altai Agreement. The key question here is whether the provisions of the Altai
Agreement were such as to give rise to a legitimate expectation falling under the scope of
protection under the ECT and BIT, and the frustration of which would constitute an
independent breach of the FET standard.

291. For the reasons exposed above (see paras. 191-194), a breach of contract does not per
se trigger a breach of treaty protection. It will be a breach of treaty only if the legitimate

expectation is of such nature as to justify its protection under the relevant treaty and its

97

frustration is of sufficiently serious character to constitute an independent breach of the
relevant treaty protection standard. Thus the concept of ‘legitimate expectation’ in a treaty
claim is not necessarily coterminous with a legitimate expectation a party may have under a
contract. Furthermore, a contractual right constitutes a ‘legitimate expectation’ protected
by treaty only where there are factors other than the simple fact of the existence of the
contract which justify giving the expectation of performance of the contract the status of a
legitimate expectation protected by the treaty. In this regard, it is necessary to take into
account the overall circumstances giving rise to the legitimate expectation and its
frustration, such as the basis for the expectation, reliance upon it in practice, the reasons
and context for its frustration, etc.

292. As concerns Article 2.8 (see above para. 165(i)) and Article 7.1 of the Altai Agreement
(see above para. 165(ii)), the Arbitral Tribunal does not consider that these provisions were
of a nature to give rise to a legitimate expectation protected under the FET standard as
asserted by Claimants. Their wording is very broad and key terms such as ‘market rates’,
‘competitive market’ and ‘blended tariffs’ are not defined. The Parties have very different
views as to what these terms mean and how they should be interpreted. In view of the
stage of development of the Kazakh economy and the stage of legislative development in
the field of electricity and competition, these provisions do not suffice to establish a
‘legitimate expectation’ protected and enforceable under the FET standard that Claimants
would be entitled under any circumstances to apply ‘market prices’ in the sense of what
they considered to be a ‘competitive market price’ or to use a trading company and sell
goods at a ‘blended tariff irrespective of whether such practice may have breached
applicable competition legislation.

293. It is true that, in view of the size of Claimants’ investment and activities, the application
of the Original Competition Law and its later iterations to Claimants had the effect of
qualifying them as dominant entities. Claimants therefore contend that they never got a fair
chance to benefit from the more liberal competition framework. However, put in other
words, Claimants assert that they had a ‘legitimate expectation’ to be exempted from the
legal provisions applicable to monopolies, and the frustration of such legitimate
expectation would be in breach of the FET standard. The Arbitral Tribunal has already set
out why the Stabilization Clause is of no avail to Claimants in the present case and that it
can in particular not serve to be exempted from particular legal provisions of a law, while
remaining subject to other more beneficial provisions.

294. With regard to Claimants’ asserted expectation that Kazakhstan would only apply
rational competition policies in a reasonable and proper manner for the purpose of deterring
or redressing anti-competitive conduct, the Arbitral Tribunal is of the opinion that this
expectation is covered by the principles of FET under Article 10(1) of the ECT and Article
TI(2)(b) of the BIT and the obligation to refrain from unreasonable and arbitrary measures
under Article 10(1) of the ECT and Article II(2)(b) of the BIT. Thus, Claimants’ asserted
legitimate expectation in this regard is nothing more than a legitimate expectation that
those protection standards would be applied by Kazakhstan. Therefore, the real question is
whether the competition legislation as promulgated and applied by Kazakhstan was in
breach of any of those protection standards.

295. The Altai Agreement contains in Article 32 an Arbitration Clause providing for ICC
arbitration in London (see above para. 165(vii)). While this provision may give rise to a
contractual expectation to resort to arbitration, such contractual expectation may not per se
suffice to give rise to a ‘legitimate expectation’ protected under the FET standard. Thus the

98

mere frustration of such contractual expectation may per se not trigger a breach of the FET
standard, unless further circumstances surrounding the frustration of Claimants’ contractual
expectation are such as to breach certain protection standards afforded under the FET.
Whether this is the case in the present case is dealt with below (paras. 322-323).

3.3. Conclusion

296. Accordingly, the Tribunal does not consider that Claimants had any legitimate
expectations under the ECT and / or the BIT that were breached by the amendments of
Kazakh competition law.

297. The Arbitral Tribunal considers it important to stress that these conclusions are drawn
based on a concept of ‘legitimate expectation’ as relevant for the purpose of determining
the scope of treaty protection. The ruling of the Arbitral Tribunal in this regard bears no
prejudice to the question whether Claimants may have had similar expectations of a
contractual nature. This is a matter of contractual interpretation subject to the law
applicable to the contract and therefore beyond the scope of jurisdiction of the present
Arbitral Tribunal.

4. Impact on Claimants’ Claims

4.1 Claims based on the FIL
(i) Claim for Breach of Article 6 FIL

298. As mentioned above (paras. 252 fol.), the Arbitral Tribunal found that the scope of
stabilization provided for under Article 6 of the 1994 FIL does not cover the changes made
by Kazakhstan to relevant competition legislation for the reason that such legislation did
not ‘adversely affect’ Claimants in comparison to the regime in place under the 1995
Electricity Law.

299. Accordingly, Kazakhstan cannot be deemed to have breached the stabilization
guarantee provided for in Article 6 of the 1994 FIL by promulgating and applying to the
AES Entities the changes in its competition legislation.

(ii) Claim for Breach of Article 8 FIL (Illegal Actions)

300. Claimants assert that Kazakhstan breached Article 8 of the 1994 FIL by (i) adopting
‘acts and decisions’ against the AES Entities, which were not in accordance or not
envisaged under the legal regime applicable to them at the time of entering into the Altai
Agreement, and by (ii) frustrating Claimants’ legitimate expectation that the AES Entities
would only be subject to rational competition policies which are applied in a reasonable
and proper manner for the purpose of deterring or redressing anti-competitive conduct.
Measures taken by Kazakhstan in breach of these two principles would constitute illegal
acts in the sense of Article 8 of the 1994 FIL.””

257 CL Reply 30.03.2012, paras. 505 fol.

99

301. The first part of Claimants’ claim relies on the assumption that the legal regime
applicable to the AES Entities at the time of entering into the Altai Agreement’ was the
Original Competition Law. However, as explained above (paras. 270-279), the relevant
legal regime was the 1995 Electricity Law. In addition, the Arbitral Tribunal found that the
application to the AES Entities of the Original Competition Law and its amendments was
generally more advantageous than the application of the 1995 Electricity Law and does
therefore not fall under the scope of stabilization provided for under Article 6 of the 1994
FIL or give rise to a similar expectation of stabilization under the FET standard under
Article 10(1) of the ECT and Article II(2)(a) of the BIT. As such, this part of Claimants’
claim must fail.

302. As concerns the second part of Claimants’ claim, as mentioned above (see para. 294), it
is already covered by Claimants’ claims for breach of the FET Standard under Article 10(1)
of the ECT and Article II(2)(a) of the BIT and the obligation to refrain from unreasonable
and arbitrary measures under Article 10(1) of the ECT and Article II(2)(b) of the BIT.
Thus, the Arbitral Tribunal will deal with the substance of this claim when examining a
breach of the relevant treaty provisions and does not need to make an independent finding
on the basis of Article 8 of the FIL.

(iti) | Claim for Breach of Article 13 FIL (Excess of Power)

303. Claimants assert that Kazakhstan exceeded its powers by repeatedly failing to comply
with its own laws and thereby breached the standard of Article 13 of the 1994 FIL.

304. The Arbitral Tribunal is of the opinion that Article 13 of the 1994 FIL does not
establish a standard, which is different from the standard already afforded under the FET
Standard under Article 10(1) of the ECT and Article II(2)(a) of the BIT and the obligation
to refrain from unreasonable and arbitrary measures under Article 10(1) of the ECT and
Article II(2)(b) of the BIT. Thus, the Arbitral Tribunal will deal with the substance of this
claim when examining a breach of the relevant treaty provisions and does not need to make
an independent finding on the basis of Article 13 of the 1994 FIL.

4.2 Claims based on the ECT & BIT
(i) Standard of Review

305. Claimants’ claims of a breach of the ECT and the BIT are based on two primary
assumptions; (i) that the legal regime applicable to them was stabilized under the Original
Competition Law, and (ii) that Kazakhstan repeatedly misapplied its own laws. Claimants
further assert that, even if the Arbitral Tribunal found that the legal regime was not
stabilized and Kazakhstan correctly applied its own law, Kazakhstan’s actions would still
qualify as unreasonable or arbitrary under Article 10(1) of the ECT.

306. Thus, Claimants’ claims are closely related to the way Kazakhstan applied its own law.
In this regard, it should be stressed that the role of an international arbitral tribunal hearing
treaty claims is not to determine whether the domestic law of a respondent State was
correctly applied or not, in the way that a local appeal court might do. The Tribunal’s role
can only be to determine whether the application of such legislation was of such nature as
to breach relevant treaty protection standards, such as FET.

100

307. One may debate whether or not Kazakhstan correctly applied its own law; and indeed
the record shows that this question was submitted to various judicial bodies in Kazakhstan.
It is not the role of the Arbitral Tribunal to re-assess whether these bodies were mistaken in
their understanding of their country’s own legislation. The Tribunal will base its decision
on the way such legislation was in fact applied and determine whether such application
may be in breach of any relevant treaty standard.

(ii) Claim for Breach of FET under Article 10(1) of the ECT and Article II(2)(a)
of the BIT

308. Claimants claim that there was a breach by Kazakhstan of the FET standard under
Articles 10(1) ECT with regard to Tau Power and Article II(2)(a) of the BIT with regard to
AES Corp.

309. Claimants substantiate their claim of breach of the FET standard based on the following
key arguments:>**

(i) that Kazakhstan failed to respect Claimants’ legitimate expectations;

(ii) that Kazakhstan failed to provide a transparent, stable and predictable legal
framework;

(iii) that Kazakhstan failed to prevent coercion and harassment of staff members of the
AES Entities;

(iv) that Kazakhstan acted in bad faith;

(v) that the AES Entities were not afforded due process when litigating before the
Kazakh courts and administrative authorities regarding the application of Kazakh
competition laws and regarding the Kazakh Supreme Court’s ruling that the
Arbitration Clause in the Altai Agreement was invalid.

310. In addition, Claimants contend that, even if any of these individual circumstances do
not in themselves amount to a breach of the FET standard, their accumulation, taken
together, must lead to the conclusion that Kazakhstan failed to accord fair and equitable

treatment to the AES Entities.”

311. | According to Respondent, the Parties largely agree on the general standard under the
FET principle, and the dispute between them only concerns the application of that standard
to the circumstances of the present case. In particular, the dispute centers on whether, in all
the circumstances, and in particular in the light of the conduct of the AES Entities, the
measures adopted by the Respondent were legitimate and justified. In this regard,
Respondent insists that its promulgation and application to the AES Entities of successive
modifications to the competition law prior to 2009 were justified and legitimate in view of
the overall circumstances including the state of the electricity market in Kazakhstan and the
challenges it faced, as well as the effects thereon of the AES Entities practices.?

101

312. With regard to the various arguments relied upon by Claimants in support of their claim
of breach of the FET standard, Respondent replies as follows:7"!

(i) There can be no breach of the FET standard based on an alleged frustration of
asserted legitimate expectations to the extent that Claimants’ alleged legitimate
expectations were unfounded.

(ii) With regard to Claimants’ claim as to a lack of transparent, stable and predictable
legal framework, Claimants’ case is reliant on supposed assurances of stability
made through either the 1994 FIL or the Altai Agreement. As such, it is
indistinguishable from, and adds nothing to, the Claimants case based on frustration
of their supposed legitimate expectations based on those provisions. To the extent
that that case fails, the claim relating to change of legislation must likewise fail.

However, even if Claimants’ case with regard to the FET standard was not tied to
their asserted legitimate expectations, it would equally fail. To the extent that
Claimants’ case is based on changes in legislation per se, i.e., is independent of
Claimants’ alleged legitimate expectations, Claimants failed to establish that the
different iterations of the competition legislation in fact resulted in a lack of either
transparency, stability or predictability in a fashion such as to breach the FET
standard. To the extent that Claimants’ case is based on a misapplication of
Kazakhstan’s own laws and thereby results in an inconsistent and arbitrary
application, Claimants fail to establish that (i) Kazakh law was misapplied, and that
(ii), if misapplied, it would have been misapplied in such a way as to amount to
‘inconsistent and arbitrary’ treatment under the FET standard. The mere
misapplication of domestic law does not as such constitute, without more a breach
of international law.

(iii) | With regard to Claimants’ claim of failure to prevent coercion and harassment of
the AES Entities and their employees, Respondent says that it is unsubstantiated
and not worthy of credit. Claimants have failed to articulate the consequences that
a finding of breach in this regard would have on their claims for damages.
Claimants have also failed to show that the investigative measures adopted by the
competent Kazakh authorities were in any way improper, and were not properly
undertaken in the context of criminal investigations into the conduct of the AES
Entities.

(iv) With regard to Claimants’ claim of breach of due process in relation to the
application of competition law, Claimants failed to discuss the relevant standard for
denial of justice under international law. Claimants’ case is solely based on the
proposition that the judgments of Kazakh courts “were grossly inadequate, as they
endorsed the unreasonable and arbitrary criteria applied by [the] regulator
imposing significant penalties and damages on the AES Entities” and that “the
judgments failed to analyse the key allegations and evidence raised by the AES
Entities in the course of the proceedings, thereby failing to conduct an independent
analysis and reasoning of the case and simply endorsed the content of the orders”.
According to Respondent, these propositions are unsubstantiated and unproven. It
is only insofar as it is shown that a particular interpretation was grossly and patently

261 RSP Rejoinder, paras. 539 fol., 559 fol., 582 fol., 611 fol.

102

wrong and inconsistent with the terms of the relevant law that any complaint can be
made.

(v) With regard to Claimants’ claim of a lack of good faith in the application of
competition law, Claimants’ case boils down to its assertion, on the one hand, that
the competition legislation was applied ‘abusively’, and on the other, that it was a
breach of good faith for Respondent first to enter into the Altai Agreement and then
to declare that “the business activities envisaged in that agreement are in breach of
national law”. As to the first point, Respondent’s position is that Claimants failed
to establish that the competition authorities acted in bad faith in adopting relevant
measures in application of the competition legislation against the AES Entities. As
to the second point, it overlaps with Claimants’ alleged legitimate expectation that
they would not be subject to regulation merely on the basis that they acquired
generator assets. Thus, to the extent Claimants’ alleged legitimate expectations are
unfounded, their case based on bad faith fails too.

 

(vi) | With regard to Claimants’ claim in relation to the application of competition law on
the theory of a cumulative or ‘global’ breach, Respondent doubts that Claimants’
theory of ‘global breach’ of the FET standard is at all admissible. In any case,
Respondent denies that its application is appropriate in the circumstances of the
present case. Contrary to the approach taken by the tribunal in the E/ Paso case on
which Claimants rely, in the present case, the various measures and conduct relied
upon here by Claimants cannot be characterized as forming a ‘composite act’, and
do not all contribute concurrently to the same loss claimed by Claimants. In
addition, even if Claimants were to establish a breach of the FET standard as a
consequence of combination of the application to the AES Entities of the
competition legislation and the other matters relied upon, the cause of the alleged
loss in respect of which compensation is claimed is a series of individual measures
each of which constitutes the sole and unique cause of a certain potential loss. As
such, even if the Tribunal were to conclude that, as an accumulation of a number of
the various measures relied upon by Claimants, there had been a breach of the FET
standard, this would not justify the award of the full amount of compensation
claimed by Claimants by way of past loss of profits and incremental costs.

313. The Arbitral Tribunal finds as follows regarding the various sub-claims advanced by
Claimants in support of its claim for breach of the FET standard, be it under the ECT or the
BIT.

314. Different tribunals have explained the content of the FET standard in different words;
and as a matter of legal principle the phrase must be interpreted in the context of each
treaty in which it appears. In the present case, however, it is unnecessary to enter into
detailed discussions of the meaning of FET, because all interpretations of the phrase set a
significant threshold of impropriety. Thus, accepting for the sake of argument Claimants’
formulation which asserts that a failure to provide a transparent, stable and predictable
legal framework can amount to a breach of the FET standard, the crucial question remains
whether any failure on the part of the Respondent is sufficiently serious to fall below the
requisite standard of transparency, stability and predictability. As it was put by the tribunal
in the case of AES Summit Generation Ltd v. Hungary (hereinafter “AES v Hungary”),

before the adjudicator, manifestly unfair or unreasonable (such as would shock, or at least
surprise a sense of juridical propriety — to use the words of the Tecmed Tribunal — that the
standard can be said to have been infringed”. In the present case the Tribunal finds, as is
explained below, that neither the enactment nor the application of the changes in
Kazakhstan’s competition laws reach that threshold.

315. As concerns Claimants’ claim _based_on a frustration of their asserted legitimate
expectations, to the extent that the Arbitral Tribunal found that the Stabilization Clause of
Article 6 of the 1994 FIL or the FET standard did not afford protection from the changes in
the Kazakh competition legislation and that Claimants’ asserted expectations with regard to
‘market prices’ and the use of a trading company were unfounded (see above paras. 286
fol.), the remaining basis for Claimants’ claim is their alleged expectation that Kazakhstan
would implement a rational competition law framework and would apply it properly to the
AES Entities. As such, the basis for this claim is no different than Claimants’ claim based
on the standard of ‘transparent, stable and predictable legal framework’.

316. As concerns Claimants’ claim based on Kazakhstan’s alleged failure to provide, with
regard to competition legislation, for a transparent, stable and predictable legal framework,
the Arbitral Tribunal is of the opinion that Claimants’ claim is not established.

317. | As mentioned above (paras. 270-279), the changes in competition legislation were part
of a general effort to liberalize the electricity market and were thus aimed at benefiting the
market and the market players, including the AES Entities and the public at large. With
regard to the general nature of the Kazakh Original Competition Law, it is not alleged that
the application of such law to Claimants was in breach of any treaty protection standard.
The question is whether the subsequent changes made to the Kazakh Competition Law in
2001, 2006 and 2008 and thereto related regulations were of such a nature as to lack
transparency, stability or predictability. In this regard, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that
the nature of the changes made to the Kazakh competition legislation are not of a nature to
breach the FET standard under Article 10(1) of the ECT or Article II(2)(a) of the BIT. The
reasons are the following: (i) the frequency of the changes were reasonable in view of the
evolution of the Kazakh economy, and in particular of the country’s increasing needs in
energy; (ii) the changes made to the legislation concerned specific elements, such as
relevant thresholds to determine market shares, refinement of definitions of specific
concepts, etc., and the general principles and approach of the competition legislation
remained the same throughout the relevant time. In addition, the nature of the changes
made and the approach adopted by Kazakhstan were similar to practices in other European
countries and emerging economies.” With regard to the argument of ‘predictability’, it
must be weighted in the light of the state of development of the Kazakh market, and in
particular the electricity market, where Kazakhstan had to pass from a state monopolies
regime to a more liberal competition system. It is understandable that such a change could
not be made in a single step, and that regular adjustments to the competition legislation
would be necessary. The Arbitral Tribunal does not find any element indicating that the
changes made lacked transparency, stability or predictability under the FET standard.

104

318. As to the question whether the application of the competition legislation to the AES
Entities may have been in breach of the FET Standard, the Arbitral Tribunal is of the
opinion, as stated above (para. 307), that it is not its role to re-assess whether the Kazakh
courts and administrative bodies correctly implemented Kazakh competition law. The key
question is rather whether the result of such application, i.e. the effects of such application
on the AES Entities may be such as to be in breach of the FET standard. In this regard, the
main reason why Claimants consider such application to have been unfair and inequitable
is because it was inconsistent with what Claimants’ thought they were entitled to expect
under the Altai Agreement. However, as explained above (paras. 286-297), the Arbitral
Tribunal has already found that Claimants’ asserted legitimate expectations as to
stabilization, market prices and use of a trading company were unfounded. Thus, in as
much as Claimants did not legitimately hold such expectations, their claim of breach of
FET standard also fails.

319. As concerns Claimants’ claim of coercion and harassment, the record clearly shows that
investigations took place and that the AES Entities complained about the way some of their
employees were treated by the local authorities in the context of these investigations. In
particular, it does appear that there was a gap between what Claimants believed they were
entitled to expect and to do, and the understanding of the Kazakh authorities about the way
that their legislation had to be implemented. While it is possible that the manner in which
these investigations were conducted may not have been exemplary, the Arbitral Tribunal
considers that the factual elements on which Claimants rely are not sufficient to amount to
coercion or harassment’ or to give rise by themselves to a breach of the FET Standard for
reason of ‘coercion or harassment’.

320. As concerns Claimants’ claim based_on an application in bad faith of Kazakh
competition legislation, the Arbitral Tribunal is of the opinion that this claim is also closely
related to Claimants’ asserted legitimate expectation. Claimants argue that it was a
violation of their treaty rights for Kazakhstan to penalize Claimants for market practices
which were contemplated in the Altai Agreement. However, this argument relies on the
assumption that Claimants had a legitimate expectation of being able to engage in such
market practices irrespective of changes in competition legislation. As was noted above
(paras. 286-297), the Arbitral Tribunal has found that Claimants’ had no such legitimate
expectation protected by the ECT or the BIT. Accordingly, the mere fact that Claimants
may have been disappointed that what they envisaged would happen under the Altai
Agreement did not in fact happen, is not sufficient to establish ‘bad faith’ on the part of
Respondent, let alone constitute a breach of the FET standard based on such an argument
of bad faith.

321. As concerns Claimants’ claim of lack of due process, it largely relies on the contention
that the Kazakh courts misapplied Kazakh law and disregarded key arguments advanced by
the AES Entities. With regard to the misapplication of Kazakh law, the Arbitral Tribunal
refers to its position as stated above (paras. 305-307). As concerns the alleged disregard by
the Kazakh courts of certain arguments advanced by Claimants, such disregard may be
relevant under the FET Standard only if it was such as to amount to a substantial denial of
justice. In view of the various proceedings conducted in Kazakhstan by the AES Entities,
and the judgments and decisions rendered by the Kazakh courts and administrative bodies,
which appear the Arbitral Tribunal to be properly motivated and detailed in their findings
of facts and law, and considering that in certain instances the courts decided in favor of the
AES Entities the Arbitral Tribunal does not find that the court proceedings and their
findings amounted to a substantial denial of justice.

105

322. Another aspect of Claimants’ claim for lack of due process concerns the ruling of the
Supreme Court of Kazakhstan that the Arbitration Clause in the Altai Agreement was
invalid (see above paras. 58-66, 63). According to Claimants, this ruling was ‘patently
incorrect’ as the Supreme Court “did not have, and should not have purported to assert,
any jurisdiction to determine the issue’, For Claimants, the validity of the Arbitration
Clause is subject to English law and the English judge has already confirmed the validity of
such clause (see above para. 66). Thus, this ruling by the Supreme Court of Kazakhstan
deprived Claimants of a neutral and legitimate forum to resolve claims concerning breaches
of the Altai Agreement and allowed Kazakhstan to disregard its obligations under the Altai
Agreement with impunity. Consequently, Claimants would actually be denied justice as
concerns their contractual claims under the Altai Agreement. Such denial would constitute
a breach of the FET Standard.

323. The Arbitral Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to determine the validity of the
Arbitration Clause in the Altai Agreement. Similarly, it is not its role to determine to what
extent the Kazakh Supreme Court had jurisdiction to rule on that issue and whether its
ruling was correct. The Arbitral Tribunal merely takes note of the fact that the courts at the
place of arbitration, i.e., England, have confirmed the validity of the Arbitration Clause.
Accordingly, the Arbitral Tribunal does not consider that Claimants have been deprived of
any ‘legitimate forum’ to resolve claims for breaches of the Altai Agreement. In addition,
Claimants have not established what damage they have actually suffered because of such
ruling. Whether or not the ruling of the Kazakh Supreme Court may in future cause issues
of enforcement in the situation in which Claimants pursue arbitration under the Altai
Agreement and win, is a highly hypothetical question. Thus, Claimants may at this stage
not base a claim for breach of FET on the mere fact that the Kazakh Supreme Court ruled
to invalidate the Arbitration Clause in the Altai Agreement. If that ruling were to cause
damage to Claimants in future, Claimants would be free to file a new claim.

324. In conclusion, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that Claimants’ claims for breach of the FET
Standard under Article 10(1) of the ECT and Article II(2)(a) of the BIT fail.

(iii) | Claim for Unreasonable and Arbitrary Measures under Article 10(1) of the ECT
and Article II(2)(b) of the BIT

325. With regard to the applicable standard for measuring a breach of the obligation to
refrain from unreasonably or arbitrarily impairing investments, Claimants contend that this
standard is not identical to the FET standard. Nevertheless, Claimants agree with
Respondent that the obligation to refrain from impairing investments through unreasonable
measures requires, as stated in the Saluka Investments B.V. v. Czech Republic (hereinafter
“Saluka”) case, a “showing that the State's conduct bears a reasonable relationship to
some rational policy” and that arbitrariness refers to action which is opposed to the rule of
law rather than any particular rule of law and/or are not based on reason (see Elettronica
Sicula S.p.A. (hereinafter “ELSI”)7®’ and Siemens A.G. v. Argentine Republic (hereinafter

According to Claimants, Kazakhstan has failed to comply with its obligations under the

Its unreasonable and arbitrary application of competition laws to the AES Entities,
in particular its imposition of competition law sanctions absent any demonstration
of abusive behavior, its unjustified finding of illegal collusion, its imposition of
price caps and fines set at arbitrary levels without any economic justification.
According to Claimants, Kazakhstan’s measures against the AES Entities based on
Kazakh competition law bear no relationship to any legitimate policy objective of
preventing anti-competitive conduct;

Its coercion and harassment of various AES employees for the purposes of forcing
the AES Entities to adopt certain business practices;

Its determination that the activities of the AES Entities, which were fully
contemplated under the Altai Agreement, are in breach of competition laws despite
its prior approval of Claimants’ investment.

According to Respondent, Claimants’ claims are unfounded for the following main
reasons:

(i)

(ii)

With regard to the claim based on an unreasonable and arbitrary application of
competition laws to the AES Entities, Respondent contends that even if the standard
under the FET and the obligation to refrain from unreasonable and arbitrary
impairment are not identical, there is a substantial overlap between these two
standards to the extent that Claimants allege a breach of the FET standard based on
the unreasonableness and arbitrariness of measures taken in application of Kazakh
competition law. Referring to the ELSI case, Respondent contends that in order to
find a breach of the prohibition of unreasonable and arbitrary impairment, it would
be necessary that the act at stake be characterized as “a willful disregard of due
process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical
propriety”. According to Respondent, Claimants’ claim in this regard fail because
it is based on the inappropriate assumption that Claimants could legitimately expect
to be exempted from applicable competition legislation and Claimants unfounded
view that the competition legislation was applied inappropriately by the Kazakh
authorities.”

With regard to the claim based on alleged coercion and harassment, Respondent
denies that its authorities have acted in any way improperly. In addition, even if
Claimants were to establish that the measures were improper, the measures
complained of against AES employees are not causative of any of the monetary
losses claimed by Claimants.

328. For the Arbitral Tribunal, Claimants’ claim of unreasonable and arbitrary impairment is
largely twofold: it relies (i) on the way the Kazakh authorities applied Kazakh competition
law, and (ii) on the fact that the measures taken by Kazakhstan were inconsistent with
alleged assurances made under the Altai Agreement upon which Claimants were entitled to
rely.

329. With regard to the first point, Claimants’ primary contentions are that Kazakhstan
misapplied its own law, and that such misapplication was unreasonable as it was not based
on a rational policy, and was arbitrary to the extent that it was particularly directed at the
AES Entities. As mentioned above (paras. 305-307), it is not the role of the Arbitral
Tribunal to re-assess whether the Kazakh authorities applied Kazakh law correctly. Thus,
the only question remaining is whether the law as applied can be deemed in breach of any
protection standard afforded under the treaty. However, in this regard, the Arbitral
Tribunal considers that even if there may be, in theory, differences between the FET
standard and the standard of prohibition of unreasonable and arbitrary impairment, the
ways in which Claimants constructed their claims under these two standards actually
overlap. Consequently, for the same reasons as mentioned above with regard to the FET
standard (paras. 313-320), the Arbitral Tribunal does not consider that the measures taken
by Kazakhstan were of an unreasonable or arbitrary character in the sense of Article 10(1)
of the ECT and Article (II)(2)(b) of the BIT.

330. With regard to the second point, Claimants’ claim is closely related to the question of
Claimants’ legitimate expectations. As the Arbitral Tribunal has already considered
Claimants’ alleged legitimate expectations arising out of the Altai Agreement to be
unfounded (see above paras. 290 fol.), such expectations cannot lead to a breach of the
non-impairment standard under Article 10(1) of the ECT and Article (II)(2)(b) of the BIT.

331. In conclusion, Claimants’ claim for breach of the obligation to refrain from
unreasonable and arbitrary impairment of investments under Article 10(1) of the ECT and
Article (II)(2)(b) of the BIT fails.

 

(iv) Claim for Breach of the Umbrella Clauses under Article 10(1) of the ECT and
Article II(2)(c) of the BIT

332. Claimants’ claims under the Umbrella Clauses fall into two main categories: (i) claims
based on breaches of the 1994 FIL and (ii) claims based on breaches of the Altai
Agreement.”

333. With regard to the 1994 FIL, the Arbitral Tribunal accepts that as a matter of principle
a breach of the 1994 FIL could trigger a treaty breach based on the Umbrella Clauses.
However, it has already rejected the claim for breach of Article 6 and 8 of the 1994 FIL,
(see paras. 298 fol.).

334. | With regard to an alleged breach of Article 13 of the 1994 FIL, the Arbitral Tribunal
has already explained that it did not consider Article 13 of the 1994 FIL to establish a

standard different from the standard of protection afforded directly under the ECT and the
BIT (see above para. 304). As the Arbitral Tribunal considered that there was no breach of

278 CL Reply 30.03.2012, paras. 461 fol.

108

relevant standards under the ECT and/or the BIT, there can be no breach based on Article
13 of the 1994 FIL either.

335. Consequently, the Umbrella Clauses of the ECT and BIT cannot trigger a breach of
treaty with regard to Articles 6, 8 or 13 of the 1994 FIL. In this regard, Claimants’ claim
fails.

336. With regard to the Altai Agreement, the Arbitral Tribunal considers Claimants’ claim to
be similarly unfounded. The Altai Agreement contains no express commitment not to
amend the Kazakh competition law, and the Arbitral Tribunal finds no ground for implying
any such commitment in the Altai Agreement. Accordingly, no question arises of an
obligation on this matter that might be transformed into a treaty obligation under the
Umbrella Clauses. This part of Claimants’ case also fails.

(v) Claim for Breach of Full Protection and Security under Article 10(1) of the ECT
and Article II(2)(a) of the BIT

337. According to Claimants, the standard of full protection and security (“FPS”) includes
adverse effects of regulatory measure or administrative actions on the investment, whereby
the standard is then very close to the FET standard. Claimants claim that Kazakhstan failed
to comply with this standard by allowing the Competition Agency to wrongfully apply to
the AES Entities new legislation, by failing to follow Kazakh law and by breaching the
provisions of the Altai Agreement. In particular, Claimants maintain that, while full
protection and security clauses require protection from ‘physical violence’, it does not
follow that these clauses cannot go beyond a mere safeguard from physical violence and
embrace legal protection for an investor as well.?”*

338. Respondent contends that Claimants have failed to substantiate the alleged breaches of
the FPS standard, and that their claim merely replicates what Claimants already claim
under the FET standard, i.e., that no legislation other than the Original Competition Law
should have been applied to the AES Entities, that the Kazakh authorities misapplied
Kazakh law, and that this was in breach of the provisions of the Altai Agreement. In
addition, Respondent’s position is that the FPS standard does not impose any obligations in
respect of legal stability and protects only physical security and protection.” 5

339. The Arbitral Tribunal is of the opinion that Claimants have failed to substantiate their
claim under the FPS standard. In particular, Claimants have not demonstrated that such
claim, which is based ‘on adverse effects of regulatory measure or administrative actions
on the investment’, is actually different from the claim raised under the FET standard and
the obligation to refrain from unreasonable and arbitrary impairment. The Arbitral
Tribunal has already found that Claimants’ claims under the FET standard and the
obligation to refrain from unreasonable and arbitrary impairment cannot be sustained, and
it sees no additional element in or aspect of Respondent’s conduct that constitutes a breach
of the FPS standard.

E. For the Period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2015

I. The Issues

In summary, Claimants claim that by enacting and implementing the 2009 Tariff
Amendment, Kazakhstan reverted to a heavily-regulated market model with capped tariffs
imposed by the state for all electricity generators. The situation was then further
exacerbated by the enactment and implementation of the 2012 Electricity Law, which
Claimants consider to be an arbitrary and irrational piece of legislation, which did not
pursue any legitimate policy goals and which was clearly aimed at preventing Claimants
from making any distributable return on or of their investment in their electricity generation
activities in the EKO until 2016 at the earliest.””°

Based thereon, Claimants raise two sets of claims: (i) one set of claims relating to
alleged breaches of the 1994 FIL and (ii) one set of claims relating to alleged breaches of
the ECT and BIT.

(i) With regard to the 1994 FIL, Claimants contend that Respondent’s breach is
threefold:?””

- The application of the 2009 Tariff Amendment to the AES Entities is itself a
breach of the Stabilization Clause, and the 2012 Electricity Law which enacts
amendments to the 2009 Tariff Amendments, is therefore a continuing and
additional breach of the Stabilization Clause.

- Such breach of the Stabilization Clause constitutes simultaneously a breach
of Article 8 of the 1994 FIL.

- Kazakhstan breached Article 10(1) of the 1994 FIL by restricting Claimants’
right to use income received from their investment at their discretion.

(ii) With regard to the ECT and BIT, Claimants raise five different claims:?”8

- A breach of the FET standard under Article 10(1) of the ECT and Article
II(2)(a) of the BIT for failure to respect Claimants’ legitimate expectations
without a reasonable or proportionate public policy justification.

- A breach of the duty to encourage and create favourable and transparent
conditions for investors under Article 10(1) of the ECT by preventing
generators from having any discretion over their income or profit and by
penalizing generators which do not have a signed Investment Obligation
Agreement.

- A breach of the duty to refrain from adopting unreasonable or arbitrary
measures under Article 10(1) of the ECT and Article II(2)(b) of the BIT by
enacting the 2012 Electricity Law, which provides arbitrary and unreasonable
measures.

- A breach of the Umbrella Clauses contained in Article 10(1) of the ECT and
Article II(2)(c) of the BIT for failure by Kazakhstan to comply with its
obligations under the Altai Agreement.

- A breach of the duty to guarantee the freedom of transfer of the Claimants’
returns from their investments out of Kazakhstan without delay under Article
14 of the ECT and Article IV(1) of the BIT by enacting the 2012 Electricity
Law which improperly prohibits Claimants to freely transfer their returns (as
defined in the BIT and the ECT) out of Kazakhstan.

343. In Respondent’s view, Claimants’ claims are entirely unfounded for various reasons:7””

(i) Claimants disregard the fact that the enactment of the 2009 Tariff Amendment and
the 2012 Electricity Law were necessary to address an urgent need for investment
and prevent a risk of critical shortage of electricity power. As such, they were
motivated by pressing public interest concerns and the system put in place by the
2009 Tariff Amendments and the 2012 Electricity Law — i.e., the ‘tariff in exchange
for investment policy — was aimed at both incentivizing and ensuring sufficient
investment.

(ii) Claimants’ understanding of the 2009 Tariff Amendments is wrong and the claims
raised with regard to the 2012 Electricity Law are therefore partly flawed.

(iii) | In view of the above circumstances, the various claims raised by Claimants lack
factual and/or legal basis, as Claimants have failed to meet the relevant
requirements or thresholds.

344. In order to determine to what extent Claimants’ claims with regard to the 2009 Tariff
Amendment and 2012 Electricity Law may be justified, the Arbitral Tribunal considers it
appropriate first to clarify the following preliminary issues, which appear to be relevant for
a number of Claimants’ claims:

e The specific mechanism set in place by the 2009 Tariff Amendment and the 2012
Electricity Law, the material differences (if any) between these two laws, and the

relevance of any such differences to Claimants’ claims.

e The policy goals underlying the 2009 Tariff Amendments and the 2012 Electricity
Law.

345. Once these preliminary issues have been clarified, the Arbitral Tribunal will proceed to
examine each head of claim raised by Claimants.

The Parties’ Positions

According to Claimants, the mechanism implemented under the 2009 Tariff
0

The 2009 Tariff Amendment constituted an abrupt abandonment of a competitive
market for the generation of electricity by subjecting all generators to government-
imposed capped prices, which were lower than competitive market prices. In order
to be able to sell at prices up to a maximum tariff, the 2009 Tariff Amendment
required that generators enter into IOAs with MINT. However, the way in which a
generator chose to use its own profit remained a matter entirely for that generator’s
discretion. In this regard, Claimants rely on Article 12-1(3) of the 2009 Tariff
Amendment, which provides that “Power-generating organisations shall
independently determine their investment commitments”. As such, Claimants’
position is that there was nothing in the 2009 Tariff Amendment which permitted
MINT to make any demands of generators with respect to their level of investment.
In particular, there was no provision in the 2009 Tariff Amendment establishing any
correlation between the chargeable tariff and the amount of investment committed
to under the IOA, and there was no provision permitting MINT to refuse to sign an
IOA, the latter’s role being limited to “monitoring performance” under the IOA. In
other words, under the 2009 Tariff Amendment, Claimants were entitled both to use
their profits as they wished and to repatriate funds by way of both return of and
return on capital. Claimants maintain that their understanding of the 2009 Tariff
Amendment is further supported by the fact that in 2009, MINT signed IOAs for
the AES generators (see above para. 53) in full knowledge that there was no
correlation between the amount that those AES generators planned to invest and the
tariff that they proposed to charge. Thus, both the text of the 2009 Tariff
Amendment and the practice of Kazakhstan’s own officials would confirm
Claimants’ case.

The correlation between the chargeable tariff and the amount of investment
committed to under the IOA, and also the right of MINT to refuse to enter into an
IOA were novelties introduced by the 2012 Electricity Law:

- With regard to the correlation, under the 2012 Electricity Law, the tariff that
a generator is entitled to charge for electricity is fixed at an amount that
would cover only the generator’s generating costs, planned depreciation, and
the cost of funding the investments it has committed to make pursuant to its
IOAs. Generators are then expected to reinvest into their facilities all of the
profits they make from electricity sales, including a sum representing the
cash equivalent of depreciation. Thus, generators are deprived of the use of
any of their operating cash flow. This novelty was introduced by modifying
the wording of Article 12-1(3) of the 2009 Tariff Amendments as follows:
“Power-generating organisations shall independently determine their

(iv)

investment commitments subject to their planned depreciation charges and
the level of net income gained through the sale of electric power at prices
not exceeding capped tariffs” (emphasis as added by Claimants). Under such
provision, all net income earned must be reinvested, that is, investors are not
entitled to retain any profits whatsoever, whether as working cash in the
business or by way of a distribution or otherwise. While Kazakhstan argues
that such profits will be recouped by the generators post-2015 in the form of
increased returns and more valuable assets, there is simply no guarantee
whatsoever that this will happen.

- With regard to MINT’s right to refuse to enter into a IOA, while the 2012
Electricity Law introduced such a right for MINT, it provides no guidance,
no limitations and no suggestions as to what might constitute justified
grounds for a refusal by MINT to sign an IOA.

- Another novelty of the 2012 Electricity Law concerns generators which have
not signed any IOA. Under Article 25(5) of the 2012 Electricity Law, such
generators will be entitled to charge only a tariff that covers its costs of
generation and that does not include any margin to compensate for
depreciation, or to provide operating cash flow or a return on capital. In
other words, a generator without an IOA would be unable to recover even a
return of capital through depreciation, much less a return on capital by
generating and repatriating profit from its activities.

- If the Arbitral Tribunal was to determine that these ‘new’ requirements were
in fact already part of the 2009 Tariff Amendment, then Claimants’ position
would be that the breaches of Claimants’ rights would also date back to
2009.78!

The existing regime of capped tariffs introduced under the 2009 Tariff Amendment
will continue to apply until the end of 2015.

According to Claimants, it is undisputed that the requirement of forced
reinvestment coupled with the prohibition on payment of dividends prevents
Claimants from making any returns of or on any un-depreciated capital invested by
them prior to 31 December 2008. In other words, any un-depreciated capital
invested by the AES Entities prior to 1 January 2009 is lost and not recoverable
between 2009-2015. It is also undisputed that Kazakhstan has in effect prohibited
Claimants from earning return on the capital they are forced to invest in the seven
year period 2009-2015, except in very specific circumstances where Claimants are
able to generate electricity below certain costs and the market demand is high
enough to guarantee a certain level of sales. Moreover, Claimants will only be able
to earn a return of capital invested between 2009 and 2015 if they are able to meet
their revenue and cost targets. In other words, if they are unable to sell sufficient
quantities of electricity at the price needed in order to meet the cost of their forced
investments, they will not even earn a return of the full amount of the forced
investment and they will operate at a net loss. This is the case regardless of whether

2009 Tariff Amendment and the 2012 Electricity Law is mistaken. The ‘tariff in exchange
for investment’ policy was already contemplated by the 2009 Tariff Amendment, and the
2012 Electricity Law only aimed to ensure that this policy was implemented correctly. In
other words, the 2012 Electricity Law constitutes a tightening up of mechanisms ensuring
compliance with the same underlying policy of ‘tariff in exchange of investment’ provided
for in the 2009 Tariff Amendment.”

they have IOAs in place or not. If they do not have IOAs in place, they will be
forced to operate at a net loss.?*?

According to Respondent, Claimants’ understanding of the relationship between the

The system put in place by the 2009 Tariff Amendment permitted the generators to
charge more than the then-existing tariffs under the competition legislation
provided that they had an IOA in place. Thus, any increase in prices charged up to
the maximum tariff set by the 2009 Tariff Amendment for a relevant group of
generators had to be subject to such IOA with MINT and such approval was only to
be given where the proposed increase in prices was matched by a corresponding
increase in the level of investment. Generators could not charge prices up to the
maximum tariff without adjusting their investment accordingly.

In this context, Claimants’ interpretation of the 2009 Tariff Amendment makes no
sense and is not supported by any legal expertise or citation of Kazakh law.

If Claimants’ view that generators remained free under the 2009 Tariff
Amendment to determine the level of investment was true, than the very
purpose of the IOAs would have become meaningless as there would have
been no incentive for any generator to do any more than make merely token
investments whilst charging the maximum tariff. Each of the IOA entered
into by the MINT contained a provision by which the price at which power
was to be sold was fixed, and such provision indicates clearly that it was
envisaged from the very beginning that there was a link between the
chargeable tariff and the level of investment that the generator was willing to
commit to. Further, Article 12-1(4) of the 2009 Tariff Amendment provided
that a generator could apply for permission to charge higher tariffs, where
“investment obligations of a power-generating organization cannot be
performed using funds received from selling electricity at tariffs not
exceeding maximum capped rates”. Respondent submitted that Claimants
were well aware of the intended mechanism of the 2009 Tariff Amendment
and in particular of the underlying principle of ‘tariff in exchange for
investment’.

The authority of MINT to conclude an IOA necessarily includes the power to
refuse such to conclude such an IOA, for example where the link between the
chargeable tariff and the level of investment is not respected. The purpose of
the additional wording in the 2012 Electricity Law was to increase the
accountability of MINT in instances where it refused to sign an IOA; it did
not constitute the basis for MINT’s right to refuse an IOA.

(iii) |The only novelty introduced by the 2012 Electricity Law is Article 25(5), which
was intended to ensure compliance by generators with their pre-existing obligation
to enter into an IOA. Such obligation was contemplated by the 2009 Tariff
Amendment; and Article 25(5) introduced an additional incentive to fulfill the
obligation, by punishing non-compliance with the law.

 

(iv) | Consequently, under the ‘tariff in exchange of investment’ policy contemplated by
both the 2009 Tariff Amendment and the 2012 Electricity Law, Claimants were
bound to charge according to the maximum tariff and to reinvest all revenue above
cost, unless they can show that said legislation was irrational and arbitrary. In any
case, however, Claimants would still have been regulated under Kazakh
competition legislation and, as dominant entities, would have been subject to
regulated tariffs calculated on a cost-plus basis: Claimants would not have been free
to set tariffs at whatever levels they wished.

348. As concerns the specific functioning of the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ policy,
Respondent acknowledges that the Kazakh Government intended that all “profits”, (defined
as revenue above costs) be reinvested in infrastructure. Thus, while the generators were
permitted to retain profits, they had to reinvest those profits. These profits were therefore
not taken away from the generators: generators were simply required to “lock in” those
profits in exchange for receiving the substantial additional capital injection funded by the
consumers who were paying increased prices at the maximum capped tariff. In this regard,
the cost of depreciation can be charged as a cost, although the equivalent sum has to be
reinvested. Thus, depreciation costs can be recovered and retained, although they will be
locked in as (re-)investments in infrastructure. Exceptions may be applied to companies
which may require less investment or which have already completed all the necessary
investment prior to 2015. With regard to generators which do not enter into an IOA with
MINT, they may not treat depreciation as a cost, but must reinvest all of the income
generated by the sales of electricity.”

(ii) The Arbitral Tribunal’s Assessment

349. It emerges from both parties’ submissions that it is essentially undisputed that the ‘tariff
in exchange for investment’ scheme required all profits, defined as net revenue, to be
reinvested into the generator. While depreciation would be accounted for as a cost
(provided the generator had signed an IOA), the equivalent sum was also to be reinvested.
Thus, generators benefitting from an IOA had to reinvest all operating cash. Generators
without an IOA in place were not even allowed to account for depreciation, and were thus
de facto operating at a loss.

350. What is disputed is whether the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ scheme already
existed under the 2009 Tariff Amendment, or whether it was introduced only by the 2012
Electricity Law. This question appears to be relevant in the following two ways:

(i) According to Respondent, some of the claims raised by Claimants in relation to the
‘tariff in exchange for investment’ scheme in their Supplementary Submission of 6
August 2012 are based only on the 2012 Electricity Law. In this regard,
Respondent contends that these claims may therefore only be examined with regard

284 RSP PHB on Liability 30.11.2012, paras. 108-117; RSP PHB on Quantum 5.04.2013, paras. 37-47; London Hearing
Day 4 p. 166 1. 11-14; Paris Hearing Day 1 p. 771. 25 —p. 78 1. 10; p. 161 1. 12—p. 163 1.9.

116

to the 2012 Electricity Law, and it is too late to raise them as claims with regard to
the 2009 Tariff Amendment. In other words, where the basis of Claimants’
complaint arises out of the 2009 Tariff Amendment, then Claimants’ claims should
be rejected as untimely.

(ii) It appears that the AES Entities continued to repatriate profits during the years
2009-2011, and Respondent objects to this repatriation as being in breach of the
‘tariff in exchange for investment’ scheme. On the other hand, Claimants argue that
such repatriation was legitimate as the 2009 Tariff Amendment did not yet establish
a correlation between the level of investment made and the level of tariff
chargeable.”*> This issue, which may be relevant with regard to quantum, depends
on whether the duty to reinvest all profits was already in effect under the 2009
Tariff Amendment or came into effect only with the 2012 Electricity Law.

351. _ Looking at the provisions of the 2009 Tariff Amendment, in the view of the Tribunal it
appears quite clear that there was a link between investment and tariff, although the
specific details of that link were not clearly spelled out. It was also quite clear that the
generators could not use additional revenues however they deemed fit. Letters from MINT
dating back to August 2010 are in the record in which the MINT requested a higher level of
investment commitment for the 2010-2011 IAO and complained that the AES Entities did
not make sufficient investment under the 2009-2010 IAO.”*° This confirms that the ‘tariff
in exchange for investment’ scheme was already contemplated by the 2009 Tariff
Amendment, although it may have been refined by the 2012 Electricity Law.

352. | However, the Arbitral Tribunal also considers that the 2009 Tariff Amendment was not
specific with regard to core aspects of the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ scheme, such
as the manner according to which investors had to fix the level of required investment and
the reasons for refusal by MINT of any IOA. As such, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that it
would not be appropriate to consider Claimants’ claims as belated just because they are
actually based on features already present in the 2009 Tariff Amendment. In view of the
lack of specificity of the 2009 Tariff Amendment and the ongoing talks with MINT
concerning the conclusion of an IOA, it was reasonable for Claimants to first seek to clarify
the situation with MINT.

353. Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that notwithstanding the fact that the ‘tariff
in exchange for investment’ scheme was already contemplated by the 2009 Tariff
Amendment, Claimants’ claims relating to such scheme and raised primarily with regard to
the 2012 Electricity Law are admissible and should be considered as based on both the
2009 Tariff Amendment and the 2012 Electricity Law.

(iii) — Conclusion

354. Without at this stage deciding upon the legal consequences of this characterization, the
Arbitral Tribunal considers that the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ scheme in effect
obliged generators to reinvest all operating cash flow and thereby prevented those
generators from being able to realize and make use of any profits from 1 January 2009 until

31 December 2015. To the extent that generators could not realize any profits, they were
also prevented from distributing and repatriating such profits.

3. The Policy Goals underlying the 2009 Tariff Amendments and the 2012 Electricity
Law

(i) The Parties’ Positions

355. According to Claimants, there are no rational policy grounds on which Kazakhstan can
rely in order to justify its actions under the 2009 Tariff Amendment and/or the 2012
Electricity Law. In particular, the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ scheme amounts to a
disincentive to investors, and furthermore it encourages imprudent investment to the
detriment of consumers. According to Claimants, “there can be no policy justifications for
prohibiting private generation companies from having any free cash flow or from
distributing their income in the manner of their own choosing just because, in the view of

the State, those private companies are earning so called ‘super-profits’ [reference omitted]

iently reinvesting in their facilities” 57 Requiring generators to reinvest all of
their profits and operating cash with no margins for any returns would lead only to wasteful
and inefficient investment at the expense of the consumers.

  

356. In addition, Claimants submit that even if the Tribunal were to find that the 2009 Tariff
Amendment and 2012 Electricity Law pursued legitimate public interests (which Claimants
deny), those laws did not provide a reasonable, non-arbitrary and proportionate way of
attaining those interests. In this regard, Claimants argue as follows:***

(i) The prohibition on free transfers of capital, in particular the prohibition of payment
of dividends and repatriation of profits by foreign investors plainly cannot be a
legitimate policy goal. The right to pay dividends is a fundamental right of a
foreign investor and cannot be undermined by a public interest consideration,
absent some provision in the treaty providing a carve-out for such a prohibition. No
carve-out however exists in the either the ECT or the BIT.

(ii) The aim of increasing capacity does not justify heavy regulation or forced
reinvestment. Kazakhstan’s excessive regulation from 2001 to 2008 is exactly what
caused the problem that Kazakhstan sought to address with the 2009/2012 changes
to the Electricity Law. But blanket regulation is not the answer to investment
problems in the electricity sector. On the contrary, the policies put into place by
Kazakhstan under the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ clearly discourage
investors from investing in the electricity sector in Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan’s
approach is based on a confusion between the value of the fixed assets of a business
and the value of the business itself. Increased investment will not necessarily result
in a benefit to the investor, as it may lead to overinvestment and cause a system
overload or breakdown, not to mention overcapacity which will impact the level of
prices that generators will be able to charge.

287 CL Suppl. Subm. 6.08.2012, paras. 42 fol., 47.
288 CL PHB on Liability 30.11.2012, para. 161, paras. 162 fol.

118

(iii) | The changes were unreasonable, disproportionate and arbitrary. Kazakhstan’s
position is that its measures were reasonable because the increased tariffs and thus
the investments were funded by the consumers, i.e. the State was in effect raising
‘free funds’ from consumers for investment in infrastructure by the generators.
However, simply being entitled to charge a tariff up to a certain level is no
guarantee that the generator will be able to realize that price. In addition, it is not
credible for Kazakhstan to suggest that a seven-year prohibition on the payment of
dividends is a proportionate response to supposed underinvestment in its electricity
sector.

357. According to Respondent, the policy goals behind the ‘tariff in exchange for
investment’ scheme, as set out in the 2009 Tariff Amendment, included the “maintenance
of security of electricity supply to the consumers for the long-term period, creation of
conditions to attract investment for reconstruction and development of the power potential
of the country and creation of the power market’, as well as the resolution of unsettled
issues such as the “low competition between the producers of electrical energy due to
insufficient development of networks and limited transmission capacity of power lines
between the areas in Kazakhstan”. As such, at the most fundamental level, the urgent need
for the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ scheme stems from the forecast that Kazakhstan
would face a critical shortage of electrical power in the near future if the status quo were
maintained. According to Respondent, there is no dispute that Kazakhstan was facing an
imminent crisis which required government action, because the electricity market was
generally unresponsive to market signals.”

358. With regard to Claimants’ challenges to the rationality of Respondent’s policy of ‘tariff
in exchange for investment’, whilst Respondent acknowledges that the locking-in of profits
may seem to be formally inconsistent with the entitlement to repatriate profits, any such
entitlement must be seen against the urgent need for investment. Once the pressing need
for investment is acknowledged, there can be no objection to the measures taken by
Respondent. According to Respondent, the “fundamental point at the end of the day is that
none of the depreciation costs or ‘profits’ is taken from the generators [but from the
consumers] and there is a definite end-date to the investment programme in 2015, beyond
which the requirement to reinvest found in the 2009 Tariff Amendment and 2012 Electricity
Law will cease”?

359. In conclusion, Respondent contends that in the absence of stabilization, the AES
Entities are entitled to charge only such tariffs as are permitted by the prevailing
legislation, and not market rates, and that Claimants are seeking to escape the regulated
tariffs by arguing that the laws themselves were irrational. The burden of proving that
domestic legislation is in and of itself irrational, arbitrary or unreasonable is extremely high
and Claimants cannot meet this burden considering that (i) Kazakhstan was facing a serious
shortage of electricity in 2009, there was a need for the Government to take action on this
front because electricity generation markets appear to be impervious to market signals; (iii)
there was a clear link between the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ programme and the
attempted solution for the impending shortage of electricity; and (iv) there was general
agreement by the industry to the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ programme.

(ii) The Arbitral Tribunal’s Assessment

360. It is essentially undisputed between the Parties that the policy goal underlying the ‘tariff
in exchange for investment’ scheme was to increase investments in the production and
transmission of electricity in order to avoid a shortfall in electric power. What is disputed,
however, is whether the specific measures designed by Kazakhstan to achieve this goal
were reasonable and proportionate, and the extent to which the answer to this question may
impact on Claimants’ claims.

361. The Arbitral Tribunal considers that the underlying policy goal of avoiding a shortage
in electricity supply by incentivizing increased investments in the electricity sector is per se
a legitimate policy goal, which may justify the taking of certain measures, including the
amendment of applicable laws and regulations and imposing restrictions with regard to
prices or other factors which may affect competition in general.

362. Thus, Claimants claim that the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ scheme was based on
irrational policy grounds is unfounded. However, the fact that the underlying policy goal
itself was legitimate and rational does not justify the taking of any action whatsoever in
pursuit of that goal. The key question is therefore whether the way in which Kazakhstan
planned to realize this goal, i.e. the actual measures it took, was in line with applicable
treaty protection standards or whether the measures may have gone too far. This is not a
question that can or should be addressed in general terms. It must be analyzed in the
context of the relevant provisions invoked by Claimants and in the light of the range of
alternative means of securing the necessary investment that were in practice available to the
government and were feasible.

(iii) — Conclusion

363. The Arbitral Tribunal considers that the general policy goal underlying the ‘tariff in
exchange for investment’ scheme was legitimate and rational, but that the key question is
whether the measures taken by Kazakhstan to achieve that goal were adequate and

proportional, or whether they may have breached certain standards of protection afforded
under the 1994 FIL, the BIT or the ECT.

4. Impact on and Analysis of Claimants’ Claims

4.1 Breach of Articles 6 and 8 of the 1994 FIL
(i) The Parties’ Positions
364. According to Claimants, the application of both the 2009 Tariff Amendment and the
2012 Electricity Law to the AES Entities constitutes a breach of the Stabilization Clause.
Claimants advance the following reasoning:
(i) To the extent that the 2009 Tariff Amendment was part of a series of changes to the

regulatory framework introduced by Kazakhstan since 2001, the application of such
a new regulatory framework — including the 2009 Tariff Amendment — is itself a

breach of the Stabilization Clause. The 2012 Electricity Law — which enacts
amendments to the 2009 Electricity Law — is therefore a continuing and additional
breach of the Stabilization Clause.

As to the requirement imposed by the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ policy on
the AES Entities that they reinvest into their facilities all operating cash from
electricity sales, thereby preventing Claimants from earning any return of or on
their investments in Kazakhstan, such a new requirement undoubtedly had an
adverse effect on the Claimants’ investment, and its application to the AES Entities
therefore constitutes a breach of the Stabilization Clause.

The breach of the Stabilization Clause of Article 6 of the 1994 FIL also constitutes
a breach of Article 8 of the FIL.

According to Respondent, Claimants’ claim based on the 1994 FIL is entirely

The claim that the 2009 Tariff Amendment breached the 1994 FIL was first raised
by Claimants in their Supplementary Submission. This claim is inconsistent with
the fact that the AES Entities did enter into an JOA in 2009 under which they
undertook investment obligations and at no point did they assert that there were not
subject to the 2009 Tariff Amendment. Thus, Claimants’ claim regarding a breach
of Article 6 of the 1994 FIL is inconsistent with Claimants’ previous assertions and
behavior.

According to Rumeli, the mere fact that the 1994 FIL contained standards of
protection paralleling those under international investment treaties in no sense
means that a breach of the 1994 FIL constitutes ipso facto a breach of international
law. Rather, where the content of the substantive protections contained in the 1994
FIL relied upon by the Claimants are replicated by the standards of protection in the
applicable BIT, there is no need to assess separately whether there has been a
breach of the 1994 FIL.

Claimants are not entitled to stabilization and there has been no breach of Articles
6(1) or 8 of the 1994 FIL as a consequence of adoption of the 2012 Electricity Law,
considering that:

a. The 1994 FIL was repealed and Claimants are not entitled to rely on any of its
provisions, be it Article 6, 8 or 10(1);

b. With regard to Article 6 of the 1994 FIL:
- Even if still applicable, Article 6(1) of the 1994 FIL is of ‘programmatic
character only’ and only constitutes a ‘renvoi’ provision, without

providing direct protection;?*

- Article 6(1) of the 1994 FIL only provides stabilization “unless the
contract stipulates otherwise” and Article 10.1.3 of the Altai Agreement

RSP Suppl. Subm. 27.08.2012, para 104 fol.

296

constitutes such ‘other stipulation’ thereby providing a carve-out from
stabilization;?>

Article 6(4) of the relevant version of the 1994 FIL (i.e. the version in
force on 28 July 1997) excludes “matters of State regulation”, which
include the 2012 Electricity Law and the 2009 Tariff Amendment.”*°
Thus, these laws cannot be covered by any stabilization.

With regard to Article 8 of the 1994 FIL:

To the extent that Claimants are not stabilized, their claim under Article
8 of the 1994 FIL also fails.

In any event, as of 27 August 2012, Kazakhstan had not taken any action
in application of the 2012 Electricity Law, so that there are as yet no
actions or decisions of the relevant agencies which might engage the
application of Article 8 of the 1994 FIL.

d. With regard to Article 10(1) of the 1994 FIL:

The right to use income derived from investment activities is a qualified
right and is only applicable to “reinvestment”, “acquisition of goods” or
for “other purposes not prohibited by the legislation of the Republic of
Kazakhstan”. Under the 2009 Tariff Amendment and the 2012
Electricity Law any income derived from the generation of electricity
was to be reinvested, and its use for any other purpose was not permitted.
Thus, the income derived therefrom is subject to the limitation of Article
10(1) of the 1994 FIL and Claimants have no right to receive such
income.

The Arbitral Tribunal’s Assessment

The Arbitral Tribunal has already ruled (see above paras. 252 fol.) that, although the
FIL was repealed, Claimants remained entitled to rely thereon and initiate ICSID
arbitration concerning investments made prior to its repeal, and that the stabilization
guarantee provided for under Article 6 of the 1994 FIL would continue to produce effects
for the duration indicated therein.

As to the question whether the implementation of the ‘tariff in exchange for
investment’ scheme may be seen as breaching the stabilization guarantee, the key question
is whether such scheme ‘adversely affected’ Claimants’ investments, as compared to their
situation under the 1995 Electricity Law (see above para. 257). Claimants have only
pleaded the existence of adverse effects compared to the treatment they consider they were
entitled to expect under the Original Competition Law in connection with the Altai
Agreement. They have failed to sufficiently establish and substantiate the existence of
adverse effects compared to regime applicable to them under the 1995 Electricity Law.

R-Butler III, para. 16; see also R-Butler I, para. 44 and R-Butler II, paras. 23-24.

122

Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that their claim of breach of the stabilization
guarantee is not sufficiently established.

368. As concerns the substantial protection standards afforded under Articles 8 and 13 of the
1994 FIL, as mentioned above (paras. 302 and 304), the Arbitral Tribunal considers such
standards to be covered by the protection standards afforded under the BIT and the ECT.
Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal does not see the need to separately examine a breach of
these provisions.

(iii) — Conclusion

369. Claimants have failed to demonstrate that the implementation of the ‘tariff in exchange
for investment’ scheme adversely affected Claimants’ investment compared to the regime
applicable to them under the 1995 Electricity Law and their claim based on Article 6 of the
1994 FIL is therefore not sufficiently established.

370. | With regard to claims based on Articles 8 and 13 of the 1994 FIL, it is not necessary to
decide as the substance of these claims fall for consideration in the context the protection
standards afforded under the BIT and the ECT.

4.2 Breach of the Umbrella Clause under Article 10(1) of the ECT and Article II(2)(c)
of the BIT

(i) The Parties’ Positions

371. According to Claimants, Respondent breached the Umbrella Clauses under Article
10(1) of the ECT and Article II(2)(c) of the BIT, by implementing the ‘tariff in exchange
for investment’ scheme and thereby failing to comply with its obligations under the Altai
Agreement,” including by:

(i) preventing the Claimants from exercising the right to retain, as their own profits, all
amounts remaining after payment of all and any Costs (Clause 5.2.1);

(ii) failing to guarantee the repatriation of capital, loans, dividends, interest and other
income from the plants (Clause 5.5.1);

(iii) failing to indemnify the Claimants for any losses resulting from any Change of Law
which has a material adverse effect on the Claimants’ investment or their enjoyment
of their rights under the Altai Agreement (Clause 10.1.3);

(iv) failing to refrain from taking any action that would have a material adverse effect
on the Claimants’ investments or their enjoyment of their rights under the Altai

Agreement (Clause 13.1); and

(v) continuing to prevent the Claimants from exercising the right to switch to market
rates for selling energy in the competitive market (Clause 2.8).

wT CL Suppl. Subm. 6.08.2012, paras. 100 fol.

123

372. According to Respondent, Claimants claim for breach of the Umbrella Clause is
unfounded to the extent that the enactment of the 2012 Electricity Law did not breach any
of the clauses of the Altai Agreement invoked by Claimants:?"*

(i) With regard to Clause 5.2.1 of the Altai Agreement, it confers a right to retain
profits, whereby ‘profits’ are defined under this Clause as “all amounts remaining
after the payment of all and any Costs” and the term ‘Costs’ is defined in Schedule
1 of the Altai Agreement, as including “all premiums, reasonable fees, reasonable
costs and expenses whatsoever reasonable incurred’. Respondent submits that
such right is not affected by the 2012 Electricity Law. During the limited period
during which the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ policy is applicable and during
which generators are required to invest all net revenue received, the AES Entities
make no “profit” within the meaning of Clause 5.2.1 of the Altai Agreement. As
such, there is no violation of the right to retain the “amount remaining after the
payment of all and any Costs”.

(ii) With regard to Clause 5.5.1 of the Altai Agreement, it only refers to the freedom to
repatriate “capital, loans, dividends, interest and other income” and does not refer to
“returns”. The 2012 Electricity Law does not restrict such right, insofar as the
‘tariff in exchange for investment’ is based on an IAO agreed upon with the
generator. Thus, the generator agrees to reinvest the capital, and the 2012
Electricity Law therefore does not restrict the right of free repatriation of “capital,
loans, dividends, interest and other income”.

(iii) | With regard to Clause 10.1.3 of the Altai Agreement, the right to an indemnity
provided therein is limited and inapplicable in respect of the 2012 Electricity Law
and the 2009 Tariff Amendment, to the extent that such legislation falls under the
carve-out of “ordinary, reasonable and proper enforcement or application of any
rights in accordance with the provisions of any contracts and Kazakhstan
Legislation”.

(iv) With regard to Clause 2.8 of the Altai Agreement, Respondent submits that
Claimants’ interpretation of this clause is erroneous and that no right to charge
market prices derives from that provision.

(ii) The Arbitral Tribunal’s Assessment

373. The factual basis for Claimants’ claim of breach of the Umbrella Clauses under Article
10(1) of the ECT and Article II(2)(c) of the BIT is an alleged breach of the Altai
Agreement.

374. For the same reasons as set out above with regard to the Original Claims (para. 291),
the Arbitral Tribunal considers that it is not its role to determine whether or not the Altai
Agreement was breached as a matter of contract law. The Arbitral Tribunal is concerned
only with the question whether conduct incompatible with the Altai Agreement is
forbidden by the Umbrella Clauses and whether the conduct of Respondent in this case
accordingly breaches its obligations under the Umbrella Clauses. The Tribunal considers
that different interpretations of the Altai Agreement offered by the Parties reflect the fact

28 RSP Suppl. Subm. 27.08.2012, paras. 216 fol.

that the text of the Altai Agreement itself does not expressly and unequivocally prohibit the
implementation of measures under the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ scheme. The
question is whether the Altai Agreement contains or gives rise to an implied ‘obligation’ in
this respect that is elevated to a treaty obligation by virtue of the Umbrella Clauses. That
question is, in the Arbitral Tribunal’s view, essentially the same as the question whether
there was a legitimate expectation that Respondent’s right to adopt general measures in the
public interest would not be exercised in certain ways, including by the adoption of the
‘tariff in exchange for investment’ scheme. Certainly, such an obligation within the
meaning of the Umbrella Clauses could be no wider in its scope than a legitimate
expectation arising from the Altai Agreement and covered by the FET clauses.
Accordingly, the Tribunal has decided that the part of Claimants’ case should be
considered in the context of the FET standard and need not be considered separately in the
context of the Umbrella Clauses.

(iii) — Conclusion

375. The Tribunal concludes that it is not necessary to separately decide upon Claimants’
claim that the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ scheme is in breach of the Umbrella
Clauses under Article 10(1) of the ECT and Article II(2)(c) of the BIT. The substance of
that element of the claim properly falls for consideration in the context of the FET standard
and will therefore be addressed jointly with the FET standard.

4.3 Breach of the Duty to Encourage and Create Favourable and Transparent
Conditions for Investors under Article 10(1) of the ECT

(i) The Parties’ Positions

376. According to Claimants, by introducing the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ policy,
Respondent breached its duty to encourage and create favorable and transparent conditions
for investors under Article 10(1) of the ECT for the following reasons:7”

(i) Respondent removed any discretion from a generator over its own pricing and
investment policies and such discretion is vested in its entirety in MINT, who has
the power to approve or refuse IOAs depending on the correlation between the
chargeable prices and the level of investment suggested by the generator.

(ii) Not only does such policy discourage investment, MINT’s opaque right to refuse to
sign an IOA can also not be considered to create transparent conditions for
investors, or otherwise encourage or create favorable conditions for investors.

(iii) In addition, the consequence of a refusal by MINT to enter into an IOA as
contemplated in Article 25(5) of the 2012 Electricity Law is that any concerned
generator may only charge tariffs covering its costs of generation, without taking
into account any depreciation of capital or profit. Thus, such generator will actually
operate at a loss.

377. According to Respondent, to the extent Claimants rely solely on the ECT, this claim
can be made solely by Tau Power, and since no such claim has been previously raised as

ad CL Supp. Subm. 6.08.2012, paras. 94 fol.

125

part of Claimants’ Original Claims, this claim is necessarily limited to the alleged effects of
the 2012 Electricity Law.*”°

378. As concerns an alleged breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT, Respondent’s position is
that the enactment of the 2012 Electricity Law may not constitute such a breach. The first
sentence of Article 10(1) of the ECT imposes a general obligation on States Parties to
provide appropriate conditions for Investors “to make Investments”, and as a result is of no
continuing application and imposes no obligations once an Investment has in fact been
made. However, even if the Tribunal were to hold that the first sentence of Article 10(1)
remained applicable after an investment has been made, Respondent’s alternative position
is that the first sentence of Article 10(1) of the ECT imposes no freestanding obligation,
separate from the substantive obligations contained in the ECT.

379. There is no obvious characteristic of the 2012 Electricity Law which sufficiently
changes the position, as compared to the situation under the 2009 Tariff Amendment, so as
to justify a new claim.

(ii) The Arbitral Tribunal’s Assessment

380. The Arbitral Tribunal is of the opinion that the first sentence of Article 10(1) of the
ECT which refers to a duty of Kazakhstan to ‘encourage and create stable, equitable,
favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make
Investments’ is an introductory sentence aimed at putting the further obligations laid out in
Article 10(1) of the ECT into perspective. As such, it has mainly programmatic character
and does not provide for an independent standard of protection or right of action of a kind
that is sufficiently specific to be relied upon by an investor. This is confirmed by the use of
the terms “in accordance with the provisions of this treaty”, which precedes the obligation
of encouragement on which Claimants rely, and further by the terms “[s]uch conditions
shall include a commitment to accord at all times [...] fair and equitable treatment”, which
indicates that the content of this principle is further described in the following sentences of
this provision.

381. In addition, Claimants have failed to establish to what extent this asserted protection
standard would actually differ from the FET standard or other standards provided in that
very same provision, and how such difference would impact on its claims for damages.

382. Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that the duty to encourage and create stable
and transparent conditions for investment is already covered by the more specific
protection standards set out in the remaining part of Article 10(1) of the ECT and does not
constitute as self-standing independent standard.

(iii) — Conclusion

383. The Arbitral Tribunal is of the opinion that the first sentence of Article 10(1) of the
ECT does not establish an independent standard affording protection going beyond the
protection already afforded under the more specific protection standards set out in the
remaining part of Article 10(1) of the ECT. Consequently, no independent claim may be
based on the first sentence of Article 10(1) of the ECT.

The Parties’ Positions

According to Claimants, Respondent breached its obligation to accord fair and

As concerns the legitimate expectations, Claimants consider that by enacting the 2012

By requiring that AES Entities enter into an IOA and apply regulated tariffs,
Kazakhstan frustrated Claimants’ expectation to an unrestricted right to sell energy
to customers either directly or through a local affiliate or trading company, and to
charge for that energy at a blended tariff and at market prices after a competitive
market had developed (this expectation is derived from Clauses 7.1 and 2.8 of the
Altai Agreement);

By requiring that AES Entities reinvest the entire net income generated by their
sales of electricity and even the entire gross income (where no IOA is in place),
Kazakhstan frustrated Claimants’ expectation that they would be allowed to use the
income received from their investment at their discretion, subject to the limitations
imposed by the legislation in effect at the time the investment was made (this
expectation is derived from Clauses 5.2.1, 5.5.1 and 18 of the Altai Agreement and
Article 10(1) and the Stabilization Clause of the FIL);

By requiring that AES Entities reinvest the entire net income generated by their
sales of electricity and thereby prohibiting the repatriation of those profits as
dividends, Kazakhstan frustrated Claimants’ expectation that they would be allowed
to repatriate capital, loans, dividends, interest and other income from their power
generation facilities in Kazakhstan (this expectation is derived from Clause 5.5.1 of
the Altai Agreement, Article IV(a) of the BIT and Article 12(1) of the ECT);

By enacting and implementing the 2012 Electricity Law, Kazakhstan frustrated
Claimants’ expectation that they would be indemnified for any losses resulting from
any breaches by Kazakhstan of the Altai Agreement and from any change of law
(including new legislation) that materially reduced, prejudiced or otherwise
adversely affected their investments (this expectation is derived from Clause 10.1 of
the Altai Agreement and Article 6 of the FIL);

By enacting and implementing the 2012 Electricity Law, Kazakhstan frustrated
Claimants’ expectation that Kazakhstan would refrain from doing anything adverse
to the Claimants’ assets or enjoyment of their assets, unless such interference was
the result of ordinary, reasonable and proper enforcement or application of rights in
accordance with Kazakh legislation (this expectation is derived from Clause 13.1 of
the Altai Agreement);

By enacting and implementing the 2012 Electricity Law, Kazakhstan frustrated
Claimants’ expectation that Kazakhstan would encourage and create favourable and
transparent conditions for the Claimants to make their investments (this expectation
is derived from Article 10(1) of the ECT); and

By enacting and implementing the 2012 Electricity Law, Kazakhstan frustrated
Claimants’ expectation that Kazakhstan would act non-arbitrarily and reasonably
(this expectation is derived from Article II(2)(b) of the BIT and Article 10(1) of the
ECT).

Whilst Claimants acknowledge that the FET standard requires, to a certain extent, a

balance between investors’ legitimate expectations to make a fair return on its investment
and the right of the host State to regulate its economy in the public interest, Claimants
submit that there is no legitimate policy goal for Kazakhstan’s intervention through the
enactment of the 2012 Electricity Law. And, even if the Tribunal considered that mandated
re-investment of all profits could be deemed to be a legitimate policy goal, the enactment
of the 2012 Electricity Law could not be deemed to be a ‘reasonable’ or ‘proportionate’
action to take in pursuit of that goal. There can be no justification for Kazakhstan to
require all generators to re-invest all their income and profits back into their generating
facilities.

According to Respondent, Claimants’ claim based on a breach of the FET Standard

under Article II(2)(b) of the BIT and Article 10(1) of the ECT is entirely unfounded for the
following main reasons:*”

Claimants’ FET claim appears to rely solely upon the alleged failure to respect

Claimants’ asserted legitimate expectations. In this regard, Claimants’ expectations can be
divided into three categories:

(i)

(ii)

Category 1: Expectations which essentially parallel those previously asserted by
Claimants at various points in their Reply with regard to Claimants’ Original
Claims. This is in particular the case where Claimants assert legitimate
expectations based on : (a) the asserted right to charge market rates; (b) the asserted
right to sell energy through trading affiliates; (c) the asserted right to make sales at a
blended tariff; (d) the asserted right to be indemnified for breaches of the Altai
Agreement and any changes in the law; (e) the asserted right to stabilization; and (f)
the asserted obligation that the Respondent would refrain from action having a
material adverse effect on the Claimants’ investment or the enjoyment of their
asserted rights under the Altai Agreement, and that any enforcement action would
be consistent with Kazakhstan law.

Category 2: Additional expectations asserted for the purposes of Claimants’
Additional Claim and relating to an expectation to earn a return on their investment,
including (relying in particular on Clauses 5.2.1 and 5.5.1 of the Altai Agreement)
to use their income realized from their investments at their discretion, subject to the
confinement of the then prevailing legislation (relying on Clauses 5.2.1, 5.5.1 and
18 of the Altai Agreement, and Articles 6(1) and 10(1) of the 1994 FIL).

could have legitimately held an expectation that they would be entitled to earn a return on
their investment, this expectation could not have been either unqualified or absolute.

391.
FET standard relates to whether, on the one hand, the 2012 Electricity Law constitutes a
reasonable and proportionate measure of regulation adopted in pursuit of a legitimate
public interest, and on the other, whether, if so, in all the circumstances, whatever
legitimate and reasonable expectation Claimants may in fact have held have been
improperly frustrated by the adoption of the 2012 Electricity Law in a manner which
breaches the FET standard”.* According to Respondent, the ‘tariff in exchange for
investment’ policy underlying both the 2009 Tariff Amendment and the 2012 Electricity
Law is a reasonable and proportionate measure adopted in pursuit of a legitimate public
interest for the following main reasons:

303

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

(v)

Category 3: Further additional expectations asserted for the purposes of Claimants’
Additional Claim, including (a) a new alleged expectation that the Claimants would
be permitted to repatriate capital, loans, dividends, interest and other income
(relying on Clause 5.5.1 of the Altai Agreement and Article IV(a) of the BIT and
Article 21(1) of the ECT); (b) a new alleged expectation that Kazakhstan would
encourage and create favorable and transparent conditions for the Claimants to
make their investments (relying on Article 10(1) ECT; and (c) a new alleged
expectation that Kazakhstan would act non-arbitrarily and reasonably (relying on
Article II(2)(b) of the BIT and Article 10(1) of the ECT).

In relation to Category 1, as set out with regard to Claimants’ Original Claims,

In relation to Category 2, while Respondent accepts that, as a general matter, Claimants

In this regard, Respondent contends that “the dispute between the Parties under the

It was necessary to ensure the increase in investment in the power industry so as to
increase available generation capacity and avoid a projected shortfall in generating
capacity;

It was financed by the consumers themselves, who bear the financial brunt of the
investments which generators make;

It is entirely rational for generators to undertake to make investments by entering
into IAO in circumstances in which the entire cost of those investments is
shouldered by consumers, and no capital investment by the generator itself is
required;

The fact that no immediate return on capital is available during the period up to the
end of 2015 is more than outweighed by the increase in the capital value of the
existing assets of generators which are restored or reconditioned, and the addition of
new capital assets as the result of installation of new capacity, which result from the
investments made;

The policy of ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ preserves the right of investors to
determine “autonomously” the level of their investment commitments. All that

RSP Suppl Subm. 27.08.2013, para. 140.

129

MINT requires is that the investments which are proposed to be made correspond
with the net revenue received from consumers;

(vi) The ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ does not constitute a disincentive to
investors, mainly because the generators are able to take the benefits and the
increase in the capital value of their assets resulting from the investments they make
and which have been funded by consumers;

(vii) The aim of the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ policy was to lead to increased
capacity, and not to protect consumers;

(viii) The ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ does not incentivize wasteful or inefficient
investment, to the extent that the policy leaves it to generators to choose what level
of investments should be made. As a consequence, the generators are then able to
propose the level of tariff which will allow them to finance those investments
having taken into account their costs and depreciation.

392. In relation to Category 3, Respondent submits, among others, that Claimants have not
provided any evidence that they in fact held the expectations alleged at the time of making
of their investment. In this regard, Claimants seek to rely on asserted legitimate
expectations which simply replicate the content of substantive provisions of the BIT and
ECT, and those claims are therefore indistinguishable from and add nothing to the claims
already made under those other standards.

393. In view of these considerations, the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ policy
constitutes a reasonable and proportionate measure to respond to legitimate public interest,
as such any interference with Claimants’ supposed legitimate expectations does not rise to
the level of breach of the FET standard. The temporary restriction on the ability of
Claimants to freely manage assets within Kazakhstan is more than adequately justified by
the pressing social need faced by Kazakhstan.

(ii) The Arbitral Tribunal’s Assessment

394. The Arbitral Tribunal agrees with Respondent that Claimants’ sub-claims for breach of
the FET fall into various categories:

395. To the extent that Claimants rely on a frustration of legitimate expectations, which the
Arbitral Tribunal considered to be unfounded (see above para. 296), Claimants’ claim for
breach of the FET standard fails. This concerns in particular Claimants’ sub-claims based
on Articles 2.8, 7.1 and 13.1 of the Altai Agreement and Article 6 of the 1994 FIL.

396. To the extent that Claimants rely on a frustration of legitimate expectations deriving
from other provisions of the ECT and/or BIT, the Arbitral Tribunal agrees with Respondent
that the concerned sub-claims merely replicate the content of substantive provisions of the
BIT and ECT, and those claims are therefore indistinguishable from and add nothing to the
claims already made under those other standards. Therefore, such expectations may not
give rise to a separate and independent breach of the FET standard.

397. The remaining question is therefore whether the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’

scheme as implemented by the 2009 Tariff Exchange and the 2012 Electricity Law
breaches the FET standard either because it frustrated other legitimate expectations asserted

130,

by Claimants or because it was otherwise in breach of substantive protection standards
afforded under the FET standard.

398. First of all, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that Claimants did have a legitimate
expectation that they would have the opportunity to make and to have the right to dispose
of a reasonable return of and on their investment. Any investor expects to make a certain
return of and on its investment, and in view of the nature and protection afforded in the
1994 FIL, in particular of Article 10(1) of the 1994 FIL, Claimants were entitled to hold the
legitimate expectation that they would be able to make a reasonable return of and on their
investment. The fact that the 1994 FIL was repealed in 2003 does not affect the existence
of such legitimate expectation, which arose at the time of making the main part of the
investment, i.e., in 1997, and such legitimate expectation therefore remains protected under
the FET standard of Article 10(1) of the ECT and Article II(2)(a) of the BIT. It is therefore
unnecessary to determine whether it would also remain protected under the 1994 FIL
notwithstanding its repeal.

399. Secondly, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that a legitimate expectation to earn a
reasonable return of and on an investment necessarily implies the right to a certain
discretion by the investors on how to make use of such return. This right includes in
principle the right for foreign investors to repatriate such return.

400. The Arbitral Tribunal further considers that the legitimacy of this expectation was also
confirmed by Articles 5.2.1 and 5.5.1 of the Altai Agreement and Article 14(1) of the ECT
and Article IV(1) of the BIT. Whilst Articles 2.8 and 7.1 were too broad to give rise to an
independent legitimate expectation protected under the FET Standard that Claimants would
be able at all times and irrespective of the applicable legal framework to charge what they
considered ‘market prices’ and use trading companies applying blended tariffs (see above
paras. 290-293), the situation as concerns the principles set out in Articles 5.2.1 and 5.5.1
of the Altai Agreement is somewhat different. Claimants’ legitimate expectation do not
arise solely out of these provisions, but derive from the general principle that investors
should be entitled to make a reasonable return on and of their investment, combined with
the nature of the 1994 FIL and in particular the wording of Article 10(1) thereof and the
wording of Article 14(1) of the ECT, Article IV(1) of the BIT and Articles 5.2.1 and 5.5.1
of the Altai Agreement, which clearly provide that the AES Entities would be able not only
to retain ‘profits’ but also to repatriate ‘capital, loans, dividends, interest and other income’
and ‘transfer’ ‘capital’, ‘unspent earnings’ or ‘returns’. As such, all these factors combined
gave rise to a legitimate expectation of Claimants that they would be able to make a
reasonable return of and on their investment.

401. However, it is also understood that the protection of such a legitimate expectation under
the FET standard is not absolute and in order for a restriction of such right to breach the
FET standard, it is necessary that the nature of the restriction be seen as unfair or
inequitable.

402. In this regard, Respondent contends that the key question is rather whether the ‘tariff in
exchange for investment’ policy as implemented by the 2009 Tariff Amendment and 2012
Electricity Law was reasonable and proportionate. Respondent affirms that it did constitute
a reasonable and proportionate measure to respond to legitimate public interest, and that
therefore any interference with Claimants’ supposed legitimate expectations does not rise
to the level of breach of the FET standard. Respondent relies in particular on the
‘temporary’ and ‘necessary’ nature of the restrictions imposed by the 2009 Tariff

131

Amendment and 2012 Electricity Law, and the fact that the generators were able to sell
electricity at higher prices than otherwise possible, the increase in price being funded by
the consumers themselves.

403. To the extent that the Arbitral Tribunal already ruled that it considered the underlying
goals of the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ policy to be per se unproblematic, it agrees
that the key question in the present case is whether such policy was implemented in a
proportionate and reasonable way. It further agrees that in order to determine the
proportionality or reasonableness of certain restrictions, the duration of the restriction and
its necessity to achieve the pursued goal are important criteria.

404. The Arbitral Tribunal however disagrees with Respondent that the restrictions imposed
in implementation of the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ policy were proportionate and
reasonable.

405. As determined above (paras. 349-354), the restrictions imposed by the ‘tariff in
exchange for investment’ scheme were such that they obliged power generators to re-invest
all operating cash until 31 December 2015 and thereby prevented them from making any
different use of the generated income. In addition, for generators without a signed IAO,
they were denied the right to account for depreciation as a cost and were therefore forced to
reinvest an equivalent amount thereby operating at a loss. This restriction is drastic and
radical.

406. While the Arbitral Tribunal accepts that certain restrictions concerning the level of
returns to be earned or to be repatriated may be justified in circumstances were investment
in electricity generating infrastructure appears indispensable to prevent a collapse of the
electricity distribution system, the restrictions imposed by Respondent would only be
justified if the threat of collapse was real and imminent and the measures necessary to
prevent the collapse could not be implemented by means that involved a lesser intrusion
upon the Claimants’ rights.

407. The Arbitral Tribunal accepts that in 2008-2009 the risks of a collapse appeared real
and imminent, but it considers that Respondent has failed to establish that it could not have
prevented such collapse through other, less intrusive, measures. The Arbitral Tribunal is
not aware that any alternative measures were considered by the Kazakh government.

408. In addition, even if these restrictions had been the only way to avoid a collapse, once it
became apparent that the expected collapse was not going to happen, the principle of
proportionality would have required Kazakhstan to adjust the restrictions accordingly.

 

409. Therefore, and considering that the prohibition on distribution of profits is total and that
the drastic restrictions imposed by the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ scheme were
intended to remain in place for a duration of seven years, and were therefore not aimed
only at preventing an imminent danger but were evidently part of a longer-term plan to
renovate the national electricity distribution system, they cannot be considered proportional
or reasonable and are therefore in breach of the FET standard afforded under Article 10(1)
of the ECT and Article II(2)(a) of the BIT.

410. The fact that the generators were entitled to sell the electricity at higher prices than they

would have been able to charge without such policy is irrelevant to the extent that the
generators were not in a position to benefit from any such increased income for a period of

132

seven years, and that, as explained below (paras. 434 fol.), there is no guarantee that they
may be able to benefit therefrom after the expiry of the seven years period.

(iii) — Conclusion

411. In conclusion, Claimants were legitimately entitled to expect that they would have the
opportunity to make a reasonable return of and on their investment and to repatriate such
return within a reasonable timeframe.

412. In view of the drastic character and extended duration of the restrictions imposed by the
‘tariff in exchange for investment’ scheme as implemented under the 2009 Tariff
Amendment and 2012 Electricity Law, such restrictions cannot be deemed to have been
justified by the underlying policy and are therefore in breach of the FET standard afforded
under Article 10(1) of the ECT and Article II(2)(a) of the BIT. For reasons explained
above, this breach absorbs any breach of the Umbrella Clauses under Article 10(1) of the
ECT and Article II(2)(c) of the BIT (see above para. 375).

4.5 Breach of the Duty to Refrain from Adopting Arbitrary or Unreasonable
Measures under Article 10(1) of the ECT and Article II(2)(b) of the BIT

(i) The Parties’ Positions

413. According to Claimants, by introducing the ‘tariff in exchange of investment’ policy,
Respondent breached its duty to refrain from adopting arbitrary or unreasonable measures
under Article 10(1) of the ECT and Article II(2)(b) of the BIT as the amendments
embodied in the 2012 Electricity Law are both arbitrary and unreasonable.

414. According to Respondent, Claimants’ claim consists of “a little more than a bare
assertion that the 2012 Electricity Law does not constitute a reasonable, non-arbitrary and
proportionate measure adopted in pursuit of a rational public policy goal”. The
Respondent denies that there has been or will be any unreasonable or arbitrary impairment
of the Claimants’ investment as a result of the adoption and application of the 2012
Electricity Law. The standard to be applied is similar to the FET standard and for the same
reasons that Respondent denies a breach of the FET (i.e. the fact that the ‘tariff in exchange
for investment’ scheme constitutes a legitimate, reasonable and proportionate response in
pursuit of a pressing public interest requirement), there can also be no breach of the general
duty to encourage and create favorable and transparent investment conditions under Article
10(1) of the BCT.*4

(ii) The Arbitral Tribunal’s Assessment

415. Article 10(1) of the ECT prohibits a State from impairing “by unreasonable or
discriminatory measures [the] management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal [of
the investment]” and Article I(2)(b) of the BIT provides for a similar prohibition though
referring to an impairment by “arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management,
operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion, or disposal of
investments”.

RSP Suppl. Subm. 27.08.2012, paras. 207 fol.

133

416. In their Supplementary Submission of 27 August 2012, Claimants merely refer to their
Memorial of 28 April 2011 (paras. 347-359) and their Reply Memorial of 30 March 2012
(paras. 451-459). However, in their Memorial and Reply, their claim for breach of the
prohibition of unreasonable and arbitrary impairment mainly relates to the 2009 Tariff
Amendment and “its reversion to a heavily regulated local electricity market”. Claimants
do not specifically address the breach of this provision with regard to the ‘tariff in
exchange for investment’ scheme. In other words, Claimants’ position is mainly based on
their arguments that the reversion to a heavily regulated local electricity market was the
result of irrational policy goals. Therefore, while the relevant provisions refer to
‘measures’, it appears that Claimants’ claim hereunder is actually directed at the underlying
policy.

417. In this regard, the Arbitral Tribunal has already found that the policy goals underlying
the ‘tariff in exchange for investment scheme’ were not per se irrational (see above
paras. 360-363). It can also not be seen as having been discriminatory to the extent that it
applied to all power generators equally.

418. To the extent that Claimants’ claim hereunder would be directed at the specific effects
of the application of the 2009 Tariff Amendment and 2012 Electricity Law on Claimants’
investments, it is unclear to what extent their claim for unreasonable and arbitrary measures
differs from their claim for breach of the FET standard. Claimants have also failed to
establish to what extent such additional claim would actually impact the requested
remedies and be different from remedies already available under the FET standard. To the
extent that the Arbitral Tribunal has already ruled that the effects of the ‘tariff in exchange
for investment’ scheme were contrary to the FET standard, it does not consider it necessary
to determine whether the same facts would also constitute a breach of the duty to refrain
from unreasonable or arbitrary measures.

(iii) Conclusion

419. In conclusion, to the extent that Claimants’ claim for breach of the duty to refrain from
adopting arbitrary or unreasonable measures under Article 10(1) of the ECT and Article
II(2)(b) of the BIT is mainly based on the argument of the ‘irrational policy goal’ of the
‘tariff in exchange for investment’ scheme, it is unfounded. To the extent that such claim
would be directed at the specific effects of the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ policy,
the way that Claimants have construed their claim appears no different from their claim for
breach of the FET standard and is therefore covered thereby, so that it is unnecessary to
determine the existence of a separate breach under the duty to refrain from adopting
unreasonable or arbitrary measures.

4.6 Breach of the Duty to Guarantee the Freedom of Transfer of the Claimants’
Returns from their Investments out of Kazakhstan without Delay under Article
14(1) of the ECT and Article [V(1) of the BIT

(i) The Parties’ Positions
420. According to Claimants, by introducing the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ scheme
and requiring that all returns be reinvested, Respondent breached its duty to guarantee the

freedom of transfer of the Claimants’ returns from their investments out of Kazakhstan
without delay under Article 14(1) of the ECT and Article TV(1) of the BIT. Such

134

reinvestment requirement means that Claimants cannot make any transfer of their returns
“freely”, and it further means that they are prevented from transferring such returns
“without delay” *°°

421. Respondent contends that the relevant provisions of the ECT and BIT refer to different
standards with regard to the definition of investment, as well as the specific obligations
provided therein. In particular, the definition of investment under Article I(1) of the BIT
makes no reference to the term ‘returns’, and this term is defined separately under Article
I(1)(d). In addition, while Article TV(1) of the BIT imposes a requirement that transfers
should be permitted “without delay”, no such requirement is contained in the ECT. *°°

422. According to Respondent, Claimants’ claims are not concerned with any material
restriction upon the transfer of returns from their investment. In reality, Claimants’
argument in this regard rather aims to transform the provisions on freedom of transfer into
an international law guarantee of a right to ‘receive’ returns. On its face, the 2012
Electricity Law does not impose any restriction on the right to transfer returns. In any case,
Respondent observes that, even if Claimants were able to establish a breach, it will be for
Claimants to provide evidence of the damage in fact caused by any such breach, and which
they have in fact suffered as a result.

(ii) The Arbitral Tribunal’s Assessment

423. As mentioned above (see above paras. 394-412), the Arbitral Tribunal has already ruled
that the nature of the restrictions imposed by Kazakhstan under the ‘tariff in exchange for
investment’ policy were in breach of the FET standard to the extent that they prevented
Claimants from making reasonable returns of and on their investment and exercise certain
discretion in the use of such returns, including their repatriation.

424. The question therefore arises whether Article 14(1) of the ECT and Article IV(1) of the
BIT provide any additional protection to Claimants justifying to examine a separate breach
of such provisions.

425. The Arbitral Tribunal considers that Article 14(1) of the ECT and Article IV(1) of the
BIT are a specific implementation of the general principle protected under the FET
standard that an investor should have the right to earn and transfer reasonable returns of
and on its investments. Article 14(1) of the ECT and Article IV(1) of the BIT go further
than the protection afforded under the FET by establishing more specific principles
concerning the conditions for transfer of such returns and other capital.

426. Thus, while it is possible that certain measures breach the standard of protection
afforded under Article 14(1) of the ECT and Article IV(1) of the BIT without breaching the
FET standard, where measures restricting the earning and transfer of reasonable returns are
such as to breach the FET standard, such breach absorbs a consequential breach of Article
14(1) of the ECT and Article IV(1) of the BIT based on the same specific facts.

(iii) — Conclusion

427. In conclusion, to the extent that the Arbitral Tribunal has already determined that the
restrictions imposed in implementation of the ‘tariff in exchange of investment’ policy
breached the basic protection afforded under the FET standard with regard to Claimants’
rights to earn a reasonable return of and on their investment and exercise a certain
discretion with regard to its use (see above paras. 394 fol.), including the repatriation of
such returns, such a determination already covers and absorbs any consequential breach of
Article 14(1) of the ECT and Article IV(1) of the BIT.

5. Time Limitation

428. Respondent has advanced that claims made under the 1994 FIL and/or the Altai
Agreement in connection with the Umbrella Clauses would be deemed to be made on the
basis of Kazakh law, and would accordingly be subject to the general 3-year statute of
limitations applicable under Article 178 and 179 of the Kazakh Civil Code. As a
consequence, claims of breach of the FIL and/or Umbrella Clauses which occurred after 11
June 2007 (i.e. less than 3 years prior to the filing with ICSID of the Request for
Arbitration on 11 June 2010), and any claims relating to events prior to that date would be
time-barred (see above para. 172).

429. Claimants contend that their claims are not and cannot be time barred because the
relevant Articles 178 and 179 of the Kazakh Civil Code do not apply to proceedings
outside Kazakhstan and limitation under national law cannot bar claims before ICSID
tribunals. In any event, the statute of limitations does not apply to a claim for full
restitution to the extent that there is a continuing violation of Claimants’ rights under the
FIL, the ECT and the BIT (see above para. 179(iii)).”

430. The Arbitral Tribunal finds that the question of limitation period under Kazakh law is
irrelevant. As concerns claims based on the 1994 FIL and/or Umbrella Clauses, the Arbitral
Tribunal has either considered such claims to be unfounded or it considered that standards
of the 1994 FIL were similar to standards of protection afforded under the BIT and the
ECT and did therefore not require a _ separate determination (see above
paras. 340, 368, 369, 375).

431. As to claims based on alleged breaches of substantial protection standards under the
ECT and BIT, it is undisputed that time limitations applicable under national law do not
apply to such treaty claims.

432. Consequently, the claim for breach of the FET standard, which the Arbitral Tribunal

considered to be founded, is not subject to the three years limitation period under Kazakh
law and is therefore not time barred.

6. Third Conclusion

433. With regard to Claimants’ claims relating to the implementation by the 2009
Tariff Amendment and 2012 Electricity Law of the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’
policy, the Arbitral Tribunal finds as follows:

cy)

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

(v)

(vi)

(vii)

Claimants’ claims for breach of the standards set forth in Article 6, 8 and 13 of
the 1994 FIL are unfounded;

Claimants’ claim for breach of Article 10(1) of the 1994 FIL is covered by its
claim for breach of the FET standard and does therefore not need to be
separately addressed;

Claimants’ claim for breach of the Umbrella Clauses contained in Article 10(1)
of the ECT and Article II(2)(c) of the BIT for failure by Kazakhstan to comply
with its obligations under the Altai Agreement is absorbed by the breach of the
FET standard and does not need to be separately addressed;

Claimants’ claim for breach of the FET standard under Article 10(1) of the
ECT and Article II(2)(a) of the BIT is well-founded to the extent that, in view
of their drastic character and extended duration, the restrictions imposed by
the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ policy as implemented by the 2009
Tariff Amendment and 2012 Electricity Law went beyond what could have
been considered a proportional and reasonable response to the threat of
collapse of the electricity supply system and can therefore not be deemed to
have been justified by the underlying policy;

Claimants’ claim for breach of the duty to encourage and create favorable and
transparent conditions for investors under Article 10(1) of the ECT is rejected
for the reason that such duty does not establish an independent standard
affording protection going beyond the protection already afforded under the
more specific protection standards set out in the remaining part of Article
10(1) of the ECT, in particular the FET standard;

Claimants’ claim for breach of the duty to refrain from adopting unreasonable
or arbitrary measures under Article 10(1) of the ECT and Article II(2)(b) of
the BIT is unfounded to the extent that it is based on the argument of an
‘irrational policy goal’ of the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ scheme. To
the extent that such claim is directed at the restrictions imposed in
implementation of such scheme, Claimants’ claim overlaps with their claim for
breach of the FET standard and does therefore not require a separate
determination;

Claimants’ claim for breach of the duty to guarantee the freedom of transfer
of the Claimants’ returns from their investments out of Kazakhstan without
delay under Article 14 of the ECT and Article IV(1) of the BIT is already
covered by Claimants’ claim for breach of the FET standard and does
therefore not require a separate determination.

137

F. For the Period from 1 January 2016 onwards

I. The Mechanism to Apply Post-2016

434. It is undisputed between the Parties that from 1 January 2016 onwards, the tariff regime
stipulated under the 2009 Tariff Amendment and 2012 Electricity Law will cease to apply.
It is further undisputed that tariffs will continue to be set by the State for further seven year
period until 2022.8 In particular, the Parties agree that there will be two separate tariff
components:

(i)

(ii)

A Maximum Electricity Tariff (MET), which will constitute an upper cap upon
the prices which generators can charge their customers. For this purpose,
generators will again be divided into groups. Maximum tariffs will be set
annually for each group.

A Maximum Capacity Tariff (MCT), constituting an upper cap on the price
which may be charged for capacity maintenance services. Through the capacity
market generators will be able to sell capacity maintenance services to KEGOC
at a centralized auction at the MCT. Here again, maximum tariffs will be set
annually for each group.

435. The Parties however disagree on the mechanism of determination of these tariffs and
their effect.

436. According to Claimants, the post-1 January 2016 regime does not provide for any

return of or on any new investments made by the Claimants from 2016 onwards:

(iii)

(iv)

309

With regard to the MET, generators will be grouped for the MET according to
their operating cost profiles — in other words, generators with very similar levels
of production costs. For each group of generators, the MET for the period
2016-2022 will be calculated only in the amount necessary to cover the
operating expenses of the generator in that group with the highest operating
costs in 2015, not including depreciation costs. Thus, the MET is designed to
cover operating costs only and does not provide for any return of or on invested
capital.

With regard to the MCT, this is the price at which a generator may sell its
available capacity to the system operator, KEGOC. Generators will be grouped
for the MCT according to type and generating capacity; a generator may or may
not be in the same group for both the MET and the MCT. For each group of
generators, the MCT for each year of the seven year period 2016-2022 will be
equal exactly to 1/7th of the highest amount of forced reinvestment made in
2015 by a generator in that group. In other words, the MCT provides for a
return on capital with respect to the amount of forced reinvestment made in

438.

(v)

2015 only. However, that return on capital will be spread over a seven year
period from 2016-2022. No return on invested capital for the years 2009-2014,
or from 2016 onwards, is provided by the MCT.

Both the MET and the MCT are maximum capped tariffs, but there is no
guarantee that a generator will be able to achieve either of these maximum
prices. That is dependent on whether generators are able to make sales.
Kazakhstan has acknowledged that there is likely to be an oversupply of
electricity in 2016 meaning that it is unlikely that generators will, in fact, be
able to receive the maximum capped tariffs.

In summary, under the post-1 January 2016 regime as contemplated by the 2012
Electricity Law, the only capital invested by Claimants that may possibly be recovered
under the post-1 January 2016 regime is capital forcibly reinvested in a single year, namely
2015. Even then, this capital can only be recovered over a future seven year period, thus
greatly reducing the present value of such recovery. Moreover, even this recovery is far
from guaranteed as the generator must still manage to trade sufficient capacity in those
years to KEGOC at the maximum level of the MCT.

According to Respondent, the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ policy leaves

sufficient room for generators to make profits:*"°

(i)

(ii)

The MET be set for each group based on the “maximum actual price formed in the
respective group of electricity generating organizations realizing electricity within
the year which preceded the introduction of maximum electricity tariffs” (Art. 12-
1(2)(3) of the 2012 Electricity Law). Generators will be able to set their own prices
up to the level of the cap. As a consequence, to the extent that a generator is able to
operate more efficiently by reducing its costs, it will be able to achieve a profit from
the sale of electricity.

The MCT is to be adjusted annually so as to ensure “the return on investments
made in the renewal, maintenance, reconstruction, and technical re-equipping of
existing production assets within the limits of the normative period of recoupment
equal to seven years” (Art. 1(31-2)) and is to take into account the need to ensure
the investment attractiveness of the industry (Art. 12-1(2-1)(2). In the first year, the
MCT is to be set based on “the means of the electricity generating organization
ensuring the return of investments made in the renewal, maintenance,
reconstruction, and technical re-equipping of existing generating assets within the
limits of the normative period of recoupment equal to seven years” prevailing
within the relevant group of generators used during 2015 (i.e. under the ‘tariff in
exchange for investment’ policy. (Art. 12-1(2-1)(3)).

2. The Arbitral Tribunal’s Assessment

439.

Based on the way that Claimants’ construed their claim relating to the implementation

of the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ scheme, Claimants’ contentions regarding the
post-2016 regime mainly served to support their position that there is no guarantee that

310

RSP PHB on Liability 30.11.2012, paras. 124 fol.; see also Paris Hearing Day | p. 165 1. 2 — p. 171 1. 16.

139

they would ever recover any investments made in the 2008 to 2015 period and that the
majority of such investments would be lost. When Claimants submitted their Updated
Claim (see above para. 108), they included an updated computation of the Claimants’
losses from 2016 onwards. However, Claimants did not raise a separate claim relating to
the post-2016 regime and a determination on the admissibility of the ‘update’ of its
previous claims was deferred by the Arbitral Tribunal (see above para. 113(i)).

440. While it is unclear whether the amounts claimed by Claimants with regard to the post-
2016 regime have a legal basis independent of the basis of Claimants’ claims in relation to
the 2009-2015 regime, the Arbitral Tribunal does not consider this question to be relevant.

441. The Arbitral Tribunal considers that any claim relating to what may or may not happen
under the post-2016 regime would be premature and therefore at this stage unfounded. The
main reasons are the following:

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

While the 2012 Electricity Law provides general guidelines as to the treatment of
generators after 1 January 2016, many questions remain unanswered, such as the
specific composition of relevant groups and the specific level of tariffs to be
imposed;

Kazakhstan is free at any time to change its course and amend the 2012 Electricity
Law with regard with measures to be taken after | January 2016;

To the extent that the post-2016 regime as currently envisaged by Kazakhstan
builds upon the previous ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ scheme as implemented
by the 2009 Tariff Amendment and 2012 Electricity Law and considering that the
Arbitral Tribunal ruled such scheme to be in breach of the FET standard under
Article 10(1) of the ECT and Article II(2)(a) of the BIT, admitting at this stage a
claim relating to the uncertain post-2016 regime would imply assuming that
Kazakhstan will disregard the Arbitral Tribunal’s ruling. Such assumption would
be inappropriate. On the contrary, the Arbitral Tribunal would expect that
Kazakhstan will take the appropriate measures to remedy the current breach of the
FET standard and adjust the post-2016 regime in such a way as to comply with all
of its obligations under the ECT and BIT.

In any case, due to the uncertainties relating to the post-2016 regime, it would not
be possible to determine with sufficient accuracy the specific financial
consequences of such regime on Claimants’ operation, so that any calculation of
potential damages would be highly speculative.

442. This determination does not affect Claimants’ rights to file, at the appropriate time, new
claims as a new ICSID case in respect of future developments.

3. Fourth Conclusion

443. Claimants’ claims for breach of (a) Articles 6, 8, 10 and 13 of the FIL (b), Articles
10 and 14 of the ECT, and (c) Articles II and IV of the BIT relating to the regime
after 1 January 2016 are premature and therefore unfounded.

140

G. Remedies

1. With Regard to Claims relating to Kazakh Competition Law and Relating to the
Period until 31.12.2008

444. The Arbitral Tribunal has already determined that Claimants’ claims relating to the
changes in Kazakh competition legislation and its application to the AES Entities in the
period prior to 2009 are unfounded (see above para. 340).

445. As aconsequence thereof, Kazakhstan may not be held liable for any damage caused to
Claimants in application of the relevant Kazakh competition legislation.

446. Claimants’ claims for restitution and/or compensation for damages are therefore to be
rejected.

2. With Regard to Claims relating to the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ scheme for
the Period from 1.1.2009 to 31.12.2015

2.1 The Parties’ Positions

447. According to Claimants, because of the way in which the 2009 Tariff Amendment and
the 2012 Electricity Law operate (see above para. 346), the ultimate effect of this
legislation is that it extinguishes the entire fair market value of Claimants’ investments.*!!
In the terms of Prof. Kalt and Mr Rosen:

"Under the 2012 [Electricity Law], the situation from an economic and valuation point
of view that was created was a business enterprise that was incapable of earning any
cash returns, and so its market value had been extinguished’. °™"4)_— "TAIL you
are doing is sitting making the investments, with significant pieces, but with no
opportunity to recover even the capital you've invested, much less a return on that
capital. [T}his has the effect [...] of extinguishing the fair value of the plant, the revenue
streams, to a willing buyer of those revenue streams".

448. It is Claimants’ case that the change of regulatory regime did not impact on the
Claimants’ entitlement to charge competitive market prices and therefore the competitive
market price should have been available to the AES Entities from 1 January 2009

312
onwards.

449. Based thereon, Claimants calculated their losses as follows:

(i) For past losses relating to the period 1 January 2009 to 30 September 2012,
Claimants claim for loss of profits and incremental costs. Claimants’ loss of profits
is calculated on the basis of the difference between the competitive market prices
which the AES Entities would have charged absent Kazakhstan’s breaches (the
“but-for” prices) and the actual prices they charged from 1 January 2009 to 30
September 2012. The incremental costs that Claimants sustained between 1

corresponds to what they consider to be the ‘competitive market price’.*!* This is also the
case for the hypothetical scenario submitted by the Arbitral Tribunal in which “the Arbitral
Tribunal were to decide that the 2009/2012 Electricity Law violated Claimants’ rights, but
that the capping of prices based on the Competition Law did not violate such rights”.

451.
fatally flawed assumptions:*!°

(i)

(ii)

452.

January 2009 and 30 September 2012 represent various fines and penalties imposed
on the AES Entities by Kazakhstan relating to alleged competition law violations
and thereto related defense proceedings.

As to future losses for the period from 1 October 2012 to 31 December 2015, the
principles of damage calculation remain the same, except that Claimants relied on
the assumption that the AES Entities would continue to sell power at capped tariffs
originally established by the 2009 Tariff Amendment.*"*

As to future losses from | January 2016 onwards, the principles regarding the ‘but
for’ prices remain the same, although Claimants have updated their computation
based on additional information provided by Mr. Jaxaliyev as concerns the
applicable tariffs.

Thus, in all scenarios, Claimants consistently rely on a ‘but for’ price which

According to Respondent, Claimants’ damage calculation relies on two critical but

They have assumed success on all the breaches alleged, or that any and all breaches
alleged result in the same quantum of damages sought. There is no proper analysis
of which breaches are causally relevant to any particular part of the total sum
sought by way of damages.

They have assumed that the competition legislation should never have been and
should never be applied to the AES Entities and that Claimants were entitled in all
relevant periods to charge ‘competitive market prices’. However, at all relevant
times, the competition legislation continued to operate alongside the regime of
‘tariff in exchange for investment’. Accordingly, even if the Tribunal were to hold
that the 2009 Tariff Amendment and the 2012 Electricity Law were in breach of
Respondent’s international obligations, the AES Entities would still have been
subject to price regulation under the competition legislation as at all times they
were, and remain, on the Register.

In addition, even if the Tribunal were to hold that Claimants did have an entitlement to
charge ‘competitive market prices’, the ‘but for’ prices put forward by Claimants do not, in
truth, constitute ‘competitive prices’. With regard to the period from 2009 to 2015,
Claimants use the Maximum Capped Tariff for Group 1 (in which Ekibastuz is placed) as a
proxy. However, this approach is entirely misconceived. Those tariffs are not ‘competitive
market prices’, but regulated prices. Further, they are deliberately set at a level higher than
competitive levels in order to incentivize investment by passing the cost thereof on to
consumers. It is not appropriate to use the tariffs as a measure of competitive prices
without any accompanying obligation to invest. The ‘competitive market prices’ would in

fact be closely linked to costs since, as highlighted by Professor Yarrow and Dr Decker, “in
effectively competitive markets there are pressures towards pricing that reflects efficient
cost of supply, including a normal return on investment”. 316

453. Finally, any damage calculation would need to take into account the fact that the AES
Entities charged and benefited from the Maximum Capped Tariffs between 2009 and 2011
despite not having IOAs in place, and further, despite not investing all net revenues, plus
depreciation, generated under the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ programme. Rather,
the AES Entities paid out significant sums in dividends to the Claimants. To the extent that
the AES Entities in fact charged the Maximum Capped Tariffs and received sums in excess
of those they would have been able to charge through regulated tariffs under the
competition legislation, those sums fall to be returned to Respondent and must be deducted
from any damages awarded to Claimants.*!”

454. As concerns the hypothetical scenario submitted by the Arbitral Tribunal in case “the
Arbitral Tribunal were to decide that the 2009/2012 Electricity Law violated Claimants’
rights, but that the capping of prices based on the Competition Law did not violate such
rights”, Respondent submits that Claimants have failed to answer the Tribunal’s question.
Claimants’ Scenario A bears no resemblance to the question actually posed and the second
fails to address what the returns under the regulated tariffs would have been.*!*

2.2 The Arbitral Tribunal’s Assessment

455. The Arbitral Tribunal is of the opinion that it is necessary and appropriate to distinguish
claims relating to past losses, including the period from 1 January 2009 up to the date of
this Award, and claims related to future losses, including the period from the date of this
Award up to 31 December 2015.

(i) For the Period from 1 January 2009 until the date of the Present Award

456. To the extent that the Arbitral Tribunal has already found that the ‘tariff in exchange for
investment’ scheme as implemented under the 2009 Tariff Amendment and the 2012
Electricity Law is in breach of the FET standard under Article 10(1) of the ECT and Article
II(2)(a) of the BIT, Respondent is liable for the damage caused to Claimants.

457. The question therefore arises what is the appropriate remedy, if any, that Claimants
should be awarded.

458. According to Claimants, to the extent the Tribunal finds that Kazakhstan has breached
the BIT or ECT, Kazakhstan’s international responsibility has been engaged under the BIT
and the ECT. However, since neither the ECT nor the BIT offer guidance as to the
appropriate measure of damages or compensation in relation to breaches of those treaties,
other than, with respect to expropriation, the Arbitral Tribunal should rely on the ILC

rticles.”

gives rise to an obligation to make “full reparation for the injury caused by the
internationally wrongful act”, and this includes under Article 34 three forms of reparation:
(i) restitution, (ii) compensation and (iii) satisfaction. In the present case, Claimants only
request restitution and compensation:

on a faulty quantification of harm”:

Restitution: According to Claimants, Kazakhstan is obliged to effect full restitution
by ceasing and withdrawing all wrongful measures carried out or adopted since 23
July 1997.

- With regard to the past, an order of restitution should be made requiring the
withdrawal of the offending measures, though such order would necessarily
need to be accompanied by an award of compensation so as to make the
Claimants whole for the actual losses they have suffered in the past.

- With regard to the future, restitution is without doubt a suitable remedy and it
means that Kazakhstan should be ordered to cease its continuing breaches of
the BIT and ECT. The Tribunal could actually give Kazakhstan the option of
either (i) paying full compensation for future losses in a liquidated amount;
or (ii) ceasing to apply the offending measures to the Claimants and the AES
Entities on a going forward basis.

Compensation: To the extent that the Tribunal finds that restitution is either
impossible or would not wipe out all the harm suffered as a result of Kazakhstan’s
measures, Kazakhstan must pay compensation to the Claimants for the financial
losses they have suffered. In this case, Kazakhstan must compensate the Claimants
for both past economic losses and future economic losses caused by its breaches. It
is not in dispute that Claimants would be entitled to compensation for their losses if
the Tribunal were to find liability. What is in dispute is the amount of compensation
due to Claimants.

According to Respondent, “there is no valid claim in restitution and when the claim in

Restitution should not be ordered, because Claimants’ claim for restitution is
essentially that Kazakhstan should be required to modify its legislation so as to
exempt Claimants from the application of prevailing legislation relating to pricing
and the regulation of competition or should fail to properly apply and enforce its
own laws. Such a request for relief is impermissible. In particular, Part Two of the
ILC Articles do not apply to investment treaty arbitration between a company and a
state. In addition, the basic condition that restitution be both possible and
proportionate is not met in the present case. Thus, Claimants should be restricted to
claim for compensation.*”!

Claimants’ approach to compensation is fundamentally flawed, to the extent that
Claimants’ claims are based on various legal bases, without however differentiating
in any way between the various different instruments under which the claims are

made and without attempting in any way to differentiate between the different
breaches alleged. Not all the alleged breaches of the 1994 FIL, BIT and ECT, even
if established, could have caused all of the losses which Claimants allege that they
have suffered.

461. In addition, Respondent stresses that the principle of full reparation is not a one-way
street. Insofar as the requirement for full reparation requires that the injured party should
be placed in the position it would have been in “but for” the breach, it is necessary that all
the consequences of the wrongful act should be removed. That applies equally to matters
which were in fact beneficial to the party affected by the breach. This applies to both an
order for restitution and an award of compensation.*”*

462. The Arbitral Tribunal is of the following opinion:

463. It is a general principle of law that whoever causes damage as a result of a wrongful act
should be liable for such damage. This principle applies to all legal subjects including
States and private actors.

464. |The question is thus whether this liability is limited to a duty to compensate, or whether
it also includes a duty of ‘restitution’, i.e., to recreate the situation in place before the
wrongful act.

465. It is undisputed between the Parties that liability for a wrongful act includes a duty to
compensate for the damage caused by such act. The Arbitral Tribunal further considers
that such liability includes the duty to cease any ongoing wrongful act.

466. As to the question whether this liability also includes a duty of ‘restitution’, it can
remain open to the extent that, even if available, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that
restitution would not be feasible in the circumstances of the present case for the following
main reason: In the present case ‘restitution’ would mean to undo investments which have
been already been made in application of the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ scheme,
which would neither be feasible nor helpful. As such, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that
the only options are compensation and cessation of any ongoing wrongful act.

467. In any event, in order to succeed with their claim for compensation, Claimants must
establish the scope of damage that they suffered. As set out above (see paras. 449-450),
Claimants have calculated their damage based on the difference between a ‘but for’ price,
which would have been the price which they assert the AES Entities could have charged if
Kazakhstan had not engaged in the conduct that Claimants say breached Kazakhstan’s
international obligations, and the ‘actual price’, corresponding to the price that the AES
Entities actually charged. At all times, the ‘but for’ price relied upon by Claimants is what
they considered would have been the ‘competitive market price’. The problem with this
approach is that it is based on the assumption that Claimants should not have been subject
to the restrictions imposed by changes made to the Kazakh competition law. In other
words, the ‘but for’ price relied upon by Claimants is only realistic to the extent that their
Original Claims are founded.

~ RSP PHB on Quantum 05.04.2013, paras. 29 fol., 34.

468. Given that the Arbitral Tribunal ruled that Claimants’ Original Claims are unfounded,
the entire basis for Claimants’ damage calculation falls. This applies not only to the ‘but
for’ price relied upon by Claimants, but also to the basis for their claim for ‘incremental
costs’ relating to fines and penalties imposed in application of Kazakh competition law.

469. The Arbitral Tribunal therefore considers that Claimants have failed to duly establish
their damage. The Arbitral Tribunal also considers that Claimants were given sufficient
opportunity to do so and that it would not be appropriate to further prolong these
proceedings by giving them yet another additional opportunity. Even when asked by the
Arbitral Tribunal how Claimants would approach the issue of the damage in case “the
Arbitral Tribunal were to decide that the 2009/2012 Electricity Law violated Claimants’
rights, but that the capping of prices based on the Competition Law did not violate such
rights”, Claimants did not re-calculate their damage based on the assumption that the price
restrictions imposed by Kazakh competition law were in line with Kazakhstan’s treaty
obligations. Even after Respondent raised this issue in its Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum
of 5 April 2013, Claimants did not provide an alternative ‘but for’ price in their Reply Post-
Hearing Submission on the Tribunal’s Question of 23 April 2013. Claimants must therefore
bear the risks of having based their claims on a single assumption.

(ii) For the Period from the Date of the Present Award until 31 December 2015

470. With regard to the period following the issuance of the present Award, it cannot be said
that Claimants have already suffered any damage. Damage may occur only to the extent
that Kazakhstan would fail to remedy the breach of the FET standard and continue
applying the 2012 Electricity Law as before. However, it cannot be presumed that such a
future breach will occur: on the contrary, the Arbitral Tribunal expects that Kazakhstan will
take the necessary measures to bring the position into conformity with its obligations under
the FET standard, as identified in this Award.

471. Claimants may not at this stage claim for damage which has not yet occurred and which
is based on an assumption that Kazakhstan will disregard the present ruling and perpetuate
its breach of the FET standard. In case Kazakhstan fails to remedy the current breach and
thereby causes actual damage to Claimants, Claimants would be free to raise a new claim.

472. As to Claimants’ claim for restitution, it is equally inappropriate. Restitution aims at
reinstating a situation which has previously been modified due to a wrongful act. In the
present situation, as concerns the period from the issuance of this Award until 31 December
2015, the wrongful act — which consists in the imposition on the AES Entities of
restrictions which are in breach of the FET standard - has not yet been implemented. There
can be no ‘restitution’ with regard to a situation which has not yet occurred.

473. The situation may have been different in case Claimants were claiming for an
expropriation, in which future damages may have been taken into account at their ‘net
present value’ as part of the process of determining the present value of the property
expropriated, or in which restitution in the sense of an undoing of the expropriation may
have been conceivable. However, this is not Claimants’ claim. Claimants are claiming that
the application of current legislation, which is in breach of Kazakhstan’s treaty obligation,
unduly prevents them from earning and using returns they would otherwise be able to earn
and use. Thus, only the continued application of such legislation causing actual damage
would justify the raising of a specific claim for compensation.

146

474. For this reason, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that Claimants’ claims for compensation
of damages for the period following the issuance of the present Award until 31 December
2013 are at this stage unfounded.

3. With Regard to Claims relating to the ‘Tariff in Exchange for Investment’ Scheme
for the Period after I January 2016

475. The Arbitral Tribunal has already found that Claimants’ claims for breach of treaty
standards relating to the post-2016 regime are premature and at this stage unfounded (see
above para. 443).

476. Consequently, Claimants’ claims for restitution and/or compensation based on such
claims are equally unfounded and are to be rejected.

4. Fifth Conclusion

477. Claimants’ claim for full restitution by re-establishing Claimants into the situation
which existed prior to Kazakhstan’s breaches of the FIL, ECT and BIT is rejected
(CL-2).

478. Claimants’ claim for compensation of all losses suffered as a result of
Kazakhstan’s breaches of the FIL, ECT and BIT, including moral damages

@ is rejected to the extent that it relates to Claimants’ Original Claims with
regard to Kazakh competition law and as relating to the period until 31
December 2008;

(ii) is rejected to the extent that it relates to Claimants’ Additional Claim with
regard to the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ scheme as implemented
under the 2009 Tariff Amendment and 2012 Electricity Law as relating to
the period from 1 January 2009 to the date of the present Award;

(iii) is deemed premature and therefore unfounded to the extent that it relates
to Claimants’ Additional Claim with regard to the ‘tariff in exchange for
investment’ scheme as implemented under the 2009 Tariff Amendment
and 2012 Electricity Law as relating to the period following the date of
this Award. Claimants’ claim for restitution for such period is rejected.

H. Costs

I. The Parties’ Positions

479. The Parties submitted their Submissions on Costs on 17 May 2013 simultaneously (see
above para. 123).

480. Claimants submitted a total amount of costs of USD 7,818,086.81, including an amount
of USD 5,320,043.37 for legal fees and USD 1,923,043.44 in various costs and
disbursements (including USD 156,735.55 in disbursements, USD 1,964,337.89 in Expert
fees and expenses), and USD 575,000 for the ICSID advance on costs and lodging fee.

481. Respondent submitted a total amount of costs of USD_10,620,839.96, including
USD 8,145,480.50 in legal fees (composed of USD 6,349,103.11 in legal fees from Reed
Smith LLP, USD 1,504,877.40 in legal fees from other Counsel, and USD 291,500.00 in
legal fees from Kazakhstan’s legal consultants) and USD 1,925,359.36 in costs and
disbursement (including USD 1,091,820.99 in Experts’ fees, USD 661,020.95 in translation
and interpretation fees, USD 110,001.19 in internal disbursements, USD 62,516.32 in
external disbursements) and USD 550,000 for the ICSID advance on costs.

482. With regard to costs, Claimants filed the following request for relief (see above
para. 134):
“ [...] the Claimants request that the Tribunal enter an award in their favour

and against the Republic of Kazakhstan as follows:

L.]

D. — [CL-5] pay the Claimants the costs of this arbitration, including all
expenses that the Claimants have incurred or will incur in respect of
the fees and expenses of the arbitrators, ICSID, the Secretary of the
Tribunal, legal counsel, experts and consultants;

[el’”

483. Respondent filed the following request for relief (see above para. 137):
“ —_[...] Respondent respectfully requests the Tribunal to adjudge and declare in
its Award or Awards in the present proceedings that:

f [RSP-8] the Claimants shall pay Kazakhstan’s costs and expenses incurred
in relation to the present proceedings, including any payments by way of
advance that Kazakhstan has made or will make on account of the costs and
expenses of the Tribunal, the Secretary to the Tribunal and/or ICSID.

484. In addition, it its Submission on Costs, Respondent concluded as follows: “In the event
of a finding of no breach on the part of the Respondent, the Respondent submits that it
should be entitled to its Party Costs and its share of the Costs of the Arbitration. For the
reasons outlined above, in the event of a finding of some breach on the part of the
Respondent, the Respondent submits that it should nevertheless be entitled to the costs it
has incurred in relation to the claims and arguments put forward by the Claimants which

148

have been unsuccessful, as well as the corresponding proportion of the Costs of the
Arbitration” 4

485. The fees and expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID’s administrative fees and expenses
(the costs of the proceeding) are the following:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

USD

Prof. Pierre Tercier 370,259.63
Prof. Vaughan Lowe QC 99,172.11
Dr. Klaus Sachs 201,633.36
Dr. Clarisse von Wunschheim 38,046.12
ICSID’s administrative fees and expenses, including 145,998.01
hearing costs (estimated)

Total 855,109.23

 

 

 

 

486. The Tribunal’s fees and expenses as well as ICSID’s administrative fees and expenses
are paid out of the advances made by the Parties.*”° As a result, each Party’s share of the
costs of the proceeding amounts to USD 427,554.61.

2. The Arbitral Tribunal’s Assessment

487. Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:

“(2) In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the
parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in
connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those
expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the
charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision
shall form part of the award.”

 

488. This provision gives the Arbitral Tribunal the discretion to allocate the costs of the
proceedings among the parties as it considers appropriate, whereby it is common practice
to differentiate between parties’ costs, including legal fees and disbursement, and the costs
of the arbitration, including the arbitrators’ fees and the administrative fees of ICSID.

489. In the circumstances of this case, the Arbitral Tribunal considers the following factors
to be relevant for the allocation of the overall costs relating to the arbitration:

(i) Claimants’ claims were composed of two main bulks of claims, one relating to the
effects on Claimants of Kazakh competition law and one relating to the effects on
Claimants of the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ scheme. The first bulk of

The ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a detailed financial statement of the case account as soon as all
invoices are received and the account is final

as follows:

claims however represented the core of Claimants’ claims and Claimants’ claims in
this regard have failed. The Arbitral Tribunal nevertheless admitted a breach of the
FET standard with regard to the second bulk of claims.

Since Claimants did not provide individualized damage assessments for each of
their claims and based their entire damage calculation on an assumption that the
Arbitral Tribunal considered as inapposite, it is not possible to measure the specific
proportion of claims which the Arbitral Tribunal considered as founded.

Although Claimants have failed on the majority of their claims, those claims were
in no regard frivolous or otherwise a lost cause. They originated primarily from a
disagreement between the Parties about the relationship between assurances made
by Kazakhstan in the Altai Agreement and other laws, such as the 1994 FIL, and
Kazakhstan’s obligations under the BIT and the ECT. In this regard, the Arbitral
Tribunal considers that Kazakhstan bears part of the responsibility in the escalation
of the dispute into an ICSID arbitration and that it would therefore not be
appropriate to let Claimants bear the entire burden of the costs relating to the
arbitration proceedings.

Consequently, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that it is appropriate to allocate the costs

Each party shall bear its own legal fees and expenses;

The costs of the proceeding shall be borne to 67% by Claimants, i.e. USD
572,923.18, and Respondent shall bear the other 33%, i.e. USD 282,186.04. Thus,
Claimants shall pay to Respondent the amount of USD 145,368.57.

3. Sixth Conclusion

491.

Consequently, the Arbitral Tribunal rules as follows:

The costs of the proceeding are fixed at USD 855,109.23.
Claimants and Respondent shall each bear their own legal fees and expenses.
The costs of the proceeding shall be borne to 67% by Claimants, i.e. USD

572,923.18, and Respondent shall bear the other 33%, i.e. USD 282,186.04.
Thus, Claimants shall pay to Respondent the amount of USD 145,368.57.

Ill. DECISION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL

In consideration of the above, the Arbitral Tribunal finds and decides as follows:

The Arbitral Tribunal considers that it has jurisdiction to hear Claimants’ claims
as submitted in this proceeding and that there is no procedural impediment
preventing the Arbitral Tribunal to hear such claims.

. With regard to Claimants’ request that the Arbitral Tribunal declare that

Kazakhstan has (a) breached Articles 6, 8, 10 and 13 of the FIL, (b) breached
Articles 10 and 14 of the ECT, and (c) breached Articles II and IV of the BIT (CL-
1), the Arbitral Tribunal finds that:

cy)

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

With regard to claims relating to the changes in Kazakh competition
legislation and their application to the AES Entities for the period from
2004 to 31 December 2008, Claimants’ request is rejected;

With regard to claims relating to the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’
policy as implemented by the 2009 Tariff Amendment and 2012 Electricity
Law during the period from 1 January 2009 to the date of this Award, the
restrictions imposed under such scheme as described above in paras. 349-
354 breached the FET standard under Article 10(1) of the ECT and Article
II(2)(a) of the BIT in view of their drastic character and extended duration.
All other requests relating to this same period are rejected for the reasons
set out above in para. 433;

To the extent such request relates to the period after 1 January 2016 it is
premature and therefore unfounded.

All other requests under this heading are rejected.

. With regard to Claimants’ request for various orders, the Arbitral Tribunal finds

as follows:

cy)

(ii)

CL-2: Claimants’ request that Kazakhstan be ordered to provide full
restitution to the Claimants by re-establishing the situation which existed
prior to Kazakhstan’s breaches of the FIL, ECT and BIT is rejected.

CL-3: Claimants’ request that Kazakhstan pay Claimants compensation
for all losses suffered as a result of Kazakhstan’s breaches of the FIL, ECT
and BIT, including moral damages

- is rejected to the extent that it relates to Claimants’ Original Claims
with regard to Kazakh competition law and as relating to the period
until 31 December 2008;

- is rejected to the extent that it relates to Claimants’ Additional
Claim with regard to the ‘tariff in exchange for investment’ scheme
as implemented under the 2009 Tariff Amendment and 2012
Electricity Law as relating to the period from 1 January 2009 to the
date of the present Award;

151

- is deemed premature and therefore unfounded to the extent that it
relates to Claimants’ Additional Claim with regard to the ‘tariff in
exchange for investment’ scheme as implemented under the 2009
Tariff Amendment and 2012 Electricity Law as relating to the
period following the date of this Award. Equally, Claimant's claim
for restitution for such period is rejected.

(iii) | CL-5: Claimants’ request that Kazakhstan be ordered to pay Claimants
pre-award interest is rejected.

(iv) CL-6: Claimants’ request that Kazakhstan be ordered to pay Claimants
post-award interest, compounded monthly at a rate to be determined by the
Tribunal on the amounts awarded until full payment thereof is rejected;

(v) CL-7: Claimants’ request for any such other and further relief that the
Arbitral Tribunal shall deem just and proper is rejected.

4. With regard to each Party’s request that the other Party be ordered to pay the
costs of the arbitration, including all legal fees and expenses, the fees and expenses
of the Members of the Tribunal, and the charges for the use of ICSID’s facilities,
the Arbitral Tribunal orders that:

@ Each Party shall bear its own legal fees and expenses; and

(ii) Claimants shall bear 67% of the costs of the proceeding, ie. USD
572,923.18, and Respondent shall bear the other 33%, i.e. USD 282,186.04.
Thus, Claimants shall pay to Respondent USD 145,368.57.

5. All other requests from either side are rejected.
