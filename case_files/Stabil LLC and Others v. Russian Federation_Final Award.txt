THE PARTIES AND THEIR REPRESENTATIVES

The claimants are Stabil LLC, Rubenor LLC, Rustel LLC, Novel-Estate LLC,
PIl Kirovograd-Nafta LLC, Crimea-Petrol LLC, Pirsan LLC (the “Petrol Station
Owners”), Trade-Trust LLC, ElefteriaLLC (the “Petrol Station Lessees”), VKF
Satek LLC, and Stemv Group LLC (the “Storage Facility Owners”), all companies
incorporated and existing under the laws of Ukraine (hereinafter collectively referred to
as the “Claimants” or the “Petrol Companies”). The Claimants are represented in these
proceedings by: Messrs. John M. Townsend, James H. Boykin and Vitaly Morozov, and
Ms. Eleanor Erney of Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP, 17751 Street NW,
Washington, D.C. 20006, United States of America; and Mr. Leon loannou of Hughes
Hubbard & Reed LLP, 8 rue de Presbourg, 75116 Paris, France.

The respondent is the Russian Federation (“Russia” or the “Respondent,” and together
with the Claimants, the “Parties”). The Respondent has not appointed any agents or

representatives in these proceedings.
OVERVIEW OF THE DISPUTE

The Claimants seek compensation for a series of measures taken by the Respondent
“that disrupted and eventually destroyed [their] Crimean operations,” culminating in the
dispossession and nationalization of their network of 31 petrol stations and associated
assets in Crimea.‘ According to the Claimants, the Respondent's conduct was
motivated by hostility toward Mr. Igor Valerievich Kolomoisky, “a well-known Ukrainian
businessman and the former Governor of the Dnepropetrovsk State Administration in
Ukraine, [who] is one of the Petrol Companies’ beneficial owners.”2 The Claimants
submit that, by its conduct, the Respondent has violated Articles 2, 3, and 5 of the
Agreement between the Government of the Russian Federation and the Cabinet of
Ministers of Ukraine on the Encouragement and Mutual Protection of Investments,
dated 27 November 1998 (the “Treaty” or “BIT”).

Although invited by the Tribunal to do so, the Respondent did not file a Statement of
Defense or otherwise participate in these proceedings. Its only communications in the

context of these proceedings were a letter dated 12 August 2015 from its Ministry of

Statement of Claim, § 1.3.

Justice and a cover letter dated 15 September 2015 from its Ambassador to the
Kingdom of the Netherlands (the “Respondent's Letters”).

In its letter dated 12 August 2015, the Ministry of Justice wrote as follows:

We return you herewith the Notices of Arbitration on the arbitration proceedings
initiated under Article 9 of the [Treaty] before the Permanent Court of Arbitration
by [the Petrol Companies] vs. the Russian Federation [...].

It is manifest that such claims cannot be considered under the [Treaty] mentioned
above and, therefore, the [Treaty] cannot serve as a basis for composing an

arbitral tribunal to settle these claims.

In accordance with paragraph 1 Article 1 of the [Treaty] the term “investment”
means every kind of movable and immovable and intellectual property invested
by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting
Party in accordance with the legislation of the latter Contracting Party. The
property in question which is the matter of the claims is situated in the territory of
the Crimea and Sevastopol, i.e., in the territory that was a part of Ukraine but at
the present time pursuant to the will of people forms an integral part of the

territory of the Russian Federation and cannot be regulated by the [Treaty].

On the basis of the above mentioned the Russian Federation does not recognize
the jurisdiction of an international tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in

settlement of the abovementioned claims.

In his cover letter of 15 September 2015 forwarding the one just quoted, the

Ambassador of the Russian Federation to the Kingdom of the Netherlands stated:

Nothing in the attached letter of the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation
can be interpreted as consent of the Russian Federation to constitution of an
arbitral tribunal, participation in arbitration proceedings, or as procedural actions
taken in the framework of the proceedings, mentioned therein, or as waiver by
the Russian Federation of the jurisdictional immunities in respect of itself and its
property in relation to any judicial or administrative proceedings or procedures,
connected directly or indirectly with these claims, including immunity from court
jurisdiction and immunity from any measures of constraint that can be connected
directly or indirectly with these claims, regardless of the jurisdiction (national or
supranational) under which they are initiated.

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-1 Filed 04/09/22 Page 10 of 133

As noted at paragraph 81 of the Award on Jurisdiction of 26 June 2017 (the “Award on
Jurisdiction”), the Tribunal understood the Respondent’s Letters to constitute an
objection to jurisdiction. The objection to jurisdiction was addressed in the Award on
Jurisdiction. For purposes of this Award, the Tribunal understands the Respondent's

Letters as an objection to the Claimants’ requested relief.
PROCEDURAL HISTORY

The Award on Jurisdiction recounts in detail the procedural history of this arbitration
from its commencement until the date on which that Award was issued. In this Section,
the Tribunal recalls only the key procedural details from the early phase of the

proceedings and describes the developments since June 2017.

INITIAL PHASE

On 3 June 2015, the Claimants submitted a Notice of Arbitration (the “Notice of
Arbitration”), invoking Article 9 of the Treaty and the Arbitration Rules of the United
Nations Commission on International Trade Law 1976 (the “UNCITRAL Rules”).
According to the Claimants, the Notice of Arbitration was served on Russia on
15 June 2015.3 On the same day, PJSC Ukrnafta (“Ukrnafta”), a Ukrainian entity
represented by the same counsel as the Claimants, also filed a notice of arbitration
against Russia under the Treaty (see PCA Case No. 2015-34, PUSC Ukrnafta v. The
Russian Federation (“PCA Case No. 2015-34”)).

In their Notice of Arbitration, the Claimants appointed Mr. Daniel M. Price as the first
arbitrator in this matter pursuant to Article 7(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules.

The Respondent did not appoint an arbitrator within 30 days of the Claimants’
notification of the first arbitrator. Accordingly, on 17 July 2015, the Claimants requested
the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (the “PCA”) to designate
an appointing authority for the appointment of a second arbitrator pursuant to
Article 7(2)(b) of the UNCITRAL Rules.

On 6 August 2015, having sought comments from the Respondent but having received
no reply, the Secretary-General of the PCA designated Dr. Michael Hwang as the
appointing authority in this matter for all purposes under the UNCITRAL Rules.

Letter from the Claimants to the Secretary-General of the PCA, dated 17 July 2015.

20.

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-1 Filed 04/09/22 Page 11 of 133

On 18 September 2015, the PCA received the Respondent's Letters. Their contents
are set out in paragraphs 5 and 6 above.

In a letter of 25 September 2015, on the invitation of Dr. Hwang, the Claimants
provided their comments on the Respondent's Letters, stating that they showed that
the Respondent “does not intend to participate in these proceedings.” Referring to
Articles 7(2) and 28(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Claimants suggested that “nothing
stated in the Respondent's [Letters] should prevent the Appointing Authority from

proceeding with the appointment of a second arbitrator in this case.”

On 28 September 2015, Dr. Hwang appointed Professor Brigitte Stern as the second

arbitrator in these proceedings.

On 7 October 2015, the Tribunal was constituted when the co-arbitrators agreed to the
appointment of Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler as the Presiding Arbitrator
pursuant to Article 7(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules. A tribunal comprised of the same
members was constituted on the same date in PCA Case No. 2015-34. The PCA
informed the Parties of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler’s appointment in both cases on
13 October 2015.

By letter of 3 November 2015, the Tribunal (i) accepted the Claimants’ proposal for the
PCA to act as registry in the present proceedings; (ii) invited the Parties to comment on
draft terms of appointment and a draft procedural order (which included the PCA’s
tasks as fund holder and registry); (iii) proposed dates for a first procedural conference;
and (iv) proposed that Ms. Eva Kalnina be appointed as the Secretary of the Tribunal, a

description of her tasks being set out in that same letter.

On 6 November 2015, the Claimants agreed to the appointment of Ms. Kalnina as the

Secretary of the Tribunal and to the PCA serving as the depository of funds.

On 3 December 2015, the Tribunal held a first procedural telephone conference,
concurrently in this matter and in PCA Case No. 2015-34. Although both Parties were
invited to participate, the Respondent did not take part in the telephone conference.

On 14 December 2015, the Tribunal wrote to His Excellency Mr. Alexander Vasilievich
Shulgin, Ambassador of the Russian Federation to the Netherlands, advising him that,
“failing receipt of other instructions [...], the Tribunal and the Parties will serve all

documents in relation to these proceedings by email on [Mr. Shulgin] as the sole

representative of the Russian Federation in [this matter],” with a copy to the e-mail
address of the Russian Ministry of Justice.

On 16 and 17 December 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Orders Nos. 1 and 2
(“PO1” and “PO2”), in which it fixed Geneva (Switzerland) as the seat of the arbitration,
appointed the PCA as registry, set forth provisions concerning the PCA’s remuneration,
and established a procedural timetable (the “Procedural Timetable”). In PO1, the
Tribunal indicated that, “[i]n light of the commonalities of fact and law involved [...] and
of the identical composition of the Tribunal in [this matter and the related PCA Case
No. 2015-34],” the Tribunal would “seek to structure both proceedings [...] in such a
manner as to minimize duplication and avoid unnecessary costs whenever possible.”*
Accordingly, the Tribunal determined that correspondence and hearings would in
principle be common to both cases, while written submissions as well as the Tribunal’s

awards would remain separate.

JURISDICTIONAL PHASE

On 15 January 2016, the Claimants submitted their Statement of Claim (the “Statement
of Claim”), which included, inter alia, (i) the witness statement of Mr. Uriel Laber, dated
6 January 2016 (the “Laber Statement’); (ii) the expert report on Russian law of
Professor Peter B. Maggs, dated 8 January 2016 (the “First Maggs Report”); and
(iii) the valuation report of Mr. Brent C. Kaczmarek, CFA, dated 15 January 2016 (the
“Kaczmarek Report”). The Claimants included among their exhibits English translations

of the BIT from both its Ukrainian and Russian original versions.

On 16 March 2016, the Claimants submitted a “revised English translation” of the BIT,
noting that the new translation “conform[ed] more closely to Russian treaty practice

than the translation previously submitted.”

On 5 April 2016, the Tribunal invited the Parties to state whether they had any
objection to the PCA occasionally publishing information about the progress of this
arbitration in a press release. The Claimants agreed to such publication on
18 April 2016, while the Respondent did not reply.

The Respondent failed to submit its Statement of Defense by 15 April 2016, the time

limit fixed by the Tribunal in the Procedural Timetable.

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-1 Filed 04/09/22 Page 13 of 133

On 22 April 2016, the Tribunal ordered that the proceedings continue notwithstanding
the Respondent's failure to communicate its Statement of Defense pursuant to
Article 28(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules and informed the Parties that, accordingly,

Scenario 2 of the Procedural Timetable would apply.

As foreseen in Scenario 2 of the Procedural Timetable, by letter dated 22 April 2016,
the Tribunal posed questions to the Parties with respect to issues of jurisdiction. In the
same letter, the Tribunal also (i) invited the Parties to state whether they had any
objection to a counsel from the PCA assisting the Tribunal Secretary in her tasks as
outlined in the Tribunal’s letter of 3 November 2015, and (ii) asked the Parties to
provide their comments on a draft press release prepared by the PCA concerning
certain procedural steps in the present proceedings. On 1 May 2016, the Claimants
confirmed that they had no objection to the PCA providing assistance to the Tribunal
Secretary and provided their comments on the press release. The Respondent
submitted no comments.

On 2 May 2016, the PCA issued a press release in the present proceedings, which was
published on its website.

On 23 May 2016, having sought the Parties’ comments on the possible appointment
and choice of, as well as instructions to be given to, a translator, the Tribunal appointed
Mr. Igor Vesler, a translator, to produce a new English translation of the BIT from its
Russian and Ukrainian original versions. Copies of the translation produced by
Mr. Vesler were subsequently communicated to the Parties for their comments.

On 3 June 2016, the Claimants submitted their answers to the Tribunal’s questions on
jurisdiction. The Respondent filed no responses to the Tribunal’s questions.

On 8 June 2016, the Tribunal, the Claimants, and the claimant in PCA Case No. 2015-
34 held an organizational pre-hearing telephone conference. Although the Respondent
was invited to participate in the conference, it did not do so. Following the conference,
the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 on 13 June 2016.

On 17 June 2016, the Claimants submitted their comments on Mr. Vesler’s translation

of the BIT. The Respondent did not submit comments.

On 21 June 2016, having consulted the Parties, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order
No. 4, admitting into the record of these proceedings a submission of Ukraine as non-
disputing party to the Treaty and granting the Parties until 28 June 2016 to submit

comments on Ukraine’s submission. The Claimants provided their comments within this
time. The Respondent remained silent.

On 1 July 2016, having consulted the Parties, the Tribunal denied an application from
Ukraine to attend and make oral submissions at the hearing on jurisdiction.

The hearing on jurisdiction was held on 11 July 2016 in Geneva, concurrently in this
matter and in PCA Case No. 2015-34. The Respondent was invited to participate, but
did not do so.

On 18 July 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, in which it provided post-
hearing directions, including questions to be addressed in the Parties’ post-hearing

briefs.

On 4 August 2016, after inviting the Parties’ comments on a draft, the PCA issued a

second press release regarding the present proceedings.

On 26 August 2016, the Claimants submitted their post-hearing brief on jurisdiction.

The Respondent did not submit a post-hearing brief.

In March 2017, with the permission of the Tribunal, the Claimants submitted into the
record of these proceedings the jurisdictional awards issued in February and March
2017 in (i) PCA Case No. 2015-07, Aeroport Belbek LLC and Mr. Igor Valerievich
Kolomoisky v. The Russian Federation; (ii) PCA Case No. 2015-21, JSC CB
PrivatBank and Finance Company Finilon LLC v. The Russian Federation; and
(iii) PCA Case No. 2015-36, Everest Estate LLC et al. v. The Russian Federation

(‘Everest’).

On 26 June 2017, the Tribunal issued the Award on Jurisdiction, which forms an
integral part of the present Award. In the operative part, the Tribunal declared and

decided as follows:

(i) The Tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute submitted to it in this arbitration;

(ii) The Tribunal will take the necessary steps for the continuation of the proceedings

toward the liability phase;

(iii) The Tribunal reserves the decision on the costs of the jurisdictional phase for a
later stage of the proceedings.

In concluding that it had jurisdiction over the present dispute, the Tribunal held that “the
dispute falls within the territorial and temporal scope of application of the Treaty and
that the Claimants qualify as ‘investors’ under the Treaty, having made an ‘investment’

in the territory of Russia in accordance with its legislation.”>

The tribunal in PCA Case No. 2015-34, comprised of the same members as the

Tribunal in this case, also rendered an award on jurisdiction on 26 June 2017.

On 4 July 2017, after inviting the Parties’ comments on a draft, the PCA issued a third

press release regarding these proceedings.

On 14 August 2017, the Russian Federation filed an action for annulment of the Award
on Jurisdiction before the Swiss Supreme Court or Federal Tribunal, which is the court
with jurisdiction to rule on awards issued in international arbitrations seated in
Switzerland. In addition to the annulment, the Respondent requested the Federal
Tribunal to stay the arbitration pending the annulment proceedings. This request was
withdrawn on 5 January 2017 and the arbitration was continued while the Federal
Tribunal considered the annulment action.

Having received two rounds of written submissions and issued various orders on the
conduct of the proceedings, including an order denying a request for security for costs,
in a public deliberation held on 16 October 2018, the Swiss Supreme Court denied the
request for annulment, holding that the arbitral tribunal had correctly interpreted the
Treaty and declared itself to have jurisdiction over this dispute.

MERITS AND QUANTUM PHASE

On 9 August 2017, having sought the views of the Parties and circulated a draft for
their comments, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 (“PO6”), establishing a

procedural calendar for the merits phase of the proceedings.

On 21 September 2017, in accordance with the timetable established in PO6, the
Tribunal posed questions on merits issues to the Parties.

On 20 November 2017, the Claimants submitted their responses to the Tribunal’s
questions on merits issues (the “Claimants’ Answers on Merits”). The Respondent did

not submit any responses.

On 7 December 2017, the Tribunal, the Claimants, and the claimant in PCA Case
No. 2015-34 held a pre-hearing telephone conference to discuss issues pertaining to
the organization of the hearing on the merits scheduled to take place from 5-6 February
2018 in Geneva, concurrently in this matter and PCA Case No. 2015-34 (the “Hearing
on the Merits”). Although the Respondent was invited to participate in the conference, it

did not do so.

On 8 December 2017, the Tribunal circulated an audio-recording of the teleconference
to the Parties and issued Procedural Order No. 7, deciding the outstanding issues
pertaining to the organization of the Hearing on the Merits.

The Hearing on the Merits took place from 5-6 February 2018 in Geneva as scheduled.
The Respondent was invited to participate, but did not take part in the Hearing. The

Interpreters:

Mr. Sergei Mikheyev

Mr. Yuri Somov

At the request of the claimant in PCA Case No. 2015-34, one of its representatives,

Ms. Viktoriia Ishchenko, also received a live feed of the hearing transcript in Kyiv.

In the course of the Hearing on the Merits, Mr. Townsend addressed the Tribunal in an
opening statement on behalf of the Claimants and the claimant in PCA Case
No. 2015-34. The Tribunal heard the following fact and expert witnesses presented by
the Claimants: (i) Mr. Uriel Laber, a shareholder and representative of shareholders of
the Claimants, who was responsible for managing all financial and commercial aspects
of the Claimants’ businesses (as well as a minority shareholder and member of the
supervisory board of the claimant in PCA Case No. 2015-34); and (ii) Mr. Brent C.
Kaczmarek, the Claimants’ expert on quantum. The Tribunal put questions to each of

these fact and expert witnesses. It also put questions to the Claimants’ counsel.

As the Hearing on the Merits in these proceedings was held concurrently with the
hearing in PCA Case No. 2015-34, the Tribunal also heard Mr. Vyacheslav Kartashov,
a legal director of Ukrnafta, whose witness statement had been filed in PCA Case
No. 2015-34 only. At the end of the hearing, the Claimants made an application “that
the Tribunal consider that all of the evidence it ha[d] heard [during the Hearing on the

Merits] be considered to have been presented in both cases.”®

The court reporter sent electronic copies of the hearing transcript to the Parties at the

end of each hearing day.

On 7 February 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8, in which it (i) denied
the Claimants’ application that the Tribunal consider that all of the evidence it had
heard during the Hearing on the Merits be considered to have been presented in both
this case and PCA Case No. 2015-34; and (ii) informed the Parties that, in accordance
with Article 27 of the UNCITRAL Rules and Paragraph 6.4 of PO2, it intended to
appoint an expert to prepare a written report responding to specific questions regarding

the quantum of damages.

On 13 February 2018, the Tribunal sent the audio-recording of the Hearing on the
Merits to the Parties.

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-1 Filed 04/09/22 Page 18 of 133

On 19 February 2018, after inviting the Parties’ comments on a draft, the PCA issued a
fourth press release regarding these proceedings.

On 22 February 2018, arbitrator Price made a disclosure regarding the hiring of a trade
policy advisor, Ms. Tuninetti, at a consulting firm of which he is a partner, Rock Creek
Global Advisors LLC (RCGA). Arbitrator Price noted that Ms. Tuninetti had previously
been part of the legal team representing Ukraine in several unrelated matters.
Arbitrator Price also stated that during her employment at RCGA, “she will not be
involved in any capacity, neither administrative nor substantive, in my work as an
arbitrator in the cases captioned above. She will not have access to the files in either
electronic or hard copy form. She will be screened completely.” The PCA transmitted
arbitrator Price’s letter to the Parties on 23 February 2018. Neither side provided any

comments.

On 28 February 2018, having conducted a search for experts with appropriate
qualifications, independence, and availability, the Tribunal sought the Parties’
comments on the prospective appointment of Mr. Thierry Sénéchal as the Tribunal
expert on quantum and his draft terms of reference. It also provided the Parties with

Mr. Sénéchal’s curriculum vitae.

By letter dated 6 March 2018, the Claimants sought a clarification regarding
Mr. Sénéchal’s experience in performing valuations in Russia and Ukraine. On 9 March
2018, following Mr. Sénéchal’s reply to their queries, the Claimants stated that they had
no further comments on the proposal to appoint Mr. Sénéchal as a Tribunal expert. The

Respondent submitted no comments.

On 17 March 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9 (“PO9”), setting forth
Mr. Sénéchal’s terms of reference. The scope of his task was circumscribed by
11 specific questions addressing various aspects of the Kaczmarek Report. PO9 also
provided for the expert procedure as follows: (i) the expert was to submit his draft
report by 30 May 2018; (ii) after reviewing the expert's draft report and possibly asking
for clarifications from the expert, the Tribunal was to afford the Parties a period of
21 days to submit their comments on the expert's draft report as well as to state
whether they wished to examine the expert in person; and (iii) the expert was then to
submit his final report, on which the Parties had an opportunity to make supplemental

comments within 14 days.

On 31 March 2018, after having sought the Parties’ comments, the Tribunal issued

Procedural Order No. 10, establishing a timetable for the Tribunal expert procedure

and in particular providing that, after receiving Mr. Sénéchal’s draft report and the
Parties’ comments thereon, the Tribunal would, if needed, fix a place and time (no later

than 20 August 2018) for a one-day hearing to examine Mr. Sénéchal.

On 28 May 2018, upon the Claimants’ proposal and having sought the Respondent's
comments to no avail, the Tribunal invited the Claimants to submit into the record of
this arbitration the Award on the Merits issued on 2 May 2018 in the Everest case,
which the Claimants did on 29 May 2018.

The Tribunal also invited the Parties to provide it with a copy of the Law of the Republic
of Crimea No. 345-ZRK/2016 entitled “On peculiarities of regulation of particular
property relations in the Republic of Crimea” dated 28 December 2016 (the “Crimean

Property Law’), and invited the Parties’ comments.

On 30 May 2018, Mr. Sénéchal submitted his draft report, which the Tribunal reviewed

as provided in PO9 and communicated to the Parties on 13 June 2018.

On 15 June 2018, the Claimants submitted a copy of the Crimean Property Law and
provided their comments thereon. The Claimants also filed an analogous decree issued
by the Government of the Federal City of Sevastopol (the “Sevastopol Government”),
namely Resolution No. 67 entitled “On approval of the procedure for issuing decisions
on compensation for the value of property declared to be property of the city of
Sevastopol that was previously private property” dated 8 February 2018 (the
“Sevastopol Resolution”). In addition, the Claimants sought to introduce into the record
eight exhibits in support of their comments on the Crimean Property Law. The

Respondent did not submit any comments on the Crimean Property Law.

By letter dated 16 June 2018, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on the

Claimants’ request to file additional exhibits. The Respondent did not reply.

By letter of 2 July 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the Claimants’ request to
introduce additional exhibits into the record was granted with respect to three exhibits
(which were official publications) and denied with respect to four exhibits (which were
news publications). With respect to the eighth exhibit that the Claimants sought to file —
an article published in the newspaper Kommersant on 13 October 2017 — the Tribunal
invited further submissions from the Parties. Specifically, the Tribunal noted the
Claimants’ assertions of 15 June 2018, based on the Kommersant article, that “[t]he
Russian Ministry of Justice was itself reported by the press to have argued before the
Constitutional Court that the Crimean Property Law violates the Russian Constitution,

70.

71.

72.

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-1 Filed 04/09/22 Page 20 of 133

because it contains so many exceptions.” The Tribunal invited the Respondent to
comment on the Claimants’ assertions by 9 July 2018 and to provide, within the same
time limit, a copy of any submissions or comments made by the Russian Ministry of
Justice or any other State organ regarding the Crimean Property Law, indicating that it
would make a decision on admission of the Kommersant article thereafter. The
Respondent submitted no reply. In light of its findings regarding the Crimean Property
Law in this Award (see paragraphs 247-253 below), the Tribunal can dispense with
making any finding based on the Kommersant article. Accordingly, the Claimants’
request to introduce the Kommersant article is hereby denied.

In its letter of 2 July 2018, the Tribunal also informed the Parties that on 18 June 2018,
the PCA had received a Note Verbale from the Embassy of the Russian Federation in

the Kingdom of the Netherlands, stating that:

In accordance with the President's decree No 271 of 28 May 2018 the
Regulations of the Ministry of Justice have been amended. The Ministry is
henceforth entrusted with representation of the Russian Federation and/or
protection of the interests of the Russian Federation in international arbitration
bodies (except for inter-state disputes and disputes involving international
organisations to which the Russian Federation is a party, as well as disputes
arising of contractual obligations of diplomatic representations and consulates of
the Russian Federation), unless otherwise explicitly stipulated in corresponding
decisions of the Governments or decisions of the President of the Russian

Federation.

The responsible structural division of the Ministry of Justice of the Russian
Federation is the Department of International Law and Cooperation (address:
14 Zhitnaya str. Moscow, GSP-1 119991, Russia; fax: +7 (495 677-06087;

e-mail: legalprotection@minjust.ru).

The Tribunal informed the Parties that the address of the Department of International
Law and Cooperation of the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation would be

added to all future correspondence in this matter.

On 3 July 2018, the Claimants submitted their comments on Mr. Sénéchal’s draft
report. They noted that they did not deem it necessary to hear Mr. Sénéchal in person.

The Respondent did not submit comments.

By letter from the PCA dated 13 July 2018, the Tribunal (i) informed the Parties that it
wished to hear Mr. Sénéchal at a hearing; (ii) confirmed that the hearing would take
place on 20 August 2018 in Geneva; (iii) requested that the Claimants make their
expert on quantum, Mr. Kaczmarek, available at the hearing in the event that the
Tribunal had questions for him after hearing Mr. Sénéchal; and (iv) circulated a draft
hearing agenda for the Parties’ comments.

On 16 July 2018, Mr. Sénéchal submitted his final report, which was communicated to

the Parties the following day (the “Sénéchal Report”).

On 20 July 2018, the Claimants submitted their comments on the draft hearing agenda.

The Respondent did not submit comments.

On 26 July 2018, after having consulting the Parties, the Tribunal issued Procedural

Order No. 11, setting forth its hearing directions and agenda.

On 31 July 2018, the Claimants submitted their comments on the Sénéchal Report.

The Respondent did not submit comments.

Court reporter:

Mr. David Kasdan

During the hearing and in accordance with the agenda, the Tribunal first put questions
to Mr. Sénéchal and then to Mr. Kaczmarek. The Claimants were also allowed to put
questions to the experts within the scope of the Tribunal’s examination and of the few
paragraphs in the Sénéchal Report that had not appeared in his draft report. At the end
of the hearing, the Claimants’ counsel made brief closing remarks and the Tribunal
discussed next steps with the two experts and the Claimants.

The court reporter provided electronic copies of the hearing transcript to the Parties at
the end of the hearing.

On 22 August 2018, as requested by the Tribunal at the hearing, the Claimants
submitted into the record a copy of Mr. Kaczmarek’s model for his discounted cash flow

analysis.

On 23 August 2018, also as requested during the hearing, the Claimants submitted

a written response to a question put to them by Professor Stern.
On the same day, the Tribunal sent the audio-recording of the hearing to the Parties.

On 25 August 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 12 (“PO12”), setting
forth the post-hearing directions discussed at the end of the hearing. /nter alia, the
Tribunal requested the Claimants to submit into the record the model for
Mr. Kaczmarek’s comparable companies’ analysis. The Tribunal also expanded
Mr. Sénéchal’s terms of reference, requesting that he (i) review Mr. Kaczmarek’s
models for the discounted cash flow and comparable companies’ analyses for the
accuracy of the calculations and the consistency of the models; and (ii) prepare a
supplementary report containing an alternative valuation of the Claimants’ petrol
stations, remedying any inaccuracies or inconsistencies identified in the models and
adjusting as he deemed appropriate two variables used in Mr. Kaczmarek’s discounted
cash flow analysis. These variables, namely, the projected revenues arising from a
planned renovation program of the petrol stations and the long-term growth rate used
in the calculation of the terminal value, were the ones which Mr. Sénéchal had
identified as inaccurate in his examination. The Tribunal indicated that it would provide
specifications regarding the date of valuation and the benchmark market shortly after
31 August 2018.

On 27 August 2018, the Claimants submitted a copy of Mr. Kaczmarek’s model for his

comparable companies’ analysis into the record.

On 28 August 2018, the Claimants submitted an additional appendix to the Kaczmarek

Report “further particularizing the damages claimed by each Claimant.”

On 12 September 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it had requested

2014 as the valuation date and Russia as the benchmark market.

On 13 October 2018, the Tribunal transmitted Mr. Sénéchal’s supplementary report

(the “Sénéchal Supplementary Report”) to the Parties and invited their comments.

On 23 October 2018, the Claimants submitted comments on the Sénéchal
Supplementary Report (the “Claimants’ Comments on the Sénéchal Supplementary

Report’). The Respondent did not comment.

On 29 October 2018, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit their statements of costs
in accordance with PO12, which the Claimants did by filing their Application for Costs

on 2 November 2018, while the Respondent made no submission.

On 19 February 2019, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would request
Mr. Sénéchal to prepare a further valuation of the Claimants’ Crimean petrol stations

and storage facilities implementing specific assumptions identified by the Tribunal.

On 5 March 2019, the Tribunal transmitted Mr. Sénéchal’s second supplementary
report (the “Sénéchal Second Supplementary Report”) to the Parties and invited their

comments.

The Claimants submitted their comments on 15 March 2019 (the “Claimants’
Comments on the Sénéchal Second Supplementary Report”). The Respondent did not
comment.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal notes that in this Award it uses the terms “Crimea”
and “Crimean Peninsula” interchangeably to refer to the geographical area composed
of the administrative units “Autonomous Republic of Crimea” and “City of Special
Status Sevastopol” identified in the Ukrainian Constitution. The Tribunal uses the latter

two terms or “Republic of Crimea” and “Federal City of Sevastopol” (which are the

terms used under Russian law to refer to the region and city within the Russian
Federation) for descriptive purposes only, without expressing any view about their legal
status.

THE CLAIMANTS AND THEIR INVESTMENTS IN CRIMEA

Together, the eleven Claimants owned, operated, and supplied a chain of 31 petrol
stations in Crimea.’ Of these 31 petrol stations, 17 were located in the Autonomous

Republic of Crimea and 14 were located in the city of Sevastopol.®

The Petrol Station Owners — Stabil LLC, Rubenor LLC, Rustel LLC, Novel-Estate LLC,
Pll Kirovograd-Nafta LLC, Crimea-Petrol LLC, and Pirsan LLC — acquired title to or built
the 31 petrol stations between 2000 and 2010.9 Further, the Petrol Station Owners
either owned or leased the land on which the petrol stations were built. They also
owned other real estate and a fleet of vehicles." Stabil LLC, one of the Petrol Station
Owners, owned an office building in Feodosia, Crimea, which served as the
management headquarters for the Claimants’ petrol stations, as well as for the petrol
stations of Ukrnafta, the claimant in PCA Case No. 2015-34."

From 2010 to 2011, the Petrol Station Lessees, Trade-Trust LLC and Elefteria LLC,
obtained rights to lease and operate the petrol stations and the adjoining convenience
stores from the Petrol Station Owners. 2

The Storage Facility Owners, VKF Satek LLC and Stemv Group LLC, owned two
storage facilities in the cities of Simferopol and Sevastopol, respectively; these were

THE INCORPORATION OF CRIMEA BY THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION

As noted in the Award on Jurisdiction, the dispute before the Tribunal arose in the
context of the incorporation of Crimea into the Russian Federation (the “Incorporation’).
These events have been extensively documented and feature prominently in the
Claimants’ pleadings. The following account, excerpted from media reports contained
in the record, provides an overview of the most relevant events for present purposes.
The Tribunal emphasizes that it is using the term “Incorporation” and_ later
“Incorporation Treaty”, rather than the terms “annexation” or “Annexation Treaty” used
by the Claimants, to make clear that it expresses no view on the legality of the inclusion
of Crimea into the Russian Federation, because it need not resolve that issue in order

to decide the dispute before it.

On 22 February 2014, then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych left Ukraine
following a series of protests in the country against his administration. '® Media outlets
have reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin “ordered work on ‘returning

Crimea” immediately following President Yanukovych’s departure. '”

On 23 February 2014, the leader of the Crimean “Russian Unity Party,” Mr. Sergei
Aksyonov, described the formation of “rapid-response groups” and patrols in
Simferopol to defend “the interests of the Crimeans and Crimean Russians who live in

facto mayor” of Sevastopol on 25 February 2014.9

On 27 February 2014, gunmen “dressed in fatigues” stormed Crimea’s regional
administrative complex in Simferopol, establishing control over the parliament and
ministerial building of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, and raised the Russian flag
above the building.2° These forces also surrounded Ukrainian military bases and
seized control of the Simferopol and Belbek airports. In a special session, the
parliament of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea named Mr. Aksyonov as prime

minister.21

On 28 February 2014, Russian military forces consolidated control over the Crimean
Peninsula. A Russian Black Sea Fleet missile boat blocked the exit to Balaklava Harbor
in Sevastopol to Ukrainian State Border Service ships; a Russian armored personnel
carrier was observed on the streets of Sevastopol;22 and Russian military transport

planes landed outside Simferopol.?°

On 1 March 2014, President Putin submitted an appeal to the Russian Federation
Council, the upper house of Russia’s federal legislature, to “use the armed forces of the
Russian Federation on the territory of Ukraine until the social and political situation in
that country is normalized.”24 The request was granted on the same day.?°

A public referendum took place on 16 March 2014 on the Crimean Peninsula.?° Of the
votes cast, 96% were reportedly in favor of the Incorporation, although numerous
allegations of electoral fraud were received by the Office of the United Nations High

Commissioner for Human Rights.2”

On 18 March 2014, the “Republic of Crimea” and the “City of Special Status
Sevastopol,” the latter of which became known as the “Federal City of Sevastopol”
under Russian law, signed the “Treaty between the Russian Federation and the
Republic of Crimea on the Acceptance of the Republic of Crimea into the Russian
Federation and the Formation of New Constituent Parts within the Russian Federation”
(the “Incorporation Treaty”). 28 The Russian Constitutional Court ruled that the
Incorporation Treaty was “consistent with the Russian Federation Constitution” on
19 March 2014,”° and the Incorporation Treaty was approved by the lower and upper
houses of Russia’s parliament on 20 and 21 March 2014, respectively. °° The

parliament also approved legislation implementing the Incorporation.3*

31 July 2014, the Respondent enacted legislation guaranteeing pre-existing property

rights in Crimea.%4

According to the Claimants, despite initial denials,° President Putin recognized in a
television appearance dated 17 April 2014 that Russian armed forces had been
involved in the seizure of control in Crimea. On that occasion, President Putin made

the following statement:

[O]ur goal was to ensure proper conditions for the people of Crimea to be able to
freely express their will. And so we had to take the necessary measures in order
to prevent the situation in Crimea unfolding the way it is now unfolding in
southeastern Ukraine. We didn’t want any tanks, any nationalist combat units or
people with extreme views armed with automatic weapons. Of course, the
Russian servicemen did back the Crimean self-defence forces. They acted ina

civil but a decisive and professional manner, as I’ve already said.

Russia did not annex Crimea by force. Russia created conditions — with the help
of special armed groups and the Armed Forces, | will say it straight — but only for
the free expression of the will of the people living in Crimea and Sevastopol. It
was the people themselves who made this decision. Russia answered their call
and welcomed the decision of Crimea and Sevastopol. This was natural, and it

could not have been any other way.°¢

Ukraine, as stated in its non-disputing party submission, considers that Crimea remains
an “inseparable part of Ukraine” and that the events described above constitute an

unlawful occupation.°”

THE FACTS RELATING TO THE CLAIMANTS’ INVESTMENTS,

During his television appearance on 17 April 2014 mentioned above, President Putin
also discussed the Crimean economy and banking system. In this context, when
responding to the question of a Crimean resident as to whether he needed to make his
lease payments for a car leased from PJSC Privatbank, a Ukrainian bank in which
Mr. Kolomoisky had a significant shareholding, President Putin made the following

statement:

[President Putin reads out the question] Here is an interesting question about the
Crimean economy and banking system. The first part of the question concerns
certain difficulties, including economic issues. The second part is as follows: “I
hired a car on lease from Privatbank. It will take me only two years to repay the
loan. The car officially belongs to AvtoprivatGroup in Kiev. Privatbank no longer

operates in Crimea. What am | supposed to do?”

[President Putin answers the question] Please use the car and don’t worry. If

Mr. Kolomoisky [...] dofesn’t] want your money, it’s [his] problem.**

In an earlier televised appearance on 4 March 2014, President Putin had also called
Mr. Kolomoisky, who had just been appointed Governor of the Eastern Ukrainian
region of Dnipropetrovsk, a “scoundrel” and an “imposter”.2° The Claimants argue that
these statements by President Putin foreshadowed the eventual expropriation of their

investments.*°

In this regard, the Claimants assert that their Feodosia office and Crimean petrol
stations were seized by members of the Crimean “self-defence” or “paramilitary” forces
(the “Paramilitary Forces”) between 22 and 25 April 2014.4" An account of those events

is provided by the Claimants’ witness Mr. Uriel Laber, a minority shareholder and

“drive without any worry.” Claimants’ Opening Presentation of 5 February 2018, Slide 6;

representative of the Claimants’ shareholders, who was responsible for managing all

financial and commercial aspects of their businesses.42

In his witness statement, Mr. Laber recalls that, on the morning of 23 April 2014, he

learned of the seizure of the Feodosia office, which had occurred the previous day:

| was awoken by an early call at my home in Miami from Mr. Yuriy Topchiy, one

of our executive managers in continental Ukraine who reports directly to me.

Because he usually waited until | was in the office to call me, | immediately

suspected some emergency and went to the office to take Mr. Topchiy’s call from

there.

After arriving at my office in Miami, | called Mr. Topchiy in Dnepropetrovsk,

Ukraine. He described to me the following events that had transpired earlier [in

the day before“’]:

Mr. Karyagin, a director of Stabil LLC (the company that owned the Petrol
Companies’ headquarters in the City of Feodosia), was supposed to travel
from Crimea to Dnepropetrovsk (in continental Ukraine), but the Paramilitary

Forces prevented Mr. Karyagin from leaving Crimea.

By 10:00 a.m. (Ukraine time), we could no longer reach the office in Feodosia
by telephone. At 10:30 a.m., an employee in the Feodosia office managed to
reach Mr. Topchiy and told him that the office had been seized by
approximately 20 gunmen. Before she could provide any additional details, the

phone line went dead.

At about 2:30 p.m. (Ukraine time), Mr. Topchiy received another call from the
Feodosia office. The caller said that he had only 15 seconds to talk, and that
the Feodosia office had been seized. The connection was then cut. Fearing
for our employees’ safety, Mr. Topchiy repeatedly tried to call them throughout

the day, but he could not get through.**

Mr. Laber further recounts that, according to Mr. Topchiy, the armed men who took
control of the Feodosia office had arrived in “official-looking vehicles”, 4° had
confiscated mobile phones, and had abducted from the office premises a director of
Elefteria LLC and three other managers, telling them they had to choose between the

“old” and the “new” management.*®

At the Hearing on the Merits, Mr. Laber explained that when they were released and
returned home approximately one week later, these employees “told us the story,
[namely that they were] taken there [to the cemetery], and told, hey, listen, either you
continue the work that you’ve done on the ground, continue selling the fuel products,
which is — there’s going to be your old management, your old owners are now null and
void, and we’re the new guys in charge, and everything will be fine. If you don't listen,

this is where you are going to end up [the cemetery].”4”

The office employees later reported that the office had been “looted” of computers,
permits and licenses, commercial documentation, and the equivalent of US$ 800,000 in
cash. In his witness statement, Mr. Laber explains that while this “was an unusually
large amount of cash to have at our headquarters, [...] the Russian invasion affected
the banking system, and the Petrol Station Lessees were unable to deposit cash as
they usually would. For this reason, we started storing cash at the Feodosia
headquarters.”48

Mr. Laber states that, following the seizure of the Feodosia office on 22 April 2014, the
Claimants’ employees were never again able to access the building as the Paramilitary
Forces continued to occupy it.4? The Claimants thus lost managerial control of their

petrol stations, which were managed from the Feodosia office.°°

According to Mr. Laber, by 25 April 2014, the Claimants also lost physical control of

their Crimean petrol stations:

By 25 April 2014, numerous sources on the ground in Crimea reported to us that
individuals — either the Paramilitary Forces or individuals affiliated with them —
were illegally selling the Petrol Stations’ remaining inventory of fuel and other
products at substantially lower prices than the prices set by the Petrol
Companies. These individuals abandoned the Petrol Stations around June 2014,
probably because there was no remaining inventory to be sold. The Petrol
Companies received none of the revenues from this illegal sale of their fuel and
other goods since 22 April 2014.5"

raid of their Feodosia office, “the police — who were controlled by the new Russian-
installed ‘authorities’ - took no meaningful action to remedy the situation.”52 He also
explained that the Claimants did not file an official complaint with the local authorities,
as they had decided to first see what would happen to the complaints filed by Ukrnafta,
the claimant in PCA Case No. 2015-34.5°

In addition to Mr. Laber’s account of the events of 22-25 April 2014, the Claimants have
submitted into the record an article published on 4 June 2014 in Sobytia Cryma
(Crimean Events). They rely on the article in respect of certain events of 23 April

2014, which it describes as follows:

That very evening [of 22 April 2014], Sergey Ryabichenko [identified in the article
as the director of Elefteria LLC] telephoned all the employees and told them to
come to a meeting at the office in the morning.

On the morning of April 23, Ryabichenko arrived at the office accompanied by
two persons — the man who had been in command of the “self-defense” forces on
the day of the raid, and a young woman. The woman introduced herself as Yulia,
an attorney, and announced that she was “representing the interests” of the self-
proclaimed prime minister of Crimea, Sergey Aks[yo]nov. She offered the
employees of the office a choice: either continue working for the “new owner,” or

leave Crimea immediately. As a result of the conversation, the Crimean

employees of Ukrnafta voluntarily-compulsorily agreed to live and work under the

new system.®>

Eight days after the raid, on 30 April 2014, the State Council of the Republic of Crimea
(the “Crimean State Council”) adopted a decree (the “Nationalization Decree”), which
was later expanded to nationalize the Claimants’ assets (see paragraph 125 below). In

its initial form, the Nationalization Decree provided, inter alia, that by:

no later than January 1, 2015, all state property (of the State of Ukraine) and all
abandoned property located in the Republic of Crimea shall be considered the

property of the Republic of Crimea.5*

On 18 June 2014, the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation, the principal
federal investigative organ in Russia, opened a criminal investigation against
Mr. Kolomoisky for allegedly funding and cooperating in the “organiz[ation of] a military
operation for the purpose of killing civilians” in Eastern Ukraine.’ The Basmanny
District Court in Moscow ordered Mr. Kolomoisky’s arrest on 2 July 2014.58

On 18 August and 1 September 2014, the Kievskiy District Court in the City of
Simferopol (the “Simferopol District Court”) granted two requests submitted by the
Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Crimea to attach properties owned by
companies believed to be affiliated with Mr. Kolomoisky, including several petrol
stations owned by the Claimants. °° As explained by the Court, its decision was
motivated by the alleged failure of PUSC Privatbank, a Ukrainian bank “owned by”
Mr. Kolomoisky, to perform its obligations under bank deposit contracts with Crimean

depositors.

The Nationalization Decree was amended on 3 September 2014 to include, among

other assets, (i) Stabil LLC’s office in Feodosia; (ii) the Claimants’ petrol stations

In announcing these amendments, Mr. Aksyonov, Chairman of the new Council of
Ministers of the Republic of Crimea, declared that “Kolomoisky is one of the oligarchs
who initiated and has been financing military operations in the southeast of Ukraine
where our compatriots are being killed; therefore it is our moral right and our moral duty

to carry out this nationalization.”®2

Their principal case is that their investments in Crimea have been nationalized in
breach of Article 5 of the Treaty. In this connection, the Claimants argue that, as of
April 2014, Crimea’s Paramilitary Forces “seized and looted” the Feodosia office
building and began to operate the Claimants’ petrol stations. 7° The Claimants
additionally recall that the Crimean authorities nationalized their properties (including
their petrol stations, storage facilities, and other real estate) located in the Republic of
Crimea on 3 September 2014 and in the Federal City of Sevastopol on 11 November
2014.71 In the Claimants’ view, all of these measures are attributable to the Russian
Federation and qualify as a nationalization within the meaning of Article 5 of the Treaty.
The Claimants submit that the nationalization was unlawful as it did not satisfy any of

the conditions of legality set forth in the Treaty.’2

In particular, the Claimants assert that the measures of which they complain were
taken in a discriminatory manner and without a public purpose. These measures
resulted from the Claimants’ affiliation with Mr. Kolomoisky, one of their beneficial
owners, as well as a former governor of Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region and a staunch
opponent of the Incorporation.’ In the Claimants’ view, Mr. Kolomoisky’s assets were
“the target of a campaign by Russian and Russian-controlled authorities in Crimea that
resulted in the taking of all properties in Crimea known or perceived to be associated
with him.”74

In addition, the Claimants submit that the Respondent violated Article 3 of the Treaty.
Article 3(1) requires Contracting Parties to refrain from “measures discriminatory in
nature that could interfere with the management and disposal” of protected investors’
investments. The article also includes a most favored nation (“MFN”) clause that
requires host States to provide protected investors treatment that is “no less favorable

than the treatment given to its own investors or investors of any third state.”

In this connection, the Claimants first assert a claim under a theory of discriminatory
treatment flowing from the first clause of Article 3(1).7° Relying on AES Summit
Generation Ltd. v. Hungary, the Claimants suggest that discrimination is shown where
a State “benefit[s] or harm[s] someone more in comparison with the generality.”’° In the
Claimants’ view, the Respondent “left no doubt” that its actions discriminated against
the Claimants and were motivated by “political animus towards Mr. Kolomoisky.””” The

Claimants submit that such conduct is devoid of an “objective or reasoned basis.””®

Further, the Claimants invoke the MFN clause in Article 3.72 They refer in this
connection to Article 3(1) of the bilateral investment treaty between Canada and the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (the “Canada-USSR BIT”), which guarantees
investors fair and equitable treatment (“FET”) and full protection and security (“FPS”).8°
The Claimants consider the Treaty to incorporate, and the Respondent to have

violated, these guarantees.**

The Claimants also claim a breach of Article 2 of the Treaty, which requires the
Respondent to guarantee “the full and unconditional legal protection of investments by
investors of the other Contracting Party.” According to the Claimants, the Russian
Federation failed to grant such protection when it “targeted” the Claimants based on
their connection with Mr. Kolomoisky, “ultimately destroying” their investments through
physical seizure and nationalization. ®2

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-1 Filed 04/09/22 Page 39 of 133

SUMMARY OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION’S POSITION

The Respondent did not participate in these proceedings despite invitations to do so
from the Tribunal. Nevertheless, the Tribunal considers the Respondent's Letters,
quoted in full in paragraphs 5 and 6 above, to manifest the latter's opposition to the
relief sought by the Claimants.

ANALYSIS

In this Section, the Tribunal will first address a number of preliminary matters (A) and
set out the text of relevant legal provisions (B). It will then address the issues on
attribution (C), liability (D), and reparation (E).

PRELIMINARY MATTERS

Prior to considering the merits of the Parties’ positions, the Tribunal will address the
law governing this arbitration (1); the subject matter of this Award (2); the coordination
of the parallel proceedings (3); the default of the Respondent (4); and the law

applicable to the merits (5).

1. Law Governing the Procedure of this Arbitration

This investment arbitration is seated in Geneva, Switzerland, and is thus governed by
Chapter 12 of the Swiss Private International Law Act.*® It is also governed by any
procedural rules found in the BIT and in the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules.

2. Subject Matter of this Award

The present proceedings were bifurcated between jurisdiction and merits in
accordance with the Procedural Timetable (Scenario 2) in PO2. As mentioned above,
the Tribunal rendered its Award on Jurisdiction on 26 June 2017. This final Award
deals with the merits of the dispute submitted to the Tribunal, as well as with quantum
and costs.

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-1 Filed 04/09/22 Page 40 of 133

3. Coordination of Parallel Proceedings

In accordance with Article 5 of PO1, the present proceedings were conducted in
parallel with PCA Case No. 2015-34, PJSC Ukrnafta (Ukraine) v. The Russian
Federation. In light of the commonalities of fact and law and of the identical
composition of the tribunals in the two cases, the Tribunal sought to structure the
arbitral proceedings in such a manner as to minimize duplication and avoid
unnecessary costs whenever possible. In particular, joint hearings were held for both
matters. However, as provided in PO1, the Tribunal deals with the two cases in
separate Awards.

4. Default of the Respondent

Although it has been advised of all procedural steps in this arbitration and invited to
participate in each of them, the Respondent has not taken part in the proceedings
aside from submitting the Respondent's Letters. After the Respondent failed to submit
a Statement of Defense, the Tribunal ordered the proceedings to continue in
accordance with Article 28(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules.®

As noted in the Award on Jurisdiction,8° under the UNCITRAL Rules and the /ex arbitri,
an arbitration must proceed even if the respondent defaults. This said, unlike in court
litigation in many jurisdictions, there is no “default judgment” in arbitration. In other
words, in spite of the default, a tribunal cannot dispense with satisfying itself regarding
whether or not the claims before it are well founded in fact and in law. This rule applies

to jurisdiction as well as to the merits.

5. Law Governing the Merits

The claims before this Tribunal are brought on the basis of the BIT between Russia
and Ukraine, which, interpreted in accordance with Articles 31 to 33 of the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties (the “VCLT’),®” is the primary source of law for this
Tribunal. In addition, the Tribunal may also look to other rules of international law as

Pursuant to Article 28(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, ‘“[iJf, within the period of time fixed by the
arbitral tribunal, the respondent has failed to communicate his statement of defence without
showing sufficient cause for such failure, the arbitral tribunal shall order that the proceedings
continue.”

Award on Jurisdiction, § 89.

1155 UNTS 331 (1969) (CLA-24). Both Russia and Ukraine are parties to the VCLT since 1986.
Its Articles 31 to 33 also reflect customary international law.

33

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-1 Filed 04/09/22 Page 41 of 133

may be applicable. National law may also be relevant depending on the issues

involved.

150. When applying the governing law, be it international or national, the Tribunal is not
bound by the arguments and sources invoked by the Parties. Under the maxim iura
novit curia — or, better, iura novit arbiter — the Tribunal may apply the law of its own
motion, provided it seeks the Parties’ views if it intends to base its decision on a legal
theory that was not addressed and that the Parties could not reasonably anticipate. ®*

B. RELEVANT PROVISIONS

151.

Turning next to the specific treaties applicable in the present case, in particular the BIT
and the VCLT, the Tribunal notes that the following BIT provisions are relevant to the

merits of the present dispute:®°
e Article 2 of the BIT reads, in relevant part, as follows:
2. Each Contracting Party guarantees, in accordance with its legislation,

the full and unconditional legal protection of investments by investors of
the other Contracting Party.

Article 3 of the BIT states, in relevant, part, as follows:

1. Each Contracting Party shall ensure in its territory for the investments
made by investors of the other Contracting Party, and activities in
connection with such investments, treatment no less favorable than that
which it accords to its own investors or to investors of any third state,
which precludes the use of measures discriminatory in nature that could
interfere with the management and disposal of the investments.

Further, Article 5 of the BIT provides that:

1. Investments made by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory
of the other Contracting Party shall not be expropriated, nationalized or
subject to other measures equivalent in effect to expropriation
(hereinafter referred to as “expropriation”), except in cases where such
measures are taken in the public interest under due process of law, are

(2002), pp. 493, 511 and 4A_214/2013 of 5 August 2013, § 4. See also, inter alia, Vestey Group

Annulment, § 295 (7 January 2015).

82 In general, when quoting the provisions of the Treaty, the Tribunal adopts the language of the
Claimants’ second translation of the Treaty’s Russian original version (CLA-129). For
completeness, the Tribunal also notes that no decision turns on the differences between the
Claimants’ translation in CLA-129 and that of Mr. Vesler, the Tribunal-appointed translator.

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-1 Filed 04/09/22 Page 42 of 133

not discriminatory and are accompanied by prompt, adequate and
effective compensation.

2. The amount of such compensation shall correspond to the market
value of the expropriated investments immediately before the date of
expropriation or before the fact of expropriation became officially known,
while compensation shall be paid without delay, including interest
accruable from the date of expropriation until the date of payment, at the
interest rate for three-month deposits in US dollars on the London
Interbank Market (LIBOR) plus 1%, and shall be effectively disposable
and freely transferable.

152. Furthermore, it is recalled that Article 31 of the VCLT provides the following rules on
treaty interpretation:

(1) A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the
ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their
context and in the light of its object and purpose.

(2) The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall
comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:

a. Any agreement relating to the treaty which was made
between all the parties in connexion with the conclusion of the
treaty;

b. Any instrument which was made by one or more parties in
connexion with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by
the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.

(3) There shall be taken into account, together with the context:

a. Any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the
interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;

b. Any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which
establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its
interpretation;

c. Any relevant rules of international law applicable in the
relations between the parties.

(4) A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the
parties so intended.

e Article 32 of the VCLT adds the following:

Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation,
including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its
conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application
of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation
according to article 31:

(a) Leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or
(b) Leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-1 Filed 04/09/22 Page 43 of 133

153. Additionally, as these are referred to below, it is useful to reproduce here certain
provisions of the United Nations’ International Law Commission’s Articles on

Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (the “ILC Articles”):

e Article 4 provides that:

1. The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that
State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative,
executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the
organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the
central Government or of a territorial unit of the State.

2. An organ includes any person or entity which has that status in
accordance with the internal law of the State.

Further, Article 5 states:

The conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State
under article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to
exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an
act of the State under international law, provided the person or entity is
acting in that capacity in the particular instance.

Article 8 adds:

The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act
of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in
fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of that
State in carrying out the conduct.

Finally, Article 11 provides:

Conduct which is not attributable to a State under the preceding articles
shall nevertheless be considered an act of that State under international
law if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the
conduct in question as its own.

C. ATTRIBUTION
1. The Claimants’ Position

154. As outlined in paragraph 134 above, the Claimants argue that the Russian Federation
has violated the Treaty through the actions, first, of the Crimean State Council and the

Sevastopol Government, and, second, of the Paramilitary Forces. Relying on the ILC

155.

156.

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-1 Filed 04/09/22 Page 44 of 133

Articles, they argue that the acts of each of these entities are attributable to the
Russian Federation.°°

First, the Claimants submit that the Crimean State Council and the Sevastopol
Government are State organs of the Russian Federation within the meaning of ILC
Article 4.91 They argue that the reference in this provision to “any State organ” is “in the
most general sense [...] not limited to organs of the central government [and] extends
to organs of government of whatever kind or classification, exercising whatever
functions, and whatever level in the hierarchy.” 2 In any event, the Claimants
emphasize that in the present case it is undisputed that under Article 2 of the
Incorporation Treaty, the Republic of Crimea and the Federal City of Sevastopol
became “federal subjects” of the Russian Federation.%

Second, as far as the conduct of the Paramilitary Forces is concerned, the Claimants
make a distinction between acts committed before and after 21 March 2014, but note
that they were only affected by the Paramilitary Forces’ acts as of 22 April 2014. In
the Claimants’ view, the Paramilitary Forces’ conduct between the end of February
2014 and 21 March 2014 is attributable to the Russian Federation under ILC
Article 8.°* According to the Claimants, at the time the Paramilitary Forces were
“an armed militia consisting of supporters of the Russian occupation recruited from
among the Crimean population and supported by the Russian military.”°° This was
admitted by President Putin when he stated, in the interview quoted at greater length in
paragraph 109 above, that “Russian servicemen [...] back[ed] the Crimean self-
defense forces.”°° The Claimants further rely on “reputable international sources”

referring to the cooperation between the Russian military and the local self-defense
forces in Crimea.°”

In respect of the acts of the Paramilitary Forces after 21 March 2014, including their
seizure of the Claimants’ properties in April 2014, the Claimants rely on ILC Article 5.%°

They submit that, by 22 April 2014, the Russian-installed civil authorities in Crimea had
empowered the Paramilitary Forces to exercise police powers and therefore to

“exercise elements of governmental authority” within the meaning of Article 5.

The Claimants also recall that, pursuant to ILC Article 7, “[t]he conduct of an organ of a
State or of a person or entity empowered to exercise elements of the governmental
authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law if the organ,
person or entity acts in that capacity, even if it exceeds its authority or contravenes

instructions.”°°

Alternatively, the Claimants proffer ILC Article 11 as a basis for the Tribunal to find that

the Russian Federation is responsible for the acts of the Paramilitary Forces. 1°

2. Analysis
(a) Attribution under international law

The BIT contains no guidance on matters of attribution in the context of State
responsibility. The Tribunal thus needs to resort to rules of attribution under customary
international law, as codified by the ILC Articles.

Under the ILC Articles, a State is legally responsible for the acts and omissions of (i) its
organs, as set forth in Article 4; (ii) entities or persons empowered to exercise elements

of governmental authority, if they carried out the relevant acts in such capacity, as set

forth in Article 5; and (iii) entities or persons acting in accordance with the instructions
of, or under the direction or control of, the State in relation to the specific acts in
question, as provided in Article 8. Furthermore, Article 11 provides that conduct which
a State “acknowledges and adopts” as its own is also attributable to that State under

international law.

(b) Are the actions of the Crimean State Council and the Sevastopol
Government attributable to the Russian Federation?

i. ILC Article 4

The Claimants argue that the actions taken against them by the Crimean State Council
and the Sevastopol Government are attributable to the Russian Federation under

ILC Article 4, because both entities were acting as “organs” of the Russian State. 1°
. ILC Article 4 provides as follows:

1. The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under
international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or
any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State,
and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a
territorial unit of the State.

2. An organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance
with the internal law of the State.

. The Commentary to the ILC Articles (the “ILC Commentary”) emphasizes the broad

meaning of organ in the following terms:

[...] the reference to a State organ in article 4 is intended in the most general
sense. It is not limited to the organs of the central government, to officials
at a high level or to persons with responsibility for the external relations of the
State. It extends to organs of government of whatever kind or classification,
exercising whatever functions, and at whatever level in the hierarchy, including
those at provincial or even local level. No distinction is made for this purpose
between legislative, executive or judicial organs. 1°2

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-1 Filed 04/09/22 Page 47 of 133

ILC Article 7 specifies that the conduct of a State organ is attributable to the State even
if it is unlawful: a State is responsible for acts of its organs that exceeded authority or

contravened instructions, acting thus ultra vires.1°

Article 4 speaks of attribution whatever the position that an organ holds within the State
organization. Accordingly, international tribunals have consistently attributed to the
State actions by a wide variety of State organs, including actions by government
ministers, the state treasury, the legislature, the courts, and the armed forces. 1

Furthermore, Article 4 covers conduct of an organ “whatever its character as an organ
of the central government or of a territorial unit of the State.” Further, as stressed by

 

the ILC Commentary, “[i]t does not matter for this purpose whether the territorial uni

 

in
question is a component unit of a federal State or a specific autonomous area, and it is
equally irrelevant whether the internal law of the State in question gives the federal
parliament power to compel the component unit to abide by the State’s international
obligations.” "°° Indeed, international tribunals have consistently applied the principle
that the central government is responsible for the acts of its territorial units, such as
provinces, constituent states, and municipalities. °° For example, the tribunal in
Compafiia de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine
Republic (Vivendi |) underlined that acts of a province are attributable to the State
irrespective of the State’s constitutional structure:

[I]t is well established that actions of a political subdivision of federal state, such
as the Province of Tucuman in the federal state of the Argentine Republic, are
attributable to the central government. It is equally clear that the internal

constitutional structure of a country cannot alter these obligations. 1°”

The factual background of the present case, including the Incorporation of Crimea by
the Russian Federation, has been described in detail in the Award on Jurisdiction’
and summarized in Section IV.B above. For the present purposes, suffice it to note that

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-1 Filed 04/09/22 Page 48 of 133

the Incorporation Treaty established that the Republic of Crimea and the Federal City
of Sevastopol became “constituent parts” of the Russian Federation. This is reflected in
the title of the Incorporation Treaty, which explicitly refers to “Acceptance of the
Republic of Crimea into the Russian Federation and the Formation of New Constituent
Parts within the Russian Federation.” More specifically, Articles 1 and 2 of the
Incorporation Treaty provide as follows:

Article 1(1)

[T]he Republic of Crimea shall be considered accepted into the Russian
Federation from the date of signing of this Treaty.

Article 2

From the date of acceptance of the Republic of Crimea into the Russian
Federation, new constituent parts shall be formed within the Russian Federation:
the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol. 1°

. In addition, by virtue of Russian federal legislation implementing the Incorporation
Treaty, the Crimean State Council was explicitly empowered to exercise the functions
of a governing body in the Republic of Crimea, ''® while the Russian “Law of the City of
Sevastopol” of 30 April 2015 established the Sevastopol Government as the
“permanent executive body of state power of the city of Sevastopol.”

. The Claimants’ expert, Professor Maggs, elaborated upon these legislative acts in his
expert report, noting inter alia that “[t]he Russian Federation in many respects became
the legal successor of Ukraine,” and that “[w]ith respect to the subordinate bodies of
the Republic of Crimea and the Federal City of Sevastopol, the Russian courts have
held that bodies performing functions similar to those of pre-annexation bodies are

legal successors of the pre-annexation bodies.”"12

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-1 Filed 04/09/22 Page 49 of 133

For completeness, the Tribunal notes that the Everest tribunal, having recalled the
relevant facts regarding the incorporation of the Republic of Crimea and the Federal
City of Sevastopol into the Russian Federation, concluded that “there is no doubt that
by taking the preceding steps Respondent [i.e., the Russian Federation] became
responsible under international law for the acts of the authorities of the Republic of
Crimea as from March 18, 2014.”113

In light of the foregoing analysis, it is clear that the Crimean State Council and the
Sevastopol Government are structurally part and thus “organs” of the Russian
Federation for purposes of ILC Article 4. Consequently, the conduct of the Crimean
State Council and the Sevastopol Government is attributable to the Russian

Federation.

(c) Are the actions of the Paramilitary Forces attributable to the Russian
Federation?

The Claimants argue that the acts of the Paramilitary Forces are attributable to the
Russian Federation because the Russian-installed civil authorities in Crimea
empowered the Paramilitary Forces to “exercise elements of governmental authority”
within the meaning of ILC Article 5. In the alternative, the Claimant relies on
ILC Article 11 as a basis for the Russian Federation’s responsibility for the acts of the

Paramilitary Forces. '"4

i. ILC Article 5

In accordance with ILC Article 5, a State is responsible under international law for the
conduct of persons or entities that exercise elements of delegated governmental
authority, “provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular

instance.”

Thus, for the conduct of a person or entity to become attributable to a State under
Article 5, it must be demonstrated that (i) the person or entity under consideration was
authorized to exercise governmental authority, and (ii) the person or entity exercised
such authority in carrying out the conduct in question. The ILC Commentary further

clarifies that entities under ILC Article 5 may include public corporations, semi-public

entities, public agencies of various kinds, and even private companies. ‘*® Numerous
international tribunals have held an entity's conduct to be attributable to a State under
Article 5, where (i) the entity was “empowered by the internal law” of the State to
exercise elements of governmental authority (“prérogatives de puissance publique”),
and (ii) the specific acts in question were performed by the entity “in the exercise of any
such delegated governmental authority.” 1'® Arbitral tribunals have also consistently
held that entities charged with implementing State policies satisfy the ILC Article 5
requirement for such entities to be authorized “to exercise governmental authority.”
For example, in Bosh v. Ukraine, the tribunal held that a university exercises
governmental authority for purposes of ILC Article 5, since “the provision by the
University of, inter alia, higher education services and the management of State-owned
property [...] constitute forms of governmental authority that the University is

empowered by the law of Ukraine to exercise.”''7

Similarly, in Helnan v. Egypt, the tribunal found that conduct of the Egyptian Company
for Tourism and Hotels engaged the responsibility of Egypt due to the pivotal role it
played during the implementation of Egypt's privatisation of its tourism industry.118

Another example of “elements of governmental authority” referred to in the ILC
Commentary relates to the exercise of police powers:

[Flor example, the conduct of a railway company to which certain police powers
have been granted will be regarded as an act of the State under international law
if it concerns the exercise of those powers, but not if it concerns other activities

(e.g. the sale of tickets or the purchase of rolling stock).1"9

The Tribunal also notes that the practical application of ILC Article 5 was intended to be
flexible. As noted by the tribunal in FW Oil Interests v. Trinidad and Tobago, “the notion
is intended to be a flexible one, not amenable to general definition in advance; and the

elements that would go in its definition in particular cases would be a mixture of fact,
law and practice.” 2° In essence, the practice of international tribunals clearly
demonstrates that delegating a State’s activities to separate entities will not permit

avoidance of responsibility for breach of a treaty. '2"

In the present case, the following questions are relevant to determine whether the
conduct of the Paramilitary Forces is attributable to the Russian Federation under ILC
Article 5. First, were the Paramilitary Forces that allegedly seized the Claimants’
property part of the so-called People’s Militia, whose conduct was inter alia formalized
by a specific order issued by the Supreme Council of the Autonomous Republic of
Crimea, as further discussed in paragraph 193 below? Second, were the Paramilitary
Forces/People’s Militia authorized to exercise governmental authority? Third, did the
Paramilitary Forces/People’s Militia exercise governmental authority in carrying out the

conduct that resulted in the alleged violation of the Claimants’ Treaty rights?

The first question is thus whether the Paramilitary Forces that raided the Claimants’
offices and seized their property in April 2014122 formed part of the so-called People’s
Militia or whether these were single acts of armed individuals, which could not give rise
to State responsibility. On the basis of the evidence on record, the Tribunal has come
to the conclusion that the Paramilitary Forces indeed formed part of the so-called
People’s Militia.

In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal has in particular considered the testimony of
Mr. Laber, which it found credible, regarding the events of 22 and 23 April 2014. These
events became known to Mr. Laber through the information provided to him by
Mr. Topchiy. ‘2°

More specifically, the Tribunal has considered the Claimants’ evidence that the persons

who seized their office in Feodosia during the raid of 22 April 2014 arrived in “official-

The Tribunal notes that the same building served as headquarters for the Claimants and the
claimant in PCA Case No. 2015-34. See Laber Statement, § 12 (CWS-1), noting that “[t]o reduce
overhead costs, the same employees managed the Petrol Companies’ stations and Ukrnafta’s
stations from this shared headquarters in Feodosia.”

looking vehicles” and wore uniforms with insignia of “polite people,” the Russian term
for the militia that was deployed in Crimea. 124

184. The Tribunal has also noted the account of Mr. Yaroslav Burch, Ukrnafta director, given
to the Ukrainian Independent Information News Agency, that during the raid of the
Feodosia office on 22 April 2014, he heard the Paramilitary Forces identify themselves
as members of the Crimean self-defense forces and members of the Crimean Security
Service. 176

185. The Tribunal also finds it telling that the Crimean police appeared powerless when
called upon to intervene during the raid. Mr. Laber explained that after a brief
conversation with members of the raiding force, the police officers left without more
ado:

At some point that morning, the police did come, the local Crimean police. But
after a few brief words with the armed individuals, they, you know, sort of put their
hands up and said this is sort of not something that we can deal with. This is
above what we could help you with, so it was obvious to everyone there that
there was — it was a Russian military, you know, takeover, not a — 30 bandits who
came in with automatic rifles. 2°

186. The factual account of the Claimants’ witness is consistent with the press report from
the Sobytiya Kryma (Crimean Events) news service, which provided the following
summary of the April 2014 events that took place at the Claimants’ offices:

According to the information that Ukrnafta provided to law-enforcement agencies,
the events unfolded as follows. On the morning of April 22, at the Office of
Ukrnafta’s Petroleum Products Sales Division for the Autonomous Republic of
Crimea in Feodosia located at 84 Krymskaya Street, a bus pulled up, and about
30 armed persons got out dressed in camouflage uniforms without identifying
marks, with chevron insignia reading “polite people.” The armed visitors calling
themselves “Crimean Self-defense Forces” broke into the building and forced the

entire staff to gather in the lobby. The attackers confiscated the employees’

mobile phones and put them in a box which they took away with them. The
Director of the division, Andrey Khabarov, Deputy Director Vladimir Minkin and
the Director of Elefteria LLC, Sergey Ryabichenko were taken into their offices
where “discussions” were held with each of them individually, the contents of
which can only be guessed. Fifteen minutes later, all three were taken outside
and driven away in an unknown direction. When a squad of Feodosia police
officers arrived, responding to a call from the employees of the office they were

very quickly neutralized and taken out of commission by the “polite people.” 12”

According to the same press report, on 23 April 2014, a woman named Yulia arrived at
the Feodosia office, announced that she was representing the interests of
Mr. Aksyonov, the Crimean Prime Minister, and gave the Claimants’ employees the

choice between working for the “new owner” or leaving Crimea immediately. 178

On the basis of these facts, the Tribunal has no doubt that the Paramilitary Forces
were indeed members of the People’s Militia or the Crimean Self-Defense Force and
that their conduct did not constitute random acts by some unorganized criminal

gang.°

For the sake of completeness, the Tribunal observes that it has taken note of the
factual reality that some of the evidence before it came from indirect sources, in part

due to the obvious difficulties for the Claimants to gather evidence in Crimea.

In this context, and with due regard to Article 25(6) of the UNCITRAL Rules, pursuant
to which the Tribunal has considerable discretion in matters of evidence, the Tribunal
accepts the Claimants’ explanation that direct evidence on the identity of the
Paramilitary Forces is under the exclusive control of the Russian Federation.
Consequently, the Claimants may establish such identity through indirect evidence, a
method of proof also recognized by the International Court of Justice. For example, in

the Corfu Channel case, the International Court of Justice held that “the fact of this

confirmed that the People’s Militia of Crimea, the Crimean Security Services, and the Crimean
Self-Defence Forces were “all the same people.” Transcript 5 February 2018, 30/15-24. The
Tribunal also notes that while it has established that the Paramilitary Forces formed part of the
so-called People’s Militia, for the sake of consistency, the Tribunal will continue referring to the
armed forces that seized the Claimants’ property in April 2014 as “Paramilitary Forces”.

exclusive territorial control exercised by a State [...] has bearing on the methods of
proof [...] [where] the other State, a victim of a breach of international law, is often
unable to furnish direct proof [and thus] should be allowed a more liberal recourse to

inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence.”'°°

The second question arising in the context of attribution is whether the Paramilitary
Forces had been authorized to exercise governmental authority. The record shows that
this question can only be answered affirmatively.

On 1 March 2014, President Putin submitted an appeal to the Russian Federation
Council, the upper house of Russia’s federal parliament, to “use the armed forces of
the Russian Federation on the territory of Ukraine until the social and political situation

in that country is normalized,” which request was granted on the same day. '"

More importantly in our precise context, ten days later, on 11 March 2014, the
Supreme Council of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea issued an order (the “Militia
Order”), institutionalizing the People’s Militia as an entity authorized to “conduct raids”
and “participate in patrols.”*22 Specifically, in accordance with Section II(3) of the Militia
Order, the People’s Militia was assigned the tasks of participating in patrols, setting up
posts on streets and in other public places, and conducting raids to uncover and stop
violations of the law. The People’s Militia was also charged with uncovering
circumstances contributing to violations of the law and reporting such circumstances to
law enforcement and other authorities of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, and
delivering offenders to Internal Affairs authorities.

Again, ten days later, on 21 March 2014, when the Republic of Crimea became a
federal subject of the Russian Federation, the Militia Order was “affirmed”. 33 The

Militia Order was eventually superseded by an act of the Republic of Crimea passed on

17 June 2014,'* which defines the People’s Militia as “an association that is being
created for the purpose of assisting government agencies of the Republic of Crimea
and law-enforcement agencies in maintaining public order, and shall be made up of
citizens of the Russian Federation who have been recruited into it in accordance with
the prescribed procedure” (Article 1.1). Article 2.1 of the same act clarifies that the legal
foundation of the People’s Militia is “the Constitution of the Russian Federation, federal
laws and other normative legal acts of the Russian Federation, the Constitution of the
Republic of Crimea, this Law, and other normative legal acts of the Republic of
Crimea.”

As a consequence, the Tribunal has no hesitation to conclude that the People’s Militia
was empowered under the internal law of the Republic of Crimea to exercise

governmental functions and, specifically, police powers.

The third question in the three-prong test to assess attribution set out in paragraph 180
above, i.e., whether the People’s Militia did exercise governmental powers when taking

control of the Claimants’ operations, must also receive an affirmative response.

The best evidence for the fact that the Paramilitary Forces/People’s Militia exercised
governmental authority in carrying out the conduct at issue is that the Crimean State
Council and the Sevastopol Government effectively ratified the Paramilitary Forces’
acts by issuing the 3 September 2014 amendment to the Nationalization Decree and
the Sevastopol Order.'%° It is also noteworthy that, on 16 April 2014, Mikhail Sheremet,
the head of the Self-Defense Forces, became the Deputy Prime Minister of Crimea and

was specifically charged with supervising law enforcement bodies of Crimea.'®® Last

but not least, the Claimants’ properties were eventually put under control of State-
owned enterprises by the Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol. "37

All of the above facts lead to the conclusion that the Paramilitary Forces were
empowered under ILC Article 5 to exercise elements of governmental authority and in
fact exercised such authority by their conduct affecting the Claimants’ investment in
Crimea and Sevastopol. The Tribunal’s conclusion is in line with the findings of the
Everest tribunal, which was faced with a similar factual pattern and concluded that, “[i]n
view of the governmental character of the functions entrusted to the People’s Militia
and the fact that these functions are based on the law of the Republic of Crimea, [...]
the alleged acts of the People’s Militia shall be considered acts of the Russian

Federation under international law.”'°*

Lastly, some additional observations are in order. First, the fact that the Paramilitary
Forces may have violated Russian law in their exercise of police powers has no impact

on the attribution of their conduct to the Russian Federation. **°

Second, the Tribunal observes that it has noted the distinction drawn by the Claimants
in relation to the acts committed by the Paramilitary Forces before and after 21 March
2014, which potentially impacts the attribution of the acts complained of under ILC
Articles 5 or 8.'4° However, considering that the Claimants have only been affected by
the acts of the Paramilitary Forces as of 22 April 2014, it is unnecessary for the
Tribunal to seek to characterize the acts preceding that date. The Tribunal can thus
dispense with the analysis of attribution of the conduct of the Paramilitary Forces under
ILC Article 8.

international law if the organ, person or entity acts in that capacity, even if it exceeds its authority
or contravenes instructions.” (CLA-102). The ILC Commentary provides the following further
explanation: “The State cannot take refuge behind the notion that, according to the provisions of
its internal law [...] their actions or omissions ought not to have occurred or ought to have taken a
different form.” p. 45 (CLA-103).

ii. ILC Article 11

Finally, for the sake of completeness, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants have also
argued that the acts of the Paramilitary Forces are attributable to Russia under ILC

Article 11, which reads as follows:

Conduct which is not attributable to a State under the preceding articles shall
nevertheless be considered an act of that State under international law if and to
the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its

own.

In addition to being attributable under ILC Article 5, the Tribunal is of the opinion that
the acts of the Paramilitary Forces are attributable to the Russian Federation under ILC
Article 11. Indeed, the record shows that the Russian Federation has acknowledged
and adopted the conduct by the Paramilitary Forces as its own. The Tribunal has made
this finding taking into account the facts mentioned in paragraph 197 above as well as

the following circumstances:

(i) on 17 April 2014, President Putin acknowledged in a televised interview that

“Russian servicemen did back the Crimean Self-Defense Forces”;"*"

(ii) by June 2014, the Crimean Parliament had confirmed the role of the Paramilitary
Forces as an organ of the Crimean government through the enactment of a number of
laws and regulations specifying their status and organizational structure; "42

(iii) on 3 September and 11 November 2014, respectively, the Crimean State Council
and the Sevastopol Government ratified the actions of the Paramilitary Forces by
the amendment to the Nationalization Decree and the issuance of the Sevastopol
Order; "43 and

this legislation the People’s Militia is controlled and financed by the Crimean Government, while
the head of the Militia is appointed and removed from office by decree of the head of the Crimean
Republic.

(iv) there was no attempt by the Russian Federation or any of its authorities to
prosecute or hold the Paramilitary Forces accountable in any manner. 44

Since the acts of the Paramilitary Forces have already been held attributable to the
Russian Federation under ILC Article 5, it is not strictly necessary to reach a conclusion
on attribution under Article 11. It was nevertheless discussed here because it was

raised by the Claimants and adds weight to the already clear finding under Article 5.

(d) Conclusion

In light of all of the above, the Tribunal concludes that (i) the acts of the Crimean State
Council and the Sevastopol Government are attributable to the Russian Federation
under ILC Article 4 and (ii) the acts of the Paramilitary Forces/People’s Militia are
attributable to the Russian Federation under ILC Article 5 and ILC Article 11.

LiaBILITY
1. The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants argue that the Russian Federation breached its obligations under the
BIT. They primarily rely on Article 5 of the BIT, contending that the Russian Federation
unlawfully expropriated the Claimants’ investment in breach of this Article. Moreover,

the Claimants argue that the Respondent also breached Articles 2 and 3 of the BIT. "4°

(a) The expropriation claim

According to the Claimants, the Russian Federation “interfered with and nationalized”
their properties when: (i) the Paramilitary Forces “seized and looted” the Feodosia
office and began operating the Claimants’ petrol stations in April 2014; ‘° (ii) the
Crimean State Council nationalized the Claimants’ petrol stations, office in Feodosia,
storage facility, and other real properties located in the Republic of Crimea by the

3 September 2014 amendment to the Nationalization Decree; ‘47 and (iii) the

Sevastopol Government nationalized the Claimants’ petrol stations and storage facility
in that city by the Sevastopol Order of 11 November 2014. 148

The Claimants argue that these measures constitute an unlawful “nationalization”
under Article 5 of the BIT."4° According to the Claimants, for expropriation to be lawful
under that provision, it must: (i) be in the public interest; (ii) not be discriminatory;
(iii) be in accordance with the procedures established by law; and (iv) be “accompanied
by prompt, adequate and effective compensation.”'®° The Claimants submit that the

Respondent failed to meet any of these requirements.

(b) Discriminatory measures

The Claimants contend that Article 3(1) of the BIT enjoins the Russian Federation from
adopting “discriminatory measures that could interfere with the management and
disposal” by Ukrainian investors of their investments. ‘*' Accordingly, there is
discriminatory treatment when a “state benefit[s] or harm[s] someone more in
comparison with the generality.” 52 In the determination of whether there is
discriminatory treatment, the Claimants aver that it is “necessary to compare the
treatment challenged with the treatment of persons or things in a comparable
situation.”"53 The Claimants add that “tribunals generally favor an approach that looks
at the consequences of a particular measure,” although discriminatory intent may also

be relevant. 4

In the present case, the Claimants argue that the Russian Federation’s actions were
discriminatory because they were motivated solely by its “political animus” against
Mr. Kolomoisky.15° Thus, due to the absence of an “objective or reasoned” basis for its

actions against the Claimants, the Russian Federation exhibited discriminatory
behavior in breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT.15¢

(c) Most favored nation protections

The Claimants assert that, in addition to the preclusion against discriminatory
measures discussed in paragraph 208 above, Article 3 of the BIT guarantees
investments of Ukrainian investors “treatment no less favorable than the treatment to
[the Russian Federation's] own investors or investors of any third State.”'*’ For the
Claimants, this is an MFN clause, which imports into the BIT substantive guarantees
from other investment treaties ratified by the Respondent. The Claimants submit that
“[t]he weight of authority clearly supports the view that an MFN rule grants a claimant
the right to benefit from substantive guarantees contained in third treaties.” 1° In
support of this argument, the Claimants refer to MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. v. Republic of
Chile and White Indus. Australia Ltd. v. Republic of India.1°°

In the present case, the Claimants seek to import into the Treaty Article 3(1) of the
Canada-USSR BIT, specifically its substantive FET and FPS protections. '®° In relevant
part, Article 3(1) of the Canada-USSR BIT provides:

Investments or returns of investors of either Contracting Party shall at all times be
accorded fair and equitable treatment in accordance with principles of

other Contracting Party.

i. Fair and equitable treatment

The Claimants submit that the FET standard “ensures that [a] foreign investor is not
unjustly treated [...] and is a means to guarantee justice to foreign investors,”
asserting that it “is more than a ‘minimum standard’ of conduct.”"® In this regard, the
Claimants recalls the following factors identified in Rumeli Telekom v. Republic of
Kazakhstan as relevant to an FET standard analysis: (i) “the State must act in a
transparent manner’; (ii) “the State is obliged to act in good faith”; (iii) “the State’s
conduct cannot be arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust, idiosyncratic, discriminatory, or
lacking in due process”; and (iv) “the State must respect procedural propriety and due
process.”*® In addition, the Claimants cite Tecnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. v.
United Mexican States, Jan Oostergetel v. Slovak Republic, Vivendi v. Argentine
Republic (Vivendi II), and MTD v. Chile. ** Reading these cases together, the
Claimants submit that the FET standard mandates States: (i) “to act in good faith and
to refrain from acting in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner”; and (ii) “to afford
foreign investors due process under the law.” 16>

In the present case, the Claimants contend that the Russian Federation violated the
FET standard because it acted in a “blatantly discriminatory manner” against the Petrol
Companies and their investments in Crimea.‘® In particular, the Claimants argue that
the Russian Federation's acts that specifically targeted the Petrol Companies and their
investments for “extralegal and political reasons” constitute a clear infringement of the

FET standard.'®’ Additionally, the Claimants submit that the Respondent's measures

“violated ‘[t]he general, if not cardinal, principle of customary international law that
States must act in good faith’.”"°8

. Finally, the Claimants assert that the Russian Federation failed to satisfy its obligation
to afford the Petrol Companies due process of law when the Respondent failed to
“provide the Petrol Companies a meaningful opportunity or mechanism to challenge the
unlawful takeover and nationalization of their stations and other properties” and when it
rebuffed the Claimants’ efforts to seek legal recourse. 8°

ii. Full protection and security

. The Claimants are of the view that the FPS standard complements the FET
standard. 17° Referring to Occidental Exploration & Production Co. v. Republic of
Ecuador, the Claimants state that “treatment that is not fair and equitable automatically
entails an absence of full protection and security of the investment.”'7' Further, the
Claimants emphasize that the FPS standard imposes an “obligation of vigilance” on a
State to take all measures necessary to ensure an investor's “full enjoyment of

protection and security of its investments.”*7

. The Claimants submit further that the scope of protection guaranteed by the FPS
standard includes not only physical security, but also legal protection of an investor's
rights.‘73 In support, the Claimants rely on CME Czech Republic v. Czech Republic,

the security and legal protection of the claimant's investment to be in breach of the FPS
standard.'74

The Claimants argue that, similarly, in the present case, the Respondent breached the
FPS standard when it intentionally targeted and destroyed the Petrol Companies’
investments in Crimea based on their connection with Mr. Kolomoisky and without due
process of law. 175

In addition, the Claimants submit that, even if the FPS standard only guaranteed
physical security of investments, the Russian Federation would still be in breach of the
BIT.'76 The Claimants rely on the holding in Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Arab Republic of
Egypt, where the tribunal found that Egypt failed to accord full protection and security
to the investor when it did not prevent the seizure of the investor's hotel by private
actors, or return the hotel to the investor's control.17”

Applying Wena Hotels to this case, the Claimants aver that the Respondent breached
the FPS standard when it refused to take any action to protect the Claimants’
properties and employees after the Paramilitary Forces raided the Feodosia office and
began operating the Claimants’ petrol stations, and when the Crimean authorities did
not act on the Claimants’ complaints. '7® To the contrary, the Russian Federation
“actively participated” in the actions against the Claimants by nationalizing their

properties in Crimea. "7°

The Claimants also argue that the Russian Federation violated its obligation to
“guarantee[], in accordance with its legislation, the full and unconditional legal
protection of investments by investors of the other Contracting Party” under Article 2 of

Mr. Kolomoisky,” which ultimately resulted in the destruction of their investments in

“concerned not merely with physical protection but also with legal protection.”"8*

The Claimants add that assuming there was no act of nationalization on 22 April 2014,
the fact that the Respondent failed to protect their properties on that day constitutes a
breach of Article 2 of the BIT. 18

2. Analysis
(a) Expropriation
i. The legal standard

Article 5(1) of the Treaty establishes the following protection from unlawful

expropriation:

Investments made by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the
other Contracting Party shall not be expropriated, nationalized or subject to other
measures equivalent in effect to expropriation (hereinafter referred to as
“expropriation”), except in cases where such measures are taken in the public
interest under due process of law, are not discriminatory and are accompanied by

prompt, adequate and effective compensation.

The Tribunal will first assess whether there has been an expropriation. In the
affirmative, it will proceed to examine whether the expropriation was lawful in
accordance with the test set forth in the Treaty. As is apparent from the wording of
Article 5(1), the Treaty conditions the legality of any expropriatory measure on the

following elements:
(i) public interest;
(ii) non-discrimination;
(iii) due process of law; and
(iv) prompt, adequate and effective compensation.

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-1 Filed 04/09/22 Page 65 of 133

The language of the Treaty leaves no doubt that the four requirements are cumulative.
Indeed, arbitral tribunals have frequently held that when a treaty requires several
conditions for a lawful expropriation, failure to meet any one of those conditions makes

the expropriation wrongful. 8°

Furthermore, the prohibition of unlawful expropriation in Article 5(1) of the Treaty
encompasses both direct expropriation and measures “equivalent in effect to
expropriation” (i.e., “indirect” expropriation). The Treaty’s protection thus covers an
outright physical taking of property or measures that affect legal title, as well as acts
that deprive an investor of the use and enjoyment of its investment without affecting
possession or formal title to the investment. In other words, in cases of direct
expropriation, there is an open and unequivocal intent, which is reflected in a physical
act or a formal law or decree, to deprive the owner of his or her property through the
transfer of title or outright seizure. In cases of indirect expropriation, it is the measure’s
economic impact on the investment that matters, whereas an open and unequivocal

intent to expropriate may not be present.

ii. Did the Russian Federation expropriate the Claimants’ investment?

In the context of the analysis of its ratione materiae jurisdiction in the Award on
Jurisdiction, the Tribunal held that “there can be no serious doubt that the resources
committed by the Claimants fully correspond to the meaning of ‘investment’ set forth in
Article 1(1) of the BIT.” ‘® In this context, the Tribunal also analyzed the relevant
Ukrainian, Crimean, and Russian legislation and concluded that the Claimants’
property rights and their investment complied with both Ukrainian and Russian law, '®
with the result that the Claimants’ investment fully met the requirement set forth in

Statement of Claim, § 3.60. See, e.g., Ron Fuchs v. Republic of Georgia, \CSID Case No.
ARB/07/15, Award, § 390 (3 March 2010) (CLA-70) (finding the Respondent's expropriation
unlawful even where (i) the expropriation was potentially taken in the public interest and
(ii) despite Respondent's argument that no compensation was due, but where (iii) the
expropriation was not carried out under due process of law; Vivendi v. Argentine Republic
(Vivendi II), \CSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award, § 7.5.21 (20 August 2007) (CLA-80), noting as
follows: “If we conclude that the challenged measures are expropriatory, there will be violation of
Article 5(2) of the Treaty, even if the measures might be for a public purpose and non-
discriminatory, because no compensation has been paid.”). See also Bernardus Henricus
Funnekotter & Ors. v. Zimbabwe, |\CSID Case No. ARB/05/6, Award, § 98 (22 April 2009): “The
Tribunal observes that the conditions enumerated in Article 6 are cumulative. In other terms, if
any of those conditions is violated, there is a breach of Article 6.”

Article 1(1) of the BIT for the investment to be made in accordance with the host
State's legislation.

The Tribunal also observed in its Award on Jurisdiction that the Respondent had never
put forward an argument of any alleged non-conformity of the Claimants’ properties
with either Russian or Ukrainian laws as a justification of the measures that are the
subject of this arbitration.®° The Tribunal hereby confirms its earlier findings and adds
that the Respondent's recognition of the Claimants’ title over their properties before the
nationalization is also confirmed by the Crimean Property Law, '®” the purpose of which
was to deal with certain effects “as a result of the termination of the title of the previous

proprietor and the acquisition by the Republic of Crimea of title to such property.”"88

Turning to the facts related to the alleged expropriation, the Tribunal recalls that it is the
Claimants’ position in this arbitration that the Russian Federation nationalized their
properties when (i) the Paramilitary Forces “seized and looted” the Feodosia office and
deprived the Claimants of all control over their petrol stations in April 2014;1®9 (ii) the
Crimean State Council nationalized their petrol stations, storage facility, and other real
estate assets (in particular, Stabil LLC’s residential apartment in Simferopol) located in
the Republic of Crimea by the 3 September 2014 amendment to the Nationalization
Decree; "®° and (iii) the Sevastopol Government nationalized their petrol stations and

storage facility located in Sevastopol by the Sevastopol Order of 11 November 2014.19"

With reference to paragraph 113 and following above and in view of its findings on
attribution, the Tribunal finds that the above three sets of facts alleged by the Claimants
are established. Therefore, it considers that the Russian Federation carried out a direct
expropriation of the Claimants’ petrol stations and storage facilities when it seized the
Claimants’ headquarters in Feodosia on 22 April 2014. This expropriation was
subsequently formalized through the 3 September 2014 amendment to Nationalization
Decree *®2 and the Sevastopol Order, 1% the terms of which are clear and leave no

doubt that the Republic of Crimea and the Sevastopol Government expropriated the
Claimants’ properties. Stabil LLC’s residential apartment in Simferopol was

expropriated through the 3 September 2014 amendment to the Nationalization Decree.

As to the date of the expropriation, the Tribunal notes Mr. Laber’s testimony that,
following the seizure of the Feodosia office on 22 April 2014, Ukrnafta employees were
denied access to the building by the Paramilitary Forces, and thus the Claimant lost all
managerial control of its Crimean petrol stations: 1%

By 25 April 2014, numerous sources on the ground in Crimea reported to us that
individuals — either the Paramilitary Forces or individuals affiliated with them —
were illegally selling the Petrol Stations’ remaining inventory of fuel and other
products at substantially lower prices than the prices set by the Petrol
Companies. These individuals abandoned the Petrol Stations around June 2014,
probably because there was no remaining inventory to be sold. The Petrol
Companies received none of the revenues from this illegal sale of their fuel and
other goods since 22 April 2014. In short, the Petrol Companies had lost control
of their operations. 19>

Consequently, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent expropriated the Claimants’
Crimean petrol stations and storage facilities on 22 April 2014, and Stabil LLC’s

residential apartment in Simferopol on 3 September 2014.

iii. Was the Russian Federation’s expropriation of the Claimants’
investment lawful?

With reference to the test set out in paragraph 223 above, the Tribunal will now
examine whether the Respondent's expropriatory measures were contrary to the public
interest (a); discriminatory (b); not in accordance with due process of law (c); and

lacking compensation (d).

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-1 Filed 04/09/22 Page 68 of 133

(a) Public interest

Under Article 5(1) of the BIT, in order for an expropriation to be lawful it must be “taken
in the public interest.” This requires a concrete, genuine interest of the public that is
furthered by the expropriation.

The Special Rapporteur on International Responsibility highlights the importance of the

public purpose requirement for the legality of an expropriation:

[T]he least that can be required of the State is that it should exercise [its] power
only when the measure is clearly justified by the public interest. Any other view
would condone and even facilitate the abusive exercise of the power to
expropriate and give legal sanction to manifestly arbitrary acts of expropriation.
[...] It is accordingly sufficient to require that all States should comply with the
condition or requirement which is common to all; namely, that the power to
expropriate should be exercised only when expropriation is necessary and is
justified by a genuinely public purpose or reason. If this raison d’etre is plainly

absent, the measure of expropriation is “arbitrary.”*9°

The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that the expropriation of their investment
lacked a public purpose. In view of all the circumstances surrounding the expropriation,
which were discussed in the context of attribution in paragraphs 154-160 above and
are further addressed below, the Tribunal can discern no public purpose that could
justify the challenged measure. In this context, the Tribunal finds it particularly telling
that the amendments to the Nationalization Decree and the Sevastopol Order, which
nationalized the Claimants’ properties and proclaimed them to be the property of the
Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol, made no attempt to justify the taking by reference

to a public purpose.

The Tribunal thus concludes that the Respondent's expropriation of the Claimants’
properties lacked public interest, which is even more visible if one also considers the
discriminatory nature of the expropriation, to which the Tribunal turns next.

(b) Discrimination

Under Article 5(1) of the Treaty, an expropriation is unlawful if it is discriminatory.

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-1 Filed 04/09/22 Page 69 of 133

The Claimants argue that the requirements of public interest and lack of discrimination
are intertwined, such that when the expropriation is motivated by personal animus
against an investor, the expropriation necessarily contravenes the public interest,
regardless of an ostensible public purpose for the measure. 1” In this regard, the
Claimants refer to British Caribbean Bank Ltd. v. Belize, where the tribunal found that
the public statements of the Prime Minister of Belize according to which
the expropriation targeted the assets of the investor, who was an “enemy of Belize,”
belied the public interest justification for the expropriation. 1 Drawing a parallel
between the present case and British Caribbean, the Claimants argue that the Russian
Federation’s actions against the Claimants were motivated by its “hostility” against
Mr. Kolomoisky, ‘°° and reiterate that, unlike the Government of Belize in British
Caribbean, the Russian Federation did not even proffer a public interest objective when

it expropriated the Claimants’ properties.2°°

In connection with the motivation behind the expropriation, the Tribunal notes that the
record contains numerous manifestations of the Respondent's hostility towards
Mr. Kolomoisky. The statement of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Crimea
to the Crimean Parliament that it was a “moral right and a moral duty to carry out th[e]
nationalization” because Mr. Kolomoisky “is one of the oligarchs who initiated and has
been financing military operations in the southeast of Ukraine where our compatriots
are being killed”2°" is self-explanatory. Bearing in mind that Mr. Kolomoisky holds a
significant share of the Claimants’ equity (see paragraph 99 above), there is no need
for further evidence of the Respondent's discriminatory intent when carrying out the

expropriation of Mr. Kolomoisky’s property.

Nonetheless, for completeness, the Tribunal also notes the following circumstances

which prove the discriminatory nature of the Respondent's expropriation:

(i) the 24 September 2014 statement of a spokesperson for the Russian Investigative
Committee, Mr. Vladimir Markin, that “all of Mr. Kolomoisky’s assets in Russia” would

be seized;202

(ii) President Putin’s interviews of 4 March and 17 April 2014, where he called
Mr. Kolomoisky a “scoundrel” and an “impostor,”2°? and told a Crimean resident not to
bother repaying his car loan to PJSC Privatbank, a Ukrainian bank in which
Mr. Kolomoisky was a significant shareholder;2o*

(iii) the order by the Basmanny District Court of Moscow to arrest Mr. Kolomoisky for
his alleged support to the Ukrainian Defense Forces in their skirmishes against the

Russian military in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine;2° and, finally,

(iv) the August and September 2014 orders of the Simferopol District Court for the

attachment of properties believed to be associated with Mr. Kolomoisky.?°

On this basis, the Tribunal has no hesitation to conclude that the Russian Federation’s
measures were targeted specifically at the Claimants and their investments, and were
therefore by definition discriminatory, which renders the expropriation unlawful under
the Treaty.

(c) Due process

The Claimants submit that the nationalization of their properties was not carried out
“under due process of law,” as required by Article 5 of the BIT. They assert that they
pursued “all avenues available to them to regain control of their Crimean operations” by
reporting the illegal actions to the local police (as described at paragraph 120
above). °7 However, those authorities “failed to take any actions to remove the
perpetrators from the Petrol Companies’ property. Further, the Crimean authorities

failed to afford the Petrol Companies a forum in which to challenge the nationalization
of their properties or to petition for the rights to resume operations at their stations and

storage facilities.”298

The Tribunal first observes that in providing that an expropriation is wrongful unless
taken “under due process of law,” the Treaty does not distinguish between substantive
and procedural due process. International tribunals have held that a lawful exercise of
the right to expropriate requires compliance with both substantive and procedural due

process.

Substantive due process is breached through a “substantively unfair’ result. 29°
Procedural due process is violated when certain procedural safeguards are not
provided: tribunals have required a fair hearing within a reasonable time by an impartial
adjudicator, as well as a procedure under domestic law for the investor to raise claims
against the expropriation measure and compliance with that procedure. As aptly

summarized by the tribunal in ADC v. Hungary:

“[D]ue process of law”, in the expropriation context, demands an actual and
substantive legal procedure for a foreign investor to raise its claims against the
depriving actions already taken or about to be taken against it. Some basic legal
mechanisms, such as reasonable advance notice, a fair hearing and an unbiased
and impartial adjudicator to assess the actions in dispute, are expected to be
readily available and accessible to the investor to make such legal procedure
meaningful. In general, the legal procedure must be of a nature to grant an
affected investor a reasonable chance within a reasonable time to claim its
legitimate rights and have its claims heard. If no legal procedure of such nature
exists at all, the argument that “the actions are taken under due process of law”

rings hollow.?"°

. Additionally, the Claimants submit that Russia failed to afford them the guarantees of
Article 35 of the Russian Constitution and of the Russian investment law. 21
Article 35(3) of the Russian Constitution indeed provides that “[n]o one may be
deprived of his property except pursuant to a judicial decision. Property can be forcibly

taken for state needs only on condition of prior and equal compensation.”

. In view of the facts on record, the manner in which control was taken over (see
paragraphs 113-132 above) and in particular the lack of any response to the Claimants’
complaints by the Crimean and Russian authorities (see paragraph 120 above), the
Tribunal can only conclude that the expropriation did not meet the requirement of due

process of law, be it under international or Russian law.

. In this context and for completeness, the Tribunal also notes that, on 28 May 2018, it
invited the Parties to provide a copy of, and comment upon, the Crimean Property
Law.?!2 In their response of 15 June 2018, the Claimants filed the Crimean Property
Law and responded to the Tribunal’s enquiry that such act purported to regulate
“relations involving compensation for the value of property [...] as a result of the
termination of the title of the previous proprietor and the acquisition by the Republic of
Crimea of title to such property, which is included in the List of Property Recorded as
Property of the Republic of Crimea [...]” (the “List’).2"* The Claimants further observed
that the List referenced in the Crimean Property Law enumerated the properties
nationalized pursuant to the Nationalization Decree and the amendments thereto, and

included the Claimants’ properties in Crimea at issue in this arbitration.

. The Tribunal notes that, pursuant to the Crimean Property Law, “[a]ny individual or
legal entity that was the owner of property included in the List [...] as of February 21,
2014, and at the time the property was added to the List [...] shall be eligible to receive
compensation.” 2"* The Crimean Property Law further sets out the procedure for
submitting applications and calculating compensation. By the same token, under the
Sevastopol Resolution adopted on 8 February 2018, an individual or legal entity that

owned property taken pursuant to Sevastopol nationalization decrees is eligible for
compensation.2"®

However, the Crimean Property Law also provides for categories of individuals and
entities that are not entitled to compensation, such as individuals against whom a
criminal case has been instituted for an extremism-related offense before the issuance
of a not-guilty verdict.2"® As for the Sevastopol Resolution, it only covers legal entities
listed in the Russian corporate register, with the result that Ukrainian entities such as

the Claimants have no right to be compensated.?”

The Claimants argue that “the creation after the fact of an illusory remedy does not
trigger any duty on the part of the Claimants [...] to make a futile effort to mitigate [their]

damages” and refer to international jurisprudence in support of their position.2"®

Indeed, the injured party’s duty to mitigate its losses, to the extent such a duty derives
from the general principles of law, is a reasonable one: evidently futile attempts at
mitigation are not required.2"? On the basis of the facts of the present case and the
limited scope of the Crimean Property Law and the Sevastopol Resolution, the Tribunal
accepts that the Claimants could reasonably conclude that any attempt to obtain
compensation would have been futile. This is particularly so in view of the
Respondent's open hostility towards Mr. Kolomoisky due to his alleged support to the

military forces in Eastern Ukraine engaged in opposing Russian forces.

This is further true considering that acceding to the compensation mechanism created
by the Crimean authorities may have resulted in a violation of Ukrainian law by the

Claimants, which law views the Crimean authorities established by the Russian

Resolution of the Sevastopol Government No. 67-PP “On approval of the procedure for issuing
decisions on compensation for the value of property declared to be property of the city of
Sevastopol that was previously private property” (8 February 2018) (C-167).

also Claimants’ Responses on Merits, p. 11, fn. 45. In response to the Tribunal’s question
regarding the Claimants’ duty to mitigate its damages, the Claimants explained that they had
pursued all reasonably available avenues to regain control of their Crimean operations, but the
Crimean authorities failed to take any action (Claimants’ Responses on Merits, § 2.2). As noted
above at § 120), the Tribunal has found these facts to be established.

§§ 215, 386 (17 December 2015) (CLA-272), finding that the victim of wrongful conduct is

reasonably when confronted by injury; in other words, at the time of the wrong.”

Federation as “illegal bodies” and their acts as “invalid.”22° It was thus reasonable for
the Claimants to refrain from making any — most probably futile — attempts to obtain

compensation from the Crimean authorities.

253. In any event, having considered the two laws, the Tribunal notes that neither satisfies
the BIT requirement of “prompt, adequate, and effective” compensation. In reaching
this conclusion, the Tribunal bears in mind the Report of the United Nations Human
Rights Commission, which made the following finding:

The confiscation of public and private property, referred to as “nationalization”
under the Russian Federation legislation, which began in Crimea after
the referendum in March 2014 continued. As of 12 May 2017, 4,575 public and

private real estate assets had been “nationalized”.

The Russian Federation authorities took steps to compensate owners of property
“nationalized” since March 2014 by adopting special legislation on 28 December
2016. However, the compensation is limited and does not offer a fair remedy to

 

those affected. Indeed, the scheme is only applicable to private property and
excludes individuals accused of “extremism”. The latter limitation raises particular
concerns in view of the arbitrary application of anti-extremism legislation by the
Russian Federation authorities in Crimea. The amount of compensation will be
determined by reference to the market value of the object on 21 February 2014, a
date which precedes the application of Russian Federation legislation in Crimea
and the “nationalization”. Moreover, payment of compensation can be postponed

for 10 years.?#"

254. The Tribunal also notes the statement by the United Nations Commissioner on Human
Rights in his report of September 2017 on Crimea, which was approved by the United
Nations’ General Assembly in December 2017, according to which although
“[rlegulatory acts have been adopted to provide legitimacy to the nationalization

process,” the fact remains that “[Ilarge scale expropriation of public and private

220 See Law of Ukraine No. 1207-VII, “On guaranteeing the rights and freedoms of citizens and on

the legal regime on the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine,” Art. 9 (titled “Illegal bodies, their
officials and officers”) (15 April 2014) (C-67).

situation in Ukraine 16 February to 15 May 2017, §§ 157-158 (13 June 2017) (C-187) (emphasis
added).

property has been conducted without compensation or regard for international
humanitarian law provisions protecting property from seizures or destruction.”222

To conclude, the Russian Federation failed to respect the Claimants’ substantive and
procedural due process rights under Article 5(1) of the Treaty in carrying out the

expropriation. Thus the Respondent's expropriation was unlawful.

(d) Compensation

Article 5(1) of the BIT requires that expropriatory measures shall be accompanied by
“prompt, adequate and effective compensation.” Article 5(2) of the BIT states that
compensation must equate the investment’s market value and gives further indication

on how it must be computed:

(2) The amount of such compensation shall correspond to the market value of the
expropriated investments immediately before the date of expropriation or before
the fact of expropriation became officially known, while compensation shall be
paid without delay, including interest accruable from the date of expropriation
until the date of payment, at the interest rate for three month deposits in US
dollars on the London Interbank Market (LIBOR) plus 1%, and shall be effectively
disposable and freely transferable.

The Claimants assert that the Respondent failed to offer them prompt, adequate and

effective compensation or, indeed, any “compensation whatsoever.”223

With due regard to, inter alia, its observations on the Crimean Property Law above, the
Tribunal deems it established that the Respondent has failed to pay any compensation
to the Claimant, let alone “adequate and effective” compensation, as required by
Article 5(1) of the BIT.

(C-190). The Tribunal has also noted that the U.N. Resolution 72/190 urges the Russian
Federation “to repeal laws imposed in Crimea by the Russian Federation that allow for forced
evictions and the confiscation of private property in Crimea, in violation of applicable international
law.”

iv. Conclusion

The Tribunal concludes that the Respondent expropriated the Claimants’ investment in
breach of Article 5 of the Treaty as a result of (i) the physical seizure of the Claimants’
property on 22 April 2014 by the Paramilitary Forces, and (ii) the legislative acts by the
Crimean State Council and the Sevastopol Government that nationalized the
Claimants’ investment in Crimea and Sevastopol. In particular, the Tribunal holds that
Russia’s expropriation of the Claimants’ investment did not meet any of the four
cumulative requirements set forth in Article 5 of the Treaty for the lawfulness of an
expropriation.

(b) Other alleged treaty breaches

The Claimants do not assert that the alleged treaty breaches other than expropriation
caused them separate or greater harm than the harm that they suffered through the
expropriatory measures. As a result, since it held that the Respondent is liable for
expropriation, the Tribunal considers that it can dispense with answering the merits of
the allegations of additional treaty breaches for the sake of procedural economy. 224

REPARATION

Having held that the Respondent expropriated the Claimants’ investment in breach of
Article 5 of the Treaty, the Tribunal now turns to the question of reparation, addressing
the standard of compensation and the date of valuation (1); the valuation of the

Claimants’ investment (2); and the application of interest (3).

1. Standard of Compensation and Date of Valuation
(a) The Claimants’ position

The Claimants submit that the BIT does not define a standard of compensation for
unlawful expropriations or breaches of Articles 2 and 3.225 In the absence of a lex
specialis, the standard for damages is the customary international law principle of full
reparation according to which, in the words of the Permanent Court of International

Justice in the Case Concerning the Factory at Chorzéw (“Chorzow”), “reparation must,

as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the
situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been
committed.”226 That principle is codified in the ILC Articles, specifically in Articles 31,
34, and 36.22”

The Claimants further submit that full reparation implies granting the fair market value
of the investment.28 They also state that, “[w]hen a host State has undertaken a series
of measures that culminate in a final act of expropriation,” valuation must be carried out
on the “date prior to the ‘first completed breach’ by the Respondent.”22° In the present
case, this date is 22 April 2014, when the Respondent seized the Claimants’
headquarters in Feodosia,?°° which resulted in the “actual and permanent deprivation”
of their investment.2*"

(b) Analysis

The Tribunal has held that the Claimants’ investment in Crimea was expropriated in
breach of Article 5 of the Treaty. It has also held that the breach was attributable to the
Russian Federation. Thus, the Russian Federation has committed an internationally
wrongful act, which gives rise to an obligation to make full reparation for the injury
caused by that act.232

While Article 5(2) of the Treaty (reproduced at paragraph 151 above) provides a

standard of compensation, that standard applies only in the event of an expropriation

that is lawful under the test provided in Article 5(1). As the expropriation in the present
case was held to be unlawful, the standard of Article 5(2) does not apply. The Tribunal
will therefore resort to customary international law and, in particular, to the principle set

forth in Chorzow:

The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act — a principle
which seems to be established by international practice and in particular by the
decisions of arbitral tribunals — is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe
out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which
would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.
Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to
the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of
damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or

payment in place of it.28°

Under the circumstances of this case, the Tribunal considers that the principle of full
reparation just referred to will be adequately implemented by granting the Claimants a
monetary award equal to the fair market value of their investment immediately prior to
expropriation. The fair market value of an investment is the price at which an asset
would change hands, or more specifically “[the] price [...] at which property would
change hands between a hypothetical willing and able buyer and a hypothetical willing
and able seller acting, at arm’s length in an open and unrestricted market, when neither
is under compulsion to buy or sell and when both have reasonable knowledge of the
relevant facts.”254

Having concluded that the Claimants’ petrol stations and storage facilities were
expropriated on 22 April 2014, the Tribunal also takes this date as the date of
valuation. In other words, the value to be assessed is the value of these properties just
before their expropriation on that day. In the Tribunal’s opinion, 22 April 2014 is the
relevant date, irrespective of the exact date of seizure of each petrol station and
storage facility. Indeed, what matters is that the Claimants lost control of these assets
on 22 April 2014 at the time of the seizure of the headquarters in Feodosia, which
controlled all of the Claimants’ Crimean operations. The valuation date for Stabil LLC’s
residential apartment is 3 September 2014, the date of its expropriation through the

amendment to the Nationalization Decree.

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-1 Filed 04/09/22 Page 79 of 133

The Claimants have computed their damage claim using only ex ante information, i.e.,
information, including forecasts, available on the date of valuation to the exclusion of ex
post information, i.e., information available after the date of valuation and especially at
the time of the judgment or award. Both the Claimants’ expert and the Tribunal’s expert

concur with this approach, which the Tribunal will thus adopt.

2. Valuation

As described in the procedural history above, the Claimants based their compensation
claim on an expert report by Mr. Brent C. Kaczmarek. The Tribunal studied the
Kaczmarek Report and put numerous questions to its author during the Hearing on the
Merits. Having heard the Claimants’ expert, it determined that it would be assisted in its
assessment of the quantum by receiving evidence from an expert that it would appoint
itself. Following consultations with the Parties, the Tribunal appointed Mr. Thierry
Sénéchal to fulfill this role. On the basis of expert terms of reference, Mr. Sénéchal
prepared a report addressing 11 specific questions put to him by the Tribunal regarding
various aspects of the Kaczmarek Report. The Parties were given the opportunity to
comment on a draft as well as on the final version of the Sénéchal Report and to
examine Mr. Sénéchal in the course of a further hearing, at which the Tribunal put
questions to both Messrs. Sénéchal and Kaczmarek. As will be seen in greater detail
below, during this hearing Mr. Sénéchal identified two variables in Mr. Kaczmarek’s
valuation which he considered to require adjustment. Following the hearing, the
Tribunal instructed Mr. Sénéchal to verify the accuracy and consistency of the financial
model used by Mr. Kaczmarek and to prepare an alternative valuation of the Claimants’
investment, changing the two variables which he had identified at the hearing.
Mr. Sénéchal submitted a Supplementary Report presenting his alternative valuation,
on which the Parties were given an opportunity to comment. After studying his
Supplementary Report, the Tribunal asked Mr. Sénéchal to implement further specific
assumptions in his valuation, which he did in a Second Supplementary Report, on
which the Parties were invited to comment. Only the Claimants availed themselves of

the opportunity to comment on Mr. Sénéchal’s reports and to examine him orally.

As will be seen below, the Claimants’ and the Tribunal’s experts concur on many
aspects of the valuation and disagree about a few issues. In discharge of its duty to
satisfy itself that the claims before it are well founded, the Tribunal will examine all of
the aspects of the quantum and form its own view on the value of the Claimants’
investment. This being so, it will give particular attention to the matters on which the

experts diverge. To this end, the Tribunal will first describe Mr. Kaczmarek’s valuation

(a), then turn to Mr. Sénéchal’s views (b) and to the Claimants’ comments on the

latter (c), before reaching its own analysis (d).

(a) Mr. Kaczmarek’s valuation

Mr. Kaczmarek defined the subject-matter of the valuation as the enterprise value of
the Claimants’ network of 31 petrol stations and two storage facilities located in the
Crimean Peninsula.?°° To value these assets as of 22 April 2014, Mr. Kaczmarek
employed two methods: (i) the discounted cash flow (“DCF”) approach; and (ii) the
comparable publicly traded company (“CPTC”) approach.23” The values reached under
the two approaches were then weighted based on the relative quality of the data
available to execute each approach. 7% Additionally, Mr. Kaczmarek valued a

residential apartment owned by Stabil LLC.22°

i. Discounted cash flow (DCF) approach

According to the Claimants, investment tribunals recognize the DCF approach as a
valid methodology to calculate the market value of companies able to generate future
revenue.24° Mr. Kaczmarek describes the DCF approach as a “practical implementation
of the theoretical financial concept that an income-producing asset's value is equal to
the present value of the future cash flows produced by the asset.”24" In implementing
this approach, the “valuation practitioner first creates a projection of the expected future
performance of the business that is to be valued. Then, using the projected
performance, the practitioner calculates the relevant cash flows, determines an
appropriate discount rate, and discounts the future cash flows to present value.”242

In implementation of the DCF method, Mr. Kaczmarek projected free cash flows for
2014 to 2018 by relying on historical data regarding the performance of the Claimants’

Crimean petrol stations and storage facilities for 2008 to 2013, adjusted for their new
circumstances and outlook following the Incorporation.243

As the Claimants’ own financial records could no longer be accessed after the seizure
of the headquarters in Feodosia, Mr. Kaczmarek recreated financial statements for the
Claimants based on daily financial and operational information from 2008 to 2013
contemporaneously submitted by them to Avanta-S LLC, a centralized service
company based in Dnipropetrovsk that tracked market data and set up pricing

strategies for the Claimants.244

With respect to the revenue component of the cash flow projections for the petrol
stations, Mr. Kaczmarek relied on historical volumes of fuel sold and prices at each of
the petrol stations.”4° To project these figures over the five-year forecast period from
2014 to 2018, he used forecasts of oil prices and Russian petroleum consumption as of
22 April 2014.24° Mr. Kaczmarek carried out an ex ante valuation in that he made
assumptions on the basis of the reasonable expectations of a hypothetical buyer and
seller on 22 April 2014, eschewing ex post information.4” For the forecast of petrol
consumption in Russia, Mr. Kaczmarek relied on the growth projections of the
Economist Intelligence Unit for 2014 to 2018.8 For his forecast of retail fuel prices, he
relied on Brent futures prices.*° As a result, he found that, but for the Respondent's
measures, the volume of fuel sales at the Claimants’ petrol stations would have
increased from 2014 to 2018,2©° while the average fuel prices at the Claimants’ petrol

stations would have slightly decreased during the same period."

Additionally, Mr. Kaczmarek assumed that in 2014 the Claimants would have

renovated 19 out of their 31 Crimean petrol stations. He based this assumption on

renovation plans prepared by the Claimants between November 2013 and January
2014, 252 which he describes as including “(1) the replacement of fuel pumps with
modernized, faster pumps, which would allow the stations to more efficiently serve
customers, (2) the replacement and repair of fuel tanks, (3) the replacement and
improvement of road surfaces, (4) the repair of canopies and operator rooms, and
(5) the replacement of price and advertisement pylons.” 25% According to
Mr. Kaczmarek, the renovations would first have reduced sales volumes by 30% in
2014 and 10% in 2015 (during renovations) and then produced a one-time increase in
sales volumes by “an average of approximately 150% [...] in 2015."254

Further, Mr. Kaczmarek included in his cash flow computations projected revenues
from sales of goods at the convenience stores attached to the petrol stations,°° stating
that these would also have increased as a result of the planned renovations.°° Taking
these factors into consideration, Mr. Kaczmarek projected that the Claimants would
have earned revenues of US$ 29.8 million in 2014, increasing to US$ 56.6 million in
2018.57

Mr. Kaczmarek calculated the revenue component for the storage facilities based on
storage volumes in 2012-2013, projected over the five-year forecast period using the
expected increase in Russian petroleum consumption, and a storage fee equal to 1.5%
of the wholesale price of petrol.25°

With respect to the costs component of the cash flow projections, Mr. Kaczmarek
analyzed historical costs of procurement of fuel and related goods, as well as of station
operations, depreciation, and taxes. 75° He benchmarked fuel procurement costs
against Russian industry data to confirm reasonableness. 7° In summary,
Mr. Kaczmarek found that the Claimants would have incurred costs ranging from

US$ 28.8 million in 2014 to US$ 54.5 million in 2018 for the petrol stations and
US$ 550,145 in 2014 to US$ 566,806 in 2018 for the storage facilities.25"

In connection with the capital expenditures component of the cash flow projections,
Mr. Kaczmarek projected that the planned renovations would have required

investments amounting to US$ 1.9 million.252

As the final component of the cash flow projections, Mr. Kaczmarek calculated the
change in the net working capital of the Claimants’ Crimean petrol stations and storage

facilities. 26°

On the basis of the components just referred to, Mr. Kaczmarek forecast the free cash
flows of the petrol stations as negative US$ 202,591 for 2014, reflecting the reduction
in operations due to renovations, US$ 1.4 million in 2015, and approximately US$ 2.4
to 2.6 million from 2016 to 2018.74 He also forecast the free cash flows of the storage
facilities as decreasing from US$ 175,000 to US$ 115,000 from 2014 to 2018.76

After determining the projected cash flows for 2014 to 2018, Mr. Kaczmarek discounted
these cash flows back to the valuation date of 22 April 2014.76 As discount rate, he
adopted the weighted average cost of capital ("“WWACC’”), i.e., the weighted average of

the cost of equity and debt used or contemplated to finance the business.26”

In this context, Mr. Kaczmarek assumed an optimal capital structure, based on the
average capital structure of two comparable companies (described at paragraph 293
below), further averaged with the capital structure of the automotive retail industry in
Europe.268

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-1 Filed 04/09/22 Page 84 of 133

. The cost of equity was estimated by applying the capital asset pricing model (the

“CAPM”), captured by the following formula:
CAPM = Rf + B * EMRP + CRP
Where:

Rf = Risk Free Rate of Return
B = Beta
EMRP = Equity Market Risk Premium

CRP = Country Risk Premium26?

. For purposes of this formula, Mr. Kaczmarek estimated the risk free return rate using

the ten-year trailing average of the 20-year U.S. Treasury bond yield as of
22 April 2014, which amounted to 4.09%.?7°

For the beta, which is another element in the CAPM formula measuring the systematic
risk or volatility of an asset as compared to the market as a whole, Mr. Kaczmarek
relied on the betas of the same two companies used to assess the optimal capital
structure, as well as on the index for the European automotive retail industry, arriving at

an unlevered beta for the Claimants of 0.56.27!

Mr. Kaczmarek further adopted an equity risk premium of 5.5% and a country risk for
Russia of 2%, arriving at a nominal cost of equity of 11.32%.’ With respect to the
country risk, Mr. Kaczmarek stated that the primary risk factors to be considered in a
“valuation analysis in the context of an arbitral proceedings such as this are currency
risk, macroeconomic risks, and social risks,” while “the level of legal risk, regulatory
risk, and political risk [...] should be excluded because these risks are controlled by the

state (and arguably protected against under the BIT).”273

The Claimants’ expert further assumed that the Petrol Companies’ cost of debt would
“be equal to the weighted average interest rate on US dollar denominated loans to
nonfinancial organizations with terms of more than 3 years extended in Russia,”
arriving at an after-tax cost of debt of 4.34% and an overall cost of capital (WACC) of
8.06%.274

Finally, in considering the Claimants’ investment as a going concern, Mr. Kaczmarek
opined that the DCF method should consider cash flows projected beyond the five-year
period.275 However, as he deemed it “not practical to create cash flow projections over
long periods of time,” he used a constant growth method, called the “terminal value” or
“continuing value” to determine the value of the Claimants’ petrol stations and storage
facilities beyond 2018.276 He explained that through this method, the cash flow from
2018, i.e., the final year of projection, “is adjusted by an expected long-term growth rate
for the company and then capitalized by dividing the adjusted cash flow by the
difference between the WACC and the same long-term growth rate.”2”7 Mr. Kaczmarek
assumed a growth rate of 3.02%, equal to the sum of expected U.S. inflation in 2018
(1.98%) and 50% of the estimated growth in Russian petrol consumption in the same
year (2.09% divided by two, which equals 1.04%).278

Taking into account the projected cash flows for the petrol stations and storage
facilities in 2018 of US$ 2,507,711 and US$ 116,086, respectively, the WACC of
8.06%, and the projected growth rate of 3.02%, Mr. Kaczmarek determined the total
undiscounted terminal value to be US$ 53,629,647. 2° After discounting,
Mr. Kaczmarek concluded that on 22 April 2014 the total fair market value of the
Claimants’ Crimean petrol stations and_ storage facilities amounted to
US$ 46,340,006.78°

ii. Comparable publicly traded company (CPTC) approach

Mr. Kaczmarek also employed the CPTC approach, a process by which the fair market
value of a company is determined by reference to the value of the shares of

comparable companies traded on a public exchange.”8"

As comparables, Mr. Kaczmarek identified two companies: OJSC Concern Galnaftogaz
(“Galnaftogaz”), which is based in Ukraine and “is one of the leaders of Ukraine's petrol
retail industry,” and Petrol d.d. Ljubljana (“Petrol Ljubljana”), which is based in Slovenia
and is “a principal strategic supplier of oil and energy products to the Slovenian
market.”282 He then computed a weighted average enterprise value to earnings before
interest, taxes and depreciation (EV/EBITDA) multiple of 12.2x for the comparable set
(giving 75% value to the 13.2 EV/EBITDA multiple of Galnaftogaz and a 25% value to
the 9.3 multiple of Petrol Ljubljana), and used the Petrol Companies’ EBITDA from
2014 to 2018 to calculate an implied enterprise value of the Claimants’ Crimean
business of US$ 53,207,543 million on 22 April 2014.28

iii. | Weighting of the DCF and CPTC approaches

To combine the two approaches, Mr. Kaczmarek assigned 85% to the DCF approach
and 15% to the CPTC approach, based on his “assessment of the relative quality and
reliability of the information available to implement each approach.”2* Accordingly, the
Claimants’ network of 31 petrol stations and two storage facilities located in the
Crimean Peninsula was valued at US$ 47,370,137.28

iv.  Stabil LLC’s residential apartment

Mr. Kaczmarek separately valued a residential apartment owned by Stabil LLC located
at 20 Marka Donskogo Street in Simferopol. As the apartment was not related to the
Claimants’ petroleum business, Mr. Kaczmarek considered that its value was not
captured by the DCF and CPTC analyses described above. Mr. Kaczmarek valued the

apartment by considering the listing prices in December 2015 of two other apartments

located on the same street in Simferopol. From these listing prices, he derived an
estimated price per square meter (US$ 963), which he applied to the surface area of
Stabil LLC’s apartment (37.7 m2), arriving at a value of US$ 36,318.86

v. Allocation of damages between the Claimants

In order to allocate the value of the expropriated investment between the Claimants,
Mr. Kaczmarek first broke down the total enterprise value of the Claimants’ network of
31 petrol stations and two storage facilities (US$ 47,370,137, as seen at paragraph 294
above) among the Petrol Station Owners, the Storage Facility Owners, and the Petrol

Station Lessees.?®”

Mr. Kaczmarek explained that, in practice, the 31 petrol stations and the two storage
facilities were operated in an integrated manner, such that costs came out of an overall
budget and the Storage Facility Owners and the Petrol Station Lessees did not pay
fees to the Petrol Station Owners.288 Nevertheless, in order to allocate the enterprise
value between the Claimants, under the DCF approach, Mr. Kaczmarek estimated that
the enterprise value of the Petrol Station Owners amounted to their expected income
stream under the leases with the Petrol Station Lessees, discounted to the valuation
date of 22 April 2014.28° The expected income stream under the leases was based on
the lease agreements of two petrol stations, as the other available lease agreements
either did not specify a rental fee or pertained to petrol stations that were not fully
operative.2°° The enterprise value of the Storage Facility Owners was based on the
implementation of the DCF method as described at paragraphs above. 2°! The
enterprise value of the Petrol Station Lessees was taken to equal the total enterprise
value minus the enterprise values of the Petrol Station Owners and the Storage Facility

Owners. 782 Under the CPTC approach, the total enterprise value was allocated

(b) Mr. Sénéchal’s views

In many respects, Mr. Sénéchal agreed with the valuation of Mr. Kaczmarek. Where
relevant, the Tribunal takes note of specific areas of agreement in its analysis below. In
the present section, however, it focuses on areas where Mr. Sénéchal raised doubts
and criticisms.

In his first report, Mr. Sénéchal raised four main issues. First, he drew the attention of
the Tribunal to the importance of the selection of the benchmark market in the
implementation of the DCF analysis. Observing that Mr. Kaczmarek had used Russia
as the benchmark for his forecasts and risk assessments, Mr. Sénéchal noted that
another option would have been to use the Ukrainian market for this purpose, given
that, from an economic point of view, “the Crimean economy was very dependent on
the Ukrainian economy before the annexation.” °° Mr. Sénéchal explained that, if
Ukraine were chosen as the benchmark market, this would significantly affect
numerous parameters of the DCF analysis, such as projected petrol consumption and
country risk.29” For example, whereas Russia’s country risk is in the vicinity of 2%, the
country risk for Ukraine is approximately 8.8%, calculated on the basis of credit default
swaps (“CDS”) spreads.298

Second, Mr. Sénéchal opined that, even for the Russian market, Mr. Kaczmarek’s
revenue projections in the DCF analysis were overstated. In Mr. Sénéchal’s view,
Mr. Kaczmarek had not fully taken into account the uncertainty of both the

macroeconomic and political environment at the time of the valuation.7°° Relying on

Claimants’ Letter dated 7 March 2018, § 3. See also Kaczmarek Report, Appendix 6.A.

historical trends in GDP and income per capita, Mr. Sénéchal observed that Russia
was undergoing a structural crisis.2°° Deteriorating market conditions “would be a major
constraint on the steady growth potential of the petrol distribution and retail market.”2°"
More specifically, Mr. Sénéchal relied on UN statistics to opine that Mr. Kaczmarek had
overstated his projections for Russian petrol consumption from 2014 to 2018. %
Mr. Sénéchal also considered that there was a high risk of overstatement with respect
to the planned renovation of the petrol stations. In his view, there was insufficient
evidence to conclude that the renovations would have been implemented and, if
implemented, would have generated the revenues projected by Mr. Kaczmarek.3% In
addition, Mr. Sénéchal considered that the political and social conditions in Crimea in
early 2014 would have heightened the risk perception of a hypothetical buyer at that

time.9%4

Third, Mr. Sénéchal expressed the view that Mr. Kaczmarek’s proposed growth rate of
3.02% used to calculate the terminal value in the DCF analysis was unreasonably high
in light of prevailing macroeconomic conditions and data on historical petrol
consumption in Russia.2°° He suggested that a growth rate based solely on the U.S.

inflation rate of 1.98% may be more appropriate.2°°

Fourth and finally, Mr. Sénéchal agreed with Mr. Kaczmarek that, in an ex ante
valuation of an investment at a historical date, such as this one, it would not be
appropriate to use ex post data.°°” However, Mr. Sénéchal suggested that, in situations
of high uncertainty and volatility, a scenario-based DCF valuation should be preferred
over “a single-path model [...] likely to be proven wrong in hindsight.”*°8 For example, a
scenario-based model could anticipate the likelihood of various events occurring, such
as a sharp fall in oil prices.2°° Mr. Sénéchal noted that, while Mr. Kaczmarek’s indexing

using historical data available on 22 April 2014 “predicted a stability in the forecast,

with only a slight increase in the oil price over the period 2014 to 2018,” in fact “oil
prices changed radically after the annexation of Crimea, with major market corrections
in mid-2014 and oil prices falling from USD100 to below USD50.”312

Nevertheless, at the hearing, Mr. Sénéchal did not insist on a scenario-based DCF
approach and testified that Mr. Kaczmarek’s forecast of oil prices reflected “market
expectations”. °"1 Mr. Sénéchal also stated that his concerns regarding
Mr. Kaczmarek’s DCF analysis would be addressed by adjusting two variables, namely
the revenue expected to be generated from the renovation of the petrol stations and
the growth rate used in the calculation of the terminal value. His views as they emerged

at the hearing were summarized in the following exchange with the Presiding Arbitrator:

PRESIDENT KAUFMANN-KOHLER: [...] With respect to Date of Valuation and
Reference Market, you say these are legal questions, but at the same time you
say that if we take a Date of Valuation of 224 of April, it would be correct

economically to take the Russian market as a reference?
THE WITNESS: Yes.

PRESIDENT KAUFMANN-KOHLER: Is that right?

THE WITNESS: Yeah.

PRESIDENT KAUFMANN-KOHLER: Then you say that the cash flows must be
adjusted, and you say what needs to be adjusted is the renovation income, and

the long-term growth rate in the Terminal Value.
THE WITNESS: Correct.

PRESIDENT KAUFMANN-KOHLER: And you do not say any more that the petrol
consumption prices need to be adjusted, or value — or volume. It’s volume and

prices; yes?

THE WITNESS: Correct.

PRESIDENT KAUFMANN-KOHLER: That is right [?]
THE WITNESS: Yeah.

PRESIDENT KAUFMANN-KOHLER: And | also understand that, in terms of the
Discount Rate, you consider that the Country Risk Premiums that are put forward
by Mr. Kaczmarek, be it 2 percent for Russia or 8 or 8.8 — now | don’t remember

— for Ukraine are correct.

THE WITNESS: | think Mr. Kaczmarek has been only proposing a Discount Rate

THE WITNESS: The Ukrainian example was coming from myself.

PRESIDENT KAUFMANN-KOHLER: Was yours, yeah, thank you. But you have
no issue with the Russian Country Risk Premium as put forward by Mr.

Kaczmarek; is that right?
THE WITNESS: Yeah, that’s completely right. Yeah.

beyond that, there is no adjustments to be made to the Cost of Capital because

THE WITNESS: The Cost of Capital, altogether with the Country Risk Premium of

2 percent is fine.

just one follow-up question — that summarizes your evidence, or do | miss

something?

THE WITNESS: No, | think you didn’t miss anything. | think that’s correct,
yeah.312

307. After the hearing, upon the request of the Tribunal, Mr. Sénéchal further addressed the

312

issues of the renovations and terminal growth rate in his Supplementary Report. In this
report, Mr. Sénéchal confirmed his prior assessment that Mr. Kaczmarek had
overstated the revenues that would have been generated by the renovations. He
observed that, in Mr. Kaczmarek’s valuation, the impact of the renovations was to

increase the enterprise value by US$ 19.4 million.*'° For many petrol stations, the
growth rates in fuel sales fluctuated between 120% and 200%, while for some stations,
these rates were significantly higher.**4 For example, according to Mr. Kaczmarek, the
fuel sales at Stabil Station #30 would rise by 697% between 2013 and 2015, as a result
of a capital expenditure of only US$ 140,000, leading to an annual return on investment
of 751%.%'5 Even more drastically, the convenience store sales for different petrol
stations displayed growth rates from 2013 to 2015 in the range of 1,740% and
81,582%.2"6

. For Mr. Sénéchal, such growth was unsupported by economic logic or evidence for a
number of reasons. First, Mr. Sénéchal explained that he would not expect such growth
to arise from the type of renovations planned, which he assimilated to “maintenance
operations (replacement of equipment) and some refurbishment,” as opposed to
“strategic investment plans aimed at differentiating the cross-selling offer and
maximizing sales by unusually high multiples.”"7 Second, given that the petrol stations
were “operating in a period of economic uncertainty in early 2014,” characterized by an
“economic downturn and market vulnerabilities, as well as lower growth expectations
and depressed demand,” he found that the high growth rate proposed by
Mr. Kaczmarek would require a fuller explanation.*"® Third, Mr. Sénéchal noted that
exhibit NAV-141, a document submitted by the Claimants summarizing the actual
growth in fuel sales that arose from the renovation of a number of petrol stations in
mainland Ukraine in 2014 showed an average growth of only 167%. Fourth,
Mr. Sénéchal considered that there was little evidence of such fast growth in the
Claimants’ historical operational data for 2011, 2012, and 2013. *19 Finally,
Mr. Sénéchal indicated that Mr. Kaczmarek’s financial models referred to embedded

constants, which did not always have a clear audit trail and seemed arbitrarily set.°2°

. In view of these criticisms, Mr. Sénéchal proposed to modify Mr. Kaczmarek’s analysis

by deriving a market proxy based on the available information. In particular,

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-1 Filed 04/09/22 Page 94 of 133

Mr. Sénéchal proposed to take the average of Mr. Kaczmarek’s estimates for the
impact of planned renovations on the Claimants’ business, as well as on Ukrnafta’s
business in PCA Case No. 2015-34, and the 167% growth rate derived from the
renovation program in mainland Ukraine that had actually been realized. By averaging
these data points, Mr. Sénéchal arrived at a growth rate of 216%, which he applied to
estimate the fuel sales volumes for 16 of the 19 petrol stations to be renovated.22" With
respect to the other three petrol stations, which were inoperative before the
Incorporation, Mr.Sénéchal did not propose to make any adjustments to
Mr. Kaczmarek’s revenue estimates.222 Mr. Sénéchal further favored applying the same
growth rate of 216% to the sales of the convenience stores, in particular because the
planned renovations did not include the construction of any additional revenue-
generating facilities.223

. Upon the Tribunal’s request, Mr. Sénéchal also carried out a further valuation of the
Claimants’ petrol stations and storage facilities in his Second Supplementary Report,
assuming a growth rate in fuel and convenience store sales resulting from renovations
of 167% (which, as noted above, reflects the growth rate set out in exhibit NAV-141
derived from the renovation program in mainland Ukraine that had actually been

realized).54

. With respect to the second adjustment to Mr. Kaczmarek’s analysis which
Mr. Sénéchal proposed, i.e., the adjustment of the growth rate used in the calculation
of the terminal value, Mr. Sénéchal reiterated in his Supplementary Report that
Mr. Kaczmarek’s use of 3.02% did “not seem to reflect the deteriorating
macroeconomic conditions in the pre-annexation period,” including the “falling GDP in
Russia and Ukraine, a protracted economic downturn in Ukraine, and structural crisis in
Russia.” $2 Accordingly, Mr. Sénéchal considered it “important to recognize that
the terminal value has risk and that the businesses may never actually achieve the
expected performance, due to economic vulnerabilities and regional economic
volatility.” °° Noting that Mr. Kaczmarek had based his proposed growth rate on
the U.S. inflation rate and growth in Russian petrol consumption in 2018, Mr. Sénéchal

asserted that “the year 2018 cannot be expected to serve as a stable benchmark for
the cash flow to grow at a constant rate over the future, due to the many uncertainties
in the regional economy.”*2” Accordingly, Mr. Sénéchal favored using averages from
2014 to 2018 in order to establish the growth rate to be used in the terminal value. On
this basis, he arrived at a growth rate of 2.62%, comprised of half of the average
change in Russian gasoline consumption from 2014-2018 (1.73% divided by 2) plus

the average U.S. inflation rate for the same period (1.76%).°8

314. The Claimants submit that Mr. Sénéchal’s adjustments to Mr. Kaczmarek’s valuation
entail the risk that the Claimants would not be compensated adequately. They also
argue that the Tribunal’s expert’s criticisms “lack any evidentiary support and are

incorrect.”$32

315. In respect of the growth rate of the terminal value, the Claimants criticize Mr.
Sénéchal’s use of the averages from 2014 to 2018 in respect of the U.S. inflation rate
and petrol consumption**? as inconsistent with the testimony of both quantum experts
regarding the correct methodology for calculating the terminal value, according to

which the terminal value must be calculated on the basis of the cash flows in the last

330 The changes proposed by Mr. Sénéchal to Mr. Kaczmarek’s DCF analysis had an impact on the
Claimants’ average EBITDA for 2014-2018, which required a corresponding adjustment in the
CPTC model. Sénéchal Supplementary Report, § 47.

year of the projection.**4 The Claimants also point out that, in line with Mr. Sénéchal’s
own evidence, the growth rate is supposed to reflect a “constant average compounded
rate of growth in perpetuity,” while asserting that in this instance projected cash flows
are not constant before 2018, primarily as a result of the renovations, which depress

revenues in 2014 and increase them rapidly in 2015.%°

Further, the Claimants argue that the unusually low U.S. inflation rates for 2014 to 2018
used by Mr. Sénéchal are inconsistent with both historical and projected long-term
rates, which all point to a normal inflation rate of 2%. Historical data are available from
the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations, the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics and the U.S. Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve also projects the long-
term inflation rate at 2%.°°°

The Claimants further submit that Mr. Sénéchal’s petrol consumption growth rates are
unsupported by the data. In this respect, they first assert that Mr. Sénéchal
acknowledged that the petrol consumption growth rate on which Mr. Kaczmarek relied
(2.08%) was consistent with pre-Incorporation data, from which Mr. Sénéchal derived a
2.31% growth rate between 2011 and 2013.%%7 The Claimants add that if data for 2010

were included, the historical average would be lifted to 3.37%.°%8

The Claimants further contend that the economic uncertainty to which Mr. Sénéchal
refers does not justify his downward adjustment of the growth rate. For the Claimants,
“volatility and growth are not mutually exclusive,” as demonstrated by the 2010-2013
historical data, which shows not only overall growth but also volatility, with jumps from
6.57% in 2010, to 1.29% in 2011, to 3.84% in 2012, and 1.79% in 2013. °° Still
according to the Claimants, the poor pre-Incorporation market conditions to which Mr.
Sénéchal refers are “already internalized in the inputs taken from reliable third-party
and market participants” that Mr. Kaczmarek used in his cash flow projection.*4° To the

extent that the growth rate must be reduced to account for uncertainties, the Claimants

submit that Mr. Kaczmarek has already done that by taking only 50% of the estimated
growth rate in Russian petrol consumption in 2018.34

. Finally with respect to the growth rate, the Claimants submit that Mr. Sénéchal’s
adjustment is “not based on the scientific approach,” as he is guided only by his
“overall assessment of the general economic conditions.”*42 For the Claimants, the fact
that Mr. Sénéchal changed his views between the hearing of 20 August 2018, when he
asserted that the growth rate should be the U.S. inflation rate of 1.98%, and his
Supplementary Report, where he proposed a growth rate of 2.62%, shows that his
opinion lacks a firm basis.*4?

. With respect to the renovations, the Claimants dispute Mr. Sénéchal’s assessments
that it cannot be satisfactorily concluded that (i) the renovation plans would have been
implemented and that (ii) they would have led to the forecast revenues.*44

. With respect to the first assessment, the Claimants submit that they only need to
establish that it was probable that the renovations would have been realized,245 which
they have done by demonstrating that they had plans to carry out renovations in 2014

and had already carried out such renovations in the past.*4°

. In relation to Mr. Sénéchal’s second assessment, the Claimants assert that the
evidence shows that “revenues/profits can be increased by improving the provision of
the core, existing services of selling petrol and related goods.”*4” They point out that
during the hearing of 20 August 2018, Mr. Sénéchal recognized that the renovations

“produced ‘a big impact on sales’.”*48 To this, the Claimants add that Mr. Sénéchal’s

belief that economic conditions would have dampened the revenue increase arising

from the renovations is unsupported by evidence.*42

Moreover, the Claimants stress that the “evidence supports the forecast increase in
revenues and profits after renovations.”©° According to the Claimants, Mr. Sénéchal
himself acknowledged “evidence on the positive impact of renovation plans on fuel

sales,” with an average increase of 67%.°*

The Claimants emphasize that the renovation plans incorporated into Mr. Kaczmarek’s
financial model should be taken on a station-to-station basis.°°? The Claimants illustrate
this on a micro and macro level.

At a micro level, the Claimants stress that the “renovation plans were for specific
‘stations [...] [involving] specific amounts [...] different for each station, [resulting in
different and specific effects for each station]’.”°°* The Claimants thus identify two
petrol stations at which Mr. Kaczmarek’s projected sales volumes post-renovation did
not exceed their sales volumes pre-renovation. 34 While acknowledging that other
stations’ projected post-renovation revenues did exceed their revenues pre-renovation,
“sometimes by many times,” the Claimants argue that this was because, in some
cases, pre-renovation revenues were negligible and, for the three inoperative stations,
non-existent. #55 The Claimants add that Mr. Sénéchal’s assumption that the same
growth rate would apply for petrol and convenience store sales also leads to
unrealistically low convenience store revenue forecasts, particularly for stations with a
“low or non-existent base.”35°

At the macro level, the Claimants assert that, from 2014 to 2015, the renovations
raised Mr. Kaczmarek’s volume forecasts by 41%, *5” a conservative increase
compared to that of 67% experienced for the mainland stations.*** The Claimants note
that, while Mr. Sénéchal’s proposed overall volume increase (of 116%) is greater than
Mr. Kaczmarek’s (of 41%), his final valuation is less than Mr. Kaczmarek’s, due to the
difference in volumes of fuel sold at the different stations.°°°

(d) Analysis

In this Section, the Tribunal addresses the selection and weighting of the valuation
methods (i); the DCF approach (ii); the CPTC approach (iii); the claim for the value of

Stabil LLC’s residential apartment (iv); and, finally, its conclusion (v).

i. Selection and weighting of the valuation methods

Mr. Kaczmarek employed two valuation methods, the DCF approach and the CPTC

approach, assigning a weight of 85% to the former and 15% to the latter.°°°

The Tribunal considers that this overall approach is appropriate. Both the DCF and the
CPTC methodologies are frequently used for the valuation of income-producing assets
in investor-State arbitration.*6' Here, the historical data for the years 2008 to 2013
show that the Claimants’ Crimean petrol stations had a track record of profitability,°62

with the result that a valuation applied to income-producing assets is appropriate.

The weight assigned to each approach is based on Mr. Kaczmarek’s assessment of
the quality and reliability of the evidence available to implement each valuation
method.*® At the Hearing on the Merits, Mr. Kaczmarek explained that greater weight

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-1 Filed 04/09/22 Page 101 of 133

is given to the DCF approach due to the high level of “granularity” in the data used to
construct the DCF model.%®4 For the CPTC approach, the expert acknowledged some
“hesitation” due to the gap between the EV/EBITDA multiples for the two comparable
companies, which was larger than what one might find in other valuations.** In spite of
this hesitation, Mr. Kaczmarek maintained that the CPTC approach was reliable and
that, “more evidence of value [being] always better,” the CPTC approach should not be

discarded.*°

Importantly, the Tribunal-appointed expert shared this assessment. Although he
suggested improvements to the CPTC approach (see paragraph 381 below), in answer
to a question from the Tribunal at the hearing of 20 August 2018, Mr. Sénéchal
confirmed that the CPTC approach should not be rejected.26”

In view of this evidence, the Tribunal will combine the DCF and CPTC approaches in

the proportions used by the experts, i.e., 85% for the former and 15% for the latter.

ii. Discounted cash flow (DCF) approach
(a) Available evidence

As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal is mindful that the DCF approach requires the use
of data about the past operations of the Claimants’ petrol stations and that some of the
relevant documentation is lacking. Mr. Laber testified that documents such as originals
and copies of invoices, as well as original title documents, were left behind when the
Respondent took over the Claimants’ headquarters in Feodosia on 22 April 2014.36
The Tribunal has no reason to doubt Mr. Laber’s testimony, the lack of access to
documents appearing as a natural consequence of the loss of control over the
operations. For purposes of quantification of damages, what matters in situations such
as this one is that the damage be substantiated by other credible means, which is the

case here.

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-1 Filed 04/09/22 Page 102 of 133

In the absence of the documents left on the Feodosia premises, the Claimants
collected financial and operational information which they had previously submitted to
Avanta-S LLC, the group’s centralized service company which tracked market data and
set up pricing strategies for the Claimants.*°° On the basis of this information and the
summaries drawn up by the Claimants, Mr. Kaczmarek re-created final statements for

the petrol stations.37°

For the following reasons, the Tribunal considers that these re-created financial
statements are sufficient to meet the Claimants’ burden of proof in respect of the past

operations of their investment in the Crimean Peninsula.

The information collated by Avanta-S LLC is very detailed?”' and was provided in the
normal course of operations;%”? it represents contemporaneous evidence as opposed
to data prepared for litigation purposes. Although Avanta-S LLC summarized the
existing information for these proceedings and the experts have not reviewed the
underlying documentation, there is no indication on record casting doubt on the
reliability of the information provided. To the contrary, Mr. Kaczmarek testified that he
had reviewed this information at a high level without finding anything “surprising” or
“suspicious”. °73 Similarly, while in his first report Mr. Sénéchal stated that the
unavailability of the underlying data created a risk of overstatement,?”4 he confirmed at
the Hearing on the Merits that, upon examining the information, he had no “particular
reason” to believe that the re-created financial statements were overstated or
inaccurate.*’> Mr. Laber also testified that Avanta-S LLC had verified the information

against bank statements.%76

(b) Benchmark market

A number of variables in the DCF analysis such as forecasts of petrol consumption or
country risk must be determined by reference to a benchmark market. This raises a
difficulty in the present case, as the DCF analysis is carried out in a peculiar situation
where the enterprise to be valued operated in one State, Ukraine, until close to the
valuation date and then shortly before that date found itself operating on territory over

which another State, the Russian Federation, exercised de facto control.

Under these unusual circumstances, one could ask whether the most accurate
valuation of the Claimants’ investment should not use exclusively regional or
subnational data, i.e., Crimean data. This is so because — as Mr. Sénéchal testified —
the “intrinsic value of the assets is derived from where they are located,” °77 which, in
this case, is the Crimean Peninsula. Be this as it may, the experts concur that no

reliable information exists for Crimea as a subnational market.°”

As indicated by Mr. Sénéchal at the hearing of 20 August 2018, where the relevant
market information is not available at the subnational level, a relevant proxy must be

chosen, in this case, Russia or Ukraine.37°

While Mr. Kaczmarek selected Russia as the benchmark market, Mr. Sénéchal in his
first report indicated that Ukraine might also be relevant, as “the Crimean economy was
very dependent on the Ukrainian economy before the annexation.” *®° In the same
report, Mr. Sénéchal also explained that the choice of the benchmark market would
depend on the Tribunal’s determination of the valuation date, with the consequence

that a valuation done after the Incorporation must use Russian parameters:

lf we assume valuation is based on assets still operated under Ukrainian
sovereignty immediately before annexation, key valuation parameters would
need to be changed to measure risk, which would be done from a Ukrainian
perspective and not the Russian perspective suggested by Mr. Kaczmarek. On
the other hand, if it is assumed claimants’ assets were de facto under the

responsibility of Russia at the date of valuation [used by Mr. Kaczmarek] (22 April

2014) because Russia had ratified on 21 March 2014 the legislation that formally
incorporated Crimea as a subject of the Russian Federation in accordance with
the Russian Constitution, then the cash flow forecast could be done from a

Russian market perspective.°8"

341. At the hearing of 20 August 2018, Mr. Sénéchal restated the pivotal role of the timing of
the valuation for the selection of the relevant data, i.e., Ukrainian data prior to the

Incorporation and Russian data thereafter:

If you assume that on 22 April the assets are located on the Russian territory, |
think you have to base your assumption on the Russian market, and | think the

Russian market in that sense is the right approach; right?

To put it differently, if you would say we need to do the value or what is a value of
the assets for a marginal investor just before the annexation, that would be a
different answer than | would have because, here, | would be looking at the
assets still located in Ukraine with no annexation taking place or — the risk of
annexation that would be looming, but there is no annexation yet being done.382

342. Mr. Sénéchal re-iterated on other occasions during the hearing that the Russian market

is the appropriate benchmark for a valuation carried out as of 22 April 2014:

PRESIDENT KAUFMANN-KOHLER: [...] So, do | understand that you're really
connecting the date and the market? Do | understand that if we were to take as a
Date of Valuation the 22nd of April 2014, you would say, from an economic point
of view — not from a legal point of view — then that would mean that the Russian

market is the appropriate benchmark?

THE WITNESS: Yes, that’s correct. | think if you take the date of 22 April, you
would assume that the assets are located in Crimea, annexed by Russia, so you
don’t look at the incorporation, really, of the firm [...]. You would look at the
location of the assets; and, if you assume that the assets are located in Russia
on 22 — o[n] the Russian territory on 22 April, you would do that valuation

according to the Russian-market perspective.%8°

PRESIDENT KAUFMANN-KOHLER: [...] With respect to Date of Valuation and

 

Reference Market, you say these are legal questions, but at the same time you
say that if we take a Date of Valuation of 22 of April, it would be correct

economically to take the Russian market as a reference?
THE WITNESS: Yes.38

In the same vein, Mr. Sénéchal also indicated at the hearing that he would not
recommend relying on a combination of Ukrainian and Russian parameters. %8

Having regard to the conclusion reached above that 22 April 2014 was the date of
valuation as well as to the views of the quantum experts and particularly to the
evidence of its own expert, who opined that Russia would be the appropriate
benchmark for a valuation post-Incorporation, the Tribunal requested Mr. Sénéchal to
carry out an alternative valuation using 22 April 2014 as the valuation date and the

Russian market as the benchmark.%#6

The Tribunal is aware that the use of Russia as benchmark means that the Claimants’
investment increased in value as a result of the Incorporation. Until the Incorporation,
the investment’s growth expectations and risks were tied to the economic environment
of Ukraine; thereafter, they were linked to economic parameters prevailing in Russia.
As the latter were more favorable than the former, the value of assets located in

Crimea increased.

One could ask whether this increase represented an inadmissible windfall profit for the
Claimants. In the Tribunal’s opinion, it does not. The increase is merely a reflection of
the fair market value of the asset, as a buyer and seller would assess it at a given
location and at a given time. Both experts agreed that the valuation in such a case
reflects the outlook of a hypothetical willing seller and a hypothetical willing buyer on
the relevant date in light of the information available on that date.*8’ As of 22 April
2014, the hypothetical buyer and seller would have considered that the Claimants’

Crimean petrol stations and storage facilities would henceforth operate on territory

controlled by the Russian Federation, with a different outlook than before the
Incorporation.*88 As put by Mr. Sénéchal at the hearing, “risk perception of the asset
being Russian as compared to Ukrain[ian] changes everything because now you are
dealing with a marginal investor willing to take a Russian risk as compared to a
Ukrainian risk.”2°°

For these reasons, the Tribunal considers that the Russian market is the appropriate
benchmark for purposes of establishing the value of the investment.

(c) Effect of international sanctions

Having decided that Russia is the appropriate benchmark market, the Tribunal has also
considered whether international sanctions imposed on Russia following the
Incorporation affected the outlook in a manner that would impact the value of the
investment.

While certain sanctions were imposed before the valuation date, others only became
effective thereafter.2°° As the experts observed, only the reasonable expectations of
the hypothetical willing buyer and seller on the date of valuation are relevant. 391
Accordingly, a question may arise as to whether the later sanctions were reasonably
foreseeable on 22 April 2014. Ultimately, however, the Tribunal need not answer this
question, as there are other reasons why the sanctions must not be taken into account

in the present case.

First, the type of business at stake, which resembles a utility, shows little vulnerability

to sanctions. Or, in Mr. Sénéchal’s words at the hearing on 20 August 2018,

You are dealing with a commodity which should not be impacted too much by the
sanction[s] because of the nature of the products that you sell to a specific

market, so it’s like a utility. Even if you have sanction[s], people will need

electricity here, as we need petroleum, and | do not believe that the impact would
be too much related to a sanction for this type of business. 392

51. This explanation is consistent with the one given by Mr. Kaczmarek at the Hearing on
the Merits:

Whether [Crimea is] flying under the Russian or Ukrainian flag or they're debating
it, people are still going to work, they're still driving their cars, food supplies need
to be delivered. So, it’s more like a utility: You know, people are still going to
consume electricity regardless of the flag that the territory is flying under. Same
with gasoline. So, from a cash-flow perspective, it is kind of business as usual.293

352. Mr. Sénéchal also testified that, as “Russia is an oil-producing country, [...] you can
safely assume that, in terms of the supply of oil, you should not see disruption”
resulting from international sanctions.°%

353. Second, to the extent that sanctions had an impact on the economy in general with a
possible consequential effect on the Claimants’ business, such effect would already be
reflected in the valuation through the incorporation of parameters such as petrol
consumption forecasts.

354. Accordingly, there is no reason to adjust the valuation on the basis of international
sanctions against Russia.

(d) Free cash flow projections

355. By the end of the hearing of 20 August 2018, the experts agreed on all aspects of the
cash flow projections, with the exception of the revenues expected to be generated
from the renovation of 19 of the Claimants’ Crimean petrol stations. While Mr. Sénéchal
initially also questioned the oil prices and fuel sales volumes assumed by
Mr. Kaczmarek in light of prevailing macroeconomic conditions, he later clarified that

such concern would be fully addressed by an adjustment in respect of the impact of

renovations coupled with an adjustment to the growth factor in the calculation of the
terminal value (the latter as discussed at paragraph 389 and following below).295

The Tribunal has reviewed the cash flow projections presented irrespective of the
experts’ views. Subject to the impact of any renovation on the petrol stations’ revenues,
which is discussed below, it reached the conclusion that the projections were
reasonable. It is true that, after the Incorporation, the Claimants’ supply routes may
have been disrupted, as the Claimants used to rely on deliveries by truck and rail from
refineries in mainland Ukraine.3%° Yet, that disruption was unlikely to have a lasting
effect. Both experts confirmed that, but for the expropriation, the petrol stations could
have been expected to procure petrol and diesel from Russia by tanker across the Sea
of Azov, the Kerch Strait and the Black Sea.3°”

This being so, the Tribunal now turns to the impact of the petrol stations’ renovations,
the aspect of the cash flow projections on which the experts disagree. As noted above,
Mr. Kaczmarek assumed in his DCF model that 19 petrol stations would have been
renovated in 2014, resulting in increased revenue as of 2015. 3% Mr. Sénéchal
challenged this assumption, opining that there was insufficient evidence to conclude
that the renovations (i) would have been implemented, and (ii) if implemented, would
have generated the increase in revenue projected by Mr. Kaczmarek.*° It is true that in
his Supplementary Report, Mr. Sénéchal did not restate the first point (see
paragraph 368 below). Because it is not entirely clear that Mr. Sénéchal abandoned

that point, the Tribunal will review both his criticisms.

The two criticisms must be assessed based on the evidence and having regard to the
applicable standard, as set out in Chorz6w, according to which “reparation [...] must re-
establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not

been committed.”4°°

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-1 Filed 04/09/22 Page 109 of 133

With respect to the first issue raised by Mr. Sénéchal, /.e., whether the renovations
would have been implemented, the question is whether, on 22 April 2014, a
hypothetical willing seller and a hypothetical willing buyer would have valued the
Claimants’ petrol stations on the basis that 19 of these stations would be renovated in

2014. The Tribunal has before it both witness and documentary evidence in this regard.

In his written statement, Mr. Laber, who was responsible for managing all financial and
commercial aspects of the Claimants’ businesses, testified that the management had

approved the renovation of 19 stations to be performed in 2014:

Several of the new entrants into the Crimean market built new stations or
modernized old ones. To stay ahead of the competition, the [Claimants’]
management met on several occasions in 2013 and early 2014 to develop and
approve plans to renovate 19 of its 31 petrol stations in Crimea over the course of
2014.401

At the Hearing on the Merits, Mr. Laber further gave evidence that this type of
renovation was part of the normal course of business for the Claimants:

[We did these renovations every year. It was very typical for us to invest in our
properties, all over the country, so there was no reason for me not to invest in

Crimea.*°2

Mr. Laber’s testimony is supported by contemporaneous documents both in respect of
Ukrnafta’s general practice and the planned Crimean renovations. First, the Claimants
have submitted a presentation’ from late 2013 by Mr. Khabarov, head of Ukrnafta’s
Crimean regional sales department,‘ which illustrates the planned post-renovation
appearance of four of the 19 petrol stations that were to be renovated. 4° This

document also shows that certain renovation works, such as the repair of price pylons,

the replacement of windows and the painting of transmission poles, had already been
carried out at some of the Claimants’ petrol stations in Crimea.4°°

. As a second piece of contemporaneous evidence, the Claimants have submitted the
minutes of a meeting held by way of a conference call by Stabil LLC (and Ukrnafta)
managers on 20 January 2014, which records that it was “resolved to approve the list
proposed by branch office management of filling stations to be remodeled with the cost
for types of work.” That list includes the 19 stations identified by Mr. Kaczmarek, and
describes the specific works planned for each station. Thus, it was approved during the

conference call that the 19 stations would undergo “road surface replacements,

improvements,” “canopy repair,” “fagade (operator room) repair,” “repair (new layout)

inside operator room,” “complete replacement of price pylon, advertising,” and “design
and approval work,” while eight of the stations would also undergo “fuel pump
replacement, [and] technology replacement,” and five would also have their tanks
replaced.4°” Additionally, the minutes of the management meeting contain a detailed
record of the planned cost of each type of work for each station.*°® Mr. Laber explained
at the Hearing on the Merits that such meetings were held by conference call in order
to allow him to participate, as by 2013 he no longer lived in Crimea.*°° Indeed, there is
evidence on record of other management meetings being held by telephone

conference.*1°

. Third, the Claimants have shown that in that same period between 2013 and 2015
similar renovations were carried out at petrol stations located in mainland Ukraine,
despite the economic and sociopolitical uncertainty prevailing at that time.41

. On the basis of this evidence, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that on 22 April
2014 a hypothetical willing buyer and seller would have valued the Claimants’ petrol

stations on the basis that 19 of these stations would be renovated in 2014. This

conclusion is reinforced by Mr. Sénéchal’s repeated acknowledgement that companies
usually reinvest into their businesses to maintain and grow their operations.“'2

. Mr. Sénéchal’s main criticism in respect of the implementation of the renovation plans
was the lack of “third-party evidence”, such as “quotations or contracts from suppliers
or contractors, submissions for work permits, tentative or final work plans agreed
between internal staff and contractors in charge of the renovation, tender preparation to
procure renovation services, or internal requests to headquarters for financing

authorization.”4"3

. Given the timeline of events, however, the absence of such documentation appears
unsurprising and not susceptible of casting doubt on the reliability of the evidence that
is in the record. As just noted, the renovation plans were approved on 20 January
2014. By the end of February 2014, Russian military forces had consolidated control
over the Crimean Peninsula and, by the end of March 2014, Crimea had been
incorporated into the Russian Federation. As explained by Mr. Laber at the Hearing on
the Merits, after the Incorporation, the renovation plans were “on hold until we would
figure out what was going to happen next there.”4"4 The Claimants’ petrol stations were
expropriated shortly thereafter on 22 April 2014. These developments explain why the
Claimants did not take steps toward the implementation of the planned renovations
and, hence, the absence of third-party evidence from suppliers, contractors, and

subcontractors.

. The lack of third-party evidence does not mean that, but for the expropriation, the
Claimants would not have proceeded with the renovations later in 2014. Indeed,
Mr. Kaczmarek assumed that the renovations would have taken place in the last four
months of that year. The Tribunal considers this to be a reasonable assumption. It also
notes that, when the chronology of events was put to him during the hearing of
20 August 2018, Mr. Sénéchal did not insist on his point regarding third-party
evidence.*'® Moreover, in his Supplementary Report prepared after the Hearing on the

Merits, he no longer suggested that the renovation plans would not have been

implemented, but only asserted that the renovations would not have generated the

revenues projected by Mr. Kaczmarek.476

. Having concluded that a hypothetical willing buyer and seller would have valued the
Claimants’ petrol stations on 22 April 2014 on the basis that 19 of these stations would
be renovated in 2014, the Tribunal must now consider the revenue that would, in all

probability, have been generated by such renovations.

. Mr. Sénéchal opined that the renovations would not have generated the revenues
projected by Mr. Kaczmarek for three main reasons. First, the planned renovations
were “mostly typical maintenance operations,” which, unlike “strategic investments,
which could add valuable cross-selling services and boost revenues, [...] were
designed to maintain assets in efficient operating condition and to bring incremental
improvements, with no reason to expect a major jump of revenues.”“"” While, at the
hearing, Mr. Sénéchal conceded that it is immaterial whether the renovations are
qualified as “maintenance” or “remodeling”,*‘® he insisted in his Supplementary Report
that the planned renovations, as described in the Claimants’ documents, were not of a
nature to significantly increase revenue.*'? As examples of works that, in contrast to the
planned renovations (described at paragraph 363 above), could have significantly
increased revenue, Mr. Sénéchal mentioned improvements aimed at “offering
diversified services with high value cross-selling opportunities, such as tyre fitting and
motor oil change services, car washes, cafes, and shops.”42° Second, Mr. Sénéchal
considered that the revenue increases projected by Mr. Kaczmarek were “not suited to
exposure to a cyclical downturn and deteriorating macro-economic conditions,” as
described at paragraphs 303 above and 390-391 below. 42’ Third, Mr. Sénéchal
explained that, apart from the macroeconomic conditions, the projected revenue

increases were unlikely given the type of industry at hand:

| think it is important to understand the process of economic value creation, and
look at the industry and ask the question in what kind of industry — what kind of
industry we are dealing with? Here, we're dealing with petroleum station[s], a
mature industry, no great innovation, high procurement costs, so it depends on

your procurement costs. [...]

You are dealing with an industry which is fairly regulated with impact of taxation
being important depending on how the Government sees it as well.

So, altogether, not only | do not see the benefits created because of the
macroeconomic condition[s], but because of the type of the industry you are
dealing with. It gives you more comfort that you would not be dealing in the

high-growth potential.

| have been also looking at the industry. | have been looking at what is the
value-creation process for that particular industry. So, for these type of assets,
which are not related to macro risks here, | am talking about something else here.
I’m talking about are we dealing with a high-growth industry, are we in the Silicon
Valley or in a high-growth/high-tech industry where you would really expect an

investment leading to high returns, and | think probably, no, probably, no.422

71. As noted by Mr. Sénéchal, Mr. Kaczmarek projected that, depending on the petrol

station, post-renovation fuel sales would have amounted to between 135% and 697%
of pre-renovation fuel sales for the 16 stations that were operative prior to the
Incorporation.423 Taking Stabil Station No. 30 as an example, Mr. Sénéchal calculated
that the projected growth rate in fuel sales of 697%, achieved through a planned capital
expenditure of US$ 140,000, would correspond to an annual return on investment of
751%.4%4 In addition, for the convenience store sales, Mr. Kaczmarek projected growth
rates between 2013 and 2015 in the range of 1,740% and 81,582%. 475 In total,
Mr. Sénéchal calculated that, in Mr. Kaczmarek’s valuation, the renovations increased

the enterprise value of the Claimants’ Crimean petrol stations by US$ 19.4 million, from
26.9 million to 46.3 million, i.e., by 72%.476

In the Tribunal’s view, such very high increase projections call for a careful scrutiny of
the basis on which these projections were made, particularly in light of Mr. Sénéchal’s
opinion that they are unrealistic. Mr. Kaczmarek explained that he based his
projections of the impact of renovations on forecasts prepared by the Claimants.‘42”
While stating that he “did not have any basis to judge what had contemporaneously
been forecasted in terms of benefits for the stations at issue,” Mr. Kaczmarek explained
that he relied on this information because it was consistent with “empirical data”
provided by the Claimants. 48 The empirical data in question are found in
exhibit NAV-141, which contains historical data collected by the Claimants regarding
the increase in petrol sales volumes between 2013 and 2015 at renovated petrol
stations in mainland Ukraine.’?? These are the same empirical data that Mr. Sénéchal
used in his alternative valuation to calculate the revenue that would have been

generated by the renovations of the Claimants’ 19 Crimean petrol stations.4°°

Overall, the Tribunal considers that Mr. Kaczmarek and the Claimants have not
sufficiently substantiated the basis for their revenue projections generated by the
renovations. While the Tribunal understands that the Claimants prepared
contemporaneous forecasts for individual stations, it has not been told how or on what

basis these forecasts were prepared.

okay, we looked at it; it looks like what they are forecasting for the [...] renovations looks
reasonable. It's anecdotal in terms of justifying/verifying that this is actually what has occurred.
[...] It's factual information that justifies a forecasted assumption.”).

At the same time, the Tribunal notes that both quantum experts consider it appropriate
to look at the empirical data set out in exhibit NAV-141 regarding renovations that have
actually been implemented in Ukraine in 2013-2015. To be precise, Mr. Kaczmarek
uses these data “in terms of justifying/verifying’** the Claimants’ own projections, while
Mr. Sénéchal arrives at his projections by averaging the Claimants’ projections with the
data from exhibit NAV-141.432 While Mr. Sénéchal explains that he does not rely solely
on the data from exhibit NAV-141 because this exhibit describes renovations at petrol
stations belonging to Ukrnafta, rather than the Claimants, *** the Tribunal notes that the
testimony of Mr. Laber suggests that these were indeed the Claimants’ petrol
stations.** In any event, both experts consider that the petrol stations referred to in
exhibit NAV-141 are sufficiently similar to the Claimants’ Crimean stations to treat that
exhibit as reliable empirical evidence. The Tribunal also notes that the types of works
described in exhibit NAV-141 (e.g., “operator's room, canopy, design, fagade, pylon”)
are similar to the works that were planned for the Claimants’ Crimean stations.
Accordingly, even if the petrol stations referred to in NAV-141 did not belong to the
Claimants, their renovation scheme constitutes a good proxy for the renovation plans of

the Claimants’ Crimean stations.

In light of these considerations, the Tribunal regards the objective data collected in
exhibit NAV-141 as more reliable than the Claimants’ subjective assessment of the
impact of renovations. It will thus use these objective data.

As noted by both experts, exhibit NAV-141 shows an average growth rate in fuel sales
at renovated petrol stations of 167%.*%5 Accordingly, the Tribunal will assume that, at
the 16 operative petrol stations that the Claimants planned to renovate in Crimea, post-
renovation fuel sales would have amounted to 167% of pre-renovation sales, and will

modify Mr. Kaczmarek’s estimate of cash flows accordingly.

For the three petrol stations that were inoperative prior to the Incorporation, the
Tribunal will use the Claimants’ projections, which were adopted by both experts. For

those stations, exhibit NAV-141 does not provide any useful empirical evidence, as it

does not address the impact of renovations on inoperative stations. Moreover, the
Claimants’ projected post-renovation fuel revenues for these three petrol stations
appear to be reasonable when compared to the revenues projected by the Tribunal for
the Claimants’ other Crimean petrol stations, amounting to somewhat less than the
other stations’ individual revenues for 2015 (the year when the inoperative stations
would have become active) and to revenues roughly similar to those of the other

stations starting from 2016.49°

In the absence of hard data regarding the impact of renovations on the convenience
store sales,*” the Tribunal will assume that such sales would have increased in the
same proportion as fuel sales, with a growth rate of 167%, and not by the rate of 216%
proposed by Mr. Sénéchal or the much higher rates claimed by the Claimants (see

paragraph 371 above).

(e) Discount rate

Mr. Kaczmarek's methodology to calculate the cost of capital (equity and debt) from
2014 to 2018 and, therefore, the rate to be applied to discount the value of free cash
flows to the valuation date, is described at paragraphs 283-289 above. It includes the
use of the WACC to determine the cost of capital and of the CAPM to compute the cost
of equity. Overall, the Tribunal finds this methodology appropriate and so does
Mr. Sénéchal. The Tribunal has, however, given particular consideration to some
aspects of the cost of capital calculation.

Mr. Kaczmarek assessed the capital structure for the Claimants’ investment and the
beta variable in the CAPM formula (which reflects the volatility of the investment as
compared to the market as a whole) by looking at other companies that he deemed
comparable to the Claimants’ Crimean business. In respect of the capital structure, he
relied on comparables to use an optimal structure rather than the actual structure of the
Claimants’ business.**8 In the case of the beta, Mr. Kaczmarek explained that the beta

of the Claimants, which are not publicly traded companies, could not be observed

See Sénéchal Second Supplementary Report, Adjusted financial model.

The Tribunal notes that exhibit NAV-141 contains data on the convenience store sales of only five
of the twelve renovated stations (projecting revenues in the range of UAH 48,000-UAH 100,000
per year post-renovation). For the remainder of the stations, it is unclear whether there were no
convenience store sales or whether the data is simply unavailable. The Tribunal considers this
information insufficient to draw any conclusions.

directly.*°° Accordingly, instead of looking at the Claimants, Mr. Kaczmarek averaged
the capital structures and betas of two comparable companies, Galnaftogaz and Petrol
Ljubljana, on the one hand, and of the automotive retail industry index in Europe, on
the other hand.4#°

In his initial report, Mr. Sénéchal approved of Mr. Kaczmarek’s use of comparables to
determine the capital structure and the beta. He noted, however, that the approach
could be improved by taking a larger sample of comparable companies and using a
different industry index, such as, for example, an index for the oil distribution business
in emerging markets.“*' At the hearing of 20 August 2018, Mr. Sénéchal did not restate
these criticisms and agreed that no adjustments were needed to Mr. Kaczmarek’s
valuation. “42 He acknowledged that another industry index might not be more
appropriate, as no index refers exclusively to companies in the retail petrol sales
sector.*43 He was also comforted by the fact that the parameters derived from the two
comparables and the industry index were similar.4“4 Finally, Mr. Senéchal emphasized
that the capital structure proposed by Mr. Kaczmarek (a debt/equity ratio of 88%,
implying 53% equity and 47% debt) was reasonable.“*>

Based on the descriptions of Galnaftogaz and Petrol Ljubljana provided by
Messrs. Kaczmarek“* and Sénéchal,**” the Tribunal ascertained that the operations of
these companies were sufficiently close to the Claimants’ Crimean business to be
comparable. The Tribunal’s conclusion is reinforced by Mr. Sénéchal’s assessment that

Mr. Kaczmarek’s approach to comparables is sound.

Furthermore, the Tribunal has given particular consideration to the appropriate country
risk. In its view, there is no doubt that a country risk must be included in the cost of

equity. In line with the conclusion reached above according to which the Russian

market is the relevant benchmark, the Tribunal will take into account the country risk

prevailing in the Russian Federation.

As noted above, Mr. Kaczmarek opined that the primary risk factors to be considered in
a “valuation analysis in the context of an arbitral proceedings such as this are currency
risk, macroeconomic risks, and social risks,” while “the level of legal risk, regulatory
risk, and political risk [...] should be excluded because these risks are controlled by the
state (and arguably protected against under the BIT).”448 On this basis, he proposed a
country risk of 2%.‘49 In contrast, Mr. Sénéchal was of the opinion that the country risk
must factor in regulatory and political risks, adding that it may in any event not be
possible to isolate the effect of such risks from currency, economic, and social risks.4°°
In practice, Mr. Sénéchal derived the country risk from the CDS spread between March
2013 and March 2014, arriving at a country risk of 1.8%.4°"

. Although they seemed to disagree on the inclusion of some risk components in the

country risk for present purposes, it remains that both experts essentially agreed on a
country risk in the range of 2%. Even though Mr. Sénéchal was in favor of incorporating
more risk factors, he came up with a percentage slightly lower than the one put forward
by Mr. Kaczmarek, and regarded a percentage of 2% as correctly reflecting Russian
country risk. Overall, both quantum experts thus concurred that 2% would be an
appropriate country risk for Russia.*°? On this basis, the Tribunal accepts 2% as the

country risk.

. In light of the above, the Tribunal finds that Mr. Kaczmarek’s calculation of the discount

rate is reasonable. It notes that Mr. Sénéchal opined likewise.

(f) Terminal value

To capture the value of all future cash flows expected to arise from the Claimants’
investment after 2018, based on a constant growth model, Mr. Kaczmarek calculated a

terminal value for the investment, applying the following formula:
Terminal Value = [FCFE:* (1 + g)]/(r - g)
Where:
FCFE:= Free Cash Flow to equity in year t
g = Terminal Growth Rate
r = Cost of Capital?

Mr. Kaczmarek proposed a terminal growth rate of 3.02%, equal to the sum of
expected U.S. inflation in 2018 (1.98%) and 50% of the estimated growth in Russian

petrol consumption in the same year (2.09% divided by two, which equals 1.04%).454

Mr. Sénéchal confirmed that “[t]he approach and formula Mr. Kaczmarek used correctly
reflect terminal value,”4°5 but was of the view that Mr. Kaczmarek’s terminal growth rate
was overstated and failed to account for deteriorating macroeconomic conditions in the

pre-Incorporation period and economic uncertainty and volatility post-Incorporation.*°>

Mr. Sénéchal described the deteriorating macroeconomic conditions in Russia as

follows:

Growth in Russia slowed from 5.1% in 2011 to 3.4% in 2012 and 1.8% in 2013.
This is less than half the growth rate in the decade up to the 2009 crisis, which
averaged 7% GDP growth per year (Figure 4). In 2012, policymakers and
analysts warned about the downside risk in the economy. For instance, the World
Bank Group highlighted the negative impacts of the structural crisis that started in

2012, showing economic activity in Russia had lost momentum, with growth in

Kaczmarek Report, p. 75, Figure 41.

2013 seen falling from the previous year due to sagging global confidence, flat oil
prices, high inflation, and sluggish domestic demand.

From end 2013 to early 2014, Russia’s economy was in a de facto recession with
investment dropping rapidly, consumer demand slackening and real incomes
falling.457

91. The Tribunal’s expert further opined that “[pJolitical conditions in late 2013 and early
2014 contributed to a worsening economy and had a huge influence on the perception

of market risk.”4°® He then summarized his concerns as follows:

Many economic uncertainties existed in the region then, including falling GDP in
Russia and Ukraine, a protracted economic downturn in Ukraine and a structural
crisis in Russia. Therefore, it is important to recognize that the terminal value has
risk and that the businesses may never actually achieve the expected
performance due to economic vulnerabilities and regional economic volatility.
One should recall that the growth rate in the terminal value formula serves as a
proxy for the expected future growth rate; the understanding that the businesses
may not actually achieve the representative steady state in 2018 requires some
adjustment.*5?

392. Thus, in his first report, Mr. Sénéchal proposed a growth rate based solely on the U.S.
inflation rate of 1.98%.‘ In his Supplementary Report, he proposed a growth rate of
2.62%, corresponding to the sum of expected U.S. inflation from 2014 to 2018 (1.76%)
and 50% of the estimated growth in Russian petrol consumption for the same period
(1.73% divided by two, which equals 0.86%).4%"

393. Having examined the expert evidence, the Tribunal considers that it would be
inappropriate to adopt a growth rate based solely on U.S. inflation, as this would
essentially mean no expectation of growth for the Claimants’ business after 2018. At

the same time, the Tribunal is sensitive to Mr. Sénéchal’s arguments regarding the

deteriorating macroeconomic conditions pre-Incorporation and the economic and
sociopolitical uncertainties of 2014. The Tribunal notes that 2014 was a period of
turmoil in the Crimean Peninsula, and in the relations between Ukraine and Russia
generally. A hypothetical willing buyer and seller would no doubt have borne these
uncertainties in mind when valuing an asset located in the Crimean Peninsula on 22
April 2014. In effect, Mr. Kaczmarek also recognized these uncertainties when, in
calculating the terminal growth rate, he halved the estimated Russian petrol
consumption for 2018. The remaining question is therefore whether Mr. Kaczmarek’s
growth rate sufficiently took into account these uncertainties or whether the further

adjustment proposed by Mr. Sénéchal is required.

The difference between the experts is that Mr. Kaczmarek used the U.S. inflation rate
and the Russian petrol consumption for the year 2018 (as forecast in 2014), when
Mr. Sénéchal used the average of such parameters over the period 2014-2018. The
Tribunal considers that taking variables over a period of time rather than for a specific
year is more likely to result in a realistic prediction of growth, as it avoids attaching
disproportionate weight to one year that may not be representative because of special
circumstances. Moreover, in line with both experts’ assessment, it appears reasonable
to use only 50% of the forecast petroleum consumption growth in order to account for

the uncertainties described above.

Accordingly, the Tribunal adopts Mr. Sénéchal’s proposed growth rate of 2.62%, equal
to the sum of expected U.S. inflation from 2014 to 2018 (1.76%) and 50% of the
estimated growth in Russian petrol consumption for the same period (1.73% divided by
two, which equals 0.86%). 42 The Tribunal notes that this growth rate is more
consistent than Mr. Kaczmarek’s proposal with the historical evolution of the Claimants’
revenues in Crimea from 2008 to 2013, which did not show constant growth, but rather
ups and downs with an overall positive trend.4® In all other respects, the Tribunal
accepts Mr. Kaczmarek’s calculation of the terminal value, with which Mr. Sénéchal

took no issue.

is not a strong case of why that growth rate should be linear as well. If you use the growth rate, if
you look at the past now, you can imagine that it also fluctuates and that you have also
volatility.”).

iii. | Comparable publicly traded company (CPTC) approach

The Tribunal recalls that it has already accepted the implementation of the CPTC
approach in the context of the calculation of the CAPM and especially of the capital
structure and beta based on the two selected comparables, i.e., Galnaftogaz and Petrol
Ljubljana. For the reasons stated above, the Tribunal accepts his CPTC analysis. Its
conclusion is confirmed by the fact that Mr. Sénéchal found no fault in the use of the
CPTC by the Claimants’ expert and that he also approved the allocation of 15% of the
total valuation to the CPTC approach.

iv.  Stabil LLC’s residential apartment

In addition to the enterprise value of their 31 petrol stations and two storage facilities,
the Claimants request compensation for the loss of Stabil LLC’s residential apartment
located at 20 Marka Donskogo Street in Simferopol, which, as noted at paragraph 229
above, was expropriated through the 3 September 2014 amendment to the

Nationalization Decree.

Mr. Kaczmarek valued the apartment by considering the listing prices in December
201544 of two other apartments located on the same street in Simferopol. From these
listing prices, he derived an estimated price per square meter (US$ 963), which he
applied to the surface area of Stabil LLC’s apartment (37.7 m2), arriving at a value of
US$ 36,318.4%

The Tribunal considers that, in principle, the use of comparable properties constitutes
an appropriate methodology for the valuation of residential real estate.4°° At the same
time, Mr. Kaczmarek’s implementation of this approach in the present case suffers from

certain weaknesses.

One such weakness is the minimal information provided about Stabil LLC’s apartment,
which makes it difficult to assess whether the chosen comparators are appropriate. In

his report, Mr. Kaczmarek mentions only the apartment's address and its surface area,

While these listings post-date the valuation date of 3 September 2014, the Tribunal observes that
the prices of real estate in Simferopol decreased between the valuation date and December 2015
(NAV-148), such that the use of listings from December 2015 does not lead to an overstatement
of the value of Stabil LLC’s apartment.

Kaczmarek Report, § 206.

See, e.g., Everest, Award on the Merits, § 265 (2 May 2018) (CLA-278), where the tribunal
accepted this methodology for the valuation of residential properties in Crimea.

and selects the comparable properties apparently on the sole basis that they are
located on the same street and are “similarly-sized”. 48” Stabil LLC’s apartment is
described in the sale and purchase agreement as consisting of “three habitable rooms,
indicated on the plan by Nos. 4, 5 and 8, with a total area of 37.7 m2, entrance hall
No. 1, closet No. 2, kitchen No. 3, bathroom No. 6, water closet No. 7, recessed
balcony, and protruding balcony.” No information is provided, however, on the
condition of Stabil LLC’s apartment and of the comparable properties selected,
although such information would shed light on the value of the apartment and the
appropriateness of the comparators. Additionally, the number of available comparators
is relatively low. In light of the uncertainties arising from these circumstances, the
Tribunal considers it appropriate to reduce Mr. Kaczmarek’s estimated value for
Stabil LLC’s apartment by 15%.

Another weakness is that Mr. Kaczmarek uses listing rather than actual sales prices for
the comparable properties. While information regarding actual prices may not be
available with the result that list prices are the best available data, it remains that list
prices are typically higher than sales prices. In the Everest case, where Mr. Kaczmarek
acted for the claimants and valued several real estate properties in Crimea, he
acknowledged this fact and “decreas[ed] the resulting list price for Claimants’ real
estate properties by 10 percent to account for the typical difference between list prices
(i.e., the seller's asking price) and sales prices (i.e., the final price agreed to by a buyer
and seller).”4°° The Everest tribunal accepted this approach and this Tribunal considers
that it would be similarly appropriate in the present case. Mr. Kaczmarek’s estimated
value for Stabil LLC’s apartment will therefore be reduced by a further 10% (which is
equivalent to reducing the list prices of the comparable properties by 10%).

For completeness, the Tribunal notes that, in December 2002, the apartment was
bought by Stabil LLC for UAH 51,230.00.47° However, that transaction took place too

long ago to provide a reliable indicator of value.

Thus, in summary, the Tribunal reduces the value estimated by Mr. Kaczmarek by 25%
and awards Stabil LLC compensation for the loss of its apartment in the amount of
US$ 27,238.

v. Conclusion

As stated at paragraphs 376-378 and 395 above, the Tribunal has decided to adjust
the Claimants’ valuation by (i) recalculating the impact of the planned renovations on
the projected cash flows for 2014-2018; and (ii) using a different growth rate in
the calculation of the terminal value.

As calculated by Mr. Sénéchal, the effect of these adjustments is as follows (all
amounts in US$):

31 Crimean petrol stations and two storage facilities among them, the Tribunal,

The changes to Mr. Kaczmarek’s DCF analysis have an impact on the Claimants’ average
EBITDA for 2014-2018, which requires a corresponding adjustment in the CPTC model. See

(e) Interest
i. The Claimant's position

The Claimants ask the Tribunal to award it compound interest on any amount granted
in this Award from 22 April 2014 until full payment is made.472

According to the Claimants, the rate of interest fixed in Article 5(2) of the BIT only

applies in cases of lawful expropriation and is, therefore, inapplicable here.473 The

Statement of Claim, § 4.1.

410.

411.

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-1 Filed 04/09/22 Page 126 of 133

Claimants thus ask the Tribunal to consider three commercial interest rates:4’4 (i) the
U.S. prime rate plus 2%;475 (ii) the 12-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)
plus 4%;476 and (iii) the yield on the Russian Federation's U.S. dollar denominated
bonds, which represents the cost of raising money for the Russian government.4””
According to Mr. Kaczmarek, the latter rate is reasonable since the Claimants are now
an unwilling lender to the Russian Federation.478

ii. Analysis

Article 5(2) of the Treaty provides for the payment of interest “accruable from the date
of expropriation until the date of payment, at the interest rate for three-month deposits
in US dollars on the London Interbank Market (LIBOR) plus 1%.”

It is true that the standard of compensation set forth in Article 5(2) of the Treaty applies
only in the event of lawful expropriation. This is equally true of the interest rate
specified in that provision. At the same time, the Tribunal considers that this provision
is indicative of the Contracting Parties’ view that LIBOR constitutes an appropriate
basis for the calculation of late interest. Moreover, the Tribunal sees no reason why
late interest which compensates for the fact that funds payable to a creditor were not
available to him during a certain period of time, should be set differently in case of a
lawful act of expropriation as opposed to an unlawful one. Finally, the Tribunal
considers that compound interest is a better reflection of the standard of full reparation
than simple interest. Had the Claimants received compensation for their investment on
the date of expropriation, they would have been in a position to earn interest, which

would have been compounded over time.472

In view of these considerations and all relevant circumstances of the case, the Tribunal
awards the Claimants interest on the compensation granted in this Award from 22 April
2014 until the date of payment at LIBOR for three month deposits in U.S. dollars

plus 1%, compounded annually.

COSTS

THE CLAIMANTS’ POSITION

The Claimants submit that the Respondent should bear all the costs and legal fees
incurred by them in connection with this arbitration, including: (i) arbitration costs
(comprised of the Claimants’ deposits for the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, the
PCA, and the appointing authority); (ii) legal fees; (iii) expert witness fees and
expenses; (iv) other expenses (e.g., translation, travel, shipping, and_ printing
expenses); and (v) interest thereon. “8° The Claimants further ask the Tribunal to
allocate any awarded costs equally among them (i.e., to allocate 9,091% of costs to

each Claimant).

RELEVANT PROVISIONS

. Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules, defining the “costs of arbitration”, states as follows:

The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its award. The term “costs”

includes only:

 

Republic of Costa Rica, \CSID Case No. ARB/96/1, Award, 17 February 2000, § 104 (‘“[T]he
award of compound interest is no longer the exception to the rule [...] The tribunal [in Santa
Elena] had noted that where the owner of property has lost the value of his asset but not been
timely compensated, the amount of compensation that is later awarded ‘[...] should reflect, at
least in part, the additional sum that his money would have earned, had it, and the income
generated by it, been reinvested each year at generally prevailing rates of interest.’ Reflecting
this rationale, a number of international tribunals have recently expressed the view that
compound interest should be available as a matter of course if economic reality requires such an
award to place the claimant in the position it would have been had it never been injured (i.e. the
wrongful act had not taken place.)"); Siemens A.G. v. Argentine Republic, Republic of Egypt,
ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Award, §§ 129-130 (8 December 2000) (CLA-74). See also John
Gotanda, A Study of Interest, Villanova Public Law and Legal Theory Working Paper Series
(2007), pp. 23-31 (CLA-99) (‘the trend in investment disputes has been for tribunals to award
interest at market rates and on a compound basis [...] the approach taken by these investment
arbitration tribunals better compensates claimants for the loss of the use of money; interest
awarded at market rates and on a compound basis more accurately reflects what the claimant
would have been able to earn on the sums owed if they had been paid in a timely manner.”).

(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each
arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with

article 39;
(b) The travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;

(c) The costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral

tribunal;

(d) The travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses

are approved by the arbitral tribunal;

(e) The costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party if
such costs were claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and only to the
extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is

reasonable;

(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the
expenses of the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration

at The Hague.

415. Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides, in respect of the allocation of costs:

1.

N

Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be
borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion
each of such costs between the parties if it determines that appointment is

reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.

With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in
article 39, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account
the circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall
bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it

determines that apportionment is reasonable.

Cc. COSTS OF THE TRIBUNAL, THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY AND THE PCA

416. In accordance with Article 41 of the UNCITRAL Rules, a tribunal may request the

parties to make deposits in equal shares as advances for the costs of arbitration. In

the event that a party has not paid its share of a deposit within 30 days of a request,

the tribunal “shall so inform the parties in order that one or another of them may make
the required payment.”

In these proceedings, the Tribunal requested deposits from the Parties on six
occasions, in a total amount of EUR 352,500 from each Party. The Claimants paid their
share of the requested deposits in full. Since the Respondent did not pay any of its
shares of the requested deposits, the Tribunal requested the Claimants to make
substitute payments for the Respondent's shares, which they did, in an amount of
EUR 352,500. Accordingly, the Claimants deposited with the PCA a total of
EUR 705,000.

The fees and expenses in these proceedings of Mr. Daniel M. Price, the arbitrator
appointed on behalf of the Claimants, amount respectively to EUR 90,180 and
EUR 14,934.59.

The fees and expenses in these proceedings of Professor Brigitte Stern, the arbitrator
appointed by the appointing authority on behalf of the Respondent, amount
respectively to EUR 120,900 and EUR 7,696.81.

The fees and expenses in these proceedings of Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler,
the Presiding Arbitrator, amount respectively to EUR 176,430 and EUR 6,995.90.

Pursuant to PO1, Ms. Eva Kalnina was appointed as Secretary to the Tribunal and the
PCA was designated to serve as registry in these proceedings. By letter of 22 April
2016, the Tribunal indicated that the PCA would assist the Secretary in her tasks.48"
Ms. Kalnina’s fees and expenses amount respectively to EUR 71,295 and EUR 3,780.
The PCA’s fees and expenses amount respectively to EUR 86,977.25 and
EUR 2,455.70.

The Tribunal also appointed an expert on quantum, Mr. Thierry Sénéchal. His fees and
expenses amount respectively to EUR 63,125 and EUR 176.

Other arbitration costs, including the costs of hearing facilities, court reporters,
translation and interpretation, IT equipment, bank transactions, and all other expenses
relating to the proceedings, amount to EUR 40,388.76.

Based on the above figures, the costs of the Tribunal, comprising the items covered in
Article 38(a) to (c) of the UNCITRAL Rules, total EUR 685,335.01. After payment of
these costs from the deposit, an unexpended balance of EUR 19,664.99 remains. This
balance will be reimbursed by the PCA to the Claimants in accordance with
Article 41(5) of the UNCITRAL Rules.

Additionally, the Claimants have paid EUR 750 to the PCA for the designation of an
appointing authority and EUR 1,000 to the appointing authority for the appointment of
an arbitrator. Thus, the costs under Article 38(f) of the UNCITRAL Rules total
EUR 1,750.

Costs OF LEGAL REPRESENTATION AND ASSISTANCE

In respect of their costs of legal representation and assistance, the Claimants seek
US$ 5,333,120.96, comprising legal fees (US$ 4,404,266.09), expert witnesses’ fees and
expenses (US$ 598,503.37), and other expenses incurred in presenting the case
(US$ 330,351 .50).482

The Tribunal notes that these costs fall within the definition of costs in Article 38(d) and
(e) of the UNCITRAL Rules and have been duly justified with evidence submitted with
the Claimants’ Application for Costs. The Tribunal considers that the amount of such
costs is reasonable.

ALLOCATION OF COSTS

Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that the unsuccessful party shall
“in principle” bear all the costs of arbitration, while the arbitral tribunal has discretion to
apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is
reasonable taking into account the circumstances of the case. With regard to the costs
of legal representation and assistance, the UNCITRAL Rules contain no presumption
for awarding them to the successful party but rather provide that in apportioning these
costs, the arbitral tribunal should consider “the circumstances of the case.” The
circumstances to be taken into account may include, inter alia, an overall view of the
case, the novelty of the case, and the parties’ respective degree of success.

In the present proceedings, the Claimants have prevailed on jurisdiction and liability,
and been partially successful with their damages claim. Hence, in the exercise of its

Application for Costs, §§ 9-16.

123

Case 1:22-cv-00983 Document 2-1 Filed 04/09/22 Page 131 of 133

discretion under Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules in matters of allocation of costs, the
Tribunal finds it fair and appropriate that the Respondent shall bear the costs of
the arbitration, as well as the costs of legal representation and assistance of the
Claimants, in a proportion that reflects the Claimants’ win on jurisdiction and liability as
well as it partial win on quantum. Under the circumstances, it sets this percentage
at 75%. Accordingly, the Respondent shall pay the Claimants 75% of all costs,
amounting to EUR 515,313.76 “83 and US$ 3,999,840.72. “® These costs shall be

allocated equally among the Claimants (i.e., 9,091% of costs to each Claimant).
