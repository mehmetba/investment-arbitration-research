PROCEDURAL HISTORY

PRELIMINARY AWARD ON JURISDICTION

The procedural history of the first phase of the arbitration until 13 October 2014 is
recounted at section II of the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction.

On 14 October 2014, the Tribunal dispatched to the Parties English and Spanish
versions of the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction and of the Concurring and Dissenting
Opinion of The Honorable Charles N. Brower dated 10 October 2014 (the “Dissenting
Opinion”). The Tribunal also invited the Parties to confer and submit their proposals for
the procedural calendar for the next phase of the arbitration.

On 24 October 2014, pursuant to paragraph 8.1 of the Procedural Rules dated 20 July
2012 (the “Procedural Rules”), the Parties provided the Tribunal with their positions on
the publication of the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction.

AMENDMENTS TO THE SOC, PROCEDURAL CALENDAR, INTERVENTION BY THE EUROPEAN
COMMISSION, PUBLICATION OF AWARDS AND OTHER RELATED MATTERS

On 3 and 4 November 2014, the Claimants and the Respondent informed the Tribunal
that they had been unable to agree on the procedural calendar. The main reason for
disagreement related to the Claimants’ intention to amend their Statement of Claim of
28 September 2012 (the “SoC”) “to address the new harmful measures implemented
by Spain subsequent to the filing of the original Statement of Claim in September
2012”,5 to which the Respondent “strongly object[ed]”.® The Parties also addressed this
issue in their further submissions of 12 November, 19 November, 25 November,
28 November and 2 December 2014.”

On 12 November 2014, the European Commission (the “Commission”) filed an
application for leave to intervene as a non-disputing party with the PCA. The
Commission’s request for permission to intervene was “limited to the question of

jurisdiction”. The Commission “invite[d] the Tribunal to decline jurisdiction” because of

See Procedural Order No. 8, 5 January 2015, paras. 2-16 (summarizing the Parties’
positions).

the intra-EU nature of the dispute. The Commission maintained that the ECT did not
create obligations among EU Member States inter se, “but only between the Union and
its Member States, on the one hand, and each of the other contracting Parties, on the
other hand [...]’.'° If the Tribunal nevertheless decided to exercise jurisdiction, the
Commission reserved its right to request leave to also intervene on issues of
substance."

On 18 November 2014, the Tribunal invited the Parties’ comments on the
Commission's application and asked the Parties whether they had an objection to the
Tribunal providing the Commission with a copy of the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction.

On 5 December 2014, the Parties submitted their comments. The Claimants argued
that there was no basis for the Commission to intervene in the proceedings nor was
“the intended scope of the intervention relevant to the dispute”.'2 The Claimants also
did not object to the Tribunal providing the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction to the
Commission.'? The Respondent indicated that it had no objection to the Tribunal
providing the Commission with a copy of the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction (subject
to certain confidentiality undertakings), or to the Commission intervening in the
proceedings. However, the Respondent suggested that it may be appropriate to
determine the question of the Commission’s intervention after the Tribunal’s
determination regarding the amendment of the SoC.

On 5 January 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8 (“PO8”), in which the
Claimants were granted leave to file an amended SoC. A procedural calendar for the
next phase of the arbitration was circulated with PO8.

By letter of 9 January 2015 to the Parties, the Tribunal ruled on the Commission’s
application. It held that it had already affirmed its jurisdiction in the Preliminary Award
on Jurisdiction.’4 Under the Swiss /ex arbitri, an award on jurisdiction did bind the

Tribunal, which thus had no power to re-open a matter already decided. As the
Commission’s application was limited to jurisdictional issues linked to the intra-EU
nature of the dispute, the Tribunal could not accept the Commission's application.

By the same letter, the Tribunal also drew the Parties’ attention to the latest
developments concerning transparency in investment treaty arbitration and inquired
whether the Parties would consent to the publication of the Preliminary Award on
Jurisdiction and the Dissenting Opinion.'®

On 16 January 2015, the Claimants confirmed their consent to the publication of the
Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction, as well as awards to be issued in these proceedings,
subject to redactions to protect the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information.
On the same day, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it did not consent to the
publication of the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction, and on 28 January 2015,
suggested that the Parties and the Tribunal hold a telephone conference on this issue.'®

In a second letter of the same day, Spain alleged that the Claimants had breached
Article 8 of the Procedural Rules, in particular by disclosing the content of the
Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction. According to the Respondent, on 24 December
2014, |AReporter had disclosed the outcome of the jurisdictional phase. It was the
Respondent's “foregone conclusion that the Claimants directly or indirectly disclosed
either the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction or the outcome resulting from such
Preliminary Award to either Mr Peterson [of |[AReporter] or some third party that is not
a party to these confidential proceedings”. The Respondent requested the Tribunal to
enforce Article 8 of the Procedural Rules by ordering such sanctions as it deemed
appropriate. On 28 January and 4 February 2015, pursuant to the Tribunal’s directions,
the Claimants provided their comments, denying the Respondent's allegations, and the
Respondent provided its responses to the Claimants’ comments.

On 6 February 2015, the Claimants filed their amended SoC (the “ASoC”) along with
supporting witness statements, exhibits, legal authorities and the Second Expert Report
of the Brattle Group (“Brattle’s Second Expert Report”)."®

On 13 February 2015, the Claimants submitted the Spanish language translation of the
ASoC.

Also on 13 February 2015, the President of the Tribunal made a disclosure, to which

neither of the Parties objected.

On 16 February 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it was available for a
telephone conference as proposed by the Respondent in relation to the publication of
the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction and asked them for their availability. On 6 March
2015, after further correspondence between the Parties, the Tribunal confirmed that
the telephone conference would take place on 9 March 2015 at 16:00 (CET).

Consequently, on 9 March 2015 at 16:00 (CET), the Parties and the Tribunal held a
telephone conference to discuss the publication of the Preliminary Award on
Jurisdiction.

On 11 March 2015, the Respondent submitted additional comments on the matters
discussed at the conference call. Amongst other things, the Respondent confirmed that:

no matter what the outcome of the liability phase (i.e., whether [the Tribunal]
finds Spain liable or not), and notwi[th]standing the fact that it is not what
arises from the Procedural Rules, Spain would consent to the publication of
the award on liability, even in the hypothetical case that such award could
not be “the final” award. Furthermore, as anticipated during the procedural
call Spain would also consent to the publication of the Preliminary Award on
Jurisdiction at such point in time (i.e., when the Tribunal renders the award
on liability)- which as it was explained during the procedural call, it was
assumed the Tribunal would do in any event.'9

In letter of 26 March 2015, the Tribunal responded to the Commission’s application of
12 November 2014. It conveyed to the Commission that it had no power to reopen
jurisdictional objections that it had already decided.”° The Tribunal observed, however,
that the Commission had “reserved the right to request leave to intervene also on points
of substance”.2" The Tribunal informed the Commission, inter alia, that it would consider
any such application and requested that the same be filed by 20 May 2015. Further, as

neither Party had raised an objection, the Tribunal provided the Commission with a
copy of the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction and the Dissenting Opinion.?

Also on 26 March 2015, the Tribunal sent a copy of the letter to the Commission just
referred to and addressed the publication of the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction.”
Having considered the Parties’ positions, it decided that the Preliminary Award on
Jurisdiction would be published at the time of the issuance of the final award.
Furthermore, it found that the Respondent had failed to establish the Claimants’ alleged
breaches of the applicable confidentiality regime.”

On 11 May 2015, following the Parties’ joint request for a revision of the procedural
timetable, the Tribunal circulated a revised procedural calendar.

On 20 May 2015, the Commission informed the Tribunal that it would not present an
application to intervene on the merits because Spain had officially notified the Disputed
Measures (in accordance with the requirements of EC law) as a result of which the
Commission was now obliged to take a decision on Spain’s notification of the Disputed
Measures.”5 The Commission invited the Tribunal to suspend the arbitration until it had
rendered its decision.

On 22 May 2015, the Respondent filed its Statement of Defence (the “SoD”) with
accompanying exhibits, legal authorities and an expert report of Greatrex and Montojo
Gonzalez in collaboration with Altran (the “MG&A Report”). On the same day, the
Respondent also filed the Spanish translation of its SoD.

On 26 May 2015, the Tribunal provided a copy of the Commission’s letter of 20 May
2015 to the Parties, and informed them of its intent to ask the Commission to provide
an estimate of the timeframe in which it planned to render its decision on the Kingdom
of Spain’s notification of the Disputed Measures. Later that same day, the Tribunal
responded to the Commission’s letter of 20 May 2015.

On 11 June 2015, the Parties jointly requested an amendment to the dates for the
document production phase specified in PO8 (as revised on 11 May 2015). The
following day the Tribunal revised the time limits as requested by the Parties.

On 16 June 2015, the Respondent filed a corrected version of the SoD and certain
additional translations. By letter of the following day, the Tribunal accepted these

changes subject to any objection by the Claimants. No objections were raised.?”

On 17 June 2015, each Party served its requests for the production of documents, in
accordance with the procedural calendar annexed to PO8 (as amended on 12 June
2015).

On 22 June 2015, the Tribunal received further correspondence from the Commission,
advising about the timing of the decision on Spain’s notification of the Disputed
Measures. Upon the Tribunal’s invitation, the Parties provided their comments on 5 July
2015.

On 8 July 2015, the Tribunal amended the timetable to reflect the Parties’ agreement

to extend the date for exchanging uncontested documents from 8 July to 17 July 2015.

On the same day, the Parties submitted their responses and objections to the document
requests.

On 17 July 2015, having considered the Commission’s request to suspend the
proceedings and the Parties’ comments thereto, the Tribunal informed the Parties of its
decision to deny the Commission’s request and the related reasons. On 24 July 2015,
the Tribunal communicated such decision to the Commission.

On 20 July 2015, the Respondent asked the Tribunal and the Claimants whether they
would agree to communicate the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction and the Dissenting
Opinion to the tribunal and the claimant in CSP Equity Investment s.a.r.l. (Luxembourg)
v. Kingdom of Spain (SCC Arbitration 2013/094) (“CSP”). On 22 and 24 July 2015, the
Tribunal and the Claimants confirmed that they had no objection to such request. On
25 July 2015, the Respondent conveyed that there was no information that needed to
be redacted from the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction, as confidentiality was covered
by the rules applied in the SCC proceedings.

On 22 and 23 July 2015, the Claimants and the Respondent submitted their Responses
to the objections to the document requests.

On 24 July 2015, the Tribunal forwarded to the Parties correspondence it had received
from the Commission in which the Commission indicated that it would inform the
Tribunal of its decision on Spain’s notification.

On 27 July 2015, the Tribunal confirmed to the Parties its understanding that the
Respondent would communicate the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction and the
Dissenting Opinion to the tribunal in CSP, being specified that both Parties had
confirmed that no information needed to be redacted from the Award.

On 31 July 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9 (“PO9”) ruling on the
Parties’ document production requests.

On 17 August 2015, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it had been requested
by the counsel for the claimants in RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Limited and RREEF
Pan-European Infrastructure Two Lux S.a r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain (ICSID Case No.
ARB/13/30) (“RREEF”), to submit the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction in that
arbitration. It thus requested the Claimants’ and the Tribunal’s consent.

Two days later, the Tribunal and the Claimants confirmed that they had no objection to
such submission.

On 17 October 2015, the Claimants filed their Reply (the “Reply”) with accompanying
exhibits, legal authorities, witness statements and the Third Expert Report of the Brattle
Group (“Brattle’s Third Expert Report”). On 23 October 2015, the Claimants filed the
Spanish translation of the Reply and on 28 October 2015, they filed a corrected version
of the Brattle’s Third Expert Report.

On 29 October 2015, the Respondent requested permission to communicate the
Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction to the tribunal in Antin Infrastructure Services
Luxembourg S.a r.l. and Antin Energia Termosolar B. V. v. The Kingdom of Spain
(ICSID Case No. AR/13/31) (“Antin’).

On 3 November 2015, the Tribunal granted such permission and noted that the
Claimants having consented to the publication of the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction
on 16 January and 19 August 2015, it was not necessary for Spain to seek any further
consent from the Claimants with respect to the disclosure of the Preliminary Award on
Jurisdiction to other arbitral tribunals or otherwise.

On 11 December 2015, in light of certain new developments, the Claimants sought
leave from the Tribunal, to submit a new witness statement from a Werec
representative in respect of its claims. Following further correspondence of
11 December, 16 December and 23 December 2015 between the Parties and the
Tribunal, the Tribunal granted the Claimants’ request on 29 December 2015. On
11 January 2016, the Claimants filed the witness statement of Jesus de Ramon-Laca

Cotorruelo and on 29 January 2016, the Respondent provided its comments.

On 21 December 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the ICSID Secretariat
had requested the communication of the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction and the
Dissenting Opinion to the ICSID tribunal in Blusun S.A., Jean-Pierre Lecorcier and
Michael Stein v. Italian Republic (I\CSID Case No. ARB/14/3) (“Blusun’). As the
Respondent did not consent to the transmittal of the award to the tribunal in Blusun, on
14 January 2016, the Tribunal informed the ICSID Secretariat that it was not in a
position to disclose the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction to the tribunal in Blusun.

On 21 December 2015, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder (the “Rejoinder’) with
accompanying exhibits, legal authorities, witness statements, and the Rebuttal Expert
Report of the Altran/MaC group (the “MG&A Rebuttal Expert Report”). An updated
version of the Rebuttal Expert Report of Altran/MaC group was filed on 3 February
2016.

On 7 January 2016, the Claimants alleged that the witness statements of
Messrs. Davey and Olivas la Llana (submitted with the Rejoinder) did not respond to or
rebut evidence submitted with the Reply, and were thus inadmissible in light of the
applicable rules and contravening the Claimants’ due process rights. The Claimants
reserved the right to submit evidence in response to these witness statements.

On 7 January 2016, the Claimants requested leave to file an extract from the
Respondent's pleadings in ICSID arbitration Masdar Solar & Wind Cooperatief U.A.v.
Kingdom of Spain (ICSID Case No. ARB/14/1) (“Masdar’). The Respondent did not
object. Thus, on 18 January 2016, the Tribunal confirmed that the document was part
of the record as Exh. C-664.

At this juncture, the Respondent sought to file a decision by the Spanish Constitutional
Court. The Claimants did not object and, on 25 January 2016, that document was made
part of the record as Exh. R-355.

HEARING ON LIABILITY AND OTHER RELATED MATTERS

On 14 January 2016, the Parties provided the Tribunal with the names of the witnesses
and experts they wished to cross-examine at the hearing.

On 18 January 2016, the Tribunal circulated a draft Procedural Order No. 10 (“PO10”)
about the organization of the hearing.

On the same day, the Parties provided the Tribunal with their list of attendees for the
pre-hearing telephone conference (the “PHTC’).

On 20 January 2016, the President of the Tribunal informed the Parties that she would
conduct the PHTC alone by delegation of her co-arbitrators.

On 21 January 2016 at 6 p.m. (CET), the President of the Tribunal and the Parties held
the PHTC to discuss the outstanding matters pertaining to the organization of the

During the PHTC, which was audio recorded, the President of the Tribunal and the
Parties discussed the items set out in draft PO10, as well as other matters raised by
the Parties during the call.

On 25 January 2016, the Tribunal issued PO10.

On 29 January 2016, the Respondent requested leave to introduce into the record
(i) the award and dissenting opinion in Charanne B. V. & Construction Investments S.A.
RL. v. the Kingdom of Spain (SCC Case No. 062/2012) (“Charanne”), and (ii) five
decisions by the Spanish Supreme Court. The Claimants did not object and, on
5 February 2016, the Tribunal granted the Respondent leave to file such documents,
which the latter did on the same date, in Spanish (original), and 18 and 25 February
2016, in English (translations), as Exhs. RL-190, RL-191, and R-356 to R-360.

On 3 February 2016, the Respondent sought the Claimants’ and the Tribunal’s consent
for communicating the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction and Dissenting Opinion to the
tribunal in NextEra Energy Global Holdings B.V. and NextEra Energy Spain Holdings
B.V. v. the Kingdom of Spain (I\CSID Case No. ARB/14/11), which consent was given
on 4 February 2016.

On 24 February 2016, pursuant to Procedural Rule 4.5, the Claimants requested leave
to submit three additional categories of exhibits: (i) documents responding to Spain’s
“late filed witness evidence”;?8 (ii) documents related to the due diligence of Impax; and
(iii) documents which post-dated the Claimants’ last submission. On 1 March 2016,
upon the Tribunal’s invitation, the Respondent objected to the submission of these new
documents. On 7 March 2016, the Tribunal granted some of the Claimants’ requests
and denied others. On 9 March 2016, in accordance with the Tribunal’s instructions,
the Claimants provided the Tribunal with a consolidated index of the Claimants’ exhibits
and submitted the new Exhs. C-665 to C-686.

On 26 February 2016, pursuant to Procedural Rule 3.7, the Respondent sought leave
to file two decisions of the Spanish Constitutional Court. Following the Claimants’
confirmation that they had no objection,?? on 7 March 2016, the Tribunal granted the

Respondent leave to file the documents as Exhs. R-361 and R-362.

Also during this period (i.e. between 23 February and 7 March 2016), the Parties and
the Tribunal exchanged correspondence about the logistics of the hearing. The Parties
made several joint proposals which the Tribunal approved.

On 4 March 2016, the Tribunal invited the Parties to make the necessary adjustments
to the hearing schedule and the Parties subsequently provided a jointly revised
schedule on 9 March 2016.

Also on 4 March 2016, the Respondent sought to submit documents as Exhs. R-363 to
R-365. Such request was issued pursuant to leave granted by the Tribunal in its letter
of 25 February 2016, which permitted the Respondent to introduce into the record any
document received from the late production of documents by the Claimants on
17 February 2016.

On 7 and 8 March 2016, the Parties provided their lists of attendees at the hearing. On
11 March 2016, the Parties submitted demonstrative exhibits.

On 11 March 2016, the Tribunal issued further instructions in relation to the hearing.
Also on 11 March 2016, the Claimants made a request with respect to (i) Exh. C-407
that had previously been filed erroneously and (ii) additional translations to be included
in the Opus hearing bundle and considered part of the record (subject to the right of
any party to dispute the accuracy of the translations). By email of the same date, the
Respondent submitted comments.

The following day the Tribunal ruled that the Opus hearing bundle was meant as
hearing support reflecting documents (including translations) already on record. That
said, as the addition of translations appeared to be intended to facilitate the efficient
conduct of the examinations, the Tribunal permitted the filing of the additional
translations, subject to compelling objections of the Respondent and it being
understood that the Respondent could question the accuracy of the translations at the
hearing as well as after the conclusion of the hearing. In addition, the Tribunal admitted
the filing of the original version of Exh. C-407 in the record.

On 14 and 15 March 2016, pursuant to section 11 of PO10, the Claimants and the
Respondent filed the PowerPoint presentations for their opening statements.

The hearing on liability (the “Hearing on Liability” or the Hearing) took place from 14 to
21 March 2016 at the Peace Palace in The Hague. The following persons attended the
Hearing:

On 19 March 2016, Spain asked to submit a new document. It did so on 1 April 2016,
the Claimants having confirmed on 25 March 2016 that they did not object.

Also on 20 March 2016, additional demonstrative exhibits were submitted by both
Parties. On 21 March 2016, the Parties submitted their experts’ PowerPoint
presentations.

During the hearing, the Tribunal heard opening submissions by counsel, asked
questions to the Parties which counsel answered at the hearing and in their post-
hearing submissions, and heard evidence from the following witnesses and experts:

Following a consultation with the Parties at the end of the hearing, on 23 March 2016,
the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 11 in relation to post-hearing matters
(‘PO11”).

On 22 April 2016, the Parties provided agreed corrections to the transcripts of the
Hearing. On the same day, the Respondent objected to the inclusion of Exhs. C-378
and C-407, which the Claimants had uploaded to the Opus platform prior to the hearing,
alleging that the Claimants had “abused their role while taking the lead in uploading
documents to the Opus platform by including two entirely new documents onto the
record and to make amendments to 72 documents”.°° On 6 May 2016, the Claimants
commented, stating, inter alia, that these matters were “routine misunderstandings that
should have properly been dealt with in correspondence between the parties”.5'

By letter of 13 May 2016, the Tribunal accepted that the Claimants had failed to submit
the original English versions of the two documents by error, as was evident from the
fact that in both cases two documents in Spanish were filed. Additionally, the Tribunal
accepted the Claimants’ explanations that the track changes visible in the footer of Exh.
C-378 (and other documents), which the Respondent had raised as an issue, were the
effect of an automatic-update system. The Tribunal thus invited the Claimants to submit
Exhs. C-378 and C-407 in their original language together with relevant translations.
The Tribunal also invited the Parties to address the issue of the translations that had
been added onto the Opus system before the Hearing, and the Respondent's related
application for costs, in their upcoming cost submissions. On 16 May 2016, the
Claimants submitted Exhs. C-378 and C-407 in English (original) and Spanish

(translations).

On 18 May 2016, in view of the Parties’ agreement, the Tribunal authorized the
Claimants to file a Spanish Supreme Court judgment of 20 April 2016 as Exh. C-687.
Additionally, the Tribunal provided that each Party would have an opportunity to
respond to any comments made by the other Party in its reply post-hearing submission
due on 17 June 2016. On 20 May 2016, the Claimants filed Exh. C-687.

On 20 May 2016, the Claimants and the Respondent filed their first post-hearing briefs
(“C-PHB1” and “R-PHB1”) followed by Spanish translations on 31 May 2016.

See letter from the Respondent to the Tribunal of 22 April 2016, p. 2.

By email of 23 May 2016, the Respondent objected to the Claimants exceeding of the
word limit set by the Tribunal for C-PHB1 and annex 1 and requested that it be allowed
to add to its reply brief the number of words by which the Claimants had exceeded the
limit, which the Tribunal allowed, the Claimants having no objection.

On 30 May 2016, pursuant to the Tribunal’s directions of 18 May 2016, the Parties filed
submissions on the Spanish Supreme Court decision of 20 April 2016. Also on 30 May
2016, the Respondent contended that the English translation of Exh. C-687 (see supra
para. 80) was inaccurate. On 2 June 2016, the Tribunal invited the Parties to attempt
to resolve divergences in relation to that translation and to revert if disagreements
remained.

On 15 June 2016, the Tribunal requested the Respondent to resubmit the Spanish
translation of R-PHB1 ensuring that the paragraph numbers in the Spanish translation
corresponded to those in the English version. The Respondent did so later that day.

On 24 June 2016, the Parties filed their reply post-hearing briefs (“C-PHB2” and “R-
PHB2”), translations into Spanish following on 1 July 2016.

On 1 July 2016, the Claimants submitted their final consolidated indices of exhibits and
of legal authorities.

On 8 July 2016, the Parties filed their submissions on costs (“C-Costs Submission” and
“R-Costs Submission”) and the Respondent also its consolidated indices of exhibits
and legal authorities. On 11 July 2016, the Claimants filed an updated submission on
costs. Reply costs submissions were filed on 15 July 2016 (“C-Costs Reply” and “R-
Costs Reply”), as were the Spanish translations of the initial submissions. Spanish
translations of the reply submissions were filed on 22 July 2016.

By email of 15 July 2016, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that a final award had
been rendered in /solux Infrastructure Netherlands B.V. v. Spain (“Isolux”), which was
the first award on merits to address the 2013 Measures. The Respondent also attached
press reports of 13 July and 15 July 2016 relating to that award. Following the
Claimants’ objections, the Tribunal advised the Parties that it could not consider a
decision merely on the basis of press reports. However, if one of the Parties were to
request leave to submit the award into the record, the Tribunal would then give
appropriate directions.

By letter of 4 August 2016, the Respondent asked the Tribunal to formally request a
copy of the /solux award from the /so/ux tribunal. On 18 August 2016, having reviewed
the Parties’ comments on the Respondent's request, the Tribunal directed the
Respondent to use its best efforts to submit the /so/ux award, adding that the Parties
would have an opportunity to simultaneously comment on the award.

PO12 AND SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENTS

On 29 September 2016, having deliberated on the Parties’ case as it had developed
through the written and oral submissions and the evidence gathered so far, the Tribunal
unanimously issued Procedural Order No. 12 (“PO12”).52

On 13 October 2016, the Parties notified the Tribunal of the likelihood that they would
require certain clarifications on the matters set out in PO12 and proposed an
amendment to the next procedural steps in relation to such clarifications. On the same
day, the Tribunal confirmed the Parties’ proposal.

On 15 November 2016, following further correspondence between the Parties and the
Tribunal on 19 October, 24 October, 28 October and 1 November 2016, the Tribunal
addressed the Parties’ requests for clarification. In particular, with regard to the
Claimants’ requests for clarification, it (i) clarified that its invitation to the Claimants to
present their quantum cases “as they deem appropriate” related only to their alternative
claim and did not cover the so-called primary claim; (ii) confirmed that it did not expect
to receive submissions on liability in the context of the phase outlined in PO12, and the
Parties’ further submissions should be “limited to the aspects of the quantum specified
in PO12”; that said, liability could be addressed in connection with comments on the
Isolux award if it was released; (iii) provided answers to questions set out in the
Claimants’ letter of 19 October 2016. In connection with the Respondent's requests for
clarification, the Tribunal stated that the Parties should use a regulatory lifetime of a PV
plant of 30 years and that the Respondent’s understanding that written submissions be
presented “in succession (i.e., the Claimants first present their written submission
followed by that of the Respondent, etc.)” was correct and reflected the text of PO12.5°

On 13 December 2016, due to concerns of breach of confidentiality which the
Claimants had raised and which the Parties had been unable to resolve, the Tribunal

denied the Respondent's request to file the /solux award, adding that it would

reconsider its decision should circumstances change, for example if it were to receive
confirmation that the claimant in /solux had consented to the disclosure of the award.

On 14 December 2016, the Parties submitted their joint procedural calendar for the
phase of the arbitration envisaged in PO12 (referred to “PO12 phase’). On this basis,
on 19 December 2016, the Tribunal circulated a draft procedural calendar for the
Parties’ comments, to which the latter agreed on 11 January 2017.

Following further correspondence of 19, 24 and 26 January 2017 and 1, 8 and
10 February 2017, it was agreed that a pre-hearing telephone conference (the “PO12
PHTC”) would be held on 8 January and a hearing on 16 to 20 January 2018 (the “PO12
Hearing’).

On 10 February 2017, the Tribunal circulated the final version of the procedural
calendar for the PO12 phase.

In accordance with the procedural calendar, on 7 April 2017, the Claimants filed their
“Quantum Submission” (the “Quantum Memorial”) with accompanying exhibits, legal
authorities and an expert report of the Brattle Group (“BQR 1”), followed on 15 April
2017, by the translation of the Quantum Memorial.

On 27 April 2017, pursuant to a request from the Respondent* and having considered
the Claimants’ comments, the Tribunal granted the Respondent an extension of five
business days for its document requests and an extension of 4 calendar days for the
Counter-Memorial. It also provided the Parties with an updated procedural calendar.

On 5 May 2017 the Respondent served its requests for the production of documents.
On 12 May 2017, the Claimants submitted their objections to the Respondent's
document production requests. On 19 May 2017, the Respondent provided its replies
to the Claimants’ responses and objections. On 29 May 2017, the Tribunal issued
Procedural Order No. 13 (“PO13”) on these document requests.

On 5 June 2017, the Claimants provided the Respondent with the documents
responsive to the requests that the Tribunal had granted, subject to certain
qualifications.

On 5 and 18 July 2017, the Respondent objected to alleged deficiencies in the
Claimants’ production and requested the Tribunal to grant it an extension to file the

Counter-Memorial and vacate the hearing scheduled for January 2018. On 14 and
21 July 2017, the Claimants rejected the Respondent's allegations and requests.

On 26 July 2017 at 5 p.m. (CET), following a request from the Respondent, the Tribunal
and the Parties held a hearing via conference call to discuss the issues raised in the
Parties’ correspondence. In addition to the members of the Tribunal and the Secretary,
Messrs. Sullivan, Ingle and Busby were present on behalf of the Claimants, and
Messrs. Leathley, Soler Tappa, de San Roman and Ms. Timmins were present on
behalf of the Respondent. At the telephone hearing, each Party first presented its views
and then answered the Tribunal’s questions.

On 31 July 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 14 (“PO14”), with a revised
procedural calendar, which addressed the Respondent's requests in relation to the
document production phase and granted the Respondent an extension until
14 September 2017 to file its Counter-Memorial.

On 7 August 2017, pursuant to the Tribunal’s directions in PO14, the Claimants
submitted documents responsive to Spain's requests and identified documents sought
which allegedly did not exist or had not been located.

Between 14 August 2017 and 20 October 2017, the Claimants provided the Tribunal
and the Respondent with updates on the status of its production of responsive
documents. On 31 October 2017, the Claimants confirmed that there were no
document requests outstanding.

On 14 September 2017, the Respondent filed its “Quantum Counter-Memorial”
(‘Quantum Counter-Memorial”), with accompanying exhibits, legal authorities and an
expert report of Econ One Research (“EOQR |”), followed by translations on
21 September 2017.

On 2 October 2017, the Claimants submitted their requests for the production of
documents in accordance with the procedural calendar agreed between the Parties.
On 9 October 2017, the Respondent submitted its objections. On 13 October 2017, the
Claimants provided their replies. In a letter of 13 October 2017, the Claimants noted
that Spain had retained a new expert (Econ One) for this phase of the arbitration instead
of MG8A, whom it had used before. /nter alia, they reserved the right to also call MG&A
for cross-examination at the PO12 Hearing. On 24 October 2017, the Tribunal wrote
that it had taken note of the Parties’ positions and would take a decision if and when
the Claimants decided to call MG&A.

On 20 October 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 15 (“PO15”) on the
Claimants’ requests for document production. It reserved its decision on request no. 7
until it received answers from the Parties to questions it had laid out in correspondence,
and in Annex A to PO15. The Tribunal later denied request no. 7 on 1 November 2017,
following consideration of the Parties’ answers of 24 and 26 October 2017, as well as
of the positions that they had advanced earlier.

On 27 October 2017, the Respondent asked the Tribunal for a one-week extension to
produce the documents ordered in PO15. On 31 October 2017, having considered the
Claimants’ objection to such request, the Tribunal granted an extension until
2 November 2017. The Tribunal further indicated that if, because of the delay, the
Claimants had insufficient time to comment on the new documents in their Reply due
on 9 November 2017, they would be permitted to file a short supplementary submission
limited to addressing the documents produced late.

Also on 31 October 2017, the Tribunal confirmed that the hearing would take place from
16 to 20 January 2018 at the Peace Palace in The Hague and requested that the
Parties confirm their availability for the PO12 PHTC on 8 January 2018 at 5 p.m. (CET),
which they did on 2 November 2017. On 2 November 2017, the Respondent also
informed the Tribunal of the status of its document production and explained that it was
still searching for documents, which it would produce if and when retrieved.

On 9 November 2017, the Claimants filed their “Quantum Reply Submission” (the
“Quantum Reply”) with report from the Brattle Group (“BQR II”), followed by translations
on 17 November 2017.

On 27 November 2017, the Claimants complained that the Respondent had still not
produced documents to any of the Claimants’ requests. On 30 November 2017, the
Tribunal invited the Respondent to provide an update on the document production
process by 7 December 2017.

On 30 November 2017, the Respondent objected to the Claimants’ submission of three
new expert reports (Exhs. C-702 to C-704), which, it said, did not rebut expert evidence
presented in the Quantum Counter-Memorial. It thus requested that these expert
reports be struck from the record or that it be permitted to submit rebuttal expert
evidence. On 1 December 2017, further to the Tribunal’s invitation, the Claimants

provided their comments.

Still on 30 November 2017, the Respondent informed the Tribunal and the Claimants
that the Commission had issued its final decision on Spain’s notification of the Disputed
Measures (see, supra, para. 29) and requested leave to submit that decision, in
accordance with Articles 3.7 and 4.5 of the Procedural Rules. Upon the invitation of the
Tribunal, the Claimants opposed Spain’s application on 4 December 2017. On
6 December 2017, the Tribunal granted the Respondent's request to file the
Commission’s decision into the record. On that same day, the Tribunal denied the
Respondent's request to strike Exhs. C-702 to C-704 from the record.

On 7 December 2017, in accordance with the Tribunal’s directions of 30 November
2017, the Respondent provided its responses as to the status of its document

production.

On 14 December 2017, the Respondent submitted the Commission's “Decision on the
State Aid SA.40348 (20151NN) regarding Spain's Support for Electricity Generation
from Renewable Energy Sources, Cogeneration and Waste”, dated 10 November 2017
(the “EC Decision on State Aid”) into the record as Exh. RL-201 and its comments on
such document. On 22 December 2017, the Claimants provided their comments.

On 22 December 2017, the Respondent filed its “Quantum Rejoinder” (the “Quantum
Rejoinder”) along with accompanying exhibits, legal authorities and a report by Econ
One (“EOQR II’), followed by a translation on 2 January 2018.

By letter of 4 January 2018, the Claimants complained that while documents pertaining
to their production request No. 1 had been disclosed in another arbitration, the
Respondent was presently “flouting its disclosure obligations” in the present
proceedings. Hence, they asked the Tribunal to order Spain to explain why the
documents had not been disclosed and order it to “immediately” produce any

documents responsive to request No. 1.

Upon the invitation of the Tribunal, on 8 January 2018 the Respondent submitted its
comments. In a letter of 12 January 2018, the Tribunal denied the Claimants’ request.
On 15 January 2018, on the eve of the PO12 Hearing, the Claimants asked the Tribunal
to reconsider its decision. By email of the same date, the Tribunal noted that it would

address this request on 16 January.

THE PO12 HEARING

On 5 January 2018, the Tribunal circulated a draft Procedural Order No. 16 (“PO16”)
on the organization of the PO12 Hearing for discussion at the upcoming PO12 PHTC.

In response to the Tribunal’s invitation, by emails of 5 and 7 January 2018, the Parties
provided their lists of attendees at the PO12 PHTC and submitted items to be added to
the agenda, as well as draft hearing schedules.

By letter of 6 January 2018, the Claimants contended that Spain had made submissions
on several issues of liability in its Quantum Rejoinder outside of the scope of PO12,
and requested the Tribunal to strike from the record sections 3.1 to 3.3 (and the new
exhibits and legal authorities submitted in support of these sections) and direct Spain
to submit a revised Quantum Rejoinder. Alternatively, the Claimants requested the
opportunity to respond to the submissions on liability contained in these sections. By
email of the same date, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on these
allegations during the PO12 PHTC scheduled on 8 January 2018.

On 8 January 2018, the Hon. Charles N. Brower circulated the CV of his new law clerk,
Dr. Devin Bray, and the confidentiality agreement that Dr. Bray had signed upon
acceptance of his employment with Judge Brower, and invited the Parties to advise
whether they had any objection to Dr. Bray’s attendance at the PO12 Hearing. On 9 and
10 January 2018, both Parties stated that they had no objection.

On 8 January 2018 at 5 p.m. (CET), the PO12 PHTC took place as scheduled. The
following persons attended:

During the conference call, which was audio recorded, the Tribunal and the Parties
discussed the items set out in the draft of PO16. On this basis, on 11 January 2018,
the Tribunal issued PO16 on the organization of the PO12 Hearing, with the Spanish
version following the next day. On 12 January 2018, the Parties also submitted their

final list of attendees at the hearing.

On 13 January 2018, pursuant to PO16, the Claimants requested leave to file additional
documents into the record, to which, following invitation from the Tribunal, Spain
objected on 15 January 2018. By email of the same date, the Tribunal issued its
directions, granting certain of the Claimants’ requests and denying others. On
16 January 2018, in accordance with the Tribunal’s directions, the Claimants submitted

the relevant legal authorities and an updated consolidated list of legal authorities.

On 15 January 2018, in accordance with PO16, the Parties also filed their

demonstrative exhibits and some corrected versions later that same day.

The PO12 Hearing took place from 16 to 19 January 2018 at the Peace Palace in The

On 16 January 2018, the Parties submitted the electronic versions of their opening
presentations. Also on 16 January 2018, the Claimants submitted the demonstrative
exhibits of the Brattle Group. On 17 January 2018, the Respondent submitted Econ
One’s demonstrative exhibits, and Econ One's hearing presentation.

During the PO12 Hearing, the Tribunal heard opening arguments by counsel, asked
questions to counsel and the experts and heard evidence from the following experts:

Mr. Carlos Lapuerta, expert, the Brattle Group

Mr. Richard Caldwell, expert, the Brattle Group

Mr. Jack Stirzaker, expert, the Brattle Group

Mr. Daniel Flores, expert, Econ One

Mr. Jordan Heim, expert, Econ One
The Tribunal decided, in consultation with the Parties, to hold an expert conferencing
on the last day of the hearing. During such examination, both Parties’ experts stated
that they would be prepared to assist the Tribunal if the latter needed help in matters

of quantum.

PO17 AND OTHER RELATED MATTERS

At the end of the PO12 Hearing, the Tribunal and the Parties discussed the further
procedural steps. As a result, on 25 January 2018 (with the translation following on

42

30 January), the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 17 (“PO17”), which reads in

relevant part as follows:

3. The Parties shall file a first round of simultaneous post-hearing
briefs on 16 March 2018. In the first post-hearing brief, each Party
shall comment on the evidence gathered in the course of the
Hearing to the extent relevant. In addition, each Party shall present
legal arguments as to the appropriate valuation date in this case.

4. Following receipt of the first round of post-hearing briefs, the
Tribunal will circulate a draft procedural order setting out certain
valuation parameters, inviting the Parties’ experts to produce a joint
valuation model (the “Experts’ Joint Model” or “EJM”) taking such
parameters into account, and providing appropriate directions in
connection with the EJM. Within 2 weeks from receipt of the draft
order, the Parties and their experts may then comment and ask
clarifications on the draft order, after which it will be issued in final
form.

5. Within 2 months from the issuance of the order in final form, the
experts will produce the EJM taking into account the parameters
provided in the order. The time limit set out in this paragraph is
tentative and may be modified if a Party so requests within 10 days
after having received the order.

6. Thereafter, there shall be a second round of consecutive post-
hearing briefs. The Claimants shall file their second post-hearing
brief 8 weeks after the filing of the EJM. The Respondent will file its
second post-hearing brief 8 weeks after receipt of the Claimants’
second post-hearing brief. In the second post-hearing brief, each
Party may respond to the arguments made in the first round to the
extent deemed necessary, comment on the EJM, and place the
result of the EJM in its overall case. In addition, to the extent deemed
necessary, each Party may address the EC Decision, the Eiser,
Isolux, and Blusun awards, and authorities CL-237 to CL-240, filed
by the Claimants on 16 January 2018.

7. The Parties shall confer and seek to agree on the word limits to
apply to the two rounds of post-hearing briefs by 1 February 2018
and revert to the Tribunal with a proposal.

8. The Parties may also confer and seek to agree on rules on counsel's
involvement in the experts’ preparation of the EJM. If the Parties
cannot agree on this issue, the Tribunal will address it in its
forthcoming draft procedural order on the EJM.

9. No new documents may be submitted with the post-hearing briefs,
except with leave of the Tribunal. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
additional international decisions and awards, published after a
Party's last written submission, may be submitted as new legal
authorities. In this respect, the Respondent shall notify the
Claimants 2 weeks prior to the time limit for the filing of the
Claimants’ second post-brief of any new legal authorities on which
it intends to rely in its second post-hearing brief.

10. Following receipt of the second post-hearing briefs, upon request or
on its own motion, the Tribunal may decide whether it is appropriate
to hold a hearing for questions from the Tribunal and possibly oral
arguments.

On 1 February 2018, the Respondent sought a clarification from the Tribunal in relation
to paragraph 9 of PO17 in respect of new relevant awards to be published after the
deadline. On 7 February 2018, following an invitation from the Tribunal,*> the Claimants
opposed Spain’s proposal. On 13 February 2018, the Tribunal explained that it had
included the rule contained in paragraph 9 of PO17 on the understanding that the
Parties had agreed on it at the end of the PO12 Hearing. This not being the case and
considering that paragraph 9 of PO17 presented certain shortcomings, the Tribunal
provide a revised version of that paragraph.

On 12 February 2018, the Respondent addressed the Tribunal’s direction that any
document under Spain’s control responsive to Claimants' document request No. 1
should be produced in accordance with PO15, which had been restated on the last day
of the PO12 Hearing. The Respondent confirmed that it had requested certain entities
to again search their records for documents responsive to request No. 1. However, no
such documents had been located. The Respondent further contended that the
Claimants’ allegation that certain documents had been produced in other proceedings
should be rejected. In the alternative, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal order
the Claimants to identify the counsel who had provided such information as well as the
proceedings so that Spain could review those records. The following day, the
Respondent submitted attachments to its letter. On 14 February 2018, the Tribunal
invited the Claimants to address such letter and its enclosures in their second post-
hearing brief.

On 16 February 2018, the Claimants submitted the Parties’ agreed version of the
English and Spanish transcripts of the PO12 Hearing. Owing to an error, the
Respondent re-sent both transcripts on 19 February 2018, to which the Claimants
agreed on 21 February 2018.

On 9 March 2018, pursuant to paragraph 9 of PO17, the Claimants requested leave to
file a press article from E/ Confidential dated 24 January 2018, which Spain opposed
on 13 March 2018. On 14 March 2018, the Tribunal granted the Claimants’ request and
the Claimants filed the article as Exh. C-705 with their first post hearing brief (infra
paragraph 137).

On 16 March 2018, the Claimants filed their “First PO12 Post-Hearing Brief’ (the “PO12
CPHB1”), followed by the Spanish translation on 25 March 2018. Also on 16 March

2018, the Respondent filed its “Quantum Post Hearing Brief’ (the “PO12 RPHB1”), with
a translation on 23 March 2018.

On 13 April 2018, during the course of the preparation of the EJM, the Claimants
requested that “EconOne be precluded from introducing an alternative But-For discount
rate for the purposes of the Joint Model”. The Respondent commented on 18 April
2018.

PO18 AND THE EJM, NEW INTERVENTION BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, THE
GREENTECH DOCUMENTS, THE ACHMEA JUDGMENT AND OTHER RELATED MATTERS

On 30 April 2018, in accordance with paragraph 4 of PO17, the Tribunal circulated a
draft Procedural Order No. 18 (“draft PO18”) dealing with the presentation of an expert
joint model (the “Expert Joint Model” or “EJM”). The Parties provided their comments
on draft PO18 on 14 and 22 May 2018.

On 16 May 2018, the Commission informed the Tribunal that “in case the Tribunal
would deem it useful for its deliberations, the Commission would be available to up-
date its written observations in the light of the recent judgment of the European Court
of Justice in Case C-284/16 Achmea v. Slovak Republic, and in particular to set out its
view on the consequences of that judgment for pending arbitration cases based on the
Energy Charter Treaty”.2” On 22 May 2018, the Tribunal forwarded the Commission's
correspondence to the Parties and invited the Parties’ comments, which were provided
on 1 June 2018.

On 6 June 2018, the Tribunal wrote to the Commission drawing the latter’s attention to
the Tribunal’s letter of 26 March 2015,°8 by which it had provided the Commission with
the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction. For the reasons stated in that letter, the Tribunal
was unable to accept the Commission’s offer to update its written observations in
relation to the intra-EU objection. The Tribunal advised the Commission, however, that
it welcomed the Commission’s offer “to set out in detail the impact of [the decision it
adopted on Spain's notification in November 2017] on the case pending before [this]
Tribunal’’? and invited the Commission to provide its comments limited to this issue by
19 June 2018. On the same day, the Tribunal informed the Parties of such letter.

Still on 6 June 2018, further to the Parties’ comments on PO18 and a request from the
Claimants, the Tribunal informed the Parties that, subject to their availability, it would
hear the Parties orally by telephone conference on some of the points raised in their
observations on 4 July 2018 at 14:00 (CET). On 7 June 2018, the Parties confirmed
their availability.

By letter of 14 June 2018, the Claimants requested the Tribunal to provide the Parties
with a proposal for the procedure going forward“ and asked for indications of the timing
of the award on liability and/or quantum and steps to avoid unnecessary delays.

On 19 June 2018, the Commission provided its observations on the impact of the EC
Decision on State Aid on the present case. The Tribunal forwarded the Commission's
correspondence to the Parties on the same day and invited their comments, which were
provided on 5 July 2018.

By letter of 25 June 2018, the Tribunal provided the Parties with the agenda for the
conference call of 4 July. In its letter, the Tribunal also indicated that it would discuss
the timing for the completion of the proceedings during the conference call, as
requested by the Claimants on 14 June 2018. On 2 July 2018, after the Parties provided
the lists of participants in the telephone conference on the following day, Spain
protested against the attendance of the Brattle experts.

On 3 July 2018, having considered the Claimants’ response, the Tribunal permitted the
Brattle experts to attend the call, highlighting that as the call would be recorded, the
Respondent would be able to provide the recording to its own experts if it so wished
and if they could not participate. The following day, the Respondent confirmed that two
of its own experts would attend the call.

On 4 July 2018, in advance of the telephone conference, the Claimants provided the
Tribunal with a zip file containing the Parties’ correspondence in relation to the EJM
and certain other documents from the record to which the Claimants might refer during
the course of the call.

On 4 July 2018 at 2 p.m. (CET), the Parties and the Tribunal held the telephone
conference to discuss draft PO18, with the following persons in attendance:

On 18 July 2018, the Tribunal unanimously issued PO18 in final form, the Spanish
translation being circulated on 2 August 2018.41

On 13 August 2018, the Respondent made a number of requests, among which an
application that the Tribunal open a new procedural phase to consider Spain’s “new
jurisdictional objection” based on “new facts”. In this context, the Respondent asked to
file the Achmea judgment along with an EC Communication and fact sheet published
on 19 July 2018, which provided “guidance on the protection of cross-border EU
investments, as well as on the implications of [Achmea], for the investor-State
arbitration in the Energy Charter Treaty [...] in relation to cross border EU
investments”. The Respondent further requested that the Tribunal allow the
Commission to present its comments on the impact of the EC Communication along
with the Achmea judgment on the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in the present arbitration.
On 31 August 2018, as directed by the Tribunal, the Claimants provided their comments
on the Respondent's requests. In accordance with the Tribunal’s further directions, the
Respondent filed its reply comments on 6 September, to which the Claimants
responded on 11 September 2018.

On 7 September 2018, the Claimants (on behalf of Brattle) sought a clarification’?
regarding one of the areas of disagreement between the experts regarding the EJM.
Further correspondence on this issue was exchanged between the Tribunal and the
Parties on 9 September, 11 September, 14 September, 18 September, 21 September,
and 24 September 2018. By letter of 24 September 2018, the Tribunal issued certain
clarifications in relation to the Claimants’ request.

On 5 October 2018, after a short delay, the Brattle and Econ One experts filed the EJM
accompanied by a Joint Memorandum to the EJM (the “Joint Memorandum’).

On 11 October 2018, following an inquiry from the Claimants, the Tribunal confirmed
that the filing dates for the second post-hearing briefs were 26 November 2018 for the
Claimants and 4 February 2019 for the Respondent. At this juncture, the Tribunal
mentioned that it would shortly provide its decision on the Respondent's request to
open a new jurisdictional phase.

Excerpts of PO18 are reproduced infra at paras. 655-656 and 667.
See Letter from the Respondent to the Tribunal of 13 August 2018, p. 1.

Pursuant to para. 15 of PO18 by which the Tribunal directed the Econ One and Brattle
experts to write to the Tribunal should they require clarifications in the course of the
preparation of the EJM.

On 15 October 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 19 (“PO19”), denying
the Respondent's request to open a new jurisdictional phase and other related
requests, the Spanish translation following on 25 October 2018.

Also on 15 October 2018, the Claimants filed an application for the production of certain
documents allegedly produced by Spain to the claimants in Greentech Energy Systems
ASS et al. v. Kingdom of Spain (SCC Arbitration V 2015/150) (“Greentech” and the
“Greentech Documents”) and certain legal authorities (Exhs. CL-243 to CL-249). The
following day, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on the Claimants’
application, which they did on 22 October 2018. On 29 October 2018, the Tribunal
ordered the Respondent to file the Greentech Documents.“4 The Tribunal also later
determined that the legal authorities should not be admitted into the record.4®

On 31 October 2018, the Respondent asked the Tribunal to reconsider its order of
29 October 2018 regarding the Greentech Documents. Upon an invitation by the
Tribunal, the Claimants submitted their comments later that same day. On 7 November
2018, the Tribunal denied the Respondent's request.

By correspondence of 12 November 2018, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that
they had yet to receive the Greentech Documents. Two days later, the Respondent
advised that a change to its counsel team was the cause of the delay. On 16 November
2018, the Claimants provided comments and requested leave to file a supplemental
submission following receipt of the Greentech documents. On 21 November 2018, the
Respondent filed the Greentech Documents.

On 23 November 2018, the Brattle experts provided an agreed corrected version of the
EJM. On 26 November 2018, the Tribunal conveyed its understanding that the updated
EJM was submitted on behalf of both experts and that it should be advised, by
28 November 2018, if this was not the case. No such advice was provided.

On 26 November 2018, the Claimants noted that their request for leave to file a
supplemental submission following receipt of the Greentech Documents remained
outstanding and asked for a two-day extension for their Second PO12 PHB (until
28 November 2018) in light of the time and manner in which they had received the
Greentech Documents.

165.

On 27 November 2018, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that when the Greentech
Documents had been filed, the metadata had been inadvertently erased. For this
reason, the Respondent resubmitted the Greentech Documents including the
metadata.

On the same day, the Tribunal confirmed that the resubmitted Greentech Documents
had been admitted into the record as Exhs. C-372 and C-373. The Tribunal also
confirmed that the time limits for the second post-hearing briefs were extended until
29 November 2018 and 12 February 2019. The Tribunal further conveyed its
understanding that there were no outstanding requests in connection with the
Greentech Documents.

Still on 27 November 2018, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that this understanding
was not correct because (i) the documents attached to Spain’s email of 27 November
2018 also had the metadata removed; and (ii) the Respondent had failed to provide the
clarification requested by the Claimants in their email of 22 November 2018 regarding
the origin of the Greentech Documents. On 29 November 2018, upon the Tribunal’s
invitation, the Respondent provided further comments on the Greentech Documents.
On 10 December 2018, the Tribunal granted the Claimants leave to submit their
observations to the Respondent's communication of 29 November 2018 and the
Respondent an opportunity to reply in its PO12 Second PHB.

On 29 November 2018, the Claimants filed their “Second PO12 Post-Hearing Brief”
(the “PO12 C-PHB2”) (the translation being provided on 6 December 2018) and relayed
that in the process of preparing such brief, it had come to their attention that (i) the
document presented as Exh. C-252 only comprised an annex to the National Action
Plan on Renewable Energy in Spain (the PANER) 2011 — 2020 dated 30 June 2010,
when it should include the full PANER; and (ii) Annex 3 to the Claimants’ application
for an order on document production dated 15 October 2018 had inadvertently been
omitted from the winzip of documents accompanying that submission. They requested
that these documents be included in the record, which Spain opposed on 6 December
2018.

By letter of 10 December 2018, the Tribunal decided not to accept these documents,
stating that the Claimants had not made out any “exceptional case” which would justify
the introduction of Exh. C-252 and the Annex 3 mentioned above at such a late stage

See Sections 3.7 and 4.5 of the Procedural Rules and para. 9 of Procedural Order No.

of the proceedings. In addition, the Tribunal also determined that new legal authorities
CL-243 to CL-249 would not be admitted, noting in particular that these authorities all
addressed the principle of adverse inferences which would only apply if the Claimants’
primary request for the disclosure of the Greentech Documents had been rejected,
which was not the case.

On 20 December 2018, the Claimants submitted their observations on the Greentech
documents.

On 12 February 2019, the Respondent filed its “Second Post Hearing Brief on
Quantum” (the “PO12 R-PHB2’), followed by the translation on 19 February 2019. Also
on 12 February 2019, the Respondent requested permission to file into the record the
declaration by 22 Member States of the European Union “on the Legal Consequences
of the Judgement of the Court of Justice in Achmea and on Investment Protection in
the European Union”. Pursuant to an invitation from the Tribunal, the Claimants
submitted their comments on 18 February 2019.

By letter of 21 February 2019, the Tribunal authorized the filing of all three declarations
made by EU Member States and invited the Parties to provide their comments. On
25 February 2019, the Respondent filed such declarations under Exh. numbers RL-214
to RL-216, with an updated consolidated index of the Respondent's legal authorities.
The Parties submitted their respective observations on the declarations on 7 and
21 March 2019.

On 26 April 2019, the Tribunal updated the Parties on the progress of its deliberations
and further invited: (i) both Parties to make additional submissions on the Greentech
Documents; (ii) both Parties to file their costs submissions pursuant to PO17; and
(iii) the Respondent to file a submission on Interest.

On 3 May 2019, the Respondent filed its submission on the Greentech Documents and
on 10 May 2019, the Claimants filed their reply, both in accordance with the Tribunal’s
instructions of 26 April 2019.

On 17 May 2019, the Respondent filed its Submission on Interest.

COsTs SUBMISSIONS AND CLOSURE OF THE PROCEEDINGS

On 14 June 2019, the Parties filed their Submissions on Costs (the “PO12 C-Costs
Submission” and “PO12 R-Costs Submission’), with translations submitted on 24 and
26 June 2019.

On 28 June 2019, the Claimants and the Respondent filed their Reply Submissions on
costs (“PO12 C-Reply Costs Submission” and “PO12 R-Reply Costs Submission”), with
translations submitted on 3 July 2019.

On 4 September 2019, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal provide an update
regarding the progress in preparing the award, which the Tribunal did on 6 September
2019. On 13 September 2019, the Claimants made further inquiries in this respect. On
18 September 2019, the Tribunal indicated that it would do the utmost to issue the
award by 2019, reminding the Parties, however, that the award needed to be translated
into Spanish before issuance. The Tribunal further indicated that it would write again
towards the end of November with an issuance date.

On 2 December 2019, after noting that it had all the necessary elements in terms of
liability and, if applicable, quantum to render a Final Award, the Tribunal closed the
proceedings and provided an updated on the date of issuance of the award.

On 4 December 2019, the Respondent acknowledged the Tribunal's letter of 2
December 2019 and informed the Tribunal that on the same date Spain was notified of
two new relevant decisions from ICSID tribunals which should necessarily inform the
Tribunal's analysis.4” The Respondent noted that, being those awards public, it trusted
that the Tribunal would take them into consideration.

On 9 December 2019, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of the Respondent's
communication of 4 December 2019 and took note of its content. Moreover, the
Tribunal noted that in addition to the decision or awards that were on record and the
additional two referred by the Respondent, it was aware of a number of other publicly
available decisions or awards rendered in other arbitrations brought against the
Kingdom of Spain and which concerned the measures in this case.*® The Tribunal

The Respondent referred to (i) Stadtwerke Munchen GmbH, RWE Innogy GmbH and

others v. Kingdom of Spain, |CSID Case No. ARB/15/1, Award, 2 December 2019
(“Stadtwerke”); and (ii) BayWa R.E. Renewable Energy GmbH and BayWa R.E. Asset

invited the Parties to advise if there were other decision or awards rendered in
arbitrations concerning the measures challenged in this arbitration. Finally, the Tribunal
invited the Parties to inform whether they wished to file a short submission limited to
said awards.

By e-mails of 11 December 2019, both Parties agreed that filing additional submissions
on these awards was not necessary.*9 Moreover, they both noted that the award in the
Infrared case®’ had been issued. While the Claimants enclosed a copy of the award to
their e-mail, the Respondent noted that despite the fact that the existence of the Infrared
award was of public knowledge, the content of the award had not been made public
until that date. On the same day, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of both
communications and took note of their content.

On 27 January 2020, the Tribunal circulated a list containing the names of the Claimant
entities and invited the Claimants to provide a clarification regarding the names of
certain Claimant entities as well as make any other necessary corrections to the names
appearing on the list. By letter of 3 February 2020, the Claimants provided the
requested clarification and set out in Annex 1 to their letter the correct names of each
Claimant entity.

On 20 February 2020, the Tribunal informed the Parties that, having regard to Article
8.2 of the Procedural Rules and the Parties’ related correspondence, after dispatch of
the Award, it would give the Parties the opportunity to (i) request that redactions be
made to the Final Award prior to its publication to the extent necessary to protect the
confidentiality of sensitive information and to (ii) comment on the other Party’s requests
(if any). The Tribunal would then rule on any disagreement and instruct the PCA to
publish the Final Award with the necessary redactions (if any) on its website. At the
same time, it would also instruct the PCA to publish the Preliminary Award on
Jurisdiction, in conformity with the Parties’ agreement (see Claimants’ letter of 16
February 2015, p. 1; Respondent's letter of 11 March 2015, p. 3). Hence, the Tribunal
would stay in office in order to implement the afore-mentioned arrangements on
publication.

OVERVIEW OF THE DISPUTE

The present dispute concerns the Claimants’ investment in Spain’s renewable energy
(‘RE’) sector, specifically in photovoltaic (“PV”) installations representing an
approximate aggregate 239.338 megawatts (MW) of electrical power-generating
capacity. The dispute concerns the evolution of the legal framework applicable to the
PV installations and the impact it had on the Claimants’ investment. Sections III.A and
III.B summarize the evolution of the legal framework in the RE sector, which is
necessary to put the Parties’ arguments (infra at Section V) into perspective. The
purpose of the summary of the legal framework and of the Disputed Measures in
sections III.A and IlII.B is to capture the general traits of the various legislative
instruments which, unless otherwise mentioned, appear undisputed between the
Parties.

THE INVESTMENT FRAMEWORK

The 1997 Electricity Law

The main piece of legislation regulating power generation in Spain is Electricity Law
No. 54/1997 published on 28 November 1997 (the “1997 Electricity Law’). The 1997
Electricity Law divides the generation of electricity into two regimes: the “Ordinary
Regime” which concerns conventional generation facilities (i.e., non-renewable
sources) and the “Special Regime” which concerns power generation from RE sources,
including PV energy.*"

Among the key differences between the rights and obligations available to power
generators under the two regimes is the manner in which they are remunerated. While
Ordinary Regime generators receive the market price for their electricity, the
remuneration for Special Regime generators is supplemented by a State subsidy or
premium. Article 30.4 as in force at the time when the Claimants made their investments
stipulates that such subsidy shall be determined by taking into account the following
factors:52

1997), Exhs. C-16; R-3; R-238, Title IV, Chapter Il, Articles 27-31.

Electricity Law No. 54/1997 dated 27 November 1997 (published on 28 November
1997), Exhs. C-16; R-3; R-238, Article 30.4 (“El regimen retributivo de las instalaciones
de produccién de energia eléctrica en régimen especial se completara con la
percepcién de una prima, en los términos que reglamentariamente se establezcan, en
los siguientes casos”).

the level of voltage at which energy is delivered to the grid, the effective
contribution to environmental improvement, primary energy savings and
energy efficiency, economically viable useful heat production and the
investment costs incurred, in order to achieve reasonable rates of return with
reference to the cost of money in the capital market. (Tribunal’s translation)

The 1997 Electricity Law is implemented through “Royal Decrees” (“RD”).5°

RD 436/2004

RD 436/2004 of 12 March 2004 (“RD 436/2004”) was the first RD to establish an
incentive system based on a “Feed-in-Tariff (“FIT”) for investors in PV technology,
based on the criteria referred to in Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law.

In that regard, Article 22.1 of RD 436/2004 gave installation operators the option to
either sell their electricity freely on the market or at a “single, flat rate”:5>

In order to sell their output or surpluses of electric power, the operators of
installations within the scope of this Royal Decree must choose one of the
following options:

a) Assignment of the electricity over to the electricity distribution company.
In this case, the electricity sale price shall be expressed as a regulated tariff
which shall be a single, flat rate for all scheduling periods and expressed in
euro cents per kilowatt hour [i.e., a FIT].

b) Sale of the electricity freely on the market, through the system of offers
and bids managed by the market operator [...]. (Tribunal’s translation)

Whatever mechanism was chosen, RD 436/2004 purported to “guarantee to the owners
of special regime installations a reasonable remuneration for their investment and to
electricity consumers a reasonable allocation of the costs attributable to the electricity
system”.5°

See ASoC, para. 89; SoD, para. 100.

a) Ceder la electricidad a la empresa distribuidora de energia eléctrica. En este caso,
el precio de venta de la electricidad vendra expresado en forma de tarifa regulada,

razonable para sus inversiones y a los consumidores eléctricos una asignacion
también razonable de los costes imputables al sistema eléctrico [...]”).

The rate of the FIT was set out in Article 33 of RD 436/2004 and was linked to a PV
installation’s capacity. The FIT was calculated as a multiple of the consumer electricity
tariff and was available at a certain multiple for the first 25 years of the installation’s
operational life and at a reduced multiple thereafter. Further, Article 40 established the
framework for revision of tariffs, premiums and incentives for new installations. The
Claimants’ investments were not made pursuant to RD 436/2004.

RD 661/2007

RD 661/2007, which replaced RD 436/2004, is the bedrock on which the Claimants
anchor their claims. While the Parties’ specific arguments are addressed when setting
out their positions, the Tribunal reviews here certain key provisions of this RD.

According to its Preamble, one of the reasons for issuing RD 661/2007 was the need
to amend the remuneration scheme established by RD 436/2004 and separate the
calculation of the FIT from the consumer electricity tariff used until then (see supra
para. 188). At the same time and in the same vein as RD 436/2004, however,
RD 661/2007 reiterated that “[t}he economic framework established in this royal decree
develops the principles contained in Law 54/1997, [...] guaranteeing the owners of
special regime facilities a reasonable return on their investments and electricity
consumers a reasonable allocation of costs attributable to the electricity system”.5”

Towards this end, Article 24 of RD 661/2007 stipulated that Special Regime
installations could either opt to receive a single regulated tariff expressed in terms of
Euro cents per kilowatt hour (i.e. the FIT) for the sale of their electricity or they could
sell directly to the market and receive the market price.®* For PV installations that opted
for the first recourse mentioned above, Article 36 stipulated the fixed tariff that would
be payable as follows:

RD 661/2007 of 26 May 2007, Exh. C-35, Preamble para. 7 (Tribunal’s translation) (“El
marco econdmico establecido en el presente real decreto desarrolla los principios
recogidos en la Ley 54/1997 [...] garantizando a los titulares de instalaciones en
régimen especial una retribucién razonable para sus inversiones y a los consumidores
eléctricos una asignacién también razonable de los costes imputables al sistema
eléctrico”).

In other words, depending on their installed capacity, PV installations were granted a
FIT in Euro cents per kilowatt hour for the first 25 years of their operational life, and a
lower amount thereafter. The FIT was adjustable annually for inflation based on the
Spanish Consumer Price Index (“CPI”).

To be entitled to the FIT, a PV facility needed to register with the Registro Administrativo
de Instalaciones de Produccién en Régimen Especial (“RAIPRE”) before a given time
limit.5° Article 22 of RD 661/2007 provided that such time limit could be set at no less
than one year after the PV sector reached 85% of its power target of 371 MW.

Article 17 confirmed certain other rights of Special Regime installations, i.e. the right to
sell all or part of the energy produced and priority of access to the transmission grid.
Finally, Article 44 provided for the adjustment and review of tariffs. In that regard,
Article 44.3 read as follows:

In 2010, in view of the result of the follow-up reports on the extent to which
the Renewable Energy Plan for 2005-2010 and the Energy Saving and
Efficiency Plan for Spain (E4) have been achieved, as well as the new

del resultado de los informes de seguimiento sobre el grado de cumplimiento del Plan
de Energias Renovables (PER) 2005-2010 y de la Estrategia de Ahorro y Eficiencia

objectives included in the next Renewable Energy Plan for 2011-2020,
tariffs, premiums, additional payments, and lower and upper thresholds set
out in this royal decree will be reviewed, taking into account the costs
associated with each of these technologies, the degree of participation of
the special regime in meeting demand and its impact on the technical and
economic management of the system, guaranteeing reasonable returns with
reference to the cost of money on capital markets. Every four years
thereafter a new adjustment will be carried out using the above criteria.

The adjustments to the regulated tariff and the lower and upper thresholds
referred to in this section will not affect the facilities for which the start-up
document was issued before January 1 of the second year after the year in
which the adjustment was implemented. (Tribunal's translation)

The Claimants began investing in the Spanish PV sector under RD 661/2007 and, on
their case, relying on the alleged “immutability” of the incentives contained in such
decree.

Registration of the Claimants’ Facilities in the RAIPRE

The 85% threshold set for the PV sector was achieved in and around August 2007. As
a result, pursuant to Article 22 of RD 661/2007, Spain announced on 27 September
2007 that the time limit for RAIPRE registrations would expire on 29 September 2008.°"
All of the Claimants’ PV installations were registered with RAIPRE within this deadline
and accordingly fell within the purview of the benefits available under RD 661/2007.

RD 1578/2008

RD 1578/2008 was enacted on 26 September 2008, days before the time limit for
registration under RD 661/2007 expired. It set forth the economic regime applicable
to PV installations that had registered after the closure of the RD 661/2007 registration
window. For present purposes, it suffices to note that the regulated tariff granted to new
installations under this RD was lower than the one granted under RD 661/2007 and
that these tariffs did not apply to the Claimants’ installations.

THE DISPUTED MEASURES

Starting from 2010, Spain enacted a series of measures, which had the effect of
adjusting and ultimately replacing the economic incentives granted under
RD 661/2007.® These measures (the “Disputed Measures”) consisted of:

a. the “2010 Measures” comprising of RD 1565/2010 of 19 November 2010
(“RD 1565/2010”) and RD Law 14/2010 of 23 December 2010 (“RDL 14/2010”)
(infra at (1); and

b. the “New Measures” or the “New Regime” comprising of RD Law 2/2013 of
1 February 2013 (“RDL 2/2013”), RD Law 9/2013 of 12 July 2013 (“RDL 9/2013’),
Law 24/2013 on the Electricity Sector of 27 December 2013 (“Law 24/2013”),
RD 413/2014 of 6 June 2014 (“RD 413/2014”) and Order IET/1045/2014 of 16 June
2014 (the “Order on Parameters’) (infra at (2)).

The 2010 Measures

In 2010, Spain approved RD 1565/2010 and RDL 14/2010. These are the first of the
measures that the Claimants allege harmed their investment.

RD 1565/2010 (as amended by Law 2/2011) extended the higher FIT provided under
RD 661/2007 to 30 years and eliminated the lower FIT, with the consequence that
installations would sell electricity at the market rate after year 30.54

RDL 14/2010, for its part, established a limit on the number of hours per year for which
PV installations would receive the FIT (the “hours cap”).® Once an installation reached
this cap, it could continue to sell electricity but at market prices. The hours cap was
applicable throughout the life of the installation.

Without prejudice to the Respondent's arguments, this is intended to refer to the fact
that the payment made under the New Regime was not in the nature of a “FIT”.

RD 1565/2010, Exh. C-152. The Tribunal notes that RD 1565/2010 initially limited the
period for which the FIT would be available to 25 years such that from year 26,
electricity would have to be sold at market price. This period was increased to 28 years
by RDL 14/2010 (Final Provision One) and extended to 30 years by the Sustainable
Economy Act Law No. 2 of 4 March 2011 (the “Sustainable Economy Law’). See
Sustainable Economy Law, Exhs. C-164; R-57.

RDL 14/2010, Exhs. C-154; R-59, Additional Provision One, which provided a general
hours cap. It is noted that pursuant to Transitional Provision Two, a different cap was
initially applicable to the installations registered under RD 661/2007 until 31 December
2013, after which the general cap applied.

59

203.

204.

206.

Finally, on 27 December 2012, Spain approved Law 15/2012, which imposed a tax of
7% “on the production of electricity and its incorporation into the electricity system”.

The New Measures

In 2013, Spain enacted a series of measures that had the effect of withdrawing the
regime put in place under RD 661/2007. These measures are set out below.

RDL 2/2013

On 1 February 2013, Spain introduced RDL 2/2013, by which it removed certain
components of the consumer price index (“CPI”) used to adjust the FIT for inflation
under RD 661/2007.%”

RDL 9/2013

On 12 July 2013, Spain enacted RDL 9/2013, which repealed all former regulations
governing the PV sector, including RD 661/2007 and the 2010 Measures. In their stead,
it introduced a “New Regime’ for both existing and new installations.

RDL 9/2013 enacted the following changes:

a. Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law was amended “in order to narrow the scope
of action of the Government in the development of remuneration systems” for RE
facilities.°° Pursuant to such amendment, the FIT was abolished. PV installations
were now entitled to the market price supplemented by an additional amount (to
which the Claimants refer as “Special Payment’). This “Special Payment” was to be
“composed of an amount per unit of installed capacity”, which “shall cover the
investment costs [...] that cannot be recovered through the sale of energy, as well
as an amount for the operation of the installation to cover, as the case may be, the
difference between exploitation costs and the revenues obtained from the

participation of such a standard installation in the market”.®°

RDL 9/2013, Exh. R-29, Preamble, Part Il, p. 52111.

RDL 9/2013, Exh. C-302, Article 1. The Tribunal notes that the Respondent's
translation is substantially similar. (“[...] las instalaciones podran percibir una
retribucién especifica compuesta por un término por unidad de potencia instalada, que
cubra, cuando proceda, los costes de inversion de una instalacion tipo que no pueden
ser recuperados por la venta de la energia y un término a la operacion que cubra, en

60

207.

b. These investment costs were calculated by reference to the costs of a hypothetical
“Standard Installation”, envisaged as an “efficient and well-managed” company
having “the necessary means for the development of its field, whose costs are those
of an efficient enterprise in that field and considering the corresponding revenue
and a reasonable profit for the execution of its functions”.”°

c. The Government could revise the Special Payment every six years.”!

d. Further, the Special Payment was capped at “the minimum level necessary to cover
the costs [...] and [...] lead to a reasonable rate of return’.’2 Such “reasonable
return” had to be calculated on the basis of the pre-tax “average returns in the

secondary market of Spain's ten-year bonds” “increased by 300 basis points”.’5

The provisions of RDL 9/2013 were not implemented immediately and were subject to
a transitory period of 11 months. During this transitory period, “in order to maintain both
the flows of remuneration to the facilities, as well as the rest of the procedures, rights,
and obligations”, the provisions of RD 661/2007 with respect to remuneration continued
to apply. However, once RDL 9/2013 was implemented, the revenues earned by PV
installations during the transitory period were to be brought in line with the revenues
that should have been earned under the New Regime.’4

Electricity Sector Law 24/2013

On 26 December 2013, the Spanish Parliament approved Law 24/2013, which
consolidated the various legislative amendments that had taken place since the 1997
Electricity Law.’5

This Law removed the distinction between the Ordinary and Special Regime on the
rationale that “the great penetration of production technologies starting from renewable
energy sources [...] has caused its individual regulation [...] to lack any purpose”.
Rather, given the degree of technological development in the sector, it was “necessary
for the regulations to consider these installations in a similar way to the rest of the
technology integrated in the market”.’¢ In other words, Law 24/2013 aimed to bring the
two regimes at par, on the premise that RE no longer lacked the ability to compete in
the market with more conventional sources.

On this basis, the Law set up a remuneration structure along the same lines as that
introduced by RDL 9/2013.” In particular, the remuneration for the RE sector was to
consist of the market price plus a supplementary amount (the Special Payment),
calculated by reference to a Standard Installation and subject to revision every six

years.”6

At the same time, Law 24/2013 maintained priority of access to the transmission grid
for RE producers.’?

RD 413/2014 and the Order on Parameters

RD 413/2014 was approved on 6 June 2014 (published on 10 June 2014). Although
this RD sought to implement and develop some aspects of the new remuneration
regime established by RDL 9/2013 and Law 24/2013, it did not provide for the set of
remuneration parameters necessary to calculate the costs of a Standard Installation.®°
These were established by the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism (the “Ministry

of Industry”) in the Order on Parameters, which, among other things, fixed the
reasonable return for existing installations at 7.398%.®"

THE PRIMARY AND ALTERNATIVE CLAIMS

In a nutshell, the Claimants contend that relying on the economic incentives contained
in RD 661/2007 and particularly on the alleged stabilization guarantee in Article 44.3,
they invested approximately EUR 2 billion in the Spanish PV sector. According to them,
RD 661/2007 was specifically designed to attract investment and boost the RE sector.
On the basis of RD 661/2007 and of various representations and public statements
made by Spain, the Claimants had the reasonable and legitimate expectation that the
incentives granted by RD 661/2007 would remain unchanged during the lifetime of their
plants. However, once Spain had “charmed” the Claimants into making their
investments, it set about enacting a series of measures that drastically scaled back and
ultimately withdrew the incentives of RD 661/2007.

The Claimants further allege that Spain’s conduct constitutes a breach of the latter's

obligations under Article 10 of the ECT. This is, in summary, the Claimants’ “primary

claim”.

Spain’s primary defence is that the Claimants should have been aware that their
incentives were subject to an overarching “principle of reasonable profitability”. In other
words, the Claimants were only entitled to a reasonable rate of return, “applicable at
the time the Claimants made their investment”, which “was around 7%”.8? According to
Spain, the New Measures were not drastically different from the RD 661/2007 regime,
maintained all the key features of that regime, and guaranteed the same level of return.
As such, its conduct is well within its right to regulate and does not constitute a violation
of Article 10 of the ECT.

In response to the Respondent's argument that Spain “did not promise any regulated
Tariff under RD 661/2007 [and] [...] the Spanish system only allowed investors to aspire
to reasonable profitability as provided for in the [1997 Electricity Law]”,® in their Reply,
the Claimants put forward their Alternative Claim.®* More specifically, while still

maintaining their Primary Claim, the Claimants argued that “[iJn the event that the
Tribunal were to agree that the Claimants’ legitimate expectations were limited by
Spain’s concept of a ‘reasonable return’ [...] Spain still faces international liability under
the ECT”,®° because it “significantly lower[ed] the ‘reasonable return’”’.®° The Claimants

contend that, even on the Alternative Claim, they suffered significant damages.®”

Spain disagrees. In response to the Alternative Claim, Spain contends that the
Claimants continued to remain highly profitable and achieved the reasonable return
that they could have expected at the time of their investment.

REQUESTS FOR RELIEF

Also in light of these developments, the Parties’ requests for relief have evolved in the

course of the proceedings.

THE CLAIMANTS’ REQUEST FOR RELIEF

In their Reply, the Claimants sought the following relief:

[T]hat the Tribunal enter an Award in their favour and against the
Respondent as follows:

(a) declaring that Spain has violated Article 10 of the ECT, as well as its
obligations under international law;

(b) (i) requiring that Spain provides full restitution to the Claimants by
reinstating the legal framework in place at the time the Claimants made their
investments in its territory and compensating the Claimants for their losses
suffered prior to such reinstatement; or (ii) directing Spain to pay full
compensation to the Claimants for the losses they have suffered as a result
of Spain's breaches of the ECT, including pre-award interest (in both cases,

In the next sections, the Tribunal summarizes the Parties positions on the Primary
Claim and the Alternative Claim (respectively sections V.A and V.B).

THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS

As a general matter, the Tribunal notes that the Parties’ positions traverse multiple
rounds of submissions and have evolved significantly over the course of the
proceedings. Moreover, the Parties do not always correlate their arguments and
defences to those of the other side. In the circumstances, the Tribunal has organized
the following sections in a manner that it considers to best reflect the Parties’ positions.
Where appropriate, further details on the Parties’ positions are contained in the

Tribunal’s analysis.

Section V.A deals with the Parties’ positions on the Primary Claim, while section V.B

addresses their positions on the Alternative Claim.

THE PRIMARY CLAIM
The Claimants’ position
Overview

The Claimants invoke “six independent breaches” of the Respondent's obligations
under Article 10 of the ECT:

a. Spain has failed to provide “fair and equitable treatment” (“FET”). The claim for
breach of the FET provision rests on three distinct breaches, i.e. (i) breach of
legitimate expectations; (ii) unreasonable, arbitrary and disproportionate measures;
and (iii) lack of transparency (7(a), (c) and (d));

b. Spain has failed to “create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions
for Investors” (7(b));

c. Spain has impaired the Claimants’ investments through “unreasonable or
discriminatory measures” (7(e));

d. Spain has failed to ensure that the Claimants’ investments were afforded “the most
constant protection and security” (7(f)).

Investing in PV Power Generation

The Claimants submit that PV technology has been an attractive, but costly, RE option
for many years.°? In recent years, EU Member States have applied government-backed
economic incentives, also known as “state support schemes’, to promote the use of RE
by reducing its costs, increasing the price at which it is sold or otherwise increasing the
volume of energy sold.%° For the Claimants, given the start-up costs of producing PV

power, there would be no investment in this sector without investment incentives.

The Claimants explain that States use a number of different support schemes to
encourage investment in RE generation. One of the most important of such schemes
is the FIT, which is essentially a fixed tariff set above normal market rates. FITs
provide a guaranteed tariff over the long term permitting to recoup high upfront

investments.°° While FIT systems are expected to be adapted as investment expenses
go down, such adjustments can only concern new investments, which take advantage
of the lower investment costs.°”

The Claimants further explain that the capital-intensive nature of PV plant development
typically requires investors to raise substantial amounts of long-term debt, or project
financing, to fund their investments. In project finance, the borrowers can rely on a
steady stream of revenue which the asset will generate over a long period of time to
service the debt. Such reliance is particularly important because of the non-recourse
nature of project finance deals. The Claimants allege that most of the Claimants’
installations used project finance in their development.°®

Background of Spain’s Electricity Sector

The Claimants explain that the 1997 Electricity Law granted Special Regime generators
priority access to the Spanish electricity transmission and distribution network. This
meant that ordinary regime generators could not sell their electricity to the distribution
grid until Special Regime generators had sold all their supply.9® The Claimants submit
that for them such priority access to the grid was a key attraction of Spain’s regulatory

framework. 1°

The Claimants further contend that Spain’s active efforts to attract foreign investment
in RE was the product of (i) binding EU obligations to meet RE consumption targets
arising in particular from the UNCCC and the Kyoto Protocol, and (ii) the new
Government's objective to present Spain as a global leader in green energy. They also
stress that Spain does not dispute that its international commitments were a key driver
behind its actions to promote and encourage investments in RE power generation
installations, including PV plants.1°"

In particular, among the EU instruments that the Claimants allege required Spain to
reach certain RE targets, the Claimants discuss the 2001 EU Directive for the

Promotion of the Use of Energy From Renewable Resources (the “2001 Renewable

Energy Directive”);°? various reports and communications from the European
Commission;'°° and the 2009 Directive on the promotion and use of energy from
renewable sources, amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and
2003/30/EC (the “2009 Renewable Energy Directive”).1°

The Claimants contend that Spain’s EU-mandated duty to build RE capacity was taken
up with enthusiasm by the Government of Prime Minister Zapatero that came to power
in 2004.'° This was not only because the Government wanted to meet the EU
obligation but because Spain viewed RE production as a means of transforming its
economy, by reducing reliance on foreign energy supply, becoming a net exporter of
energy, and creating jobs. Consequently, the new Government's economic policy was
focused on the construction of green infrastructure and the creation of green jobs.1°6 In
furtherance of this policy, the Government set about providing investors with incentives
for building RE capacity.

Against that background, so the Claimants argue, on 12 March 2004, Spain enacted
RD 436/2004.1°” According to the Claimants, RD 436/2004 introduced for the first time
an incentive system based on a lifetime FIT, replacing the previous scheme, which had
provided that RE could be sold at market prices plus a premium. For the Claimants,
Spain “introduced a stabilisation commitment aimed at creating the desired long term
stability that was necessary to attract investment”.'°° This said, the Claimants specify
that the RD 436/2004 FIT was originally subject to fluctuations linked to changes of
consumer tariffs, which entailed a lack of predictability, resulting in turn in a lack of
investment." This flaw was remedied in 2006, through the “freezing” of the consumer

tariff pursuant to Royal Decree Law No. 7/2006.''' Yet, even these actions did not
generate the expected level of investment.''? It therefore became necessary to
consider enhancements in the incentives provided.

According to the Claimants, the framework for these enhancements was laid in the Plan
for Promotion of Renewable Energies in Spain 2005-2010 or “PER 2005-2010”,
prepared in 2005 by the /nstituto para la Diversificacién y Ahorro de la Energia (“IDAE”),
an advisory governmental body that reports to the Ministry of Industry."'? The PER
2005-2010 provided recommendations to further increase investment in RE, and
especially the PV sector, in light of the poor results achieved under RD 436/2004. After
analysing the barriers to PV development, the PER 2005-2010 recommended that the
Spanish electricity regulators maintain the regulated remuneration for PV installations;
continue to grant such remuneration for the lifetime of a PV installation in order to attract
project finance, and that Spain increase its PV installed capacity targets by an
additional 363 MW (from the target of 135 MW set under RD 436/2004).'* The
Claimants contend that the PER 2005-2010 demonstrates Spain’s awareness that
development of the PV sector would require a long-term and stable cash flow through
the FIT.

According to the Claimants, the ensuing RD 661/2007 finds its roots in these

recommendations."

RD 661/2007 and the Claii legiti i as to its i {
application

The Claimants submit that, in enacting RD 661/2007, Spain was implementing the
recommendations contained in the PER 2005-2010 and seeking to induce further
investments into its RE sector, given that previous regimes had failed to attract
sufficient investments.'"® The enactment of RD 661/2007 marked a change from the
incentives provided by RD 436/2004.17

The Claimants allege that they made their investments in reliance on the incentives
contained in RD 661/2007. In particular, they expected that they would be entitled to
sell all the electricity produced by their PV plants at the FIT provided in RD 661/2007.
Moreover, due to the express “stabilization commitment” contained in Article 4.3 of
RD 661/2007, the Claimants further expected that any future changes to the FIT regime
would only apply to new installations and not to those that already qualified under
RD 661/2007.

i. RD 661/2007 conferred an economic right upon the Claimants

The Claimants submit that RD 661/2007 granted qualifying PV installations an
“immutable economic right” to, inter alia, a fixed premium indexed on inflation for all of
the electricity generated by their PV facilities during the entire operational lifetime."®
They argue that, when commenting on the draft of RD 661/2007, the National
Commission of Energy (“CNE”) had stressed the importance of “regulatory stability to
recover investments, maintaining regulated tariffs during the service life of existing
facilities (with a transparent annual adjustment mechanism)”."'°

Once a PV plant had registered with the RAIPRE through the relevant Autonomous
Community where the PV plant was located within a one-year period (i.e. prior to
29 September 2008), it was entitled to receive all the economic incentives of
RD 661/2007, including and especially the FIT.12° The Claimants submit that each of

anterioridad a la fecha limite establecida en el articulo 22”). The Claimants further note
that Article 17 of RD 661/2007 only subjects the rights set out therein to Article 30.2 of
the Electricity Law, and not to Article 30.4 (on which, according to the Claimants, Spain
relies to justify the changes based on the reasonable return concept). See C-PHB1,

the Claimants’ individual plants received a government resolution confirming their
specific entitlement to the RD 661/2007 FIT, which fact is not disputed by Spain.121

The Claimants also contend that RD 661/2007 set no limit to the quantities of electricity
entitled to the FIT. The FIT was owed for the operational life of the plant, i.e. 25-40
years.'?? Specifically, each plant would receive the FIT at a particular rate depending
on its capacity during its first 25 years of operation. Thereafter, the FIT would continue
at a lower rate for the remaining life of the plant.’ The RD 661/2007 regime also
implied that electricity distributors were required to buy all the electricity produced by
PV installations at the FIT, the latter thus having priority over producers in the ordinary
regime.'*4 More importantly, while the Claimants recognize that RD 661/2007 did not
provide a perpetual tariff, they insist that any tariff adjustments would only apply to new

investments.125

The Claimants stress that none of them would have made the investments had they
believed that the PV investment framework was subject to changes that could affect

existing investments.176

It is the Claimants’ submission that RD 661/2007 conferred upon duly-registered
installations a guaranteed right comprising of “(i) the ability to sell all of an installation's
electricity output; (ii) at a fixed FIT rate; (iii) billed and collected on a monthly basis; (iv)
revised yearly for inflation; (v) for the lifetime of the installation; (vi) without any review
or alteration to the FIT rate or term”.'2” This is demonstrated by the text of the decree;128
by the fact that it provided qualifying PV installations with a FIT for the lifetime of the
installation;'?° by the benefits it bestowed upon qualifying installations; and by the fact
that the review process for the RD 661/2007 FITs would commence in 2010, without
affecting installations already holding timely RAIPRE certificates.1°° In addition,

Article 44.1 of RD 661/2007 established a mechanism to update the FIT in order to
account for inflation.19"

The Claimants have emphasized the relevance of two provisions in RD 661/2007,
Article 22 (infra at ((a)) and Article 44.3 (infra at (b)). They have also asserted that
RD 1578/2008, a regulation issued after RD 661/2007, strengthened their expectations
and confirmed that Spain shared these expectations at the time (infra at (c)).

(a) The “tariff window” in Article 22

The Claimants indicate that RD 661/2007 did not intend to apply the Article 36 FITs to
all future facilities. Rather, in accordance with Article 22, as soon as 85% of the
production target for any energy group or sub-group had been reached, the Secretary
General for Energy was to set a period within which facilities had to obtain final RAIPRE
registration in order to be entitled to the tariffs under RD 661/2007. This registration
period could be no less than 12 months.'S? The Secretary General for Energy issued
the resolution on 29 September 2007, confirming that FITs under RD 661/2007 would
apply as long as a facility was registered prior to 29 September 2008, i.e. the end of
the tariff window.'%°

For the Claimants, Article 22 would be devoid of meaning if Spain had remained free
to change the FIT subsequently in respect of existing facilities. Similarly, it would serve
no purpose for the Secretary General to set a final registration date under RD
661/2007.14

(b) Interpretation of Article 44.3

The Claimants further invoke Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007 (reproduced supra at para.
194) in support of their argument that the FIT regime provided in RD 661/2007 was not
subject to changes with respect to existing investments.

September 2008 would be maintained”.

Accordingly, so say the Claimants, a review of the FITs would be carried out in 2010,
at the end of the planning period set out in the PER 2005-2010 when Spain anticipated
that it would reach its capacity goals, and thereafter every four years. The success of
RD 661/2007 in prompting investments in the PV sector resulted in that review taking
place in 2008.95 However, Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007 made it clear that any revisions
stemming from these reviews would not apply to existing installations.'%¢

The Claimants also observe that in 2010 the CNE itself understood this provision to
“contain one of the criteria most relevant to the current regulation of the Special Regime
in relation to legal certainty and stability of the economic regime”.'°” Furthermore, the
CNE noted that economic incentives had to be set considering the costs of the
technology installed."*° Consequently, it proposed a reduction in the tariff for new PV
installations. However, according to the Claimants, Spain subsequently abandoned this
review process by implementing the Disputed Measures. "9

The Claimants object to Spain’s argument at the Hearing on Liability that “Spain would
stand by 44.3 while the law in which it is encapsulated is in force, but Royal Decree
661 can be modified or repealed, at which point 44.3 would not apply”.'4° Such an
approach would render Article 44.3 meaningless and essentially constitute an
admission that Spain “fraudulently induced investment”.'41

Furthermore, it would make no sense if Spain was permitted to make changes “through
the backdoor” by claiming that the reviews fall outside of the scope of Article 44.3, as
this would defeat the purpose of including Article 44.3 in the first place.'4? In addition,

the Claimants rebut Spain’s argument that “the registration for RD 661/2007 was closed
and the two year window for registration under article 44.3, that was supposed to take
place in 2010, never applied” by arguing that, whether the tariff window was closed in
September 2008 or January 2012, Articles 44.3 and 22 still provided that any changes
to the FIT would not apply to existing investments.'4° In any event, contrary to Spain's
claim that the 2010 review did not take place, the CNE confirmed that the review did

occur. 44

(c) The relevance of RD 1578/2008

In the Claimants’ view, RD 1578/2008 enacted in September 2008 further evidences
that their expectations were legitimate and shared by Spain.'45 Indeed, RD 1578/2008
applied only to installations registered after the window deadline of 29 September 2008.

The Claimants also point to the Fifth Additional Provision in RD 1578/2008 which reads

as follows:

Fifth Additional Provision. Modification of the remuneration for production
activity using photovoltaic technology

In 2012, in light of the technological growth of the sector and the market and
the operations of the payment regime, payment for the activity of electricity
production using solar photovoltaic technology may be modified. (Claimants’
translation)'4°

For the Claimants, this provision has the same “intent” as Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007
as was confirmed by a CNE report of 22 October 2009 in response to a question from
a member of the public.14”

The Claimants explain that, since the FIT would automatically decrease at certain
points for new investments only, it was not necessary to state in the Fifth Additional

Provision that future changes would not apply to existing investments. Thus, like
Article 44.3, that provision aimed at providing certainty to investors by informing them
that a new payment system for PV may be set in 2012 affecting newly built plants
registered after that date.'46

ii. RD 661/2007 was designed to attract third party financing

The Claimants further highlight that RD 661/2007 was designed to attract third party
financing.'*° They argue that this is obvious from the design of RD 661/2007, which
provided that qualifying PV installations be paid on a monthly basis through invoices
issued by the CNE, which were then paid by electricity distributors, thus allowing
investors to manage their cash flow in a predictable way.'®° The design of the FIT also
matched the needs of project finance loans, which typically have a term of 18 to
25 years.'5' Further, the PER 2005-2010 acknowledged that approximately 77% of RE
investment would be financed by long-term loans from third party lenders.'®? In sum,
RD 661/2007 was “well suited to recovering invested capital, obtaining a return on
invested capital, and attracting the necessary financing for major investment”.155

iii. Spain actively encouraged foreign investment in the PV sector and made

repeated representations on the economic regime of RD 661/2007
In addition, the Claimants submit that Spain actively encouraged foreign investment
into its PV sector through advertising materials, including English-language brochures
and presentations, emphasizing the stability of its investment framework and the nature
of the investment incentives that its regulations offered. The Claimants have in
particular discussed the following documents (both pre-dating and post-dating the
enactment of RD 661/2007):15°

k. The February 2010 CNE presentation by Mr. Fernando Marti Scharfausen,
confirming that RD 661/2007 provided a “warranty by law” to investors that no
retroactive changes would be made.'®”

These documents, so the Claimants argue, reflect Spain’s own understanding that the
RD 661/2007 would apply to all qualifying installations during the entire life of the plants
and that any changes, if ever made, would not affect existing installations. As such,
these documents constituted further assurances contributing to the Claimants’
expectations that Spain's regulatory framework for PV investment would not shift."
The Claimants also emphasize that none of these documents, presentation or
brochures contained any disclaimers.'”°

Finally, the Claimants argue that, when effecting their investments in the PV sector,
they also relied on Spain’s reputation as a safe place to invest, as Spain was a Western
European country and EU Member State with a track record of protecting foreign

investments.1”'

Registration of the Claimants’ PV facilities

The Claimants contend that RD 661/2007 was so successful that in a short time the
installed PV technology far exceeded the targets set by the PER 2005-2010 and the
371 MW target envisaged by RD 661/2007. They add that, as a direct result of RD
661/2007, Spain hit the 85% threshold in a matter of months, in August 2007. As a
consequence, Spain announced on 27 September 2007 that the time limit for RD
661/2007 registrations would expire on 29 September 2008.72

Finally, the Claimants agree with Spain that the announcement of 27 September 2007
set off a “race”, motivating investors to invest in the PV Sector before the deadline.
According to the Claimants, the obvious implications of such a “race” is that “everybody
in the market, including all reasonable investors, understood that installations that met
the deadline [...] would lock in the right to receive the RD 661/2007 FIT”.175

The Disputed Measures

The Claimants submit that Spain frustrated their legitimate expectations that the RD
661/2007 regime would remain stable by enacting a number of measures, which
curtailed the incentives under RD 661/2007 and then withdrew them entirely.

i. The 2010 Measures
(a) RD 1565/2010

The Claimants argue that RD 1565/2010'” eliminated the right of PV installations to
receive the FIT for their entire life, limiting the FIT to the first 25 years of operation.”
This substantially reduced the revenues that investors could have realized as promised
under RD 661/2007. Furthermore, RD 1565/2010 augured a new era of regulatory
instability and was the first indication that Spain would ignore the key promises it had
made to investors when promoting its FIT regime.1”

The Claimants reject Spain’s formalistic argument that RD 1565/2010 does not
contravene the literal wording of Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007 because the latter
provision refers to “the reviews to this sub-section of regulated tariff’ and not to a review
of the duration during which the tariff would apply.'”” Cutting the number of years during
which a tariff applies has the same economic effect as cutting the tariff itself.17°

(b) RDL 14/2010

The Claimants contend that RDL 14/2010'7° placed two separate caps on the number
of hours during which PV installations could access the RD 661/2007 FIT.1®°

First, RDL 14/2010 placed a transitory cap lasting from 1 January 2011 until the end of
2013.18! The Claimants allege that this was a drastic change, as under RD 661/2007,
a PV installation was paid for its full electricity production during the entire calendar
year.'®? That transitory cap also failed to take account of regional differences, which
resulted in a disproportionate impact on the more efficient PV plants located in sunnier
regions.‘®> Once a PV installation reached its cap for the year, it was required to sell its
additional production into the wholesale electricity pool at market rates, like
conventional power generators in the ordinary regime (although still with priority of
dispatch).164

Second, upon its expiry in 2013, the transitory cap was replaced by a permanent one
for the remainder of the FIT entitlement of PV installation (which was extended to 28
years under RDL 14/2014 and to 30 years by Law 2/2011).185

The Claimants allege that, while the transitory cap of RDL 14/2010 applied, they
experienced a dramatic reduction in the production of FIT eligible electricity. As a
consequence, their cash flows dropped and the uncertainty facing the investments
increased."®° They refute Spain’s argument that, because the PER 2005-2010
contained estimates of the number of operating hours for PV installations (on the basis
of which Spain determined the FIT), PV investors should have reasonably expected
that there could be a reduction in the operating hours for which they would be entitled
to the FIT."8” They submit that the RD 661/2007 FIT applied to every kilowatt hour of

electricity and not only for the hours estimated in the PER 2005-2010 (on which the FIT
was based).'88

It is the Claimants’ further submission that, through a series of regulations, including
RDL 14/2010, Spain acknowledged the harm it had caused to PV investors and
attempted to compensate for that harm, which however was ineffective.'®° For the
Claimants, these attempts at compensation showed the seriousness of the harmful
measures that Spain had enacted in RDL 14/2010, as well as the unreasonableness of
its seemingly improvised and arbitrary regulatory actions.1°°

The Claimants point to RDL 14/2010 extending the right of access of the PV
installations to the RD 661/2007 FIT from 25 to 28 years.'*' The three-year extension
was at the original, higher FIT rate, but still subject to the permanent caps.'%? The
Claimants’ position is that thereby Spain reinstated a small portion of what it had taken
away by enacting RD 1565/2010.'%°

Further, so the Claimants remark, the Sustainable Economy Law (i.e. Law 2/2011)
further prolonged the entitlement to the FIT by two years to 30 in total at the higher FIT
rate (although again subject to the permanent hour cap).'% This law also extended soft
loans or liquidity lines of credit through the /nstituto de Crédito Oficial (“ICO”), thus
recognizing that the 2010 Measures had negatively impacted the financing obtained by
PV investors.19°

(c) Conclusion on the 2010 Measures

The Claimants submit that the 2010 Measures had a direct impact on the cash flows of
the plants and, therefore, on their ability to service the debt. Moreover, they caused a
reduction in the value and potential resale value of the Claimants’ assets.

ii. Law 15/2012

On 27 December 2012, Spain passed Law 15/2012, imposing a 7% levy on income
obtained by generators, renewable or otherwise.‘

The Claimants maintain that although they “are not bringing any claims with respect to
damages suffered as a result of the 7% levy”, this measure is “part of the factual
background of the dispute, providing additional details of the array of measures the PV

Investors were subject to during recent years”.1°”

For the Claimants, this 7% levy amounts to a disguised tariff cut for RE installations
and an additional limitation to the RD 661/2007 regime. As such, it cannot be regarded
as bona fide taxation of general application.'°° The fact that the levy is in reality a tariff
cut presented in the form of a “tax” is confirmed by statements from the then Minister

for Industry Jose Manuel Soria.'°9

The Claimants contend further that the 7% levy had a disproportionate impact on RE
compared to conventional generators. This is because the former operate in a
regulated regime and cannot pass on the 7% levy to the consumers, whereas the latter
can do so at least in part when selling electricity in the open market.2

According to the Claimants, the damage caused by the 7% levy is now subsumed within
the more substantial damage caused by the New Regime. The 7% levy may be
considered neutral within the framework of the New Regime, but it is “not neutral to
installations that qualified under the RD 661/2007 economic regime, where the 7% Levy

was not in place”.

Shortly after the enactment of Law 15/2012, Spain adopted additional measures which
limited the Claimants’ right to deduct certain financial expenses from the application of

corporate income tax.20?

iii. The New Measures
(a) RDL 2/2013

The Claimants submit that RDL 2/2013 enacted on 1 February 201379 removed key
components of the CPI used to adjust the FIT for inflation under RD 661/2007.2% The
index replacing the CPI reduced the FIT for PV plants by about three percentage
points.205

For the Claimants, Spain’s argument that the new index is “well established in
worldwide economic doctrine” is besides the point.2°° What matters is that it is not the
index that Spain committed to use under RD 661/2007.7°? The Claimants argue that
Spain changed the index to remove the price of oil from the underlying calculation,
based on the belief that such price would continue to rise.2°° Contrary to such belief,
the price of oil fell, with the result that the new index was higher than the CPI.2°9 For
the Claimants, this unexpected turn of events in no way justifies the measure, even if it
may have benefitted the PV plants in certain periods.?"° In any event, contrary to what
Spain contends, the new index did not benefit the Claimants in 2015, as the indexation
disappeared entirely with the enactment of the New Regime.2"

(b) RDL 9/2013

For the Claimants, RDL 9/2013, which was enacted on 12 July 2013712 and amended
the 1997 Electricity Law, revoked RD 661/2007 in its entirety for RE installations.2*° The
Claimants assert that the New Regime so introduced applied not only to new
installations, but also to existing ones.?"4

The Claimants explain that, by contrast to the previous one, the New Regime is a rate-
base system that applies a percentage return to the costs for specific standard projects,
instead of measuring actual costs.2'5 In particular, according to the Claimants, RDL
9/2013 eliminated the FIT regime and, instead, introduced a system based on the
Special Payment. Unlike the FIT, which is solely based on energy production, this
system is only based in part on energy production, and is calculated by reference to
the Government's “standard installation’, which bears no resemblance to the
Claimants’ PV plants.?'°

Further, the amount of the Special Payment “will not go beyond the minimum level
necessary” to provide what the Government considers to be a “reasonable return”.2'”
This concept, so the Claimants submit, no longer operates as a “floor” but rather as a
cap to the Special Payment.2'® The “reasonable return”, measured by reference to the
10-year Spanish sovereign bonds plus a differential (300 base points in the case of
existing facilities), is set at 7.398%.7'9 This return is calculated over the deemed
regulatory life of the plant, i.e. 30 years, is computed pre-tax and takes account of the
remuneration obtained under RD 661/2007.22°

The Claimants further explain that, under the New Regime, returns achieved under
RD 661/2007 in excess of the reasonable return defined in RDL 9/2013 will be
deducted from payments to be received in the future. In other words, this measure is
fully retroactive as it claws back payments under the old regime.22' The Claimants note

that Spain does not dispute that the New Regime “claws back” past revenues by
offsetting future ones.222

Moreover, the Claimants emphasize that the Special Payment is subject to
governmental discretion and its parameters may be changed “every six years”, which
makes the operation of PV plants highly uncertain.225

(c) Law 24/2013

On 26 December 2013, the Spanish Parliament approved Law 24/2013,2%4 which, so
say the Claimants, introduced further harmful measures.?75 In particular, such law
removed the distinction between Ordinary and Special Regimes; it placed conventional
and RE generators on an equal footing, depriving the latter of the unconditional priority
access to the grid and dispatch.??6 It also imposed on renewable installations the
obligation to finance the accrued tariff deficit, i.e., the imbalance between revenues and
costs in the electricity system.?2”

The following months, the Claimants argue, were characterized by complete
uncertainty as neither RDL 9/2013 nor Law 24/2013 defined the precise terms of the
New Regime.2# The Claimants refer to this period from July 2013 to June 2014 as the
“Transitory Period”.

ASOC, paras. 285, 302-304. The Claimants explain that renewable energy installations
are meant to receive monthly assessments with the total amount of the Special
Payment, but they only receive the full Special Payment if there are sufficient revenues
in the Electricity System. That is to say, the Government only pays the Special Payment
to otherwise qualifying generators if the State (the Electricity System) has sufficient
funds to do so. Otherwise, the renewable energy generator only receives a partial
monthly payment with the possibility of recovering outstanding amounts later on during
the year. If at the end of the year the Government remains unable to pay the total
amount of the Special Payment to the renewable energy generator, the outstanding
amount becomes part of the Tariff Deficit and the renewable energy generator will no
longer recover the amounts in question (ASoC, para. 303, discussing Law 24/2013,

(d) RD 413/2014 and the Order on Parameters

On 6 June 2014, the Government passed RD 413/2014729 and on 16 June 2014 the
Order on Parameters,?°° which specified the economic regime for the different RE

installations, including PV plants.

(e) Content of the New Regime

For the Claimants, the New Regime represents a complete overhaul of the FIT regime
under RD 661/2007, as a result of which the Claimants’ installations were placed in a
position much worse than under RD 661/2007. The New Regime undermines the very
foundation on which the Claimants made their investments, namely a stable and
predictable revenue stream at levels sufficient to service the debt, provide a return on
investment, and justify the significant risks incurred.251

The Special Payment is composed of a remuneration per MW of installed capacity and
a remuneration per MWh of electricity produced, seeking to cover the operating costs
that cannot be met by market prices.2*? It is also subject to certain thresholds of

operating hours.?3?

Specifically, the Claimants submit that the New Regime negatively affects their
investments in three main ways. First, Spain’s “repudiation” of the RD 661/2007
economic regime results in a significant reduction of cash flows, because the PV
projects no longer enjoy the FIT?54 and the Special Payment is only payable if the
electricity system generates sufficient revenues.?°5 Second, the Claimants argue that
the new terms deprive them of incentives to maximize day-to-day production
throughout the year.°6 Third, the PV projects face increased financial, operational and

regulatory risks.” The loss of the FIT has in particular affected the investors’ “ability to

meet their debt obligations, which has manifested itself differently across the Claimants’
projects” .236

Unlike what Spain argues, the Claimants deny that the New Regime provides them with
a “reasonable return”.2°9 First, the 7.398% return is pre-tax rate, i.e. equivalent to
5.179% after tax.24° Moreover, it operates as a cap on returns.”41 Second, Spain
contradicts itself when it argues, on the one hand, that producers may obtain higher
returns if they beat the parameters of the standard installations, and, on the other hand,
that such higher returns were objectionable under RD 661/2007.24? Third, the concept
of reasonable return itself is subject to change in light of the broad discretion left to the
Government.7? Finally, the Claimants challenge the transparency of the
implementation of the New Regime. The Transitory Period left PV investors in the dark
as to the precise level of remuneration for existing installations.4 In support, they point
to a statement made by the European Commission in July 2015 noting the legal
uncertainty created by the Transitory Period.45 In this context, the Claimants also
observe that the Government ultimately used its own parameters to calculate the
Special Payment, notwithstanding the fact that it had instructed two independent
consultancy firms, Roland Berger and Boston Consulting Group, to assist in the
determination of the Special Payment.”46 The Claimants further complain that the PV
industry was not consulted about the parameters of the New Regime.”47

On the basis of these facts, the Claimants allege breaches of Article 10 of the ECT and
contend that Spain's defences are without merit.

Spain’s conduct breached the ECT
i. The Disputed Measures frustrated the Claimants’ legitimate expectations
(a) Scope and content of the obligation

The Claimants submit that pursuant to Article 26(6) of the ECT, the treaty itself is the
primary source of law applicable to the merits of the dispute and determines the
standards of protection available to an investor against the actions of the host State
and whether those obligations have been breached. Customary international law
principles, although relevant, only apply where the ECT is silent and therefore are a
secondary source of substantive law.48

The ECT, being an international treaty, “must be interpreted in good faith in accordance
with the ordinary meaning given to its terms in their context and in light of the ECT's
object and purpose”.*° The Claimants submit that investments in the energy sector
involve high-value long-term commitments in projects that cannot easily adapt to the
vagaries of legal and political changes. Consequently, the ECT’s fundamental objective
is “to facilitate transactions and investments in the energy sector by reducing political
and regulatory risks”.2°° According to the Claimants, the ECT seeks to accomplish this
objective in two ways. First, by requiring Contracting States to maintain a stable,
predictable and transparent legal and regulatory investment framework. Second, by
offering more robust levels of protection than ordinary bilateral investment treaties,?5"
subject to very few exceptions with respect to a host State’s right to regulate.*52

For the Claimants, a central tenet of Spain’s obligation “to accord at all times to
Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment” is to
refrain from conduct that defeats the legitimate expectations on which an investor relied
at the time of making its investment. In order to determine whether legitimate

expectations have been created, the Claimants submit that regard must be had to the
conduct of the host State, including (i) the legal order of the host State at the time when
the investment was made (inter alia “legislation and treaties, and assurances contained
in decrees, licences and similar executive assurances or undertakings”);?>4 and (ii) “any
undertakings or representations made explicitly or implicitly by the host State”.255

(b) The Claimants’ legitimate expectations

The Claimants submit that, when they invested in the Spanish PV sector, they had
reasonable and legitimate expectations that the legal and business environment would
remain stable and predictable. Specifically, they expected that their projects would be
entitled to the economic incentives promised by RD 661/2007 for their entire
operational lifetime and that any future revisions to these incentives would not affect
their investments.”5° This expectation was created by (i) the explicit guarantees and
assurances made by Spain in the text of RD 661/2007 (on which see supra V.A.1.d)
and (ii) the numerous public statements made by Spain and various entities, regarding
the application of the regime. Moreover, these expectations were shared by other
investors in the RE sector, as well as lenders, legal advisors and energy consultants.2°”

The Claimants assert that Spain gave rise and reinforced the Claimants’ expectations
by making repeated statements regarding the stability of the legal regime during the
period in which the Claimants invested. That apart, various Government entities and
officials — such as IDAE, CNE/CNMC and InvestInSpain — made numerous
representations to the same effect both before and after the approval of RD 661/2007,

which confirm the legitimacy of the Claimants’ expectations (set out in detail at Section

V.A.1.d.iii above).75* According to the Claimants, these representations “estop Spain
from now claiming that it reserved the right to dismantle the RD 661/2007 regime”.25°

In particular, the Claimants contend that the statements made by various Governmental
entities — specifically CNE, CNMC,?°° IDAE and InvestInSpain — are attributable to
Spain.”6' In this respect, they argue that the relevant actions of CNE / CNMC, IDAE
and InvestInSpain are attributable to Spain pursuant to Article 4 of the International
Law Commission Draft Articles on State Responsibility (“ILC Articles”), as these entities
qualify as organs of the State.?® In the alternative, the Claimants submit that CNE /
CNMC’s actions are attributable to Spain pursuant to Article 5 of the ILC Articles,
because these entities were empowered to and did exercise governmental functions.2
In the further alternative, the Claimants argue that the acts of CNE, CNMC, IDAE and
InvestInSpain are attributable to Spain under Article 8 of the ILC Articles, i.e. these
entities acted in accordance with Spain’s instructions or under its direction and

control.264

Finally, in the Claimants’ view, a number of other actors shared their expectations on
the application of RD 661/2007, which demonstrates the objective nature and
reasonableness of their expectations. They refer to other investors,2° such as

(c) | Spain’s breach of the Claimants’ legitimate expectations

The Claimants submit that based on the expectation that their projects would be entitled
to the economic incentives promised by RD 661/2007 for their operational lifetime and
that any future revisions would not affect their investments, they invested close to
EUR 2 billion in the Spanish PV sector. However, in disregard of these expectations,
Spain enacted the measures that fundamentally altered, and subsequently withdrew,
the legal and regulatory framework on which the Claimants had relied to make their
investment. The Claimants’ arguments on the effects of the Disputed Measures are
summarized in Section V.A.1.f above. According to the Claimants, this overhaul of the
economic incentives regime, constitutes a clear violation of Spain’s FET obligation
under the ECT.27°

ii. Spain failed to create stable investment conditions

As a separate breach,2”' the Claimants assert that the first sentence of Article 10(1) of
the ECT requires Spain to “create stable, equitable, favorable and transparent
conditions” for investment, which is a heightened obligation, beyond the FET obligation
found in other treaties.

The Claimants clarify that whether the obligation is considered a sub-set of the FET
standard or an independent obligation Spain must maintain stability such that future
changes to the legal framework are (i) predictable; (ii) do not alter the fundamentals of
the legal framework on the basis of which the investment was made; and (iii) do not
fundamentally alter the economics of the investment absent the payment of

compensation.?”2 Consequently, according to the Claimants, continuous changes in the
legal framework applicable to an investment, which undermine the stability and
predictability of the business and legal environment or keep the investor in the dark as
to the framework that will eventually be applied, constitute a breach of this standard.2’°
The Claimants specify that in alleging a breach of this obligation, they do not posit that
Article 10(1) is a stabilisation clause requiring States to freeze their legislation or
curbing the State’s legitimate right to regulate.

According to the Claimants, Spain has violated its obligation to provide stable
investment conditions by unreasonably modifying the legal framework.2’4 In essence,
Spain subjected the Claimants’ investments to a “rollercoaster ride” of constant and
drastic changes in the regulatory framework ultimately dismantled the RD 661/2007
regime. In doing so, Spain reneged on the promises given under RD 661/2007 and
consequently breached its obligation to provide stable investment conditions pursuant
to Article 10(1).2”5

iii. The Disputed Measures are unreasonable, arbitrary and disproportionate
(a) The Disputed Measures are unreasonable

The Claimants submit that a State’s conduct is reasonable, when it relates to a rational
policy and, in implementing that policy, adopts acts that are appropriately tailored to the
pursuit of that rational policy, with due regard for the consequences imposed on
investors.2”6 In other words, the ends and the means to those ends must both be
reasonable.

The Claimants further submit that, in order to meet this threshold, Spain must first
identify a rational policy goal that it sought to achieve by enacting the Disputed
Measures and then show that the Disputed Measures were reasonably related to or
appropriately tailored to addressing these policy goals, always keeping in mind the
consequences for the Claimants. It is readily apparent, the Claimants say, that the
Disputed Measures did not meet this threshold.2””

First, each of the Disputed Measures was unreasonable because they imposed
retroactive incentive cuts for existing investments. According to the Claimants, given
the nature of investments in PV installations (requiring large upfront capital expenses
and relying on debt financing), a long term FIT was necessary to enable the Claimants
to service their debt and receive a return on their investment, with the result that a
significant cut in the FIT, wiping out the return and making it impossible to recoup initial

expenses, was unreasonable.?”8
Second, the Disputed Measures were not tailored to meet stated policy goals:

a. No specific explanation or rationale was provided for RD 1565/2010. To the extent
the measure sought to address the “growth in recent years in the number of electric
power installations within the Special Regime” and “additional technical requisites”
needed to guarantee the operation of the electricity system and facilitate the growth
of RE technologies, the Claimants consider that the decrease of the FIT effected
by RD 1565/2010 was not the appropriate mechanism to achieve these goals.2’°

b. Similarly, the severe and permanent cut to the FIT introduced by RDL 14/2010 was
inappropriate to address the stated policy behind the introduction of this measure
ie. to remedy, the tariff deficit. According to RDL 14/2010, the tariff deficit was
caused by the fall in electricity demand, the fluctuation in fuel prices and “favourable
weather”. The Claimants contend that all three circumstances were temporary,
were not caused by the Claimants’ installations, and did not alter the costs of the
installations. It was therefore unreasonable to subject the Claimants’ investments
to a cut in the FIT on this basis.78°

c. Further, the cancellation of the mechanism whereby the FIT indexed for inflation on
the basis of the CPI was also unreasonable. This is because the index used instead
provided for a lower FIT only in order to reduce the income of the existing

installations.26"

d. Moreover, the rationale behind the New Regime was unreasonable. The alleged
justification for the further cut to PV tariffs in 2013 was that “(1) ‘the volume of rainfall

and wind conditions have been much greater than historical averages’; and (2)

there had been a 2.3% fall in electricity demand”.”° The Claimants explain that PV
installations were protected against a demand risk because they had priority access
to the transmission grid. Accordingly, a reduction in demand (which is in any event,
temporary) cannot justify the permanent abolition of a regulatory regime. That apart,
say the Claimants, “it is absurd to change a long-term guaranteed FIT regime
because the weather has changed”, especially when an increase in rainfall would
reduce the amount of PV energy produced.” Additionally, the New Measures were
not implemented with due regard to the impact on existing investors.7** Finally,
assuming that the policy rationale behind the New Measures was justified, the CNE
had recommended a suit of proposals to address the tariff deficit, which were
reasonable and did not affect the FITs for existing installations. In other words, it
was possible to adopt other remedies that were adequately shaped to achieve the
policy rationale, with more limited impact for the Claimants. However, the
Government largely ignored these proposals and implemented the New Measures
instead, without taking into account the devastating consequences for existing PV

installations.285

(b) The Disputed Measures are arbitrary

The Claimants contend that the standard for determining if a measure is arbitrary is
reasonableness. In other words, measures that are not based on reason will be
deemed arbitrary. On this basis, the Claimants contend that the Disputed Measures
are arbitrary for the same reasons that they are unreasonable.”®° For the Claimants,
Spain’s proposed threshold for arbitrariness is artificially high. Nevertheless, the
Claimants view the Disputed Measures as arbitrary even when assessed against
Spain's standard.28”

Finally, the Disputed Measures are arbitrary for other reasons as well, in particular
because:

a. They artificially cap the number of years for which the Claimants’ PV installations
will receive benefits to 30 years, when in reality, the operation life of PV plants is
longer.

b. The cap on the number of hours for which benefits are granted is arbitrary, as the
same cap applies across Spain, without regard to the sunlight received in the
different regions.

c. Spain has not explained how it arrived at a target rate of return of 7.398% pre-tax,
which rate is, in any event, unreasonable.?

(c) The Disputed Measures are disproportionate

A State breaches the FET standard if it adopts measures disproportionate to the aims
pursued. This implies that measures must be (1) suitable; (2) necessary; and (3)
proportionate to the aim pursued. The Claimants argue that the Disputed Measures
satisfied none of these characteristics.?°°

The Disputed Measures were not suitable because attacking the PV sector was not the
solution to the tariff deficit problem, which existed before Spain induced the Claimants
to invest and which was caused by the Spanish Government's failure to set electricity
prices at a level that was sufficient to cover the costs of the system. Further, as there
is no evidence that the Claimants were earning exorbitant revenues, the suitability of
the Disputed Measures cannot be defended on the ground that they sought to
rebalance the costs and incomes of the electricity system.2°°

The Disputed Measures were not necessary; other more reasonable and less harmful
measures were available to address the tariff deficit.2°

The Disputed Measures were not proportionate either as they have drastically reduced
the Claimants’ cash flows, brought their project companies to the verge of insolvency,
and wiped out the returns that the Claimants ought to receive.?°2

iv. The Disputed Measures were not transparent

Article 10(1) of the ECT requires a State to “encourage and create [...] transparent
conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area”.
The Claimants submit that Spain’s conduct in dismantling the RD 661/2007 regime
lacked transparency because (i) the 11-month Transitory Period left PV producers in
the dark as to what would happen next; (ii) the criteria underlying the New Regime and
future revisions were not explained; (iii) Spain could change some parameters of the
standard installation without its methodology being known; (iv) neither is a methodology
for reviewing the Special Payment established; and (v) similarly, there is no transparent
methodology for determining whether a plant has achieved reasonable profitability.29°

In response to Spain’s contention that it acted transparently, the Claimants put forward
the following:

a. Spain failed to consult the affected parties prior to enacting the Disputed Measures.
The most significant measures, i.e. RDL 14/2010 and RDL 9/2013, were introduced
without any dialogue with the PV sector. Spain’s argument that these RDLs were
designed for emergencies and do not allow for consultation, is an excuse.?94

b. Spain’s reliance on reports issued by CNE in 2012 and 2013 to argue that the
introduction and implementation of the New Regime was transparent is misplaced.
Spain ignored the recommendations in CNE’s 2012 report. Consequently, the
public consultation that was undertaken for this report was “at best pointless and at
worst a sham”.2°5 As regards the 2013 Reports, these were issued after the New
Regime was introduced by RDL 9/2013 and could not have influenced that
regulation. In any event, the consultation process for these reports “had not
guaranteed the effective participation of affected parties”.29°

c. Similarly, the Memorandum issued by the Ministry concerning the June 2014
Ministerial Order rejected the “619 submissions from companies, industrial
associations, and Autonomous Communities” merely on the basis that the Order

complied with RDL 9/2013 and Law 24/2013 (both of which had been implemented

without consultation).29”

In sum, the Claimants assert that Spain’s conduct was plainly not in conformity with the
transparency requirements under the ECT.2°8

v. The Disputed Measures have impaired the Claimants’ investments

Article 10(1) of the ECT provides that Spain “shall [not] in any way impair by
unreasonable or discriminatory measures th[e] management, maintenance, use,
enjoyment or disposal” of Claimants’ investments. Thus, to establish a breach of this
obligation, it suffices to show that the measures in question were either unreasonable
or discriminatory. The standard of reasonableness, according to the Claimants, is that
the State’s conduct must bear a reasonable relationship to some rational policy.2%9 In
other words, as with the FET standard of reasonableness discussed above, Spain must
show that its measures were: (a) taken in pursuance of a rational policy goal; and (b)
carefully tailored to achieve that goal.5°°

In light of that standard, the Claimants reiterate the grounds on which they assert that
the Disputed Measures were unreasonable. In sum, they contend that the remediation
of the tariff deficit, cannot be a policy goal that justifies interference with the Claimants’
investment. They submit that the tariff deficit was caused by Spain’s persistent failure
to set consumer prices at a level that was high enough to cover the actual costs of the
Electricity System. As a consequence, enacting measures that are harmful to the PV
sector to finance the result of several years of regulatory malfeasance is arbitrary and

unreasonable.°°"

 

vi. The Di: 1 Me iolated the pr ion and security
obligation

Finally, the Claimants argue that Spain breached the obligation to provide their
investments constant protection and security. In particular, they claim as follows:

This obligation requires Spain to provide legal security to Claimants’
investments. It is breached where a change in the legal framework makes it
impossible for an investor to preserve and continue its rights associated with
the investment. The obligation has been breached here as the Disputed
Measures have caused Claimants to lose their right to the FIT.°°? (internal
footnote omitted)

Spain’s defences are without merit

The Claimants contend that Spain’s defences are ill-founded and contradicted by the
evidence.

i. Spain’s first defence: the RD 661/2007 regime was not guaranteed

According to the Claimants, Spain’s key defence is that they had no objectively
reasonable expectation regarding the RD 661/2007 regime because they should have
known that the incentives granted to them were subject to an overarching “principle of
reasonable profitability” (or “reasonable return”) found in the 1997 Electricity Law.2°?

For the Claimants, Spain’s reliance on that principle is misplaced. The 1997 Electricity
Law did not define reasonable return. It merely outlined the factors for determining the
specific remuneration that would provide investors with a reasonable return. Such
reasonable return had to be implemented through regulation. In RD 661/2007, Spain
implemented the reasonable return principle by providing for specific remuneration in
the form of a long-term FIT.5% In other words, RD 661/2007 represented what Spain
considered a reasonable return in compliance with the principles of the 1997 Electricity
Law at the time of the Claimants’ investment.*°5

At the same time, the Claimants do not deny that Spain had the power to adjust the
RD 661/2007 economic regime as costs of investment came down. According to the
Claimants, this makes economic sense. However, as provided in Article 44.3 of
RD 661/2007, any adjustments in remuneration could not affect existing installations.°°

Finally, the Claimants argue that most countries with FITs use concepts similar to
reasonable return in order to calculate FITs. However, reasonable return is a concept
aimed at the regulator, not at investors; it is the basis upon which the regulator

calculates the tariff. Thus, under RD 661/2007, the regulator determined what the return
necessary to induce investment.°”” This being so, an efficient investor with operating
costs below those assumed by the regulator would earn a higher return than the one
used to set the FIT. In the Claimants’ view, this is perfectly admissible and even
expected .2°8

ii. Spain’s second defence: Spain did not make a specific commitment

Spain’s second defence is that it made no commitment sufficiently specific to prevent
it from enacting the Disputed Measures and that, absent such specific commitments,
no legitimate expectations can arise. According to the Claimants, it is incorrect that
legitimate expectations can only arise out of a specific commitment given by the host
State to the investor, much less that such a commitment must be embodied in a
contract containing a stabilization clause. While specific assurances may reinforce an
investor's legitimate expectations, they are not indispensable. Guarantees included in
general laws can give rise to legitimate expectations as well.°°9

For the Claimants, “[i]t is obvious that RD 661/2007 contained a number of express
commitments on which Spain intended investors to rely”.5'° First, Article 22 confirmed
that installations that registered within the tariff window locked in the right to the tariff;
second, Article 36 provided a specific tariff for 25 years and beyond; and third, Article
17 confirmed the right to obtain the FIT upon obtaining a RAIPRE certificate. These
commitments created expectations, which were crystallised when the Claimants
obtained RAIPRE certificates confirming their entitlement to the RD 661/2007 FIT.
Spain reinforced such expectations by guaranteeing that changes to these incentives
would not apply retroactively (under Article 44.3, which is an “express stabilisation
commitment” according to the Claimants*"') and by repeatedly confirming its intention
as to the application of RD 661/2007.5"? Alternatively, assuming that a specific
commitment by the host State is required to generate legitimate expectations, the
Claimants observe that the provisions referred to above did constitute specific promises
and representations.

Refuting Spain’s argument that Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007 is not a stablisation clause
and that, in any event, it was not breached, the Claimants make the following points:

a. Article 44.3 is evidently a stabilisation clause as its terms were specific enough: it
expressly stated that revisions to the FIT would not affect installations that had
qualified before the review. Moreover, this commitment was made specifically to
those installations that had obtained their RAIPRE certificates within the term

prescribed.315

b. Spain’s argument that Article 44.3 has not been breached because the changes
introduced did not constitute a “tariff review” but the introduction of a new
remuneration format is flawed. Spain cannot get around the plain language of
Article 44.3 by claiming that its actions are outside the purview of Article 44.3. This
is precisely the sort of abusive and bad faith State conduct against which the FET
standard protects investors.°"4

c. Spain's further argument that Article 44.3 has not been breached because RDL
14/2010 and RDL 9/2013 did not change the numeric amount of the tariff but only
introduced an hours cap and a modification of the system of remuneration, is
equally flawed. Both measures had an effect comparable in magnitude to the
reduction in the original FIT.2'®

iii. Spain’s third defence: the Claimants’ returns were capped at 7%

At the outset, the Claimants submit that this defence “is perhaps the most extravagant
of all Spain's defences since it comes in two contradictory forms”: on the one hand
Spain asserts that the reasonable return was capped at 7% and, on the other, it argues
that the reasonable return was dynamic. According to the Claimants, neither position is
supported by the evidence. °°

The first piece of evidence on which Spain relies to support the existence of a 7% cap
is the Memoria Econémica. The Claimants submit that the Memoria Econémica was
not a public document. They cite the testimony of one of Spain’s experts, Mr. Greatrex,

C-PHB1, para. 197.

who testified that he saw the Memoria for the first time in 2012.31” Moreover, for them,
the statement made by Spain’s other expert, Mr. Olivas, at the hearing that the Memoria
Econémica was distributed to the RE associations was new and unsubstantiated.5"®
When the Claimants requested the Memoria as part of the regulatory dossier of
RD 661/2007 during the document disclosure phase, Spain agreed to produce it
without suggesting that it was publicly available (contrary to what it did in respect of
other documents).319

The Claimants add that the Memoria does not state that changes to RD 661/2007 will
be made. It merely provides that the tariff set out in RD 661/2007 aims at providing PV
investors with an after tax return of “approximately 7%”, without suggesting that this
operates as a cap.°?° On the contrary, the word “approximately” makes clear that the
Memoria recognized that investors could earn in excess of 7%.°21

The second piece of evidence on which Spain relies is the PER 2005-2010. The
Claimants point out that the reference to 7% in the PER 2005-2010 relates to all RE
technologies and not just the PV sector. Moreover, the PER also refers to returns of
“around 7%” after tax, which again speak against a cap. Additionally, the Claimants
point out that the PER was not consistent with the Memoria. While the reference to 7%
in the PER relates to all RE technologies, the Memoria provides different figures
(ranging from 5% to 11%) for different types of RE technologies. In other words, so
argue the Claimants, there was no clear or consistent indication that reasonable
profitability meant 7% only.°22

Moreover, Spain’s reliance on the testimony of its expert MG8&A, is of no assistance as
MG&A admitted during the hearing that there was no cap on returns under
RD 661/2007.°5

In addition, the Claimants note that the reference to 7% in the Memoria and the 7.398%
return supposedly offered by the new regime relate to two qualitatively different
concepts. RD 661/2007 provided the remuneration based on production and

incentivized installations to produce as much electricity as possible, while the new
regime supposedly provides a 7.398% return irrespective of the production.324

The “dynamic return” theory, so say the Claimants, also lacks a basis. The Claimants
acknowledge that the reasonable return would have to change over time as the cost of
investments went down. However, the Claimants submit that “Spain has failed to
provide any evidence that the cost of money on capital markets had changed between
2007 (when RD 661/2007 was passed) and 2013 (when the New Regime repealed RD
661/2007) thus necessitating a change under the ‘dynamic’ return theory”.525 In any
event, even if such a change was necessary, Spain was estopped from altering the rate
of return for existing investments.276

iv. Spain’s fourth defence: the Claimants were receiving “luxury profits”

The Claimants submit that Spain has presented no evidence to prove that the
Claimants were receiving “exorbitant remuneration” or “luxury profits”. They contend
that the absence of evidence demonstrating that the Claimants were earning excessive
returns is fatal to Spain’s case, as without such evidence the reasonable return defence
has no foundation.22”

v. Spain’s fifth defence: the Claimants did insufficient due diligence

The Claimants contend that they carried out sufficient due diligence, which considered
the relevant jurisprudence of the Spanish Supreme Court and confirmed their right to
receive the FIT.

For the Claimants, their due diligence was thorough and included requests for advice
from numerous reputable law firms.*?8 None of these firms suggested that Spain could
make retroactive adjustments to RD 661/2007.°?9 If Spain’s argument were correct, the
Tribunal would have to find that all of the law firms in Spain acted negligently by failing
to inform investors and banks that RD 661/2007 could change retroactively.2°°

vi. Spain’s sixth defence: Supreme Court jurisprudence supports Spain’s
case

The Claimants disputes Spain’s reliance on a number of Supreme Court judgments,
which allegedly hold that Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007 cannot be interpreted as a
stabilization commitment. These Supreme Court decisions relate to a different
economic regime and a different period. Hence, they are irrelevant to determine
whether the Claimants had a reasonable and legitimate expectation that no retroactive
changes would be made.

First, the Claimants submit that the vast majority of the judgments invoked by Spain
were issued after the Claimants made their investment and can thus not be taken into
account to assess the Claimants’ legitimate expectations.°*' Only four of the judgments
were in existence when the Claimants made their investments.*°2 However, the dicta
contained in these judgments cannot be deemed to override the contrary statements
by Spain in respect of RD 661/2007, especially since these judgments do not deal with
RD 661/2007.295

The Claimants further remark that no decisions pre-dating the Claimants’ investments
discuss Article 40.3 of RD 436/2004.5* In particular, the Supreme Court judgments of
2005 to 2007 refer to installations that did not have the benefit of the tariffs specified in
RD 436/2004 and were not subject to the “stability commitment” at Article 40.3.5°5

Second, the three Supreme Court judgments of December 2009 invoked by Spain,
which address challenges arising from the replacement of RD 436/2004 by
RD 661/2007,3 could not have informed the Claimants’ expectations at the time of the

investments. Indeed, so the Claimants argue, their investments were finalized (or were

in the process of completion) before these judgments were rendered in December
2009.%%7 In any event, they do not help Spain’s case, because RD 661/2007 was a vast
improvement over its predecessor RD 436/2004. Therefore, the change from one
regime to the other could not have indicated that the Government would implement
retroactive tariff cuts such as the Disputed Measures.*°°

By contrast, the Claimants rely on a Supreme Court decision of 20 April 2016, in which
the Supreme Court held that, once a PV plant was registered, its owners had legitimate
expectations to receive the FIT for which they were registered.*°° The Claimants
observe that the plaintiff in that case was an investor who had attempted to register an
installation in the RD 1578/2008 pre-assignment register. RDL 1/2012 then came into
force on 28 January 2012, implementing a moratorium that suspended the registration
of all new RE installations in the Special Regime. This suspension prevented the
plaintiff from registering its installation in the pre-assignment register of RD 1578/2008
and from receiving the RD 1578/2008 FIT.*4° The Supreme Court upheld the claim
considering that “the regulatory change that Royal Decree-Law 1/2012 entailed was
surprising and that it broke the principle of legal certainty by suspending the payment
pre-allocation procedures’, and that RD 1578/2008 had “created some solid
expectations for the owners of the installations that they would obtain registration in
that Registry and the corresponding payment for their energy in the terms provided”.*"
In the Claimants’ view, this decision shows that the Supreme Court fully recognizes
their expectations.*42

vii. Spain’s seventh defence: the Disputed Measures were justified

In the Claimants’ submission, Spain has offered various “errant and inconsistent
justifications for the Disputed Measures”, none of which are defensible.*° In particular,

address the tariff deficit; (b) to protect consumers; and (c) to address EU state aid
guidelines.544

(a) Tariff Deficit

For the Claimants, the main reason for the implementation of the Disputed Measures
was Spain’s desire to tackle the tariff deficit. A number of contemporaneous
documents, such as a 2012 CNE Report*5 and the preamble to the laws and
regulations introducing the Disputed Measures indeed refer to the need to remedy the
tariff deficit.54° In the Claimants’ view, Spain is reluctant to admit that the tariff deficit
motivated the Disputed Measures, because Spain itself caused the deficit and it would
thus acknowledge that it breached the ECT.

The Claimants argue that the tariff deficit, like the over-capacity in the PV sector,54” are
issues of Spain’s own making, which existed long before Spain enacted RD 661/2007.
The tariff deficit was the product of Spain’s failures to follow its own laws; it was not a
policy goal that justified interference with the Claimants’ legitimate expectations.54°

Initially, so say the Claimants, the tariff deficit emerged out of a series of miscalculations
about the costs and fluctuations in supply and demand.**° Subsequently, RDL 6/2009
set limits on the growth of the tariff deficit each year and required the Ministry to fix the
network access tolls at appropriate rates. However, this was not done because the
Government chose to keep artificially low electricity prices for electoral reasons.2°°
Similarly, the tariff deficit grew because the Government gave a high number of
electricity consumers, essentially all Spanish households, the benefit of the so-called

Reply, paras. 289-294; PO12 C-PHB2, paras. 274-276.

The Claimants argue that Spain’s first justification for RDL 14/2010 measures was over-
capacity of the PV sector, which would ultimately have the effect of growing the tariff
deficit. However, for the Claimants, the main reason for the over-capacity was the
decentralized authorization and registration system which Spain put in place and which
was centered around the Autonomous Communities, rather than on a sole central
control authority such as the Ministry. See ASoC, paras. 323-324.

TUR (tarifa de ultimo recurso, tariff of last recourse), i.e. a price designed to shield
consumers from dramatic increases in the market price of electricity.°5"

Furthermore, the Claimants argue that Spain ignored all of the CNE’s reasonable
proposals to address the tariff deficit.°* They refer in particular to a CNE Report of
March 2012, which identified measures to effect savings in the electricity system,

without cutting the FIT and without imposing excessive costs on the consumers.35?

Finally, it is the Claimants’ position that there is no evidence of causation between the
tariff deficit and the cost of the Special Regime (i.e. the PV premiums), contrary to what
Spain argues.*54

The Claimants conclude by noting that the Spanish Supreme Court has issued several
judgments and two sets of interim measures holding that Spain’s failure to comply with
the requirements of RDL 6/2009 was a clear violation of Spanish law.2>

(b) Protection of consumers

The Claimants further submit that Spain's argument regarding the protection of
consumers appears to have been raised solely for the purposes of this arbitration, as
the only stated purpose of the measures was to address the tariff deficit.55° Indeed,
Spain's policies show the opposite to a concern to protect consumers. In effect, Spain
increased the VAT on electricity to 21% (when it was as low as 4% or even nil for other
products and services at all). It also levies special tax on producers, all of which raises
the price of electricity for consumers.35”

(c) State aid rules

The Claimants submit that the EC Decision on State Aid issued on 10 November
201758 has no bearing on the present dispute.

First, the Claimants argue, contrary to Spain, that there is no evidence to support the
proposition that the New Measures were required to comply with applicable EU State
aid rules.*°9 In that regard, they note that the EU guidelines being invoked post-date
the Disputed Measures;*® Further, State aid was never mentioned as a purpose of the
Disputed Measures.**! In any event, the Claimants contend that EU law did not require
Spain to withdraw the economic regime, particularly not with respect to plants that
operate under that regime.

Second, the Claimants submit that, contrary to Spain’s contentions, the EU Decision
could not affect the Claimants’ legitimate expectations about the Original Regime, as it
did not address that regime at all.5°? The Claimants note Spain’s (and the EC’s)
argument that a beneficiary of unlawful aid cannot entertain legitimate expectations
regarding such aid. In response, the Claimants contend that the non-notification of
RD 661/2007 does not undermine their legitimate expectations, for the following

reasons:

a. Asa preliminary point, the Claimants’ legitimate expectations have to be adjudged
under the ECT and not under EU law;38

b. In any event, RD 661/2007 did not constitute State aid under EU law as FIT
schemes financed by the end consumer, such as those under RD 661/2007, are
not regarded as State aid;3

c. Spain itself did not consider the RD 661/2007 FIT to be State aid. Otherwise, it
would have notified the EC. Moreover, there is no contemporaneous evidence
showing that RD 661/2007 was viewed as unlawful State aid. In other words, Spain

had no expectation that the Original Regime was State aid, much less that it was
unlawful;36

d. Further, like Spain, the EC did not deem the RD 661/2007 FIT to constitute State
aid. The Claimants point out that the EC monitored Spain’s RE support schemes at
all times and was therefore on notice of the provisions of RD 661/2007. However,
although it had suo motu powers to examine unlawful aid, the EC made no
suggestions that the RD 661/2007 FIT was State aid at all, let alone that it was
unlawful or incompatible;36*

e. Inconclusion the Claimants contend that upholding Spain’s argument would permit
Spain to benefit from its own wrongdoing, which cannot excuse Spain from liability
under international law. Even assuming that the RD 661/2007 FIT did constitute
State aid, it would still be compatible with EU law. This is because the Decision
makes no finding on the RD 661/2007 FIT, when it could have done so, which
shows that the EC “was content that the RD 661/2007 FIT was compatible State

aid” 367

Third, the Claimants stress that a “finding of compatibility with EU law [does not] jpso
facto also amount to a finding of compatibility with the ECT”, as the relevant standards
under the two treaties are different.2°

Finally, the Claimants deny Spain’s contention that compensation awarded by the
Tribunal on the basis that Spain modified the Original Regime, would constitute State
aid. They submit that the Commission's statement to this effect at paragraph 165 of the
EU Decision is not binding on the Tribunal.*°9

vi Spain’s eighth defence: the Claimants have suffered no loss

The Claimants find this defence “absurd”.3”° They have substantiated their losses in
their evidence,°”' which losses caused the insolvency of many projects.°”? In any event,
the Claimants add, the PO12 phase, “definitively confirms” that each of the Claimants
suffered substantial losses.37? Moreover, the CNMC itself confirmed that the New
Regime reduced the remuneration and return of RE installations.3” In addition, Spain
claims that the Measures were intended to cut the tariff deficit and address the over-
remuneration of PV plants. The fact that the tariff deficit showed a surplus in 2014 as a
result of the New Regime demonstrates that the Measures have caused the Claimants

significant losses.575

The Disputed Measures have been criticized and challenged

The Claimants also argue that the Disputed Measures were the object of strong
domestic and international criticism, not only by PV industry associations and the
banking sector, but also by Spain’s own organs and the European Commission.3”° In
particular, three of Spain’s Autonomous Communities brought legal challenges to RDL
14/2010 on constitutional grounds, arguing that such RDL frustrated the rights of
Special Regime generators and violated norms of legal certainty and predictability. The
Constitutional Court dismissed those challenges without examining the merits as in the
meantime the New Measures had overtaken RDL 14/2010.377

Furthermore, Spain’s Senate recognized the harm caused by the hour caps in RDL
14/2010 and passed amendments to repeal such caps. These amendments were,

however, rejected by the Congress of Deputies.3’8

Moreover, the 2010 Measures were criticized by the European Commission, which, so
the Claimants assert, took issue with some retroactive and opaque changes to the
regulatory regime made by some Member States.3’9 The Commission also started
infringement proceedings against Spain for failing to communicate the type of
measures that it intended to adopt in order to implement the European Directives and
achieve the 20-20-20 target.%®° Finally, certain Autonomous Communities brought
constitutional challenges against the New Measures.**1

The Tribunal has a duty to decide consistently

Finally, the Claimants contend that the Tribunal should uphold the Primary Claim in line
with its duty to ensure the “the harmonious development of international investment
law”.5®? They submit that over 30 ECT claims have been filed against Spain as a result
of its repeal of RD 661/2007 via the Disputed Measures. At the time of their last
substantive pleading (i.e. PO12 C-PHB2), seven tribunals had issued final awards, five
of which had “found that Spain had violated the investors’ legitimate expectations and
ordered damages”.*8° According to the Claimants, the two awards that did not find a
breach of the ECT (Charanne and /solux) were outliers that arose from facts peculiar
to those specific cases.

In the circumstances, as no “compelling contrary grounds” exist in the present case,
the Claimants assert that the Tribunal “must follow the consistent line of cases” on
issues of liability as well as damages, “find Spain liable for violating the ECT”, and
“award damages on the basis that the RD 661/2007 FITs would have continued, but

the Primary Claim. In the alternative, the Claimants advance their so-called Alternative
Claim, which is addressed below (infra, at V.B.1).

The Respondent’s position

Spain submits that the Claimants have failed to show a breach of Article 10(1) of the
ECT.

The Claimants could not legitimately expect the stabilisation of RD 661/2007
i. The content of the legal standard and the scope of the Tribunal’s enquiry

At the outset, Spain notes that the FET standard in Article 10(1) of the ECT places a
very high burden on the Claimants to demonstrate the existence of a breach. In
particular, the FET standard is breached only by conduct that is,

arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and

exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of

due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety - as

might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial

proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an

administrative process.2®>
According to Spain, the terms just set out require “something more” that raises the
Respondent's actions from “the perceived unfairness occasioned by many
governmental actions that do not rise to a breach of international law’, to those which

constitute violations of international law.2®°

In the circumstances, Spain asserts that the Claimants’ inquiry on legitimate
expectations focuses on the wrong question. The issue is not what tariff the Claimants
were entitled to, i.e., either the FIT under RD 661/2007 or reasonable return. Rather,
given that the Claimants’ case is that Spain breached the ECT by enacting the Disputed
Measures and changing the applicable rules, “the central legal question is whether
Spain was free to amend its own laws”.°®7 In other words, the issue in dispute is whether
the Claimants could have legitimately expected the “petrification” of the law.

As a preliminary point, Spain asserts that there is a presumption in international law
that a State is free to amend its laws. It is from this starting point that the Tribunal must

commence its assessment of the Claimants’ legitimate expectations. In other words,
Spain alleges that it is for the Claimants to prove that RD 661/2007 established an
exception to this rule.58°

ii. Spain’s regulatory framework in the electricity sector

Because it finds the Claimants’ presentation of the legal regime incomplete,*°? Spain
has offered a comprehensive overview of its electricity system.°°° Spain explains that
the Spanish electricity system (the “SES”) forms an “economic, technical and legal
system”,°°' which is governed by the following principles:

a. Itis a “system”, characterized by a strong inter-dependency between its actors. The
various elements relating to generation, transmission, distribution and
commercialization of electricity are interconnected through common mechanisms
of control;392

b. The supply of energy is a service of strategic importance and of “general economic

interest’ °°

c. The principal objective of the system is to guarantee that all consumers have
access to electricity on conditions of equality and quality;5%¢

d. The system's economic viability is based on the principle of financial self-
sufficiency. Accordingly, there is no recourse to Spain’s state budget in case of
a deficit, which can only be remedied by increasing income or reducing costs;3%

e. Following the entry into force of the 1997 Electricity Law, the sector was partly
liberalized and now regulated and liberalized activities co-exist.5%”

Spain adds that the legal regime governing the SES comprises of hierarchically
structured laws and regulations, primary among them the 1997 Electricity Law. The
1997 Electricity Law establishes two basic principles in respect of remuneration

payable to RE installations under the Special Regime:5%°

a. Premiums for the Special Regime are a cost of the SES linked to its sustainability;
and

b. Premiums should be set at a level that allows the Special Regime installations to
achieve a reasonable return or reasonable profitability by reference to the cost of

money in capital markets.

In a nutshell, Spain submits that the subsidies granted to RE producers under the
Special Regime represent a cost to the system that has to be balanced against the goal
of ensuring the overall sustainability of the system. This means that if the subsidies and
incentives result in an imbalance that threatens sustainability, then the regulator can
legitimately adjust the remuneration to avoid over-compensation. In other words, the
very nature of the SES should have alerted the Claimants to the fact that the FIT was
not “petrified” for life.599

In that regard, Spain contends that between 2007 and 2010 the installed capacity of
the PV sector grew exponentially and surpassed all growth predictions made when
determining the remuneration regime under RD 661/2007. As a result, the cost of
subsidising the PV sector (by paying the FIT) also grew significantly and became the
main cost of the SES.4° Spain alleges that it attempted to account for the higher costs
by increasing the consumer electricity price and amortising the tariff deficit. It increased
the price of electricity on 11 separate occasions, for a total of 70%.4°! However, despite
the high price of electricity, the revenues did not cover the growth of the costs. This
resulted in a tariff deficit that posed a serious threat to the sustainability of the SES.4°?

This situation was exacerbated by the global financial crisis that purportedly put Spain’s
economy into recession. According to Spain, during and because of the economic

crisis, electricity demand fell and it was no longer reasonable for Spain to continue
increasing the price of the electricity paid by consumers.‘ These factors combined to
create an imbalance that put the SES on the brink of collapse. In these circumstances,
Spain claims that it was obliged to make changes to the legal framework, which was
clearly envisaged in the 1997 Electricity Law and under Spanish law generally.*%

iii. The principle of reasonable profitability

As a general theme stressed throughout its pleadings, Spain puts forward that the
Claimants could only aspire to “reasonable profitability”.

(a) Reasonable profitability as a cornerstone of the SES

Spain states that systematic regulation of the RE sector, including PV, began with the
1997 Electricity Law, which introduced the concept of “reasonable profitability” as an
element in the determination of remuneration of RE facilities. In this context, Article
30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law neither provides for a petrification of the legislation nor
for a perpetual tariff. It also does not state that the tariff or premiums granted by relevant
regulations shall represent “reasonable profitability’.°° Rather, Article 30.4 merely
indicates that that the premiums established through RDs from time to time will ensure
that operators’ remuneration does not fall below a threshold that permits investors to
achieve reasonable profitability.4°° Different regulations that implemented Article 30.4,
especially RD 661/2007, reaffirmed the principle of reasonable profitability.

With regard to RD 436/2004, Spain underlines that even this regulation stressed the
basic importance of reasonable profitability as part of the incentives system.*°” The
incentive scheme incorporated by RD 436/2004 - whereby the FIT was linked to the
amount of consumer electricity tariff - was based on the principle of reasonable
profitability and did not grant “a petrification of the incentives/subsidies during the entire
lifetime of the installation” 4°

381.

Reasonable profitability was of fundamental importance also in RD 661/2007. In
support, Spain points to the text of this decree and in particular its preamble.4°
Moreover, paragraph 1 of Section 44.3, when referring to the circumstances that must
be taken into account when modifying the incentives provided, reiterates that a
“reasonable rate of profitability shall always be guaranteed with reference to the cost

of money in the capital market”.41°

Thus, in Spain’s view, RD 661/2007 did not guarantee the immutability of the incentive
scheme over the course of time. Rather, it supplemented a scheme meant to provide

reasonable profitability.

Hence, nothing in the laws and regulations governing the PV sector prior to and during
the time the Claimants made their investment suggests that the incentive scheme was
frozen or that the FIT was guaranteed. The Claimants should thus have known that the

incentives could be adapted to ensure reasonable profitability.41"

(b) Reasonable profitability is a dynamic concept

Spain asserts that the concept of reasonable profitability is based on the prior work of
the regulator, which acknowledges an economic cost structure, defines the income
necessary to pay for that structure and to adequately remunerate the investor for its
capital.412

For the Respondent, profitability must be measured regardless of the premium that the
regulatory framework may have awarded at a given time. Hence, it makes no sense to
compare the situations under the New Regime with the one existing when the facility
was built.4 Thus, according to Spain, reasonable profitability is necessarily a dynamic
concept.4"4 What is reasonable today may not be so in 30 years under different

economic circumstances.*®

Spain argues that reasonable profitability must allow an investor to recoup investment
expenses (Capex) and operating expenses (Opex) and obtain a profit in line with

market criteria. The alignment with market criteria meets the triple objective of (i)
remunerating the investor proportionately, so that it can compete with conventional
energies; (ii) guaranteeing electricity supply at an efficient cost for consumers; and (iii)
making the SES sustainable.*'® In particular, Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law
guarantees an adequate balance between the cost to consumers and the investors’
profit, which is also indicated in the “Stated Purpose” of RD 661/2007.4"” Thus, if the
principle of reasonable profitability constitutes a point of equilibrium, it must have the
dynamism required to adapt in case of over- or under-remuneration.*1® Such dynamism
is reflected in the use by the 1997 Electricity Law of the cost of money in the capital
market,‘"9 as a “benchmark” to judge the reasonableness of the profitability. Because
the cost of money fluctuates according to macroeconomic parameters and monetary
policies, reasonable profitability is necessarily dynamic.‘?° Like Article 30.4 of the 1997
Electricity Law, Law 24/2013 only offers investors in renewables rates of return by
reference to the cost of money in the capital markets. In particular, Law 24/2013 links
the reasonable return to the evolution of the Spanish state bonds.‘2"

Further, according to Spain, the regulatory framework of the SES is fully consistent with
the Spanish constitutional principle of normative hierarchy. That principle permits the
introduction of regulatory changes, which do not alter the principles of the SES set forth
in the 1997 Electricity Law.‘?? Spain also argues that there is no provision in the entire
Spanish energy legal framework that guarantees a particular remuneration that is
unlimited and perpetual. Moreover, the FIT system is one incentive for renewable
energies among others, including tax incentives or green certificates.

In any event, even based on the Claimants’ argument that reasonable profitability “must
be the reasonable profitability applicable at the time the Claimants made their
investment”, with which Spain initially appeared to agree,‘”* the Respondent submits

See Rejoinder, para. 260 (where the Respondent, discussing the Claimants’ Reply,
para. 152, notes that “the Claimants make a statement in their Reply, with which Spain
concurs. They state that reasonable profitability ‘[...] must be the reasonable
profitability applicable at the time the Claimants made their investment.’ Spain does not

that reasonable profitability at the time when the Claimants invested in Spain was
around 7%. In support, Spain invokes the Memoria Economica of the draft decree that
was to become RD 661/2007, prepared by the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and
Energy.**4 According to the Memoria Economica, plants up to 10 MW would receive a
remuneration of “approximately 7%”, and plants above 10 MW would have a return
lower than 7%.46

Spain argues that the Memoria Economica was publicly available. Although it was not
published in the Spanish Official Gazette, every party showing a legitimate interest
could request access to it.476 It would have been the minimum diligence expected from
sophisticated investors like the Claimants,‘?” to request access to materials related to
the preparation of RD 661/2007. Associations representing PV energy producers,
including the one of which the Claimants are members, had full access to the Memoria
Economica and “even submitted comments on the case file”.42® The Respondent also
points to the testimony of the representatives of one of the Claimants, Mr. Barrueco,
who confirmed at the hearing that he had seen the Memoria Economica.4?°

The PER 2005-2010, so the Respondent notes, also referred to a return of 7%.4°°

Spain argues that the 2013 Measures provide for a return of 7.398%, which can be
exceeded by an efficient plant “as the parameters of costs considered in the regulation
are quite generous”.*%> Thus, under the New Regime, the Claimants can aspire to a
higher return than the one deriving from RD 661/2007.4*4 According to Spain, this
shows that the adaptations made by the New Regime were permitted, proportionate,
legitimate, and reasonable and did not violate the Claimants’ legitimate expectations.

iv. The RD 661/2007 regime was not immutable

It is Spain submission that the Claimants could have no expectation that the
remuneration fixed by RD 661/20007 would remain unchanged over time.*%5 An
immutable FIT applicable on a permanent and unlimited basis would be contrary not
only to Spanish and EU law, but also common business sense.*%°

(a) _ The interpretation of Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007

Spain argues that Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007 (reproduced supra at para. 247) does
not entail a “petrification” of the regulatory framework.4%” It contends that the review
process envisaged in Article 44.3 refers to “potential reviews that had to be made in
view of the reports regarding the level of compliance with [the PER 2005-2010], and in
accordance with the new capacity targets of the RREE plan”.49°

In particular, it explains that read in its entirety and with specific reference to its first
subsection, Article 44.3 provides for revisions to take place every four years (starting
in 2010) if a series of conditions are met,*°° and for the sole purpose of meeting the
targets for the implementation of the successive plans to foster RE.44°

However, so the Respondent continues, the “special revisions” envisaged in Article
44.3 never occurred because, among other things, the targets of the PER 2005-2010

Rejoinder, para. 271.

Rejoinder, para. 271.

Rejoinder, para. 29.

Rejoinder, para. 31.

R-PHB1, paras. 68-102. Spain raises these arguments in the context of what it
characterises as “Spanish Law’. Separately, Spain also argues that Article 44.3 does
not constitute a stabilization clause under international law, which will be addressed
subsequently.

Rejoinder, para. 108. See also ibid., paras. 901-903.

395.

were fulfilled well before 2010, i.e. in October 2007.44’ Thus, “apart from the revisions
‘of the regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits’ provided for in article 44.3, there
could be other changes made for different purposes or reasons such as to re-balance
the costs of the SES to ensure its sustainability or granting of reasonable rates of return
by reference to the cost of money in the capital markets”.442

At the Hearing on Liability, the Respondent also submitted that Article 44.3 only applied
as long as RD 661/2007 was in force.*43

In Spain’s view, the interpretation of Article 44.3 is further confirmed by its “antecedent”,
Article 40.3 of RD 436/2004. The Spanish Supreme Court established that such
provision was not immutable even before the Claimants decided to invest in Spain.

Spain “categorically denies” that Article 40.3 of RD 436/2004 constitutes a stabilization
commitment aimed at creating long term stability to attract investment.‘#4 Spain asserts
that challenges were brought against RD 661/2007, which in some cases reduced the
potential remuneration existing under RD 436/2004, while always observing the
principle of reasonable profitability.445 When deciding these challenges, the Spanish
Supreme Court confirmed (i) that the Government may change the regulatory
framework, (ii) that the expectation of receiving a FIT on a perpetual basis is not
legitimate, (iii) that the modifications made were compatible with the principle of legal
certainty, (iv) that the incentives scheme must be considered in conjunction with the
rest of the elements that form part of the principle of reasonable profitability, and (v)
that such scheme must be capable of being adapted to the circumstances from time to

time.446

For Spain, it is therefore clear that the Claimants cannot rely on Article 44.3 of RD
661/2007 (which is almost identical to the earlier provision, Article 40.3 of RD 423/2004)
to claim that they had a legitimate expectation that the regime of incentives would

remain unchanged. The very fact that RD 436/2004 was repealed through RD 661/2007
put the Claimants on notice that RD 661/2007 could undergo similar changes.*4”

(b) The significance of the “window period” provided in Article 22 of
RD 661/2007

Spain submits that Article 22 is “linked to the degree of implementation” and that “its
purpose [is] to introduce an additional control on such implementation”.*48 For Spain, in
the event that the installed capacity targets of PER 2005-2010 were achieved earlier
than 2010, “the implementation of an excess capacity was to be monitored by limiting
the deadline to access RD 661/2007 as established in article 22”.49 As a result of the
targets being achieved already in 2007, the Government opened the 12-month window
in September 2007. Therefore, “from September 2008 the registration for RD 661/2007
was closed and the two year window for registration under article 44.3, that was
supposed to take place in 2010, never applied”.4°° Thus, Spain concludes, “[iJt was
simply not possible to trigger the review mechanism of article 44.3 in 2010 since such
reviews would have only applied to those installations that would register in 2012 after
the two year window provided in article 44.3 (which did not occur as from September
2008 registration of PV plants under RD 661/2007 was closed and PV plants registered
after this date were regulated by RD 1578/2008)”.45"

(c) Fifth Additional Provision in RD 1578/2008

Initially, the Respondent argued that RD 1578/2008 did not apply to facilities registered
under RD 661/2007.45? In its post-hearing submission, Spain then submitted that
because the Fifth Additional Provision “provides that it will apply to ‘the activity of
electricity production using solar photovoltaic technology’ (unlike article 2 of
RD 1578/2008, which does refer to specific PV installations registered after

29 September) [...] the modifications provided for in the Additional Provision Five, affect
any PV installation, regardless of its date of registration or commissioning”.

For the Respondent, such provision warned the Claimants that the remuneration of
their PV installations could be changed. Such warning was without prejudice to the
possibility of amending the regulatory framework due to the principle of sustainability
of the SES.*54

v. Judgements of the Spanish Supreme Court confirm Spain’s position

In Spain, the decisions of the Supreme Court are part of the legal system*®> and, hence,
of the regulatory framework governing investments into RE.4°° Therefore, the Claimants
should have known them.

Spain distinguishes between Supreme Court decisions rendered before and after the
Claimants’ investment. The former hold that the state is fully empowered to change
economic incentives established for RE facilities, provided that it complies with the
provisions of the 1997 Electricity Law.*9”

The Respondent does not dispute that the Supreme Court decisions dealing with
regulatory changes to RD 436/2004 do not refer to Article 40.3.45° However, for Spain
this is irrelevant.4°9 In a manner similar to Article 44.3 RD 661/2007, Article 40.3 of RD
436/2007 established a particular review. The regulatory changes considered by the
Supreme Court were not related to such specific reviews, but to the principles of
sustainability and reasonable profitability.4° Moreover, the Supreme Court clearly did
not regard Article 40.3 as a provision preventing subsequent modifications to the

incentives offered by RD 436/2004,‘*" or else it could not have reached the outcome it
did.

With respect to decisions of the Supreme Court issued after the Claimants’ investment,
a first group rendered in 2009 deals with challenges against RD 661/2007, which the
Court dismissed, in spite of the presence of Article 40.3 of RD 436/2004.462

A further group of decisions (more than 100), so Spain continues, were handed down
between 2012 and 2014 and rejected challenges brought against the changes effected
through the 2010 Measures. They reflect a consistent view, according to which such
changes were lawful.46° These decisions are consistent with those pre-dating the
Claimants’ investments,** as they all confirm the State’s right to adapt regulations,
provided reasonable profitability is ensured.

Finally, the Respondent submits that the Supreme Court decision of 20 April 2016, on
which the Claimants rely, does not assist the latter. That decision bears no relation to
the Claimants’ case, as it refers to the moratorium to the registration in the RAIPRE as
a result of RDL 1/2012, and not to the modifications to the remuneration received by
PV plants already registered in the RAIPRE.*® That judgment does not say that a plant
registered in the RAIPRE will enjoy an unchangeable right to a specific subsidy or to a
specific level of profits.4°°

investor (such as in a stabilization clause), on which the latter relies to make its

investment.4o”

Spain asserts that in order to be considered as a stabilization commitment, the
undertaking provided by the host State must satisfy the “specificity test’. It must
“particularly identify (i) the act of the State being precluded (i.e. change of the law); (ii)
the specific investor towards which such commitment is being made; and (iii) the period
of preclusion”.*® Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007 does not meet any of these requirements
and, consequently, it does not qualify as a stabilization commitment under international

law.

vii. Flaws in the Claimants’ due diligence

Spain considers that “as prudent and diligent investors” the Claimants ought to have
known the legal regime applicable to their investment and anticipated changes in the
regulatory regime. Their expectations as to the immutability of the RD 661/2007 regime
could only have been generated by an erroneous interpretation of the regulatory
framework, which cannot be regarded as legitimate. The Claimants failed to conduct
due diligence to inquire about the regulatory framework prior to undertaking their
investments. This meant not only examining the requirements for the regime to apply,
but also the possibility that such regulation may be subject to adaptions.4®°

In this context, Spain notes that all the reports filed by the Claimants limit the scope of
the due diligence to corporate, real estate, contractual, tax, environmental and
administrative/regulatory issues. Where they include a regulatory section, the latter
merely describes the processes to be followed to obtain the licenses, permits and
authorizations necessary for operating a PV plant.4”° The hearing confirmed the lack of
legal due diligence.4”1 The diligence focused on the registration requirements for
RAIPRE without addressing the substance of Article 44.3 or the nature of any allegedly

"guaranteed" FIT.4”2 On the few occasions where the legal due diligence did consider
Article 44.3, it merely recited the provision.4”>

Spain further contends that the Claimants cannot assume that “no warning by counsel
means they can proceed with their misconceived view of Spanish law”.474 Lawyers
issuing due diligence reports do so on the basis of specific instructions and questions,
and there is no evidence on the record of any law firm being asked whether RD
661/2007 could be changed.4”6

Finally, Spain disputes that lenders shared the Claimants’ expectations on the
immutability of the framework and notes that there is no evidence to this effect.4”6

The Claimants’ misplaced reliance on advertising materials and project finance
i. The Claimants’ reliance on advertising materials

Spain takes issue with the Claimants’ reliance on advertisement materials allegedly
fostering or reinforcing their expectations. It is untenable that sophisticated investors
like the Claimants could have formed their expectations based on such materials, while
disregarding the case law of the Spanish Supreme Court and the opinions issued by
the Council of State and the General State Attorneys.4””

In Spain's view, the nature and content of the materials relied on could not have created
expectations of stability. First, the Claimants cannot rely on the IDAE presentations
entitled “The Sun Can Be Yours” (E/ sol puede ser suyo), which only strengthen the
notion that the regulatory framework provided for reasonable profitability to RE
investors may be modified.47°

Second, Spain contends that the PER 2005-2010 was the instrument on the basis of
which RD 661/2007 established a reasonable profitability of 7% and consequently the
level of the FIT.4”9 An investor ought to have known that RD 661/2007 was prepared

on the basis of the PER 2005-2010 and in accordance with the capacity targets set out
in such document.*®° This document clearly states that the return after taxes that could
be expected for projects financed with equity was 7%.**' The limitation of hours
provided in the PER 2005-2010 is further consistent with the number of hours
subsequently established in RDL 14/2010.482

Third, the various CNE documents on which the Claimants rely do not assist their case.
In particular, Spain argues that:

= The presentation by the then Deputy Director of the Special Regime at the CNE,
Mr. Luis Jesus Sanchez de Tembleque,**? was a “university presentation” and
the Claimants erroneously interpret the speaker's remarks on “higher than
reasonable” incentives and non-retroactivity.464

= Mr. Scharfhausen’s presentation of 29 October 20084 only generically
discussed the main characteristics of energy production in Spain and the
Special Regime.*8° In any event, Mr. Scharfhausen’s statements that the
premiums to renewable energies would apply throughout the useful lifetime of
the facilities are in no way contradicted by the Disputed Measures, as the
Claimants’ facilities continue to receive the subsidy throughout the useful
lifetime for 30 years.*8” As for the same speaker's presentation of February
2010,488 any interpretation from the Claimants that would equate “warranty by
law” to perpetuity of the FIT would be clearly erroneous.*®°

Fourth, the presentations prepared by InvestInSpain in no way support the Claimants’
position on the alleged right to benefit from the RD 661/2007 FIT system in
perpetuity.492

In addition to challenging the Claimants’ interpretation of the various promotional
materials, Spain denies that the acts of the various entities that issued the materials
are attributable to the State under the ILC Articles.4% CNE/CNMC, IDAE and
InvestInSpain are not State organs under Article 4 of the ILC Articles because domestic
law does not recognize them to be so. In particular, Spain submits that each of these
entities enjoys a separate personality and autonomous budget.‘ Neither can their acts
be attributed under Article 5 of the ILC Articles as they were not performed in exercise
of governmental authority.4°>

Lastly, the actions of CNE/CNMC, IDAE or InvestInSpain are not attributable either
under Article 8 of the ILC Articles, as these entities have separate legal personality and
are structurally and functionally autonomous. As such, their acts are not carried out
under the instructions or direction or control of the State.4%°

Finally, Spain opposes to the Claimants’ argument that RD 661/2007 was designed to
enable investors to obtain project financing, which reinforces the expectation of

international law as to when individuals or entities are authorised to speak for or on
behalf of the Government”. Consequently, “in the absence of any other clear authority
under customary international law’, Spain agrees with the Claimants that “the ILC
Articles should apply as guidelines to determine when a State can be bound by the
conduct of certain organization[s]”.

immutability.4°” From the perspective of Spanish law, it is irrelevant whether an investor
acquires a PV facility with debt or equity.*%® Thus, the fact that Spain forecast in the
PER 2005-2010 that investors would opt for one type of financing or another does not
mean that the objective of RD 661/2007 was to encourage the use of a particular
financing structure.49

 

The Di: d M meet objective I
i. Introduction

Spain contends that the Disputed Measures provide a reasonable profitability aligned
with the return that Spain provided when it enacted RD 661/2007 and which meets the
expectations that the Claimants had when they made their investments.5° Spain
asserts that the “essential features” of the regulatory framework of the Claimants’
investment have been maintained.5" At the time when they invested, the Claimants
could expect a subsidized remuneration and the right to sell all of their energy on a
priority basis, allowing them to obtain a reasonable profitability. These essential
characteristics have not been dismantled.5°2

ii. The 2010 Measures

As a general matter, Spain submits that the 2013 Measures have “absorbed” the 2010
Measures,°°? and “therefore it makes no sense to rely on the 2010 Measures in these
proceedings”.5% In order words, it is not possible to assess the effect of the 2010
Measures on the Claimants’ returns, because (i) the 25-year limitation contained in RD
1565/2010 has never been applied and never will be (as under the 2013 Measures the
limit for the subsidized remuneration was extended to 30 years); and (ii) the permanent
caps of hours established in RDL 14/2010 was and will never be applied, as the 2013
Measures foresee no such cap.5°

With regard to the temporary caps applied from 2010 to 2013 pursuant to RDL 14/2010,
of which the Claimants complain, Spain’s position is that no analysis of a rate of return
can be undertaken considering only a “window” of three years for an asset with a
lifespan of 30 years. Rather, the analysis of the Claimants’ return must be conducted
under the 2013 Measures.°° In this respect, the future remuneration set by the 2013
Measures grants investors reasonable profitability, based on a model that considers
any detrimental effects of RDL 14/2010.5°”

(a) RD 1565/2010

Spain first claims that the Claimants’ position according to which RD 1565/2010’s
limitation of the FIT to 25 years goes counter to Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007 is
erroneous, as such provision would only concern a tariff cut and not “other elements
such as the years of useful life”.5°°

Second, Spain contends that the 25 or 30-year limit has no actual impact on the
profitability of the plants, because the useful life of the Claimants’ PV facilities does not
exceed 25 to 30 years.°° For a facility to operate beyond 25-30 years, a “substantial
modification” would be required, as the equipment would become obsolete. Yet,
Spanish legislation provided that a substantial modification of the plants would result in
the loss of the plant's economic regime under RD 661/2007 and the submission to the
regime in force at the time of the modification.5"°

(b) RDL 14/2010

Spain alleges that the hour caps imposed by RDL 14/2010 reflect the number of hours
set in the PER 2005-20105"! and RD 661/2007 was enacted to grant reasonable
profitability based on projections assuming the hours of production found in the
PER 2005-2010.5'2

In any event, in Spain’s view, even disregarding the PER 2005-2010, Annex XII of
RD 661/2007 contained a table of hours coinciding exactly with the table of hours which

was later included in RDL 14/2010. That Annex sets out the average hourly production
that RD 661/2007 considered could reasonably be expected in each climate zone. It is
therefore clear that the values contained in Annex XII acted as an implicit basis
(‘presupuesto implicito”) for the tariff established in RD 661/2007. Had higher or lower
production profiles been contemplated, the tariff would logically have been adjusted
proportionately. In other words, the hours set out in Annex XII of RD 661/2007 were the
basis for the hour caps included in RDL 14/2010.5'3

Spain finally highlights that installations do not stop being paid for energy sold once the
cap is reached; they receive the market price, which — in theory — could exceed the
FIT514

(c) Law 15/2012

Spain notes that Law 15/2012 does not form the basis of the claims in this arbitration.
Nonetheless, it provides explanations in response to what it considers “plainly wrong”
allegations from the Claimants.5'° In particular, it submits that it is incorrect to equate
the 7% levy to a tariff cut. The 7% is a tax levied on all electricity producers.5'° The
difference between a tariff cut and a tax is that a tariff cut does not entail any saving or
increased revenue for the state, whereas a tax augments the revenues of the
Treasury.5'7

iii. The New Measures

(a) RDL 2/2013
With regard to the change in the inflation index provided by RDL 2/2013, Spain first
asserts that the new index is well established in worldwide economic doctrine’'® and

seeks to avoid distortions whereby the consumer price index would fall “outside the
foundations of the economy”.5'®

Spain’s second argument is that the new index was only introduced in Spain through
the approval by the European Statistic System Committee on the 26 September of

2012, which Committee approved the Regulation of the European Commission for
drafting the HICP-CT (harmonized indices of consumer prices at constant tax rates),
and made the calculation of this index mandatory for all EU Member States.5?°

Third, it is incorrect to state that the reason for the change was to remove the effect of
the price of oil from the indexation. The new index was chosen to provide more stability
as it removed the more volatile elements, i.e. energy products and food.5" In any event,
the new index was higher in 2014 and 2016 and the fact that it was lower in 2013 is a

coincidence.*2

(b) The New Regime

Spain contends that the “essential features” of the regulatory framework existing at the
time of the Claimants’ investment have been maintained.°*3 Under the New Regime,
the Claimants continue to receive a subsidy or premium for the sale of their electricity,
which results them collecting more for their production than the market price. The
Claimants’ attempt to downplay this fact by referring to the subsidy as “Special
Payment’, does not alter the nature of that payment.524

Furthermore, Spain explains that since the enactment of the 1997 Electricity Law
reasonable profitability has always been calculated taking into account (i) the
reasonable costs (Capex and Opex) of a standard plant, (ii) financing with own
resources (no project finance), (iii) the returns obtained at plant level, (iv)
reasonableness in relation to the cost of money in the capital markets.5* This
methodology has not changed under the New Regime.

First, just as the remuneration provided in RD 661/2007 was based on the reasonable
investment costs considered in the “standard cases” included in the PER 2005-2010,
the Order on Parameters establishes the investment costs for standard cases.576 Spain
explains that the PER 2005-2010 only considered a few standard cases for lack of
sufficient data, while the Order on Parameters considers 578 categories of plants.5?”

434.

435.

436.

Further, taking into account 578 categories means “greater granularity and precision in
the regulation and accommodation of PV plants”.5°

Second, the remuneration is calculated for a PV plant developed using its own
resources,°*° as evidenced by a passage of the PER 2005-2010 which refers to “with
own resources (prior to funding)”.©° Further, the reference to external financing found
in the PER 2005-2010 related to all RE technologies, and not specifically to PV.5*' Thus,
under RD 661/2007, Spain did not contemplate the profitability of PV projects resorting
to project finance.5°?

Third, Spain’s regulatory framework has always provided that the reasonable return
would be calculated with reference to greenfield investors (i.e., the promoters who
undertook the development, construction and commissioning of the installation). Such
remuneration does not cover the extra costs incurred by “secondary”, “financial” or
“brownfield” investors, such as certain Claimants, who paid a premium for the
acquisition of the asset.5° Spain contends that the calculation of the remuneration
under the current regime also considers the profitability of the project at the plant level
ie., for greenfield investors, as is demonstrated by RDL 9/2013 and the Order on
Parameters, which refer to the reasonable return for the “facilities”.554

Fourth, Spain insists that reasonable profitability is linked to the cost of money in the
capital markets,°°5 as referenced explicitly in Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law
and in Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007. Under the New Regime, such link is to the
Government bond yield in the secondary market.5%6

plus an appropriate differential”).

132

437.

438.

439.

Moreover, Spain stresses that RDL 9/2013 simply specifies the reasonable profitability
criterion established in Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law.5°’ The 7.398% rate,
which is the average yield of 10-year government bonds on the secondary market
before RDL 9/2013 entered into force plus 300 basis points, is reasonable and cannot
be reviewed until six years have elapsed from the entry into force of RDL 9/2013.5%8
Using the 10-year Spanish bond yield plus the 300 basis point is not arbitrary; it has
been recognised as appropriate reference by various relevant entities, including the

investors themselves.5%9

That rate of return does not constitute an upper limit. It represents the return to be
obtained by a facility in conformity with the relevant standard facility. If an investor
manages to reduce its costs below the parameters established for the standard facility,
it will obtain a higher return on investment.*° In the Respondent's view, the fact that
the Claimants’ investments are not outperforming the standards set out in the New
Measures and, therefore, the Claimants do not achieve higher returns shows that the
Claimants have not been efficient in structuring and running their operations.5“' For
Spain, this lack of efficiency has to do with the brownfield nature of the Claimants’

investments.542

The Respondent objects to the Claimants’ argument that the 2013 Measures establish
a return of 7.398% before tax, which would actually be 5.2% after tax. It contends that
RE producers have tax benefits that exempt them from paying any taxes during most
of the lifespan of the plants. Thus, if one applies the correct tax rate, the return will be
6.92%, which matches the 7% return after tax established by the legal framework when
the Claimants invested in Spain.54? Such calculation is made taking into consideration
a debt of 80%, in order to make the calculation as close to reality as possible.5“4 Without

debt, the pre-tax rate of 7.398% would yield an after tax figure of 6.51%, which is also
in line with the approximate rate of 7% provided under RD 661/2007.545

Spain also opposes to the Claimants’ statement that the continuation of priority dispatch
is uncertain. In this respect, Spain cites to Article 26 of Law 24/2013°4’ and contends
that priority has been expanded under the New Regime, considering that PV
installations now also enjoy priority over high-efficiency cogeneration installations.54®

Spain finally asserts that the New Regime grants PV plants subsidies for a 30-year
regulatory life, which is in line with the real lifespan of PV plants built under RD
661/2007.%° Indeed, under both the 2013 Measures and the previous regime, the
duration of the subsidized scheme was tied to “useful life” of PV plants, i.e. between

25-30 years. Spain also observes that the Claimants’ “investment papers” concur that
their expectation was for a plant life of 25 to 30 years at the most.5©°

iv. The Disputed Measures are not retroactive

It is Spain’s case that the changes to RD 661/2007 were made for the future only, and
have no application to the past. Hence, this is not a situation of “strict” or “proper”
retroactivity (which would be forbidden under Spanish law). Strict retroactivity would
arise, for example, if the Disputed Measures clawed back remuneration collected in the
past in excess of the remuneration provided under subsequent legislation.®°' By

contrast, where a measure applies to facilities already commissioned, only in respect
of their future remuneration (i.e., prospectively), such “faux” retroactivity is not forbidden
under Spanish law.55? The Spanish Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court have
held that the application of a new regulation to pre-existing situations is allowed under
Spanish law.553

In this case, the 2013 Measures do not deprive the Claimants of any of the amounts
received under RD 661/2007 and thus are not retroactive. For Spain, they continue
to offer PV facilities a “stable privileged remuneration system for PV facilities”,5°> with
profits that in some cases even exceed those provided under RD 661/2007.55°

The Disputed Measures do not otherwise constitute a breach of the ECT
i. Spain created stable conditions for investment

Spain contends that the obligation under Article 10(1) of the ECT to “create stable,
equitable, favourable, and transparent conditions” for investment is not a separate
obligation; it is embedded within the FET obligation.5°” Accordingly, Spain opposes the
Claimants’ position (purportedly taken for the first time at the Hearing on Liability), that
such obligation is distinct from the FET.

As to the content of the obligation, Spain asserts that it cannot be equated with the
“immutability ad infinitum of the regulations of a State”. In other words, Article 10(1) is
not a stabilisation clause; it recognises a State’s right to maintain regulatory flexibility.
A proper interpretation of this standard implies that the State must exercise its
regulatory flexibility fairly, consistently, and predictably, taking into account the

circumstances of the investment.5°° In this context, Spain asserts that the Disputed
Measures did not lead to irrational or unpredictable legal or regulatory instability.

First, the changes to the legal regime were neither constant, nor frequent, nor
contradictory. They strictly adhered to the twin principles governing the applicable legal
framework at the time the Claimants made their investment, i.e. (i) sustainability of the
SES and (ii) reasonable profitability for RE installations in relation to the cost of money
in the capital markets. Consequently, the changes were predictable. Investors should
have been able to predict that if either of these principles were at risk, the Government

would intervene to correct the imbalance through regulatory reform.55?

Second, Spain highlights that, as a matter of fact, the Disputed Measures were not
perceived as unstable by investors, because (i) the market risk factor (beta) for RE
investments in Spain decreased after the measures were enacted; and (ii) there has
been a wave of new investments after the enactment of the measures. In fact, many of
the Claimants have made new investments in Spain after the Disputed Measures.
There have also been new investors constructing new capacity under the New Regime.
Thus, contrary to the Claimants’ contention, the transaction boom after the Disputed
Measures is not a case of “vulture funds” purchasing assets from distressed

investors.5°

Third, as set out above (supra at V.A.2.c), the Disputed Measures respected the
principle of reasonable profitability and maintained the essential features of the prior

regulatory framework.

ii. The Disputed Measures were transparent

Spain contends that the Disputed Measures have been implemented by fully complying
with the need for transparency. It was always forthcoming with information about
intended changes and it engaged in extensive dialogue with investors prior to making
such changes.5*"

The 2010 Measures were implemented through a mandatory process of approval
through the “Ministers Council” and the Parliament, in full compliance with due process

requirements. Prior to the promulgation of RD 1565/2010, the CNE presented the report
from the Ministry seeking comments on draft RD 1565/2010 and received many
submissions from associations and companies.*® As for the RDL 14/2010, Spain notes
that there was no consultative process because a royal decree law, unlike a royal
decree, does not require a consultation given its urgency.*®? However, this RDL was
enacted after parliamentary debate and publication. Moreover, the Spanish
Constitutional Court confirmed that all legal and constitutional requirements were met
in relation to the enactment of RDL 14/2010.5%4

With regard to the 2013 Measures, Spain submits that it was forthcoming with
information about the intended changes in policy and regulations. Specifically, a year
and half prior to the enactment of the Measures, during the drafting process, CNE
opened a public consultation that resulted in more than 477 observations and proposals
concerning the electricity sector. The CNE then published a report that spelled out
the intended policy and regulatory changes and the rationale behind them;5® the
Spanish Government published several documents explaining the proposed plans for
reforms;*” hearings were held before the CNE and its successor, the CNMC;5® and
the advice of the Council of State was sought.5®

Second, in connection with the transitory period of 11 months under RDL 9/2013, Spain
recognizes that the preparation of RD 431/2014 and the Order on Parameters took
time, but that time was necessary to fulfil the legal milestones established by Spanish
law and to ensure transparency.” In particular, during the transitory period, Spain
implemented a complex procedure that ensured the effective participation of all
interested stakeholders through public hearings before the CNE / CNMC. The
submissions by the stakeholders formed the basis of reports by the CNE / CNMC, which
were incorporated in the draft regulation. The Ministry as well as the Council of State

recognised that the formulation of the draft regulation had included ample public
participation.5”1

Further, Spain points out that RD 431/2014 was subject to a public consultation, which
resulted in 619 submissions from companies, industrial associations and Autonomous

Communities.5’2

Finally, Spain considers that the engagement of the two independent consulting
companies has no bearing on the transparency requirement. Spain explains that the
Government terminated the contract with BCG for breach and BCG never issued a
report. By contrast, a report was issued by Roland Berger, but it was not used to
prepare the Order on Parameters or the remuneration standards, as it was received
after the approval of RD 413/2014 and the Order on Parameters.5”

iii. The Disputed Measures are proportionate and justified

At the outset, Spain asserts that in reviewing the reasonability and proportionality of the
Disputed Measures, the Tribunal should adopt a deferential approach and “not ‘act as
a court of appeal over the Spanish Government’”.5% The Tribunal should not review
whether the Disputed Measures were the best option out of all available measures, but
recognize that Spain had selected appropriate measures from a range of reasonably
available alternatives.5”° For Spain, there is no consistent approach to determining
proportionality. The test requires a determination of whether a measure is suitable,
necessary and proportionate, comparing the detrimental effect to the advantages of
achieving the objectives of the measures.*”° The Disputed Measures were justified and
suitable for a variety of reasons, including the need to (i) correct the over-remuneration
of PV plants under the previous regime, (ii) to remedy the tariff deficit, (iii) to protect
consumers and (iv) to comply with EU state aid rules.

(a) Over-remuneration of PV plants

Spain initially appeared to suggest that the 7% reasonable profitability at the time of the
enactment of RD 661/2007 was an “upper limit’.5’” In its post-hearing submission,
however, Spain argues that the reasonable profitability of “around 7%” for PV
installations at the time RD 661/2007 was a “target” not a “cap”.5”® However, such target
was “not achieved as the tariff from RD 661/2007 led to a situation of over remuneration

and it was therefore necessary to adapt the regime by implementing the Measures”.57°

In the Respondent's submission, it is “self-evident” that the Claimants were making
“windfall profits” under RD 661/2007 as otherwise they would not have started arbitral
proceedings since they continue to receive a return of 7.398%. Moreover, by 2007-
2008 when the Claimants' plants were built, costs had dropped significantly and hours
of production had increased compared to the estimates®*' run in the PER 2005-2010,
which “led to over remuneration and windfall profits”.5®* Various texts, including the
“stated purposes” of RDL 14/2010 and RDL 2/2013, indicate that PV plants were
obtaining remuneration higher than reasonable.

(b) Tariff Deficit

Spain first recalls that a tariff deficit accrues when the tariff collected from consumers
does not cover the costs of the system, thereby generating a debt on the part of all
consumers to the electricity producers. This debt is securitized and paid by consumers
over a series of years, as laid down by Law 24/2013.58°

The Respondent disputes that the tariff deficit was created by the Government. Many
factors resulted in a substantial increase of the tariff deficit after 2008 and compelled

See Rejoinder, para. 267 (citing to MG&A Report, page 30 and 31, conclusion 13):
“Similarly, the 7% upper limit is clearly explained in the MG&A Report: ‘The containment
of a reasonable return was the expected return that the investor who would have
invested under the remuneration regimes of RD 661/2007 relied on; and this is set out
in a target rate of return of up to 7% IRR of the project for the investors who would have
connected their plants to the network until the end of September 2007 and a lower
reasonable rate of return for plants that would connect as of this date’.”

the Government to adopt a series of measures to address the problem, including the

Disputed Measures. In Spain’s view, such factors are the following:

= Remuneration of renewable energies, in particular PV energy, above the
reasonable rate of return due to increased productivity of the plants beyond
expectations; and lower investment and production costs than expected;

= The over-installation of PV facilities which generated a 25% increase in cost of
the Ordinary Regime as a result of the priority of access of renewables;

= The sudden and deep drop in demand of electricity due to the economic crisis;

= The impossibility of increasing tolls, because they were the highest in Europe
and had already been increased eleven times over the last few years in a

context of economic crisis;
= The financing of the accumulated debt of the tariff deficits became untenable.5*

For Spain, the Claimants’ argument that the only way of remedying the tariff deficit was
to increase the price of electricity paid by consumers is unrealistic given the state’s
need to balance competing interests.5® In that exercise, the state must not only
increase the consumers’ burden, but also adapt the support scheme for energy
production (as was done through the Disputed Measures).5® In any event, the
Government did in fact increase the price of electricity for consumers,**” by increasing
the network access tolls many times, thus complying with the relevant Supreme Court
decisions.5*° Similarly, the Claimants’ contention that Spain could have imposed a tax
on all CO2 emissions or on fuel to no avail either, given that Spain had already imposed

such a tax.589

Spain also contends that the tariff deficit was an element of the system since the early
2000s, i.e. long before the Claimants made their investments. Consequently, it should

have informed their legitimate expectations.5°°

Spain further highlights the impact of the economic crisis on the tariff deficit which was
threatening the sustainability of the electricity system. Due to the crisis, there was an
unexpected drop in demand for electricity, which led to a decrease in revenues. The
repeated increases in tolls were precisely aimed at correcting that decrease. However,
in such a crisis environment, it was not reasonable for Spain to continue to increase

the price of electricity to consumers.5%"

(c) Protection of consumers

It is Spain’s argument that “the purpose of the 2013 reform was to revise each and
every one of the costs borne by the electricity system in order to comply with the legal
system in force, both domestic and at a Community Law level, and to ensure that
electricity consumers do not bear excess costs generated in the different activities”.5°%

Spain asserts that it has experienced one of the highest rises in the price of electricity
in the EU over the last years (more than 70% in 7 years).5% Thus, it refutes the
Claimants’ argument that an increase in the tolls for consumers could have covered the
tariff deficit.5°*

(d) EU state aid rules

Whilst it admits that European rules did not expressly require it to introduce the
Disputed Measures, Spain submits that it must comply with European law, which
allegedly “prohibits perpetual and unchanging subsidies”. Spain contends that
competition in the market cannot be achieved if the investors’ private interests are the
only relevant consideration, since this would worsen the existing imbalance over the

years.5%

In that regard, Spain submits that the EC Decision on State Aid makes it clear that

Spain has not breached the Claimants’ legitimate expectations:

a. The EC Decision recognises that there is “no right to State aid”, implying that there
was no right to the stabilization of the RD 661/2007 FIT. It also refers to the case
law of the Court of Justice, whereby a recipient of State aid cannot, in principle,
have legitimate expectations in the lawfulness of aid that has not been notified to
the Commission.5*” It further confirms that the only expectation that the Claimants
could have under EU law was the expectation of reasonable profitability.5% In sum,
the EC Decision considers that there is no infringement of the FET standard of the
ECT.599

b. The EC Decision also ratifies the proportionality, reasonableness, transparency and
stability of the New Regime, given that (i) the New Regime permits to recover capex
and opex, plus a profit margin of 7.398% in line with the returns of projects recently
approved by the Commission;®°° and (ii) the New Regime is subject to regular
revisions and assessments, which ensures that the returns remain “reasonable”.®"

Spain submits that EU law is part of the applicable law in the present case because (i)
pursuant to Article 26(6) of the ECT, EU law is a part of international law; (ii) EU law is
also mandatory law applicable between all Parties to the dispute; and (iii) EU law is
also applicable pursuant to Article 31(3) of the VCLT, pursuant to which the ECT must
be interpreted by taking into account “any relevant rules of international law applicable
in the relations between the parties”.®°? In the circumstances, Spain concludes that the
Tribunal’s decision must be compatible with the EU Commission's findings, which are
binding on the Tribunal.

iv. The Disputed Measures were reasonable and did not impair the Claimants’
investment

As a preliminary point, Spain contends that in the absence of evidence of loss, it is

impossible to determine if the Claimants’ investments were impaired by the Measures.

Since the Claimants’ make identical arguments on the lack of reasonableness of the

Disputed Measures and the impairment of the Claimants’ investments through

unreasonable measures, Spain addresses the two together.°°

First, Spain disagrees that the introduction of transitory hour caps was unreasonable
or arbitrary. The hours cap imposed by RDL 14/2010 was not new. It matched the
average operating hours envisaged in the PER 2005-2010 which in turn formed the
basis for calculating the tariff in RD 661/2007. Moreover, the average operating hours
were ultimately included in Annex XII of RD 661/2007. In other words, the hours cap in
Annex XII formed an implicit basis for the tariff established in RD 661/2007 for PV
facilities. As a result and because the hours cap in RDL 14/2010 was based on the
PER 2005-2010, the Claimants cannot now claim that the forecast of production hours
in RDL 14/2010 was unjustified or arbitrary.4

Second, Spain reiterates that the New Measures maintain all the features of the regime
in place at the time the Claimants’ invested and continues to be based on the principles
of the SES. Contrary to the Claimants’ arguments, the New Regime continues to
provide reasonable profitability and sufficient visibility as to return.®°5

Third, Spain submits that it is incorrect that the New Measures were a mechanism for
retaining the risks incurred by private investors, while denying them the associated
rewards. PV technologies involve the lowest risk of all RE generation technologies and
thus the Disputed Measures ensure more than a generous rate of return.®°6

Fourth, it is equally untrue that over-installation of PV capacity was a consequence of
Spain’s failure to oversee the registration of PV facilities. There was a globally
unprecedented increase in PV installations, which nobody could foresee.®”

v. Spain has provided full protection and security to the Claimants’
investments

Spain asserts that the Disputed Measures do not violate the full protection and security

(“FPS”) standard because (i) they do not cause physical harm to the Claimants or their

investments; (ii) they do not involve third party or police measures; and (iii) they are an

expression of the State’s right to regulate, which was reasonably exercised.

First, Spain submits that the FPS standard is limited to the obligation to provide physical
security and only exceptionally extends to legal security, which circumstances are not
present in the instant case.®° In any event, even if the Tribunal were of the view that
the FPS standard encompasses legal security, such obligation requires the creation of
legal remedies for the effective vindication of investment rights and Spain has always
offered the Claimants such remedies.

Second, the Respondent contends that there is no allegation of Spain breaching its
duty of care to protect the investors and/or investments against the harmful actions of
third parties. Accordingly, the Disputed Measures cannot be assessed under the FPS
standard.

Third, Spain reiterates that the Disputed Measures are a legitimate and reasonable
expression of its right to regulate, against which the FPS standard does not protect

investors.°'°

The Claimants’ failure to prove harm

Especially in their submissions prior to the PO12 Hearing, Spain has emphasized that
the Claimants failed to comply with their burden to prove any losses.®"' The
Respondent underlines that the Claimants’ case is based on the alleged financial harm
that they have suffered as a result of the Disputed Measures. Therefore, for the
Respondent, the measure of the harm allegedly caused by the Disputed Measures is
a specific and necessary element to enable the Tribunal to “confidently rule on Spain’s

international responsibility”. A decision on Spain’s liability that does not consider this
element would not be a “fully informed decision”.®'?

On this premise, the Respondent submits that the Claimants have failed to demonstrate
the alleged loss they suffered. For Spain, this was a calculated risk that the Claimants
took when they insisted on bifurcation of the proceedings and it is not for Spain to suffer
from the Claimants’ gamble.

In the same vein, Spain argues that the Claimants’ alternative case as pleaded in the
Reply — which is based on the argument that the New Regime failed to provide the
required reasonable return — is not substantiated. For Spain, in order to properly
address this argument, the Tribunal would “need to understand the margins” (i.e. the
difference between the reasonable rate of return at the time of investment and that
under the New Regime). However, so Spain contends, while “[t}he Claimants are
essentially asking this Tribunal to find liability by relying on the principle of reasonable
profitability’, they nevertheless “turn a blind eye to the need for evidence to determine
whether such reasonable profitability was actually satisfied”.®' In other words, even in
this instance, the Claimants fail to prove their loss. For Spain, the mere assertion that
the “PV Investors have suffered extensive losses as a result of the measures, resulting
in restructuring and insolvency proceedings” does not constitute credible or sufficient

evidence.°"4

THE ALTERNATIVE CLAIM

This section provides a broad summary of the Parties’ positions on the Alternative
Claim, it being noted that further details on the Parties’ arguments are contained in the
analysis of the Alternative Claim.

The Claimants’ position

The Alternative Claim rests on the premise that the Primary Claim is not successful and
the Tribunal agrees with Spain’s argument that, instead of the RD 661/2007 FIT, the
Claimants are only entitled to receive a reasonable rate of return within the terms of

Rejoinder, paras. 1121-1132.

145

482.

483.

484,

Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law (also referred to by the Claimants as the
“Original Regime”), as it stood at the time of their investment.°"5

In response to this theory, the Claimants submit that Spain nevertheless faces
international liability under the ECT, because the reasonable return under the New
Regime is lower than the reasonable return under the Original Regime.®'® On Spain’s
own case, at the time of the Claimants’ investment, the reasonable rate of return was
set at around 7% after-tax (implying a pre-tax return of around 11%).°” They contend

 

that the New Regime offers a 7.398% pre-tax return, which amounts to around 5.9%
after-tax. Thus, they submit that their return is 2 percentage points below than the return
of around 7% that Spain purported to guarantee under the Original Regime.

The Clai are entitled to “full rep ion” for violati of the ECT

 

The Claimants first discuss the context against which the Tribunal should assess the
Alternative Claim. They submit that the ECT offers no guidance on the measure of
compensation for a non-expropriatory breach, such as a violation of the FET standard.
Consequently, it is necessary to refer to the standard of compensation under customary
international law, as determined in the Chorzow Factory case and subsequently
codified in Article 31 of the ILC Articles. Pursuant to this standard, a State must make
“full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act” so as to “wipe
out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would,
in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed”.6"8

In the circumstances, the Claimants contend that if Spain is found to have violated its
international obligations under the ECT, then consistent with Chorzow Factory and the
ILC Articles, Spain must pay compensation in an amount that will wipe out the

consequences of the unlawful measures.®'9

The Primary Claim should act as a benchmark

The Claimants assert that, while quantifying damages, the Tribunal must not only
respect the principle of full reparation, but also seek to “ensure consistency with the
established jurisprudence”.®”° In that regard, the Claimants point out that a “series of
consistent cases” have found that Spain violated the investors’ legitimate expectations
by introducing the Disputed Measures (in line with the Primary Claim) and have
consequently ordered damages by reference to a DCF calculation, on the basis that
the RD 661/2007 FITs would have continued to apply.®"

Consequently, if the Tribunal decides to award damages based on the Alternative
Claim to ensure full reparation and consistency with the findings on damages in other
PV cases, the Claimants contend that the Tribunal should use the Primary Claim as a
“benchmark” for assessing damages.®? Although the Primary Claim has not been
quantified in these proceedings, the Claimants offer two “proxies” for damages under
the Primary Claim.

First, the Claimants submit that the damages under the Primary Claim would be very
similar to the damages under the Alternative Claim in a situation where the chosen
parameters generate an Alternative Tariff that is substantially similar to the RD
661/2007 tariff. Accordingly, the Claimants ask the Tribunal to refer to the damages
scenario presented by Brattle at the PO12 Hearing that produced an Alternative Tariff
most closely resembling the RD 661/2007 FIT. This damages scenario — which
considers PV plants with installed capacity under 100kW, a 7% rate of return,
disregards past profits and uses a “pure” marginal plant as the cost base®°— yields
damages of approximately EUR 654 million.94

As a second proxy, the Claimants ask the Tribunal to look at the damages awarded in
the decision rendered by the Novenergia tribunal. The Claimants submit that the
Novenergia tribunal found Spain’s implementation of the Disputed Measures in breach
of the ECT and awarded damages on an equivalent basis to the Claimants’ Primary

Claim. Consequently, the Claimants argue that the damages awarded by the
Novenergia tribunal would be “a good approximation of the damages, on a €/MW basis,
that may be viewed as reasonable in this case”.65

In Novenergia the damages amounted to EUR 2.84 million per MW of installed
capacity. As the Claimants in this case collectively hold 222.4 MW of capacity, they
would receive approx. EUR 632 million in damages.®6

For the Claimants, applying these proxies as a benchmark is particularly important in
the present case, where the maximum aggregate amount of damages computed under
the EJM (based on the narrower parameters indicated by PO18) are 25% lesser than
the damages that are likely to have been awarded under the Primary Claim. The
Claimants contend that any further reduction in the maximum available damages under
the EJM would run contrary to the Tribunal’s duty to maintain consistency in the
jurisprudence and to ensure full reparation under international law.®2”

Quantification of the loss for liability and quantum

Given that the Alternative Claim expresses the violation of the Claimants’ legitimate
expectations in economic terms, the Claimants submit that it is necessary to measure
the impact of the Disputed Measures on the value of the Claimants’ investments to
determine issues of both liability®2° and damages. This quantification was carried out
by Brattle under PO12.

The Claimants note that PO12 directed them to compute their damages by comparing
two scenarios: (a) what the Claimants call the “Actual scenario”, which measures the
cash flows and IRR as a result of the Disputed Measures, and (b) the “But For
scenario”, which measures the cash flows and the IRR in the absence of the Disputed
Measures.®9 If the IRR in the But For scenario is higher than the IRR in the Actual

scenario, it means that Spain violated their legitimate expectations by failing to provide

PO12 C-PHB2, para. 53.

PO12 C-PHB2, paras. 53-55.

PO12 C-PHB2, para. 48.

The Claimants refer to this as the “threshold liability question”. See, PO12 C-PHB1,
paras. 6-8.

PO12, para. 3(a). PO12 assumed that the quantum of damages / harm suffered by the
Claimants equals “the difference [...] between (i) the reasonable return under Article
30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law over the regulatory lifetime of a plant [...] and (ii) the
return the Claimants would make under the Disputed Measures for the same period”.

631

the target rate of return under the New Regime. The same quantification would also
serve as basis for the computation of damages.®°

The Claimants observe that for undertaking the quantification exercise, PO12 outlined
six assumptions with alternatives, namely:

a. Whether or not to update the remuneration under the New Regime at
the scheduled periodic intervals.

b. Reasonable profitability within the meaning of the 1997 Electricity Law
means either a 7% after-tax return or an 8% after-tax return.

c. Whether reasonable profitability should apply to either greenfield or
brownfield investments (to the extent it makes any difference).

d. Reasonable profitability should be measured with reference to a 30-
year regulatory lifetime.

e. Whether or not reasonable profitability should consider earnings prior
to the enactment of the Disputed Measures.

f. The valuation date should be either the date of the award or the date of
the Disputed Measures.®"

The Claimants explain that the first of these assumptions and alternatives (at (a) above)
relates to the Actual scenario. The next four assumptions (from (b) to (e), above) relate
to the But For scenario. The sixth assumption (which relates to both scenarios) refers
to the valuation date and essentially requires the calculation of damages ex post (date
of potential Award) as well as ex ante (date of Disputed Measures).

In this context, the Claimants advocate for the following parameters, which in their view
are the most appropriate for calculating the damages recoverable under the Alternative
Claim:
(a) _ find that the target rate of return was 8% after tax;
(b) do not take into account the tax benefits of interest when calculating
the effective tax rate for the purposes of establishing the Alternative
Tariff;
(c) adopt Brattle's preferred "Marginal Plant" option as the cost base;

(d) do not consider past profitability;

(e) assume that the reasonable return is revised every six years (which
on an ex ante valuation in effect reduces damages); and

(f) use an ex post valuation date in order to fully capture the harm suffered
by the Claimants.®°?

In addition, the Claimants argue that “holding IRRs” should be used in the calculation
of the IRRs, as opposed to “exit IRRs”,°° and note that a computation using the
parameters just referred to would result in damages in the sum of EUR 1.16 billion.

The Claimants’ detailed arguments on each of these assumptions and parameters are
summarized in section VI.B.4.c below (Analysis).

The Claimants further observe that in PO18, in which the Tribunal asked the Parties’
experts to prepare the EJM, the Tribunal narrowed down the number of inputs for
calculating these cash flows and, in particular, eliminated two key parameters that had
formed the basis of their prior quantification of damages, i.e. the “pure” marginal plant
option as a potential cost base, and the ex post valuation date. The Claimants submit
that the removal of these two parameters significantly reduced the damages that could
be recovered by the Claimants.®*4

First, the Claimants submit that not using the “pure” marginal plant option as a cost
base has a significant impact on damages. With this cost base, they could have
recovered damages of approximately EUR 654 million, whereas under the EJM, their
preferred set of parameters yield damages of EUR 520 million only. In either case, the
Claimants point out that the damages fall well short of the value of the RD 661/2007
FIT (and consequently, the damages that according to them would have resulted in “full
reparation”).®5

Similarly, the use of an ex ante as opposed to an ex post valuation also reduces the
recoverable damages. The Claimants submit that using Brattle’s preferred assumptions
under the EJM (but with the “pure” marginal plant as a cost base), results in damages
of approx. EUR 654 million. By contrast, if an ex post valuation date is adopted, the
total damages would amount to EUR 900 million.%°°

In sum, the Claimants submit that the EJM results in significant under-compensation,
as even the highest amount of damages available under the EJM (totalling EUR 534

million) will not provide “full reparation” to the Claimants, in accordance with the
international law principles governing compensation for internationally wrongful acts.®°”

By contrast, they note that applying the methodology used in other PV cases against
Spain yields higher damages. For instance, according to the Claimants, the
methodology endorsed by the Novenergia tribunal would result ina damages award of
approximately EUR 642 million to the Claimants.®** The Claimants submit that awarding
damages on the basis of an “Alternative Tariff’ set at the same level of RD 661/2007
would result in damages awarded on a basis similar to all other previous awards.®9
However, this would necessitate employing the “pure” marginal plant cost base.®4°

Finally, the Claimants argue that “the Alternative Claim and the EJM both assess
damages based on the returns at the plant level (or project level). They do not assess
returns on the sums actually invested by the Claimants when purchasing those PV
plants”.°41 They contend that the Claimants themselves have suffered substantial
losses on their investments, and that “as matters currently stand, the Claimants will
not even recover the capital they invested in Spain, let alone earn a profit on that
invested capital”.643

Nevertheless, if the Tribunal intends to award damages based on the set of parameters
in the EJM, the Claimants submit that the Tribunal must choose the set of parameters
that most closely reflect the reasonable return offered by Spain at the time of their

investment, i.e.:

(a) do not take into account the tax benefits of interest when calculating
the effective tax rate;

(b) choose the "Size Reclassified" marginal plant as the cost base [...];
(c) do not consider profitability before the valuation date;

(d) assume that the reasonable return is revised every six years (which in
effect reduces damages); and

(e) apply interest to cash flows lost before the valuation date.*+

The Claimants submit that the Tribunal must adopt these permutations, as they (a) “are
most closely aligned with the methodology used by Spain when designing the Original
Regime” in which the Claimants invested; and (b) reflect the impact of the Disputed

Measures.%5

The Claimants’ more detailed arguments on quantification are summarized below in
the analysis of the Alternative Claim.

The Respondent’s position
Introduction

The Respondent requests the Tribunal to dismiss the Alternative Claim as ill-founded.
For Spain, there is no merit in the Claimants’ argument that under the Alternative Claim
their damages would still be substantial. By contrast, “[t]he Claimants are receiving
exactly the same amount of return on their investment as the one provided by the
Spanish regulation at the time of their investments” and “the difference between returns
before and after taxes is minimal, as [renewable energies] have tax benefits that
exempted them from paying any taxes during most of the lifespan of the plants”.64¢
Spain’s position is that “[a]pplying the correct tax rate applicable to the PV investments,
to a 7.398% return before taxes, it will turn into a 6.92% return after taxes, which
matches the 7% return after taxes established by the legal framework when the
Claimants invested in Spain”.&7

The Primary Claim cannot be used as a benchmark for quantifying the Alternative
Claim

The Respondent submits that the Primary Claim cannot be used to benchmark the
damages in the Alternative Claim. According to Spain, the Primary Claim does not
represent the Claimants’ legitimate expectations at the time of their investment and
therefore does not represent any potential measure of damages.®°

Further, the Tribunal should also disregard the two proxies for damages proposed by
the Claimants:

a. As regards the damages granted in Novenergia, Spain contends that, “despite
basing its liability conclusions on radical change”, that tribunal seems to have used
the claimant's DCF model, using a but-for scenario where the claimant would have
continued to receive the RD 661/2007 FIT. Consequently, the damage computable
in Novenergia cannot be used as a reference.®9

b. With respect to “pure” marginal plant, the calculation of returns using this parameter
assimilates the Claimants’ plants to a 5 KW marginal plant, the cost and production
parameters of which bear no relation to the Claimants’ larger plants.®°°

Quantification of the loss for liability and quantum

Of the various assumptions provided under PO12, Spain considers the following
parameters most appropriate to quantify the alleged damages:®"'

a. The But For scenario should be calculated in accordance with the methodology
proposed by Econ One;

b. The target rate of return in the But For scenario should be 7%;

c. The “marginal plant” proposed by Brattle cannot be used as the cost base, because
the remuneration scheme for PV installations, including the RD 661/2007 FIT, has
always been based on the “costs of standard installations that reflect the typical
efficient greenfield costs in the market for the construction of certain type of
installation in a given year”.®5? Furthermore, Spain contends that “the typical costs
of the standard facilities included in the Parameters’ Order IT Codes are [...]
representative of the real costs in the market at the time of construction of the PV
Plants”;®3

PO12 R-PHB2, para. 422(a).

PO12 R-PHB2, paras. 422(b)-423.

In this section, the Tribunal has limited itself to highlighting Spain’s arguments on only
those parameters which were finally accepted or discarded in PO18. For parameters
where PO18 provides alternatives, the Tribunal addresses Spain's position infra at
VI.B.4.c.

d. An exit IRR should be used for the computation of the IRRs in the Actual Scenario;
e. An ex-ante valuation date should be adopted.

With regard to the options set out in PO18, it submits that the Tribunal should opt for
the following in order to calculate the Claimants’ alleged harm:

a. If an The Alternative Tariff is to be used, then it shall be calculated:
i. Using the IT Codes sensitivity as cost base; and

ii. Taking into account the tax benefits of interests when calculating the
applicable tax rate as calculated by Econ One.

b. The DCF should take into account profits generated before the valuation date (since
profitability can only be calculated during the full regulatory life of a plant);

c. The DCF should assume that the rate of return is revised every six years;

d. The IRRs for the Claimants’ plants in the scenario with Measures should be
calculated using the Claimants’ greenfield costs excluding developers’ premiums
as calculated by Econ One;

e. Interest should not be included, as the Tribunal did not request it and “we are at the
liability phase”.®4

The Respondent's more detailed position on quantification for purposes of determining
liability and quantum is summarized in section VI.B.4.c below which deals with the
analysis of the Alternative Claim.

PRELIMINARY MATTERS

In this section, the Tribunal will address (1) the scope of this Award; (2) the applicable
laws; (3) the relevance of prior awards; and (4) the Respondent's outstanding
procedural requests of 7 March 2019.

Scope of this Award

This award deals with both liability and damages, as further explained in sections
VI.B.4.a and VI.B.4.b below.

The Applicable Laws
Law Governing the Arbitration Proceedings

The place of arbitration within the meaning of Article 18 of the UNCITRAL Rules being
Geneva, Switzerland (see Procedural Order No. 3, para. 52), this arbitration is subject
to Chapter 12 of the Swiss Private International Law Act.

Law Governing the Merits of the Dispute

Article 26(6) of the ECT provides as follows:

A tribunal established under paragraph (4) shall decide the issues in dispute
in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of
international law.

Thus, in accordance with Article 26(6) of the ECT, the Tribunal will apply the Treaty

and applicable rules and principles of international law.

Jura Novit Arbiter

When applying the law governing the substance of the dispute, the Tribunal is not
bound by the arguments and sources invoked by the Parties. Under the maxim jura
novit curia — or, better, jura novit arbiter — the Tribunal is required to apply the law of its
own motion, provided it seeks the Parties’ views if it intends to base its decision on a
legal theory that was not addressed and that the Parties could not reasonably
anticipate .65>

The Relevance of Prior Awards

Both Parties have relied on previous decisions or awards in support of their positions,
either to conclude that the same solution should be adopted in the present case, or in
an effort to explain why this Tribunal should depart from that solution.

As it noted in the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction (para. 53), the Tribunal considers
that it is not bound by previous decisions. At the same time, in its judgment it must pay
due consideration to earlier decisions of international tribunals. Specifically, it believes
that, subject to compelling contrary grounds, it has a duty to adopt principles
established in a series of consistent cases. It further believes that, subject always to
the specific text of the ECT, and with due regard to the circumstances of each particular
case, it has a duty to contribute to the harmonious development of international
investment law in furtherance of the certainty of the rule of law. Additional observations
on the Tribunal’s consideration of the awards rendered in other Spanish RE arbitrations
are contained in paragraphs 551 to 555 below.

The Respondent’s Outstanding Procedural Requests of 7 March 2019

As recalled supra at paras. 167 and 168, upon the Respondent's request and having
heard the Claimants, on 21 February 2019, the Tribunal granted the Respondent leave
to file into the record the three January 2019 Declarations issued by the Member States
in connection with Achmea and invited the Parties to provide their comments thereto.
On 7 and 21 March 2019, the Respondent and the Claimants submitted their comments
on the Declarations.

The Tribunal first summarizes the Parties’ position and requests in connection with the
Declarations and then provides its decision on these procedural requests.

The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that the Declarations deal with the legal consequences of the
judgment rendered by the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) in Achmea
“on investor-State arbitration clauses and on the question of investment protection in
the EU and in intra-EU disputes”.®* It submits that the Declarations are directed
“towards investment arbitration tribunals as well as to the investor community”.°5”

After recalling that the Achmea judgment is binding on all EU Member States,®* Spain
contends that the declaration made by 22 EU Member States (the “22 Member States
Declaration”),° was “[s]igned by the representative of Spain and also by the
representatives of Germany and the Netherlands (relevant States on the basis of the
nationality of the Claimants in the present dispute)’. In Spain’s view, it “clearly
establishes that arbitrations between investors of a Member State and another Member

State arising from the ECT are incompatible with EU law”.6°

Quoting passages from the 22 Member States Declaration, Spain maintains that such
document “declares the Member States’ understanding that an arbitral tribunal
established on the basis of investor-State arbitration clauses such as Article 26 of the
ECT lacks jurisdiction when the dispute is intra-EU, on the basis that the Member States
did not make any offer to arbitrate under Article 26 ECT to investors from other EU
Member States”.

In stating that the effects of Achmea also extend to the ECT, the 22 Member States
Declaration, so Spain explains, follows the position of the European Commission in its
Communication of 19 July 2018 entitled “Protection of intra-EU investment”.®©2

The Respondent contends that the position of the 22 Member States is not
“contradict[ed]” by the declaration signed by five other Member States (the “S Member
States Declaration”).® Although Spain acknowledges that the latter declaration “differs

from the 22 Member State[s] Declaration in respect of the extension of the effect of the
Achmea Judgment to the ECT”, as “the 5 Member States consider that it is preferable
to not express any specific views until a ‘specific judgment’ on this matter is rendered
and the question of whether Article 26 ECT permits intra-EU arbitration is currently
being contested before a national court in a Member State”,®°> it submits that the 5
Member States Declaration confirms that it is only for the CJEU “to decide upon matters
of interpretation and application of EU Law as set out in” Achmea.®®*

In sum, Spain contends that the 22 Member States Declaration is relevant to the
present dispute because it “leaves no room for doubt as to the intention or
understanding of the ECT parties involved in this dispute that (i) Article 26 ECT cannot
be considered a valid consent to arbitration in the case of intra-EU disputes on the basis
that it would be incompatible with the autonomy of EU law and (ii) any differences in
interpretation must be resolved in favour of EU law”.6°7

Spain contends that EU law as interpreted by the CJEU “qualifies as one of the
‘applicable rules and principles of international law’ specified in Article 26(6) of the
ECT”S8 and, moreover, “is to be taken into account when interpreting the ECT” under
Article 31(3)(c) VCLT.®° Specifically, the 22 Member States Declaration is to be taken
into account when interpreting the ECT either as a “subsequent agreement between
the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty of application of its provisions”
(Article 31(3)(a) VCLT) or, at a minimum, as “subsequent practice in the application of
the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation”
(Article 31(3)(b) VCLT).°”° Hence, “tribunals cannot override the common will of the
ECT parties as to how Article 26 shall be interpreted in line with EU law”.®7

Therefore, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to “now reconsider ex officio its
jurisdiction in the present case in accordance with its continuing obligation”.®”
Moreover, in light of the Member States’ “undertaking of cooperation” to inform
investment tribunals of the Achmea judgment, Spain “invite[s] the Tribunal to contact
any of the Member States signatories to the 22 Member State Declaration concerned
with this arbitration in order to confirm their unequivocal understanding of the
Declaration and the obligations contained therein”.°”>

The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants argue that the 22 Member States Declaration draws a distinction
between the legal consequences of Achmea for bilateral investment treaties and the
ECT.®” In particular, they point to the fact that, while the 22 Member States agreed to
use their best efforts to terminate intra-EU bilateral investment treaties by the end of
2019, with respect to the ECT, they only announced that they would “discuss without
undue delay whether any additional steps are necessary to draw all the consequences
from the Achmea judgment in relation to the intra-EU application of the Energy Charter
Treaty”.°’5 Furthermore, the Claimants underscore that the 22 Member States
Declaration states that “Union law takes precedence over bilateral investment treaties
concluded between Member States”, without expressing the same view with respect to
the ECT, which is a multilateral treaty to which both the EU and the Member States are
parties.°’° Thus, in the Claimants’ view, there is no agreement among EU Member
States (including between the 22 signatories to the Declaration) regarding the
consequences of Achmea for the ECT or whether EU law has precedence over the
ECT.°7

For the Claimants, this is consistent with the other two declarations. The 5 Member
States Declaration, on the one hand, stresses the “importance of allowing for due
process and [...] that it would be inappropriate, in the absence of a specific judgment
on this matter, to express views as regards the compatibility with Union law of the intra-

EU application of the Energy Charter Treaty”.°”®. Hungary's Declaration, on the other
hand, unambiguously declares that “the Achmea judgment concerns only the intra-EU
bilateral investment treaties” and “does not concern any pending or prospective
arbitration proceedings initiated under the ECT”.*79 Hence, Spain’s argument that EU
Member States “never interpreted Article 26 of the ECT as a valid offer to arbitrate
between EU Members” is contradicted by the 5 Member States and Hungary’s
Declarations.

Furthermore, the Respondent’s argument that the 22 Member States Declaration
constitutes a subsequent agreement or practice between the EU Member States that
sets out the authentic interpretation of Article 26 of the ECT is incorrect. For the
Claimants, the 22 Member States Declaration does not fall within the “agreement” or
“practice” under Article 31(3)(a) and (b) of the VLCT, because it “is a political statement”
setting out the steps that EU Member States will take regarding the set aside of awards
and termination of intra-EU bilateral investment treaties. The Claimants contend that
“[bleyond suggesting that the intra-EU application of Article 26 is incompatible with EU
law”, the 22 Member States Declaration does not set out how the ECT ought to be
interpreted. Therefore, it neither constitutes an agreement regarding the interpretation
of Article 26 of the ECT nor subsequent practice evidencing any such agreement.®"
Furthermore, in the Claimants’ view a subsequent agreement could only be invoked if
all the parties to the treaty have been involved in the interpretation of a particular
meaning of a treaty term, which is not the case here.®2

Moreover, the 22 Member States Declaration cannot deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction
since it postdates the commencement of these proceedings and jurisdiction must be
determined by reference to the date on which the proceedings are instituted.6°°

With regard to Spain’s EU law arguments, the Claimants first contend that EU law does
not constitute “applicable rules and principles of international law” relevant to the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction.6*4 Furthermore, Spain’s argument on the primacy of EU law rests
on the assumption that there is a conflict between EU law and the ECT, which in the
Claimants’ view is not the case.®*5 Should any such conflict exist, the ECT would prevail
under Article 16 of the ECT.®°

Finally, the Claimants submit that Spain’s request to invite the EU Member States to
intervene in these proceedings must be rejected, as Spain has failed to identify, let
alone substantiate, the legal basis for its request.” In any event, the Member States’
views on the legal consequences of the Achmea judgment are not relevant for this
arbitration and have already been reflected in their declarations.6°°

Discussion and Decision

The Respondent makes two requests in its submission of 7 March 2019. First, it asked
the Tribunal to “reconsider ex officio its jurisdiction in the present case in accordance
with its continuing obligation”.®®° Second, Spain “invite[s] the Tribunal to contact any of
the Member States signatories to the 22 Member State Declaration concerned with this
arbitration in order to confirm their unequivocal understanding of the Declaration and
the obligations contained therein”.6°

Starting with Spain’s first request, the Tribunal recalls that, under the Swiss /ex arbitri
and the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules applicable to these proceedings, an objection to the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction must be raised in limine litis.

In relevant part, Article 186 of the Swiss Private International Law Act (“PILA”) provides

as follows:

(2) A plea of lack of jurisdiction must be raised prior to any defence on the
merits.

(3) The arbitral tribunal shall, as a rule, decide on its jurisdiction by
preliminary award.

Article 23 of the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules, for its part, provides that:

(2) A plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised
no later than in the statement of defence [...].

(3) The arbitral tribunal may rule on a plea referred to in paragraph 2 either

as a preliminary question or in an award on the merits. [...]
The Respondent submitted its “intra-EU jurisdictional objection” timely at the outset of
the proceedings. In accordance with Articles 186(2) of the PILA and 23(3) of the
UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal ruled on such objection in the Preliminary Award on
Jurisdiction.

Under Swiss law, awards on jurisdiction must be challenged immediately, i.e. within 30
days of notification, for irregular constitution or erroneous determination on jurisdiction
(Articles 190(2)(a) and (b) and 190(3) PILA). It is undisputed that the Preliminary Award
was not challenged. As a result, that award binds the Tribunal and has thus res judicata
effect or conclusive and preclusive effects comparable to res judicata.®*' The Tribunal
stated this position on repeated occasions throughout these proceedings,®” including
in Procedural Order No. 19 issued on 15 October 2018 (“PO19”). In PO19, the Tribunal
denied Spain’s request to “open a new jurisdictional phase” as a consequence of the
judgment rendered by the CJEU in Achmea and the related communication and fact
sheet issued by the European Commission, as it considered that the Respondent was
seeking to re-litigate the same intra-EU objection, which the Tribunal had already
denied in the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction.®%°

See Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler & Antonio Rigozzi, International Arbitration: Law and
Practice in Switzerland (Oxford University Press, 2015), p. 387, para. 7.105. See also
Bernhard Berger & Franz Kellerhals, International and Domestic Arbitration in
Switzerland (Stampfli Publishers, 3 ed., 2015), p. 252, para. 705 (‘[...] a preliminary
award on jurisdiction is binding upon the arbitral tribunal. As opposed to other
preliminary and interim decisions, against which an immediate action for annulment is
inadmissible, it is not possible for the arbitral tribunal to return to the issue of jurisdiction
insofar as it has been affirmed in the preliminary award [...]. If the respondent waives
its right to challenge the preliminary award accepting jurisdiction, the award produces
conclusive and preclusive effects which are comparable to res judicata [...]”) (emphasis
added).

The Tribunal considers that the situation is no different here, as the Respondent
requests that the Tribunal “reconsider ex officio its jurisdiction” in relation to the same
intra-EU jurisdictional defense which Spain raised at the outset of the proceedings and
on which the Tribunal ruled in the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction.®% In PO19, the
Tribunal considered that the Achmea judgment, the EC communication, and the fact
sheet did not change the nature of the intra-EU objection already resolved by the
Tribunal, as its essence remained the same.® It can reach no different conclusion in
this instance. Indeed, the Declarations which Spain now invokes purport to provide an
interpretation “on the legal consequences of the Judgment of the Court of Justice in
Achmea and on investment protection in the European Union”.®°6 Thus, in no way do
they alter the intra-EU objection. They simply add possible legal arguments in support
of it. This being so, the Tribunal is of the view that its holdings in the Preliminary Award
on Jurisdiction in respect of the intra-EU jurisdictional objection continue to be binding
upon the Tribunal and cannot be re-opened. This conclusion is further consistent with
the accepted principle that the relevant time for determining jurisdiction is the date of
initiation of the proceedings.®9”

For these reasons, the Tribunal declines to entertain the Respondent's request to
“reconsider ex officio its jurisdiction” as a result of the Declarations.

With regard to the Respondent's second request, the Tribunal considers that the
Respondent has not sufficiently established why it should “invite” the views of the other
Member States on the matters set out above. While the Tribunal considers that it would
have the authority under its broad procedural powers to invite non-disputing State
parties to the ECT to provide their views on matters of interpretation of the Treaty, if

circumstances so justify, it sees no sufficient reason for doing so in this case.

First, whatever views Member States could advance before the Tribunal on this matter,

they could not lead the Tribunal to re-open its jurisdictional question, for the reasons

See Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction, paras. 132-207.

See PO19, para. 28.

See the title of the 22 Member States Declaration. The Hungary Declaration bears the
same title. Similarly, the 5 Member States Declaration concerns “The Enforcement Of
The Judgment Of The Court Of Justice In Achmea And On Investment Protection In
The European Union”.

See Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of Congo v. Belgium)
Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2002, p. 3, para. 26 (“The Court recalls that, according to its
settled jurisprudence, its jurisdiction must be determined at the time that the act
instituting proceedings was filed. Thus, if the Court has jurisdiction on the date the case
is referred to it, it continues to do so regardless of subsequent events [...]”).

explained above. Such an invitation would thus ultimately serve no purpose and only
burden the proceedings. Second, the Member States’ views are reflected in the three
Declarations and Spain has not explained what further input could be derived by
requesting the EU Member States’ comments. In the Tribunal’s view, it is sufficient to
look at the plain texts of the Declarations to observe that, while all EU Member States
appear to be of the view that the Achmea judgment concerns the interpretation of EU
law in relation to an investor-state arbitration clause contained in an intra-EU bilateral
investment treaty, they are not unanimous in respect of Achmea’s applicability to the
ECT. For instance, in the words of the five Member States, which include Luxembourg,
the State of nationality of a number of the Claimants in this proceeding, “the Achmea
judgment is silent on the investor-state arbitration clause in the Energy Charter
Treaty”.®° This being so, these five Member States as well as Hungary have
considered it “inappropriate” to express any views as regards the compatibility with
Union law of the intra EU application of the Energy Charter Treaty.°°9

In fact, even the twenty-two Member States that take the view that Article 26 as applied
in an intra-EU context “would be incompatible with the [EU] Treaties and thus would
have to be disapplied”,”” recognize that they “will discuss without undue delay whether
any additional steps are necessary to draw all the consequences from the Achmea
judgment in relation to the intra-EU application of the Energy Charter Treaty”.”'

It is thus clear that the States signatories to the three Declarations at present disagree
as to whether Achmea applies to the ECT and, if so, with what consequences. As put
by Hungary, “[t]he ongoing and future applicability of the ECT in intra-EU relations
requires further discussion and individual agreement amongst the Member States”
(emphasis added). Therefore, while such disagreement suggests that there is neither
a subsequent agreement nor subsequent practice regarding the interpretation of the
ECT under the VCLT, for present purposes it shows that seeking the views of the non-
disputing EU State Parties to the Treaty would not assist the Tribunal’s decision-
making. Accordingly, the Tribunal denies the second request raised in the
Respondent's submission of 7 March 2019.

LIABILITY AND QUANTUM
Introductory Remarks

The Tribunal begins its analysis with the so-called Primary Claim, i.e. the claim that
Spain’s regulatory framework and the “stabilization commitment” which it contains,
together with the specific assurances found in Spain’s contemporaneous statements,
gave rise to the legitimate expectation that the Claimants’ installations would be entitled
to receive the RD 661/2007 tariff for their operational life, and that the Disputed
Measures have frustrated that expectation.’ It is only if the Tribunal were to reach the
conclusion that the Primary Claim is ill-founded that it would address the Alternative
Claim, i.e. the claim that the Claimants are not entitled to earn the FIT under the RD
661/2007 regime, but only the reasonable return offered by the regulatory regime at the
time when they made their investments.’

Before engaging with the analysis, the Tribunal notes that this arbitration is one of the
numerous investment treaty cases which investors have brought against the Kingdom
of Spain alleging that the Disputed Measures violated the ECT. The Parties have
extensively discussed some of these cases,’ including Charanne,’°° Isolux,’°°
Eiser,’°’ and Novenergia.’° Other decisions, such as the one in RREEF”® among

others,’'? became publicly available after the Parties’ second PO12 PHBs and before

See, e.g., PO12 C-PHB1, para. 1 (explaining that the “Claimants’ primary claim [...] is
that Spain’s regulatory framework and the stabilisation commitment contained therein,
together with the specific assurances contained in Spain’s contemporaneous
statements, gave rise to the legitimate expectation that Claimants’ installations were
entitled to receive the RD 661/2007 tariff for their operational life. The Disputed
Measures have frustrated that expectation”). See also supra V.A.

See Letter from the Tribunal to the Parties of 9 December 2019 (where the Tribunal
“note[d] that, in addition to the decisions or awards that are on record as legal
authorities and [the two awards which the Respondent has brought to the Tribunal’s
attention in its latest communication], it is aware of a number of other publicly available
decisions or awards rendered in other arbitrations brought against the Kingdom of
Spain and which concern the measures at issue in this case. To the Tribunal’s
knowledge based on decisions published on the ICSID website, the [AReporter, and/or
italaw, decisions or award have been rendered in the following cases: [...]”. The
Tribunal also invited “the Parties to advise the Tribunal if there are other decisions or
awards rendered in arbitrations concerning the measures challenged in this arbitration,
in addition to those just mentioned”. It also noted that it did “not consider that it would
be assisted by submissions on the awards listed above and the two decisions to which
Spain drew its attention. However, if a Party wishes to file a short submission limited to
these awards, it is invited to inform the Tribunal within the same time limit. The Tribunal
would then give appropriate directions”).

See the Claimants’ e-mail of 11 December 2019 (noting that “[i]n view of the advanced
stage of the proceedings, the Claimants do not consider it necessary for the Parties to
file submissions on these decisions”) and the Respondent's e-mail of 11 December
2019 (noting that “regarding the possibility of filing a further submission on the new
decisions the Respondent agrees with the Tribunal in that at this stage of the process
it would probably not assist the Tribunal to receive additional submissions’).

554.

In accordance with the principle jura novit curia or more accurately jura novit arbiter,”"4
the Tribunal has reviewed all of the decisions or awards rendered in investment treaty
arbitrations that concern Spanish renewable energies. As just recalled, the Parties had
an opportunity to comment on these cases. Although the Tribunal has found it helpful
to consider all of these tribunals’ findings, especially on those issues of law which
appear similar across all Spanish renewable energy arbitrations, it has reached its own
conclusion based on the facts, the submissions and claims before it. As will be seen
from the analysis below, in addressing the arguments made by the Parties, the Tribunal
often engages with the conclusions drawn by other tribunals (to either distance itself or
find confirmation), including in particular on the interpretation of the ECT standards, the
Spanish legal framework, the content of the investors’ expectations, and Spain’s
alleged assurances. While it does not consider it necessary or useful to engage with
each and every one of the known Spanish RE awards in detail, in addressing the
arguments made by the Parties it indirectly explains its disagreement with those
tribunals that have chosen another approach.

By way of general overview of the outcomes of the Spanish RE cases, this Tribunal
notes that tribunals have taken a variety of approaches in deciding whether Spain is to
be held liable for its conduct in relation to the RE reforms. A number of tribunals (for
instance in Eiser, Masdar, and Novenergia) have upheld claims that in substance were
broadly similar to the Primary Claim in this arbitration. On the other end of the spectrum,
three cases have resulted in a total dismissal of the claims (Charanne, /solux, and
Stadtwerke). Finally, a third group of tribunals have entertained and, in some cases,
upheld — with nuances and non-identical approaches — claims that appear similar to the
Alternative Claim (so for instance RREEF and BayWa).”"* The picture is thus by far not
unanimous and rather shows a diversity of views between arbitral tribunals.

As the reasons set forth below will show, the Tribunal’s assessment of the expectations
which investors could derive from the regulatory framework and the reasonableness of

See supra VI.A.2.c.

See also Stadtwerke, paras. 327 et seq., in particular 337, 353 and 355 (where the
tribunal, after concluding that Spain’s measures were reasonable and proportionate,
“nonetheless consider[ed] whether the impact upon the Claimants’ investment
specifically was reasonable or proportionate through an assessment of the rate of
return earned by the Claimants’ investment before and after the disputed measures”);
In this context, the existence of RWE Innogy GMBH and RWE Innogy Aresa S.A.U. v.
Kingdom of Spain, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/34, Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability, and
Certain Issues of Quantum, 30 December 2019 is also noted, but without more as this
decision was issued after the Parties were given their last opportunity to comment.

167

Spain’s changes to such framework lead it to dismiss the Primary Claim and thus move
to assess the Alternative Claim. In reaching this conclusion, it follows a broadly similar
route to the one chosen by the third group of tribunals identified in the preceding
paragraph. By contrast and as a result of the chosen approach, this Tribunal’s
reasoning necessarily differs both from the one followed by tribunals that upheld claims
similar in substance to the Primary Claim and by those that dismissed all claims. The
difference in approach may be explained by a number of factors. First, the facts
presented to this Tribunal may not be identical to those underlying other decisions. For
instance, the arbitration in Charanne was limited to the 2010 Measures to the exclusion
of the 2013 Measures; /solux was concerned with investments made in October 2012,
ie. a few years after the last of the Claimants’ investment, at a time when in the /solux
tribunal’s view the regulatory framework for RE “was being object of various studies
which made its modification inevitable”;”'° in Masdar, the investors had received
specific individual confirmations from the State that their plants would receive the FIT
payments across their life span;’"” similarly, in NextEra, the claimants relied on specific
assurances given to them.”'® In addition to the facts, the claims raised in some of these
arbitrations differed from the present ones. In particular, in several cases upholding
claims akin to the Primary Claim, the tribunal appears to have been presented with no
claim equivalent to the Alternative Claim (in the sense of an actual claim, and not merely
a defense from the Respondent or alternative damages calculations from the
experts).’"9 Thus, in spite of the identity or close similarity of the subject matter of the
disputes and of the main issues of law, not all of the elements forming the basis of the

decision may be identical and the Tribunal has accordingly had “due regard to the
circumstances of [this] particular case” in reaching its decision.’2°

Further to possible differences in the underlying facts, submissions or claims, the
divergent approaches shown by arbitral tribunals may also be due to a different
appreciation of the circumstances that underpin the Spanish RE cases, and in particular
of the expectations which investors could derive from the regulatory framework and the
reasonableness of Spain’s changes to such framework. It is not entirely unsurprising,
and indeed to some extent to be expected in a system based on ad hoc adjudication,
that arbitral tribunals may assess relevant circumstances in different ways.

The Tribunal will now interpret the standards of protection under Article 10(1) of the
ECT (infra at VI.B.2). In light of the standards thus interpreted, it will assess whether
the Disputed Measures violated the Treaty (infra at VI.B.3). Because the Tribunal
reaches the conclusion that the Primary Claim cannot be upheld, it will move to
examining the Alternative Claim (infra at VI.B.4).

The Standards of Protection Contained in Article 10(1) of the ECT
Introductory Remarks

Article 10(1) of the ECT, which is invoked as the legal basis of the claims made in this
arbitration, provides as follows:

Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this
Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent
conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in
its Area. Such conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times
to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable
treatment. Such Investments shall also enjoy the most constant protection
and security and no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by
unreasonable or discriminatory measures their management, maintenance,
use, enjoyment or disposal. In no case shall such Investments be accorded
treatment less favourable than that required by international law, including
treaty obligations. Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it
has entered into with an Investor or an Investment of an Investor of any other
Contracting Party.

See also Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction, para. 53 (where the Tribunal noted that it
“believes that, subject always to the specific text of the ECT, and with due regard to the
circumstances of each particular case, it has a duty to contribute to the harmonious
development of international investment Law [...]’, emphasis added).

169

558.

559.

The Claimants have argued that Spain’s measures violated a number of the obligations
contained in Article 10(1) of the ECT. In their latest brief, they have summarized their
case in the following terms:

209. The Claimants claim that Spain has breached Article 10(1) of the ECT
in the following ways:

(i) Spain has failed to “create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent
conditions for Investors”.

(ii) Spain has failed to provide “fair and equitable treatment’ (FET). The
Claimants’ claim for breach of the FET provision rests on three non-
cumulative and distinct breaches of that provision. If Spain has breached
any one of these three requirements, then a breach of FET is established.
These breaches of the FET provision include:

(A) the Disputed Measures have frustrated the Claimants’
legitimate expectations;

(B) Spain has not been transparent in its conduct; and

(C) Spain has taken measures that are unreasonable, arbitrary and
disproportionate.

(iii) Spain has impaired the Claimants’ investments through “unreasonable
or discriminatory measures’.

(iv) Spain has failed to ensure that the Claimants’ investments were
afforded “the most constant protection and security”.’*'

The facts on which the Claimants base their claims in respect of each of these alleged
breaches are largely the same. There is also some overlap between the various sub-
elements of FET,’ as well as between some aspects usually considered part of FET
and other obligations under the Treaty, such as the obligation not to “impair by
unreasonable [...] measures [the] management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or
disposal” of investments to which the third sentence of such provision refers.”2°

PO12 C-PHB2, para. 209 (emphasis in the original, bold removed).

See ASoC, para. 428 (‘There is an overlap between the above aspects of the FET
standard. For example, an investor's legitimate expectations are closely connected with
a State's duty to provide a stable legal and business framework for investments and
not to act arbitrarily or adopt disproportionate measures. Ultimately, in applying the FET
standard, the Tribunal must determine whether, in all of the circumstances of the case,
Spain's actions vis-a-vis the investor were fair and equitable. Put differently, a
determination as to what constitutes a breach of the FET standard ‘cannot be reached
in the abstract; it must depend on the facts of the particular case” (internal footnote
omitted, emphasis removed)).

See ASOC, para. 490 (where the Claimants note that “a breach of this obligation results
in a simultaneous breach of the FET standard, as no action of the host State can be
fair or equitable if it is unreasonable or discriminatory”).

170

560.

561.

562.

563.

This being so, the Tribunal starts its analysis with FET, which is the standard that is
most prominent in the Parties’ pleadings.

Fair and Equitable Treatment
i. Content

Article 10(1) of the ECT provides for a commitment of the Contracting Parties “to accord
at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable
treatment”.

Under the rules of treaty interpretation, which have been examined in the Preliminary
Award,’%4 Article 10(1) must be construed “in good faith in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object
and purpose” (Article 31(1) of the VCLT). Furthermore, pursuant to Article 31(2) VCLT,
“[t]he context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition
to the text, including its preamble and annexes: (a) any agreement relating to the treaty
which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;
(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the
conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to
the treaty”. In limited circumstances, the Tribunal may have also regard to the
supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32 VCLT.

Starting from the text of the Treaty, this Tribunal, like others, notes that the plain
meaning of the words “fair and equitable” included in Article 10(1) of the ECT — as in
many other investment treaties - does not provide much assistance.’ The tribunal in
MTD v. Chile, for instance, observed that “[i]n their ordinary meaning, the terms ‘fair’
and ‘equitable’ [...] mean ‘just’, ‘even-handed’, ‘unbiased’, ‘legitimate’”’;’° while the
tribunal in S.D. Myers v. Canada stated that unfair and inequitable treatment meant
treatment “in such an unjust or arbitrary manner that the treatment rises to the level
that is unacceptable from the international perspective”.’2” As noted in Saluka, “[t]his is

probably as far as one can get by looking at the ‘ordinary meaning’ of the terms of
Article 3.1 of the Treaty”.’28

In their attempt to ascertain the ordinary meaning of similarly worded FET provisions
found in investment treaties, arbitral tribunals have identified a number of inherent
components of the standard.’° For instance, in Electrabel, the tribunal gave a
description that encapsulates the consensus emerging from the jurisprudence about
the core components of FET and reads as follows:

[T]he obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment comprises several

elements, including an obligation to act transparently and with due process;

and to refrain from taking arbitrary or discriminatory measures or from

frustrating the investor's reasonable expectations with respect to the legal

framework adversely affecting its investment.”°°
To the extent relevant to address the claims and prayers for relief before it, the Tribunal
likewise considers that FET encompasses the protection of legitimate or reasonable
expectations, the protection against arbitrary, unreasonable, and disproportionate

conduct, and the principle of transparency.

ii. FET and “Stability”

This being said, it is true that the ECT appears to place a greater emphasis on “stable”
conditions for investments than other treaties. The first sentence of Article 10(1)
provides that the Contracting Parties shall “encourage and create stable, equitable,
favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to
make Investments” (emphasis added). The second sentence adds that such conditions
“shall include a commitment to accord at all times” FET to investments of investors.
The Claimants have argued that the reference to stability should at a minimum inform
the content of FET, if not act as a self-standing obligation under the Treaty.

The Tribunal does not consider that stability is a stand-alone or absolute requirement
under the ECT;”*' rather, it views it as a requirement that is intertwined with and closely
linked to FET. This view is in line with findings of other tribunals. The tribunal in Plama
v. Bulgaria observed for example that “stable and equitable conditions are clearly part
of the fair and equitable treatment standard under the ECT”.’°? Similarly, the tribunal in
Electrabel v. Hungary held that “[flair and equitable treatment is connected in the ECT
to the encouragement to provide stable, equitable, favourable and transparent
conditions for investors”.’33 Recent decisions issued in investment arbitrations under
the ECT involving Spain endorse the same conclusion.’*4

This being so, in the Tribunal’s opinion, the Treaty provides for the creation and
maintenance of stable conditions as part of FET within well-defined limits which derive
from the object and purpose of the Treaty. In this context, Article 2 of the Treaty, which
is entitled “purpose of the Treaty”, expressly refers to the European Energy Charter (or
the “Charter’), a political declaration that formed the basis of the ECT:

This Treaty establishes a legal framework in order to promote long-term
cooperation in the energy field, based on complementarities and mutual
benefits, in accordance with the objectives and principles of the Charter.

Therefore, the object and purpose of the ECT must be assessed in light of the Charter
which is part of its context, since it was made by the Parties in connection with the
conclusion of the Treaty and accepted by them as an instrument related to the treaty.

In this respect, the Tribunal agrees with the tribunal in /so/ux that held that “the Arbitral
Tribunal did not find, in this Article, an autonomous obligation for the Contracting
Parties to promote and create stable and transparent conditions for the performance of
investments in its territory, and whose violation would generate rights in favour of the
investors of other Contracting Party, per se” (/solux Infrastructure Netherlands, B.V. v.

The objectives of the Charter are expressed in Title 1 which articulates the following
principles:

Within the framework of State sovereignty and sovereign rights over energy

resources and in a spirit of political and economic cooperation, [the

signatories] undertake to promote the development of an efficient energy

market throughout Europe, and a better functioning global market, in both

cases based on the principle of non-discrimination and on market-oriented

price formation, taking due account of environmental concerns. They are

determined to create a climate favourable to the operation of enterprises and

to the flow of investments and technologies by implementing market

principles in the field of energy.
As can be seen from these principles, the Parties to the ECT aimed at realizing a
balance between the sovereign rights of the State over energy resources and the
creation of a climate favorable to the flow of investments on the basis of market
principles.’55 In other words, while the purpose of “promotfing] long-term cooperation in
the energy field” which is stipulated in Article 2 of the Treaty may be facilitated by
stability of the investment framework, the requirement of stability is not absolute; it must
be balanced with other principles, including those that are directly derived from “State
sovereignty”, e.g. the State’s right to regulate and to adapt the regulatory framework to
changed circumstances. More generally, the protection of investments and the right to
regulate operate in a balanced way under the ECT as in all other investment treaties.

Bearing these considerations in mind, the Tribunal will now set out its understanding of
the various elements inherent in Article 10(1) of the ECT, to the extent that they are
relevant to the claims before it.

The centerpiece of the Claimants’ case is that the Disputed Measures frustrated their

standard protects legitimate expectations.’3’ They disagree, however, on the precise

See, e.g., SoD, para. 646, where Spain states that it “does not disagree with [the]
proposition” made by the tribunal in Saluka whereby “[t]he standard of ‘fair and
equitable treatment is [...] closely tied to the notion of legitimate expectations which is
the dominant element of the standard” (Saluka Investments BV v. Czech Republic, PCA
Case No. 2001-04, Partial Award, 17 March 2006, Exh. RLA-151, para. 301).

contours of such protection and on what the investors could legitimately expect under
the circumstances.

In conformity with a number of other investment decisions, the Tribunal recalls, that the
standard of protection of legitimate expectations is an objective and not a subjective
one. Thus, in the words of Charanne:

The determination of whether the investor's legitimate expectations have

been violated must be based on an objective standard or analysis. The mere

subjective belief that the investor could have had at the time of making the

investment does not suffice. Similarly, the application of this principle

depends on whether the expectation has been reasonable or not in the

specific case. In this regard, the representations that may have been made

by the host State to encourage the investment are relevant.’2°
Or, as was held in Perenco v. Ecuador, “a central aspect of the analysis of an alleged
breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard is the investor's reasonable
expectations as to the future treatment of its investment by the host State” which
requires “an objective determination of such expectations having regard to all relevant

circumstances”.’39

It is also commonly accepted that the investors’ expectations must be assessed at the
time of making the investment.’4°

Further, expectations which are purported to be founded on general legislation have
been treated with caution in a number of recent decisions. Those cases have
highlighted the tension between claims of “stability” based on alleged legitimate
expectations and the State’s sovereign prerogative to adapt the regulatory framework
to changed circumstances. In this respect, the Tribunal agrees with the statement in
Philip Morris v. Uruguay according to which:

It is common ground in the decisions of more recent investment tribunals

that the requirements of legitimate expectations and legal stability as

manifestations of the FET standard do not affect the State’s rights to

exercise its sovereign authority to legislate and to adapt its legal system to

changing circumstances.”4"
Recent cases dealing with alleged expectations arising from a regulatory framework
have looked at a number of factors to ascertain whether the expectation at issue was
legitimate. A first factor identified by tribunals is the existence of specific commitments
given by the State to an investor. Second, tribunals have underscored that a change in
regulatory framework affecting investors must be “reasonable” in order to be compliant
with FET. Third, in what can be seen as an over-arching requirement (in line with the
interplay between stability and FET highlighted above), an investor's legitimate
expectations must be balanced with the State’s right to regulate in the public interest.
The Tribunal briefly discusses each of these factors in turn, in so far as they are
pertinent for present purposes.

First, the presence of a specific promise or representation made by the host State and
relied upon by the investor may be important to determine the legitimacy of the
investor's expectation in respect of the stability of the regulatory framework.
Accordingly, for the tribunal in EDF v. Romania, “[e]xcept where specific promises or
representations are made by the State to the investor, the latter may not rely on a
bilateral investment treaty as a kind of insurance policy against the risk of any changes
in the host State’s legal and economic framework. Such expectation would be neither
legitimate nor reasonable” .”42

The tribunal in Continental v. Argentina further elaborated on these aspects in the
following terms:

[I]n order to evaluate the relevance of that concept [legitimate expectations]
applied within [the] Fair and Equitable Treatment standard and whether a
breach has occurred, relevant factors include:

i) the specificity of the undertaking allegedly relied upon which is mostly
absent here, considering moreover that political statements have the least
legal value, regrettably but notoriously so;

ii) general legislative statements engender reduced expectations, especially
with competent major international investors in a context where the political
tisk is high. Their enactment is by nature subject to subsequent modification,
and possibly to withdrawal and cancellation, within the limits of respect of
fundamental human rights and ius cogens; [...]°

Second, it is not sufficient that a change in the regulatory framework is detrimental to
the investors’ interests in order to entail State responsibility under the ECT. The change
must also be “unreasonable”. The Tribunal shares the approach taken by the tribunal
in El Paso, which underscored that “[e]Jconomic and legal life is by nature
evolutionary”’”4 and that:

[T]he legitimate expectations of any investor [...] [have] to include the real
possibility of reasonable changes and amendments in the legal framework,
made by the competent authorities within the limits of the powers conferred
on them by the law.”45

Similarly, the tribunal in Impregilo v. Argentina noted that:

The legitimate expectations of foreign investors cannot be that the State will
never modify the legal framework, especially in times of crisis, but certainly
investors must be protected from unreasonable modifications of that legal
framework.”

Third, some tribunals have subjected the protection of the investor's legitimate
expectations to a balancing act that takes into account the investors’ legitimate or
reasonable expectations and the host State’s right to regulate.”4” The requirement for

reasonableness of the changes and the balancing test involving the investor's interests
and the State’s right to regulate are, in turn, linked to the requirement of proportionality
of the measures. Once again, the Tribunal agrees with the tribunal in Electrabel which
held that:

[...] the application of the ECT’s FET standard allows for a balancing
exercise by the host State in appropriate circumstances. The host State is
not required to elevate unconditionally the interests of the foreign investor
above all other considerations in every circumstance. As was decided by the
tribunals in Saluka v Czech Republic and Arif v Moldova, an FET standard
may legitimately involve a balancing or weighing exercise by the host State.

That requires a balancing or weighing exercise so as to ensure that the
effects of the intended measure remain proportionate in regard to the
affected rights and interests. Provided that there is an appropriate correlation
between the policy sought by the State and the measure, the decision by a
State may be reasonable under the ECT’s FET standard even if others can
disagree with that decision. A State can thus be mistaken without being
unreasonable.’

Moreover, it is also recognized that States, as the entities tasked with balancing the
often competing interests involved, enjoy a margin of appreciation in the field of
economic regulation.”49 This means that an arbitral tribunal asked to review general
economic regulation will normally not second-guess the State’s choices; it will not
review de novo whether they are well-founded, nor assess whether alternative solutions
would have been more suitable. Governments often have to make controversial
choices, which especially those directly affected may view as mistaken, based on
misguided economic theory, placing too much emphasis on certain social values over
others.”® It is not the task of an investment treaty tribunal to evaluate the policy choices

RLA-166, para. 165; Rusoro Mining Limited v. Venezuela, ICSID Case No.

November 2015, Exh. RLA-166, paras. 165 and 180 (internal footnotes omitted).

The Tribunal finds confirmation for this conclusion in RREEF para. 262, noting that “[i]n
order to appreciate the legitimacy (or illegitimacy) of the Claimants’ expectations in the
present case, it must be kept in mind that it is generally recognized that States are in
charge of the general interest and, as such, enjoy a margin of appreciation in the field
of economic regulations. As a result, the threshold of proof as to the legitimacy of any
expectation is high and only measures taken in clear violation of the FET will be
declared unlawful and entail the responsibility of the State” (RREEF Infrastructure
(G.P.) Limited and RREEF Pan-European Infrastructure Two Lux S.a r.l. v. Kingdom of
Spain, |CSID Case No. ARB/13/30, Decision on Responsibility and on the Principles of
Quantum, 30 November 2018, para. 262).

that often underpin economic decisions. This being so, the margin of appreciation
accorded to the State cannot be unlimited; otherwise the substantive treaty protections
would be rendered wholly nugatory. In the Tribunal’s view, the limits of the State’s
power are drawn by the principles of reasonableness and proportionality, which must
guide a tribunal's assessment of the allegedly harmful changes in the legislation.”5"

Finally, while the three factors elucidated above are relevant in determining whether an
investor's expectations were legitimate under the circumstances, mutatis mutandis they
will also guide the Tribunal in its review of alleged violations of other Treaty obligations
be they sub-elements of FET (e.g., the prohibition of arbitrary or unreasonable
measures) or separate standards of protection (e.g., the obligation not to impair
investments by unreasonable measures) (see Article 10(1), third sentence).

In light of the principles just discussed, the Tribunal will now turn to the Primary Claim
and examine whether the Disputed Measures violated Article 10(1) of the ECT.

Primary Claim: Did the Disputed Measures Violate Article 10(1) of the ECT?

The Tribunal will first examine whether Spain’s measures frustrated the Claimants’
legitimate expectations (infra at VI.B.3.a). It will then review whether the Disputed
Measures were in breach of the other sub-elements of FET and guarantees provided
in Article 10(1) of the ECT (infra at VI.B.3.b). Finally, it will draw its conclusions on the
Primary Claim (infra at V1.B.3.c).

controversial choices. In doing so, they may appear to have made mistakes, to have
misjudged the facts, proceeded on the basis of a misguided economic or sociological
theory, placed too much emphasis on some social values over others and adopted
solutions that are ultimately ineffective or counterproductive. The ordinary remedy, if
there were one, for errors in modern governments is through internal political and legal
processes, including elections”) (SD Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada, Partial
Award, 13 November 2000, Exhs. CLA-9; RLA-156, para. 261).

noting that “[i]Jn the absence of a specific commitment, the state has no obligation to
grant subsidies such as feed-in tariffs, or to maintain them unchanged once granted.
But if they are lawfully granted, and if it becomes necessary to modify them, this should
be done in a manner which is not disproportionate to the aim of the legislative
amendment, and should have due regard to the reasonable reliance interests of
recipients who may have committed substantial resources on the basis of the earlier
regime”.

Legitimate Expectations

In sum, the Claimants contend that the 2010 and 2013 Measures (defined above
collectively as the “Disputed Measures”) frustrated their legitimate expectations that
they would enjoy the RD 661/2007 tariff for the lifetime of their plants.”52

At the outset, the Tribunal notes that the Disputed Measures are part of Spain’s
regulatory framework of the energy sector and in particular of the renewable energy
sector. As such, the Tribunal considers that it should not review the Disputed Measures

in isolation but rather in the context of this general framework.

It is not disputed that renewable energy (including photovoltaic, thermal, solar, wind
and certain other technologies) offers significant environmental benefits. Nor is it
contested that, due to the high capital requirements, renewable energy plants have not
been able to compete with conventional forms of power generation utilizing fossil fuels.
In other words, the market price of electricity is not sufficient to cover the costs of
installing and operating renewable energy plants. Accordingly, like many other
countries, Spain decided to promote the development of renewable energy through
what are in essence State subsidies.”°° As noted by the tribunal in Antin v. Spain, “[t]he
purpose of subsidization in this context is to allow the technologies to be developed in
the hope that over time the costs associated therewith will decline, thus making RE

technologies more competitive”.’54

The legislative centerpiece in Spain’s electricity regulation is the 1997 Electricity Law,
which aimed at liberalizing the energy market. In order to encourage the production of
energy from renewable sources, the 1997 Electricity Law created two distinct regimes:
an “Ordinary Regime” applicable to conventional sources of energy production (such
as coal-fired power plants) and a “Special Regime” applicable to facilities generating
electricity from renewable energy sources and registered in the RAIPRE. Facilities
qualifying under the Special Regime were entitled to the general, market-based

See supra V.A.1.d.

See also SolEs Badajoz GmbH v. Kingdom of Spain, \CSID Case No. ARB/15/38,
Award, 31 July 2019, para. 415 (“PV plants cannot compete with conventional forms of
energy production without substantial public subsidy or other form of incentive. They
are capital-intensive, meaning that most of an investor’s costs are incurred prior to
operation (90%, according to Claimant's expert). They face a long period for capital
recovery. Investments in PV plants are usually heavily leveraged (in the range of 55-
80% leverage)’).

remuneration applicable by default to all facilities plus a premium, to be set by the
Government through regulation. Under the Law, the premium was intended to enable
energy producers “to achieve reasonable rates of return based on the cost of money in
capital markets” (Art. 30(4)). More precisely, in its version in force at the time when the
Claimants made their investments, Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law read as
follows:

4. The payment regime for electricity production facilities under the special

regime shall be supplemented by the earning of a premium, under the terms
set by regulation, in the following cases:

a) Facilities referred to in letter a) of section 1 of article 27.

b) Hydroelectric power plants with installed capacity less than or equal to 10
MW, and all other facilities referred to in letter b) of section 1 of article 27.
For the purposes of this Act, urban solid waste and hazardous waste will
not be considered biomass.

c) Hydroelectric plants between 10 and 50 MW, facilities referred to in letter
c) of section 1 of article 27, as well as the facilities mentioned in paragraph
two of section 1 of article 27.

To determine the premiums, the voltage level of electricity delivered to the
network must be considered, along with the actual contribution to
improvement_of the environment, primary energy savings, and energy
efficiency, the economically justifiable production of usable heat, and the
investment_costs that have been incurred, for the purpose of achieving

reasonable rates of return with respect to the cost of money on the capital
market.’5

Following the 1997 Electricity Law, Spain enacted a number of regulations which
sought to specify the general parameters set out in the Law. These regulations were
passed in the context of global, regional and national efforts to address climate change,
aimed at the reduction of emissions of carbon dioxide. Against the background of the
1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 1997 Kyoto
Protocol to the UNFCCC, the European Union had also adopted rules committing
Member States, including Spain, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”° These rules

included measures to encourage the use of renewable and other environment-friendly

The first instrument enacted by the Government to implement the 1997 Electricity Law
was RD 2818/1998.”°” A few years after, it was followed by RD 436/2004 of 12 March

FIT.75§ In its preamble, RD 436/2004 stressed the principle of reasonable profitability in

guarantees owners of special regime installations a reasonable return_on

which enter operation after the date of entry into force referred to in the

previous sub-section, without retrospective effect on previous tariffs and

premiums.”
The scheme of incentives provided under RD 436/2004 was first modified by RD
2351/2004 and RD 1454/2005, and eventually replaced first by RDL 7/20067°' and
subsequently by RD 661/2007.” The latter affected existing facilities registered under

RD 436/2004, in spite of the rule contained in Article 40.3 of RD 436/2004.

RD 661/2007, which was in force when the Claimants made their investments, among
other things, provided a different FIT and modified the incentives in a number of
respects. In its preamble, it stressed the principle of reasonable profitability in the
following terms:

The economic framework established in this Royal Decree develops the
principles contained in Law 54/1997, of 27 November, on the electricity
sector, guaranteeing the owners of special regime facilities a

return_on_their_ investments and electricity consumers a reasonable

allocation of costs attributable to the electricity system [...].”°°
The Tribunal agrees with Spain that the cardinal principle emerging from Article 30.4 of
the 1997 Electricity Law and the implementing decrees up to RD 661/2007 is
reasonable profitability or the guarantee of a reasonable rate of return for investors
operating in the Special Regime. In other words, the 1997 Electricity Law established
the principle of reasonable profitability or reasonable rate of return as general rule
leaving it to the implementing regulation, to establish the means ensuring such
reasonable profitability.

Starting from 2010, in economic conditions that had significantly changed (as explained
below), a number of regulations modified the incentives scheme provided by
RD 661/2007. In 2010, the Government enacted RD 1565/2010 of 19 November 2010
and RDL 14/2010 of 23 December 2010, imposing restrictions and caps on the
entitlement to the FIT. In 2013, Spain then introduced RDL 2/2013 substituting another
index to CPl-linked updating mechanism for the FIT. Subsequently, it promulgated
RDL 9/2013 in July 2013 and Law 24/2013 in December 2013, which replaced RD
661/2007 entirely with an incentive scheme based on different types of subsidies.

In respect of the regulatory framework in force at the time when they made their
investments, the Claimants’ main argument is that Spain provided “stabilization
commitments” in RD 661/2007 and other representations which it was bound to
observe for the lifetime of the qualifying plants. The Claimants place special reliance
on Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007 to support their argument that future changes could not
affect the benefits they were promised under RD 661/2007 and that their expectation
of a 25-year FIT in the amount specified in RD 661/2007 was legitimate.

Article 44.3 reads as follows:

In 2010, in view of the result of the follow-up reports on the extent to which
the Renewable Energy Plan for 2005-2010 and the Energy Saving and
Efficiency Plan for Spain (E4) have been achieved, as well as the new
objectives included in the next Renewable Energy Plan for 2011-2020,
tariffs, premiums, additional payments, and lower and upper thresholds set
out in this royal decree will be reviewed, taking into account the costs
associated with each of these technologies, the degree of participation of
the special regime in meeting demand and its impact on the technical and
economic management of the system, guaranteeing reasonable returns with
reference to the cost of money on capital markets. Every four years
thereafter a new adjustment will be carried out using the above criteria.

translation).

602.

The adjustments to the regulated tariff and the lower and upper thresholds
referred to in this section will not affect the facilities for which the start-up
document was issued before January 1 of the second year after the year in
which the adjustment was implemented.”

The Tribunal is unable to discern in this provision a stabilization commitment that would
guarantee the Claimants an immutable tariff for the operational lifetime of their plants.
For the Tribunal, a systematic interpretation of this provision in its proper context can
lead to no other conclusion.

At the outset, it must be recalled that, as an act of general regulation, RD 661/2007
was subject to the power of the legislative bodies of Spain to change the applicable
rules according to constitutional procedures and principles governing law-making. It is
correct that Article 44.3 states that certain revisions that may occur in the future under
that decree would not affect existing installations. However, that mere statement in and
of itself does not make of Article 44.3 a stabilization commitment according to which
the State guaranteed that future legislative or regulatory change would not affect the
investment. Moreover, Article 44.3 cannot be read in isolation but must be viewed in
the context of the entirety of the Spanish regulatory framework. This context includes a
number of important elements.

First, as is evident from the changes which occurred since the inception of the Special
Regime in 1997, the regulatory framework was subject to continuous changes aimed
at adapting it to the constantly evolving technological and economic circumstances.
This propensity for change should have been clear to any reasonable operator
investing in this sector.”© In particular, RD 661/2007 had been preceded by a multitude
of changes in the previous decade. Furthermore and importantly, one of the
instruments introducing changes, RD 436/2004, contained a clause analogous to
Article 44.3, i.e. Art. 40.3, and that clause had not barred the Government from
introducing still other changes through the very instrument (RD 661/2007) under which
the Claimants decided to invest and on which they base their Primary Claim. In such a

and Royal Decree Law 14/2010 modified the established economic regime in RD

implementation of Law 54/1997, of 27 November 1997, regarding the Electrical Sector
(LSE), showed a very unstable character of a regulatory framework that the
government has the power and the duty to adapt to the economic and technical needs
of the moment, within the LSE framework’).

constantly evolving framework, the Tribunal does not see how an expectation of
receiving the identical FIT during 25 years (only indexed to inflation) could have been

reasonable.

Second, in rulings on the various decrees that followed one another through the years,
the Spanish Supreme Court had similarly held that an investor should reasonably have
expected possible changes in the regulatory framework. For a tribunal operating under
international law, domestic judgments are mainly “facts”. As facts, they are relevant to
the assessment of the existence of reasonable expectations. As the tribunal in

Charanne held,

[although these decisions by the Spanish courts are not binding on this

Arbitral Tribunal, they are factually relevant in order to verify that the investor

was unable, at the time of the disputed investment, to have the reasonable

expectation that, in the absence of a specific commitment, the regulation

was not going to be modified during the lifespan of the plants.”°°
Obviously, only judgments issued prior to the Claimants’ investments could inform their
legitimate expectations. Thus, to assess the legitimacy or reasonableness of
expectations, the Tribunal disregards later decisions. For the sake of completeness, it
nevertheless observes that subsequent decisions did not contradict the Court's earlier

pronouncements.

The first relevant judgment was rendered by the Supreme Court on 15 December 2005.
There, the Court addressed the changes that RD 436/2004 had introduced to the
previous regulations governing the economic regime for renewable energies. The Court
held that the State has the power to amend a system of remuneration to modify the
electricity sector, provided it complies with the general framework provided by the 1997

Electricity Law:767

There is no legal obstacle for the Government, in the exercise of its
regulatory powers and the broad prerogatives which it enjoys in a heavily
regulated sector such as electricity, to modify a specific system of
remuneration provided that it remains within the framework established in
the ESL [the 1997 Electricity Law] (RCL 1997, 2821). (Tribunal’s translation)

Less than one year later, on 25 October 2006, the Supreme Court ruled on a challenge
to the legality of RD 2351/2004, which had modified RD 436/2004. It insisted that
operators entering a regulated market functioning with economic incentives must be

aware that an incentive scheme may be amended as long as it stayed within the scope
of the guarantee of reasonable profitability anchored in the 1997 Electricity Law. It is
helpful for our purposes to quote the pertinent passages in full:

The appeal, raised on these terms, cannot be upheld. As the State Attorney
tightly states, the owners of electricity production installations under the
special regime do not have an “unalterable right” to remain in an unchanged
economic regime governing the collection of premiums. The scheme is
designed to promote renewable energy by an incentive mechanism which,
like all those of this type, does not guarantee to remain unchanged in the
future.

It is true that in this case fixing the premiums is subject to legislative
guidelines, as stated above, but it is also true that the Council of Ministers
can, respecting them, introduce quantitative variations in formulas by which
the premiums are periodically authorised or their calculation. If the
modification has not deviated from these legal guidelines and, again, there
is no allegation of infringement of Article 30 of the Law on the Electrical
Sector, it will be difficult to consider them as contrary to law.

The value of "legal certainty" cannot be applied to a regulatory amendment
as allegedly invalidating this argument. It is true that the rules should provide
some stability to the requlatory frameworks of economic activities (in fact in
the preamble to Royal Decree 436/2004, amended by the provision now
under challenge, stated that "(...) this new methodology for calculating the
special regime charges, for the security and stability it offers, should help
encourage investment in this type of installation"), but so it is that legal
certainty is not_incompatible with the regulatory changes from the
perspective of their validity, which is the only factor on which we can decide
in law.

The same consideration applies to the principle of legitimate expectations,
increasingly but unduly deployed as an argument against quite a few
regulatory changes that some economic operators have deemed more or
less harmful to their interests. The appellants argue that their investments in
the production of electrical energy under the special regime were made at a
particular time "when they trusted the Government not to change the legal
conditions that decided them to (...) build their facility". This premise leads
them to conclude that the reduction of premiums subsequent to Royal
Decree 2351/2004 with respect to those in Royal Decree 435/2004 is
contrary to the principle.

We cannot agree that this reasoning can be applied to_an_ incentive
mechanism such as the premiums in question. Until replaced by another,
the above outlined legal regulation (Article 30 of the Electricity Law) allows
the respective companies to expect that the fixing of the premiums can be
included _as a factor relevant, to their obtaining “reasonable rates of
return with r to the cost of money in the capital market" or, to
put it again in the words of the preamble to Royal Decree 436/2004.
“reasonable compensation for their investment”. However, the payment
regime under examination does not guarantee to special regime electricity
producers that a certain level of profits or revenues will be unchanged
relative to those obtained in previous years, or that the formulas for fixing
the premiums will stay unchanged.

 

In the same manner as on the basis of economic policy factors of very
different sign (relating to the promotion of renewable energy but also the
planning of electricity sector networks, as well as other energy saving and

186

609.

efficiency considerations), premiums and incentives for the production of
electricity under the special regime can increase from one year to another,
they may also fall when these same considerations also so advise. Provided
that, we would stress, these changes are kept within the legal limits which

discipline this mode _of promotion, the mere fact that the updating or
economic direction of the premium rises or falls does not constitute in itself
grounds for nullity or affect the legitimate expectation of recipients.

Undertakings which freely decide to enter the market, such as the energy
generation market under the special regime, knowing beforehand that it is to
a large part dependent on public authorities fixing economic incentives, are
or must be aware that these incentives can be modified within the legal
quidelines, by such authorities. One of the "regulatory risks" to which they
submit, which they must necessarily bear, is precisely that of variation in the
parameters of the premiums or incentives. that the Electricity Sector Law
tempers, as previously discussed, but does not exclude such variation.”
In two later judgments, dating from 20 March and 9 October 2007, the Supreme Court

adopted similar rulings.”°?

Thus, at the time when the Claimants made their investments, the Spanish Supreme
Court had rejected challenges to the various modifications of the regulatory incentive
mechanisms and denied that investors had a vested right to specific subsidies. It is true
that these decisions concerned the regulations preceding RD 661/2007, and not RD
661/2007 itself, and may have covered different types of installations. Yet, the Court’s
reasons address the State’s power to modify regulatory incentives in a general manner
that appears valid irrespective of the specifics of the actual case before it. As a result,
a reasonably informed investor should have known that changes in the regulatory
framework could occur. In other words, these judgments sent a clear message that the
remuneration offered to any kind of installations under the Special Regime could be
amended.

In this respect, the Tribunal agrees with the finding in Charanne that:

[the] case law from the highest courts in Spain [...] clearly established, prior
to the investment, the principle that domestic law allows for changes to be
made to the regulation. [...] at the time of making the investment in 2009,
the Claimants could have carried out an analysis of the Spanish legal

framework in relation to their investment and understood that the regulations

enacted in 2007 and 2008 could be modified.””°
The Supreme Court’s holdings reviewed above were then confirmed in a number of
judgments issued in December 2009 dealing with complaints that arose from the
replacement of RD 436/2004 by RD 661/2007.’’' While these judgments are not
relevant to ascertain the expectations of the Claimants, as they were handed down at
the time when the investments were being finalized or were already completed,’’? they
are noteworthy because they confirm the principles set in the earlier judgments and
thus show a consistent jurisprudence.

In sum, prior to the Claimants’ investment and thereafter, the Spanish courts had
consistently held that tariffs and related incentives were not “immutable” and investors
had no vested right to specific subsidy for the future; that RD 436/2004 did not freeze
the remuneration system in spite of Article 40.3; that the State had the power to change
the regulatory system, and that the law guaranteed operators that they would achieve
a reasonable rate of return on investments.

With that background in mind and in light of all circumstances, the Tribunal does not
consider it reasonable for investors to have expected — from an objective viewpoint and
regardless of what their subjective belief may have been — that no regulatory changes

to RD 661/2007 affecting their investments would ever occur.

It is in this context that the arguments and submissions in respect of the investor's due
diligence must be viewed. For the Tribunal, this debate lacks relevance for present
purposes. Indeed, whether the Claimants engaged in diligence or not and whether that
diligence was “due” or not, cannot alter the fact that on the basis of the law and the
jurisprudence the Claimants knew or should have known that changes to the regulatory
framework could happen. As a consequence, expectations that they would not happen
cannot be deemed legitimate.

So far, the analysis shows that the regulatory framework, including RD 661/2007, did
not provide for a stabilization guarantee according to which investors would enjoy an

immutable tariff for the life of their plants. It remains to be seen whether a different
conclusion may arise from other alleged “representations” or “assurances” by Spain,
its organs, and institutions linked to the Government. While it is true that Spain launched
a campaign to promote the regulations and attract “green” investments, the Tribunal is
of the view that none of the representations invoked by the Claimants constitute
promises not to change the incentives contained in RD 661/2007.

These representations, too, must be placed in their proper context, i.e. that of a
constantly evolving framework for which there was no suggestion that the State had
somehow waived its sovereign prerogatives to change the laws or regulations. None of
the documents, presentations, press releases, at issue are specific enough to “lead
anyone to reasonably infer that the regulated tariff would remain unmodified during the
entire lifespan of the plants”.’’> For instance, the press release issued by the Ministry
of Industry, Energy and Tourism on 25 May 20077” does no more than reiterate the
content of RD 661/2007. Furthermore, the documents, in particular PowerPoint
presentations, prepared by IDAE, InvestInSpain and the CNE’’5 are too general as to
engender legitimate expectations that the framework could not be modified. They also
make clear that the incentives granted by Spain are policy tools to achieve the targets
set by Spanish and EU regulations sufficient to grant investors “reasonable
profitability”.’’° It should also be borne in mind that these entities were not empowered
to enact rules or regulations on energy issues in Spain.’’’ Thus, none of the additional
“assurances” is susceptible of changing the clear position that emerges from RD

661/2007 read systematically against the backdrop of the 1997 Electricity Law and from
the interpretation of the regulatory framework given by Spain’s highest court.

Having established that reasonable investors could not expect an immutable tariff for
the operational lifetime of their plants, the question arises what, if anything, they could
have expected. As the Tribunal has already noted, investors could legitimately expect
to receive a reasonable return on their investments. This entitlement is enshrined first
and foremost in the 1997 Electricity Law, which is the cornerstone of the Spanish
electricity system. It is repeated in the preamble to RD 436/2004 and later, more
importantly, in that of RD 661/2007. In other words, reasonable profitability or the
“guarantee” of reasonable rates of return, to use the terms of the preamble of
RD 661/2007, was the regulatory framework’s /eitmotiv, the essential feature
underpinning all of the instruments that were enacted through the years. The
requirement of reasonable profitability restricted the State’s power to amend the
framework and thereby guaranteed a level of stability of the conditions in which
investors operated. Differently put, that requirement ensures the existence of “stable
conditions” pursuant to Article 10(1) of the ECT.778

More specifically, Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law provides for the achievement
of “reasonable rates of return with respect to the cost of money on the capital market”.
Accordingly, an investor is entitled to a return, i.e. it is entitled to make a profit after
having paid its capital and operating expenses. Moreover, the reasonableness of the
profit or return must be measured by reference to the cost of money in financial matters.

It should be added that, in all relevant legislative and regulatory instruments, the
principle of reasonable return or profitability is always intertwined with other

The Tribunal finds confirmation of its conclusion that any expectation that investors
could legitimately have had was to obtain a reasonable rate of return on their
investment in the holding of the tribunal in RREEF which held that “[t]he Claimants
cannot prevail themselves of a fixed rate of return for their investment. However, the
Arbitral Tribunal is of the view that, whatever the means chosen by the Respondent,
the Claimants could legitimately expect a return for their investment at a reasonable
rate which implies significantly above a mere absence of financial loss, the precise
average rate taking into account the actual cost of money on capital markets for such
investments as well as other objectives”. See RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Limited and
RREEF Pan-European Infrastructure Two Lux S.a r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain, |ICSID Case
No. ARB/13/30, Decision on Responsibility and on the Principles of Quantum, 30
November 2018, para. 387. See also BayWa, para. 498 (noting that “this Tribunal
agrees with the RREEF tribunal that the only legitimate expectation the Claimants could
have had was that of a ‘reasonable return’ in terms of Law 54/1997”).

622.

considerations, in particular the State’s concern about the cost of electricity and the
competitiveness with other means of production of energy.’’9

Furthermore, in the Tribunal’s view, the guarantee to obtain a reasonable return does
not imply that it acts as a “cap”. When RD 661/2007 was in force (and the economic
conditions allowed it), it cannot be doubted that efficient installations could outperform
the reasonable return target and were entitled to keep the profits which the system
allowed them to make. In this sense, the Tribunal does not agree with Spain’s
characterization of those returns as “windfall” or “luxury” profits. However, the principle
of reasonable return places a limit on regulatory changes in the future, in the sense
that, when the changed economic conditions prompted Spain to modify RD 661/2007,
these modifications could not affect the reasonable rates of return that were promised
under the 1997 Electricity Law.

On the basis of the foregoing discussion, the Primary Claim must be dismissed insofar
as it relates to their alleged expectations of obtaining the fixed tariff under RD 661/2007.
As a result, the Tribunal will examine the Alternative Claim and determine whether the
Disputed Measures frustrated the Claimants’ legitimate expectations of a reasonable
return (infra at VI.B.4). Before doing so, it must, however, review the other elements of

the Primary Claim.

Other Alleged Breaches of Article 10(1) of the ECT

Before moving to the Alternative Claim, the Tribunal thus addresses the other elements
of the Primary Claim, namely the allegations that regardless of legitimate expectations,
the regulatory changes were unreasonable, arbitrary, disproportionate, non-
transparent, or violated the full protection and security standard.

The Claimants contend that Spain’s “abrupt and drastic changes””®° to the regulatory
framework were unreasonable, arbitrary, and disproportionate, because “the
guarantees of the RD 661/2007 economic regime that had seduced many investors —
such as the Claimants — were dismantled and repudiated”.’6' More specifically, for the
Claimants “[i]t was [...] unreasonable to strip the Claimants of the key elements of the

regulatory regime upon which their investments were made”.”*? They also argue that
the regulatory changes were “arbitrary” within the meaning given by the ICJ in the ELS/
case because “Spain committed to provide the FIT at a fixed level for 25 years and
then, at a lower level, in subsequent years. It provided an express ‘guarantee’ that this
FIT would not be changed for existing plants. Once this had successfully induced the
investment [...] Spain wanted, Spain simply withdrew the regime. It cannot be disputed
that such behaviour shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial propriety”.’®°
Finally, the Claimants contend that the Disputed Measures were “disproportionate” as
“there is no reasonable relationship between the burden imposed on the Claimants’
investments and the stated goal of addressing the Tariff Deficit. Spain’s measures had
a disproportionate impact on the Claimants’ investments and were introduced
notwithstanding Spain's alternative options to adopt less harmful measures to ECT-
protected investments”.’ In particular, the Claimants submit that the tariff deficit was
largely the product of Spain’s own failure to comply with its laws and in any event there
were alternative less harmful solutions to address that problem.785

It arises from this summary of the Claimants’ arguments that like for legitimate
expectations, the alleged violations of other standards embodied in Article 10(1) are
predicated upon the entitlement to the RD 661/2007 tariff. In line with its earlier
conclusion that the Claimants could not legitimately expect the immutability of such
tariff, the Tribunal is equally unable to accept that the elimination of RD 661/2007 and
related benefits in itself constituted conduct that was unreasonable, disproportionate,
arbitrary, or otherwise not “fair and equitable”. Indeed, accepting a violation of the
Treaty on these grounds would be tantamount to endorsing the immutability of the RD
661/2007 tariff, which would be contrary to the conclusion reached above in respect of
legitimate expectations. The position would be different if the changes were shown to
deprive the Claimants of a reasonable return, as opposed to a fixed remuneration
scheme. However, this is the subject of the Alternative Claim; it is not the basis of the

present claim.

Even if the mere fact of changing the RD 661/2007 tariff was not a violation in and of
itself, the changes could arguably still be unreasonable, disproportionate, or arbitrary.
In this connection, the Tribunal disagrees with the approach of other tribunals that have

held that “the Claimants are in a worse position under the New Regulatory Regime than
they would have been had the Respondent not abrogated the RD 661/2007 regime
[and] are therefore entitled to compensation for the Respondent's breach of
Article 10(1) ECT”.’® In this Tribunal’s view, to establish liability as a result of regulatory
changes, it is not sufficient that the investor is in a “worse position” than it would have
been under RD 661/2007. Rather, the Treaty requires that the changes must be
unreasonable, arbitrary, or disproportionate.”®”

In this respect, the Tribunal considers that the Claimants have failed to establish that
the Disputed Measures were unreasonable, arbitrary or disproportionate because the
new regime does not guarantee them the same tariff, or the same types of incentives,
or returns comparable to those they made at the time of investment. The Respondent,
for its part, has offered sufficient justifications for the enactment of the Disputed
Measures which exclude a breach of the ECT on the grounds addressed here.

In analyzing the justifications put forward by the Respondent in support of the Disputed
Measures, as recalled above,’®® the Tribunal must be satisfied “that there is an
appropriate correlation between the policy sought by the State and the measure”.”8°
Further, in assessing a State’s regulatory measures of general economic impact, the
Tribunal owes a measure of deference to the Respondent.”°

This being so, the Tribunal notes that the regulatory changes were prompted by a range
of factors. While in 2007, Spain’s economy was growing at a pace of 3.7%, in 2009
after the global economic crisis, its GDP growth had turned negative to -3.6%.79"
Unemployment grew from 8% in 2007 to 25% in 2012.”°* The negative evolution of the
Spanish economy as a result of the financial crisis produced a substantial reduction in
demand of electricity during the period 2009-20137 and the tariff deficit rose from
EUR 2 billion in 2005 to EUR 28.5 billion at the end of 2013, representing almost 3%
of its GDP. This rise cannot be attributed to the fact that the State had not increased
electricity prices in the year preceding the Disputed Measures. Indeed, Spain has
demonstrated that it did proceed to price increases.’

Faced with these pressing problems, Spain had a range of available options. In simple
terms, it could have either imposed the burden on the producers, or on the consumers,
or on the state budget. Rather than selecting one option over another, it chose a middle
course, i.e. it reduced the producers’ rate of return while still guaranteeing a reasonable
profit. The revised rate of return was approved by the European Commission’”® and is
aligned with those granted by other European Union Member States, such as France,
Italy, Estonia, Latvia,’”9” and the Czech Republic.”%° There was thus an appropriate

correlation between the policy objectives pursued by Spain and the Disputed Measures
that diminished the amount required for subsidies in the renewable energy sector.

Spain also sought to avoid increasing the price of electricity charge to consumers even
further. The Tribunal finds no element of unreasonableness or arbitrariness in Spain’s
assertion that “in an economy heavily impacted by the economic crisis, to continue
increasing the tariff payable by consumers was not an option as consumers had less
capacity to pay due to the unemployment level and per capita income and such a
measure could have only contributed to worsen the economic situation”.’°°

Therefore, subject to considering whether the Disputed Measures continue to afford
the Claimants a reasonable rate of return (a question that is part of the Alternative
Claim), the Tribunal considers that the Disputed Measures were not unreasonable,
arbitrary, and disproportionate. It thus dismisses the Primary Claim insofar as it is based
on these additional legal grounds, whether rooted in the FET standard or in the
separate obligation not to impair investments by unreasonable measures.

Furthermore, the Claimants complain that the enactment of the Disputed Measures
violated Spain's obligation to treat investors transparently. The Tribunal considers that
the record does not bear this complaint. It is not established that Spain was not
forthcoming with information on the intended changes in regulations. To the contrary,
the Tribunal observes that Spain engaged in dialogue with investors prior to making
changes and subjected the intended modifications to public consultations,®°° in the

context of which numerous industry associations and companies submitted

comments.®*"

Neither does the record show that the Claimants were “left in the dark” for eleven
months between RDL 9/2013 and the time when the Parameters Order was issued.
The Tribunal does not find that the time elapsed between these two instruments
involved a Treaty breach. Legislative processes often include consultation steps
involving a variety of stakeholders - which fosters rather than hinders transparency -
and these consultations may typically entail delays in the issuance of the final piece of
legislation. In any event, the Claimants acknowledge that “RDL 9/2013 provided that
during this period the old regime would continue to apply” and that “producers would
continue to sell electricity under the former regime”.®°? Hence, even if the delay had
violated the transparency obligation (quod non), that violation would have caused no
harm. Finally, the Claimants also rely on the fact that the so-called Memoria Economica
had not been published. While the Memoria was not published in the State Official
Gazette, Spain has sufficiently established that it was “publicly available” upon request
as it formed part of the “regulatory dossier” of draft RD 661/2007,®°° which in the
Tribunal’s opinion rules out a breach of transparency.

Finally, the Claimants raise a claim for breach of the full protection and security (FPS)
standard. They base such claim on the same facts as those underlying the FET claims,
and allege that “for reasons considered at Section 7 above [of the ASoC], Spain’s
measures have destroyed the legal framework of the investments. They are therefore
in breach of the FPS standard”.6 The Claimants further argue that “the New Regime
represents a complete overhaul of the regulatory regime (RD 661/2007) undermining
the very foundations on which the Claimants made their investments”. According to
them that regime “no longer provides the stable and predictable revenue streams at
levels sufficient to service the required financing, nor does the New Regime provide the

returns that justified investing in the Spanish PV sector in 2007 and 2008”.®°° The
obligation of full protection and security, so the Claimants continue, has been breached
“as the Disputed Measures have caused Claimants to lose their right to the FIT”.8°°

Assuming for the sake of discussion that FPS encompasses legal as opposed to
physical protection, it remains that the FPS claim is predicated upon the loss of the
guarantees established in RD 661/2007. As such, for the very reasons discussed in

relation to that loss in the context of the FET grounds, this claim cannot succeed either.

As a last point, the Tribunal reverts to the European Commission's decision on State
Aid dated 10 October 2017, which it has carefully reviewed along with the Parties’
related submissions and the European Commission's observations of 19 June 2018. In
this connection, the Tribunal observes that the decision primarily concerns the
lawfulness of the new regulatory regime under EU state aid law and does not rule on
the compatibility of RD 661/2007 with EU state aid rules. This being so, the Tribunal
does not consider that its conclusions are incompatible with the findings of the
European Commission on the Disputed Measures. The Tribunal notes in particular that

in paragraph 120 the Commission took the following view:

Spain has submitted cash flow calculations of 21 standard facilities. These
are representative of the various technologies and installation types
supported by the scheme. The data show the past sales income (including
those deriving from the premium economic scheme for existing facilities),
the expected future sales income, the initial investment costs, the operating
costs and the compensation to be granted to each facility both for operations
and for investments. For all examples provided, the Commission has verified
that the aid does not exceed what is required to recover the initial investment
costs and the relevant operational costs, plus a margin of reasonable return,
based on the past and estimated costs and market prices (7.503 % before
tax for new facilities and 7.398 % for existing facilities). These rates appear
to be in line with the rates of return of renewable energy and high efficiency
cogeneration projects recently approved by the Commission and does not
lead to overcompensation.[FN 57]

The Tribunal is aware of the following statement from the Commission that an award
of compensation that were to be issued on the basis that Spain has modified RD
661/2007 through the Disputed Measures would constitute state aid:

The Commission recalls that any compensation which an Arbitration

Tribunal were to grant to an investor on the basis that Spain has modified

the premium economic scheme by the notified scheme would constitute in

and of itself State aid. However, the Arbitration Tribunals are not competent

to authorise the granting of State aid. That is an exclusive competence of

the Commission. If they award compensation, such as in Eiser v Spain, or

were to do so in the future, this compensation would be notifiable State aid

pursuant to Article 108(3) TFEU and be subject to the standstill obligation.®°°
The Tribunal has also noted the Claimants’ view that these explanations are “incorrect
as a matter of [EU] law”.®°° This question may be left open, in particular because the
Tribunal must rule on the basis of the ECT and not on projections of hypothetical
consequences of the award. The Tribunal also observes that the Commission’s and
Spain’s conclusions on this point appear premised on the possibility that an arbitral
tribunal were to award compensation along the lines of the Primary Claim (see the
Commission’s reference to the award in Ejser), which claim the Tribunal does not
uphold. By contrast, there seems to be no suggestion either from the Commission or
from Spain that an award would constitute State aid if made on the basis of the
Alternative Claim (which takes as a starting point Spain’s defense that the Claimants

could legitimately expect reasonable profitability).

Conclusions on the Primary Claim

For all of these reasons, the Primary Claim cannot be upheld. In summary, the Tribunal
reaches the conclusion that from the start of the Special Regime for RE with the 1997
Electricity Law, the Spanish legislature provided that investors would be entitled to
“reasonable profitability” of their investments. The reasonable return on investments
was also a key element of the regime established by RD 661/2007. In the Tribunal’s
view, the principle of reasonable return serves as the limit of ECT-compliant regulatory
changes. If changes cross the “reasonable return” line, that is if they deprive investors
of a reasonable return, the State conduct transgresses the standards contained in
Article 10(1) of the ECT.

In other words, the Claimants are only entitled to compensation under Article 10(1) of
the ECT if they establish that the new regime violates the guarantee of reasonable rate
of return.®’° This approach strikes the right balance between, on the one hand, the
protection of investors who have committed substantial resources in a sector which
continues to provide Spain with the environmental benefits of clean solar power, and,
on the other hand, Spain’s right to regulate and adapt its framework to changed
circumstances, provided that right is exercised in a manner that is proportionate,
reasonable, and non-arbitrary manner.

The Tribunal must now examine whether the regime substituting RD 661/2007 deprived
the Claimants of a reasonable return. It thus moves to the analysis of the Alternative
Claim.

The Alternative Claim

In this section, the Tribunal analyzes whether Spain violated the ECT by not providing
the Claimants with the “reasonable rate of return” which it promised under the
regulatory framework in place when the Claimants made their investments. If Spain
complied with its promise, there is no breach of the Treaty. If Spain did not comply,
then the result of the inquiry into liability will at the same time quantify the loss caused
by the breach.

After some introductory comments on the concurrence of liability and damage findings
(infra at VI.B.4.a) and on the procedure and expert evidence involved in the resolution
of the Alternative Claim (infra at V|.B.4.b), the Tribunal will review the quantification
parameters on which the Parties and their experts disagree (infra at VI.B.4.c). On this
basis, the Tribunal will then draw the consequences of its analysis in terms of liability
and quantum (infra at V1.B.4.c.xii).

Before delving into the analysis, the Tribunal recalls that, by definition, the calculation
of damages inevitably involves assumptions about events that did not occur and “in a

The Tribunal notes that the tribunal in RREEF has reached a similar conclusion. See

S.a rl. v. Kingdom of Spain, \CSID Case No. ARB/13/30, Decision on Responsibility
and on the Principles of Quantum, 30 November 2018, para. 523: “[...] the Tribunal
considers that, while entitled to compensation for unreasonable return on their
investments — if established -, the Claimants cannot claim full compensation for the
total decrease in their profits as a result of the adoption of the new regime by the
Respondent; they can only get compensation to the extent that such decrease is below
the threshold of a reasonable return.”

case of such scope and complexity damages cannot be determined with mechanical
precision”.*"' The Tribunal has done its best to arrive at an accurate assessment of the
damages aspects of this case, despite the significant divergences between the Parties
and their experts on a number of key issues and the multiple number of Claimants
involved in this arbitration.

Concurrence of Liability and Quantum

To recall,°'? the Claimants put forward their Alternative Claim in their Reply®'? as a
response to the Respondent’s argument that Spain “‘did not promise any regulated
Tariff under RD 661/2007 [and] [...] the Spanish system only allowed investors to aspire
to reasonable profitability as provided for in the [1997 Electricity Law]’”.6"4

More specifically, while still maintaining their Primary Claim, the Claimants argued that
‘[iIN the event that the Tribunal were to agree that the Claimants’ legitimate
expectations were limited by Spain’s concept of a ‘reasonable return’ [...] Spain still
faces international liability under the ECT”,85 because it “significantly lower[ed] the
‘reasonable return’”.8'6 In their Reply, the Claimants contended that, even on the
Alternative Claim, they suffered significant damages,®"” which they proposed to quantify
in the subsequent phase of the arbitration.®"8

In response to the Alternative Claim, Spain maintained that the Claimants continue to
be highly profitable and achieve the reasonable return that they could have expected
at the time of their investment.8"9 It bears noting that Spain did not object when the

Claimants raised the Alternative Claim in the Reply in line with Article 22 of the
UNCITRAL Rules (which allows a party to amend or supplement its claims during the
course of the proceedings subject to certain conditions), unlike it did when it opposed
the Claimants’ intention to amend their SoC (see Procedural Order No. 18). Rather, it
chose to argue the Alternative Claim on its merits.8?°

The guarantee provided by Spain in the 1997 Electricity Law (the “reasonable return”
or “reasonable profitability”) is economic in nature. This being so, the Tribunal cannot
verify whether or not such guarantee was observed without considering the economic
impact of the Disputed Measures on the Claimants’ investment. Only once it has
ascertained such impact will the Tribunal be able to determine whether or not there is
a breach of the Treaty.

Otherwise said, in this particular case the quantification of the harm, if any, informs the
finding on liability. Unlike other cases in which liability (e.g., the allegedly wrongful
withdrawal of a permit) is clearly separated from quantum, here the two elements of the
analysis are intimately intertwined. In other words, the assessment of the harm suffered
by the Claimants is necessarily linked to the reasonableness, non-arbitrariness,
proportionality, etc., of the Respondent's conduct. It is only if the alteration of the
regulatory framework called into question the guarantee of a reasonable return that the
Claimants would be entitled to compensation pursuant to the general rules of State
responsibility.622

See, e.g., Rejoinder, paras. 963 et seq.

As also explained by the Tribunal at the end of the PO12 Hearing, “[ylou understand,
of course, that we are trying to assess legitimate expectations and whether legitimate
expectations have been breached. And the legitimate expectations were given in
economic terms. And so we think that to understand, first, what they were, and, second,
whether they were breached, we need some economic input. That was the thinking
behind PO12, of course. And that is why we are doing this exercise”. PO12 Hearing Tr.

The Tribunal finds confirmation of its approach in the decision issued in RREEF
Infrastructure (G.P.) Limited and RREEF Pan-European Infrastructure Two Lux S.a rl.
v. Kingdom of Spain, |CSID Case No. ARB/13/30, Decision on Responsibility and on
the Principles of Quantum, 30 November 2018, para. 472 (“Such an empirical
assessment cannot be made in the abstract. In other words, the Tribunal will be in the
position to determine whether the measures taken by the Respondent have adversely
affected the Claimants’ legitimate expectation for a reasonable return only when it has
evaluated the loss sustained by them, taking into account all the relevant elements. In
other words, the determination of a violation of the principles of proportionality and
reasonableness is inseparable from an assessment of the damages — if any — endured
by the Claimants as a consequence of the measures taken by the Respondent”).

Procedure and Expert Evidence

In the Tribunal’s view, to verify whether the Alternative Claim is well-founded requires
it to assess the difference (if any) between the returns the Claimants are making under
the New Regime (the scenario with Measures) and those they would be making if Spain
had ensured that plants receive the reasonable rates of return on offer at the time when

the Claimants made their investments (scenario without Measures).

Thus, in PO12 the Tribunal requested the Parties to quantify “[t]he harm allegedly
suffered by the Claimants” by reference “to the difference, if any, between (i) the
reasonable return under Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law over the regulatory
lifetime of a plant [...] and (ii) the return the Claimants would make under the Disputed
Measures for the same period”.®?° To that end, the Tribunal asked the Parties to
assume that “the investors had legitimate expectations to achieve reasonable
profitability within the terms of Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law (as it stood at the
time of the Claimants’ investments)”,®*4 which is consistent with the conclusion the
Tribunal has reached above on the content of the Claimants’ legitimate expectations.
The Parties were invited to assume that the reasonable profitability would “be equal to,

first, 7% on average post tax and, second, 8% on average post tax”.6

In calculating the returns in the scenarios with and without Measures, the Tribunal
further asked the Parties to assume a regulatory lifetime of a PV plant equal to 30
years.®6 While the various documents referred to by the Parties show regulatory
lifetime periods of PV plants that range between 25 and 40 years,®2” the Tribunal

considers that on balance of the documentary record as a whole, a 30-year lifetime of

the plant appears the most reasonable. It notes that the New Regime provides for a 30-

In addition to the parameters just mentioned, PO12 also set out a number of alternative
variables, on which the Parties made written and oral submissions and presented
different damages calculations.°°

Following these submissions on the quantum of the Alternative Claim, the Tribunal
requested the experts to provide it with a joint model, the EJM, allowing it to calculate
the Claimants’ IRR and possible resulting losses. At the hearing held on 16 to 19
January 2018, the experts had indeed agreed to assist the Tribunal in this task.®°

set out directions to be considered in the preparation of the EJM. These directions were
incorporated in PO18, which was the result of a consultative process.®*1 Such
consultation in particular enabled the Tribunal to reduce the number of assumptions for
consideration, thereby diminishing the complexity of the EJM exercise. This effort came

comments; on 14 and 22 May 2018, each Party provided two rounds of comments to
the draft; on 4 July 2018, upon the Claimants’ proposal, the Parties and the Tribunal
held a conference call for the Tribunal to hear the Parties on the draft of the order and
ask them questions on their comments and proposed modifications; and on 18 July
2018, PO18 was issued in final form.

See letter from the Claimants, 14 May 2018, pp. 1 and 4 (“the Claimants have serious
concerns regarding the extensive scope of the draft of PO18 and its potential to lead to
a further lengthy phase of the arbitration. In light of these concerns, and with a view to
determining the best way forward, the Claimants propose that the Tribunal schedule a
telephonic case management conference as soon as possible and, ideally, by no later
than Monday 21 May 2018. In the interim, the Claimants set out below their comments
on the draft PO18. The Claimants propose several modifications to the current draft of
PO18 at Annex 1 which are designed to narrow the issues to be addressed by the
experts in the EJM so that the Tribunal can be presented with a workable EJM [...] The
Claimants believe it is therefore desirable to seek to reduce the number of permutations
to be contained in the EJM so that it is both helpful to the Tribunal and can be produced

PO18 contained the following general directions:

7.

In PO18, the Tribunal also emphasized that “[e]ven though Brattle and EconOne have

been retained by the Parties, the Tribunal expects them to act as independent experts

Further to the Tribunal’s directions in Procedural Order No. 12, the
examination of the experts at the Hearing, including their answers
to questions from the Tribunal, and Procedural Order No. 17, the
Tribunal invites the Brattle experts (presented by the Claimants) and
the EconOne experts (presented by the Respondent) to confer and
present an EJM on the quantum of the Claimants’ so-called
“Alternative Claim”. In accordance with PO12, such quantum shall
be equivalent to the difference between (i) the reasonable return
under Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law over the regulatory
lifetime of a plant (as specified in PO12) and (ii) the return the
Claimants would make under the Disputed Measures for the same
period. Further, the EJM shall be based on the parameters,
including alternatives and sub-alternatives, set out in paragraph 12
below.

In the preparation of the EJM, the experts shall not rely on
documents or data that are not already in the record, subject to leave
from the Tribunal if the introduction of new documents or data arises
from the need to comply with their mandate under PO18.

If the experts cannot agree on the input to be entered into the EJM
with respect to a parameter, alternative or sub-alternative (see
paragraph 12 below), each expert shall provide his separate input
identified as such in the EJM.

|. Together with the EJM, the experts may submit a joint memorandum

with explanatory comments if they deem it useful. If the experts
diverge on some issues regarding the implementation of the
parameters specified in paragraph 12 below, they may make
separate comments identified as such in the memorandum.

. The goal of the EJM is to allow the Tribunal to compute the harm

allegedly suffered by the Claimants according to their “Alternative
Claim”. To do so, the EJM will allow the Tribunal to choose among
the alternatives and sub-alternatives set out below. The Tribunal
trusts that the experts will do their utmost to facilitate its task and
produce a workable model for the purpose just identified.

to assist the Tribunal”.

On 5 October 2018, in accordance with PO18, the experts produced the EJM with a
joint memorandum explaining the areas on which they agreed or disagreed (defined

without significant undue cost and delay. The Claimants propose the following changes

to PO18 in order to reduce the number of permutations: [...]”).

supra at para. 153 as the “Joint Memorandum’).8%4 They produced a revised version on
23 November 2018, correcting an implementation error. The Parties commented on the
EJM and the Joint Memorandum in post-hearing briefs of 29 November 2018 and 12
February 2019, respectively.®°> The Tribunal notes that, while the EJM exercise turned
out to be longer than anticipated, in particular because of the complexity of the damage
calculation, it eventually accomplished its objective and neither Party requested that

the Tribunal appoint its own damages expert. °°

The EJM contains a control panel comprising the following six parameters, with
variables representing the inputs on which the experts diverged. A variable must be
selected for each of the parameters in order to compute the loss and the corresponding
IRR:

1. Interest Tax Shield

2. Cost Base

3. Past Profits

4. Revision of the Reasonable Rate of Return (“RRR”)
5. Initial Investment for IRR Calculation

6. Interest

As mentioned above (see supra at para. 641), the result of the Tribunal’s inquiry into
liability will allow it to quantify the loss in case of breach. In other words, if the Tribunal
determines that some or all of the Claimants have suffered harm under their Alternative
Claim, the Tribunal will be in a position to issue an award on both liability and damages
based on the Alternative Claim. As the Tribunal made clear on various occasions, PO12
initiated a hybrid liability and quantum phase.

For instance, at the end of the PO12 Hearing, the Tribunal explained that:

[The scope of the first post-hearing brief] is about liability. And, to be very
clear, it could also be about quantum. If it is not quantum of the primary
claim, it is quantum of the alternative claim. But before we, in our thinking,
can get to the alternative claim, we need to make the liability decision. So

See Joint Memorandum presented by Mr. Carlos Lapuerta, Mr. Richard Caldwell, and
Mr. Jack Stirzaker of the Brattle Group and Dr. Daniel Flores and Mr. Jordan Heim of
Econ One, 5 October 2018 (“Joint Memorandum’).

See PO12 C-PHB2, paras. 35-206; PO12 R-PHB2, paras. 135-232.

In this context, it is noted that the Claimants have criticized Econ One’s credibility
(PO12 C-PHB1, paras. 21-22). While the Tribunal has taken note of this criticism, it
discerns no element in the record that would lead it to disregard that expert's evidence.

what we have heard this week does go to both the liability and the quantum
of a possible alternative claim.”

[PO12] was issued on 29 September 2016. And, from then on, we did

process with submissions, evidence, following procedural order no. 12,

which meant to open a quantum phase, too [sic] joint _with the liability

because we thought that here it might be difficult to make a decision on

liability without understanding part of the quantum at least.®°*
In response to the Parties’ requests for clarifications to PO12, the Tribunal also
explained that “the directions given in PO12 expand the current phase as circumscribed
in the Order. If, thereafter, the Tribunal were to require further briefing and evidence to
resolve the dispute, it will give further appropriate directions”.6°° Thus, the Tribunal
made clear that the PO12 phase expanded the liability phase to include what was set
out in PO12 and that it wished to hear “the Parties on certain aspects of the quantum.
Specifically, the Tribunal would be assisted by each Claimant quantifying its so-called

alternative claim...”64°

As recounted above, following PO12, the Tribunal received further submissions
accompanied by vast amount of documentary and expert evidence. The Tribunal is
thus now in a position to resolve the dispute in its entirety and issue an award on both
liability and quantum. As it stated during the 4 July 2018 telephone hearing, “the award
that we will have to issue will have to deal not only with the quantification, but also
liability”.64"

Indeed, the conduct of both Parties’ confirms their understanding that the phase started
with PO12 addressed not only liability, but also quantum. This is confirmed by the very
title of the Parties’ main submissions®? as well as their submissions during the

document production phase.*? It was also acknowledged by the experts during the
PO12 Hearing.*4 Finally, the inclusion of quantum in the phase opened by PO12 was
confirmed by the Tribunal when closing the proceedings, at which time it noted that it
“ha[d] all the necessary elements in terms of liability and, if applicable, quantum to
render a Final Award”.®45 In response, the Respondent “acknowledge[d] the Tribunal’s
letter of Monday declaring the proceedings closed as of 2 December 2019.84 This
being so, the Respondent's suggestion in its last PHB that “the purpose of the PO12
and PO18 is to assist the Tribunal in determining liability, not damages”®*’ is thus ill-
conceived.

Hence, matters of both liability and quantum with respect to the Alternative Claim have
been fully pleaded and both Parties have been heard and have had ample opportunity
to present their respective cases. There is thus no doubt that the Tribunal is now ina
position to issue an award on both liability and damages.

Finally, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants have formulated the relief sought not by
reference to the Primary/Alternative Claim, but more generally for compensation as a
result of Spain’s alleged breaches (see supra para. 220). In this connection, the
Tribunal also notes that the main difference between the Claimants’ initial request for
relief in the Reply (see supra para. 219) and the final one after the quantum phase
(PO12 C-PHB2, quoted supra at 220) is that the Claimants no longer request that Spain
provide full restitution by reinstating the legal framework. Hence, the Tribunal

objected to MG&A being called for cross examination is because MG8&A has already
been subject to cross examination on their regulatory expert reports produced in the
liability phase of these proceedings and that MG&A have not produced any new report
(or indeed any report) in relation to this quantum phase, for which a different expert —
EO- was appointed” (emphasis added).

See, e.g., PO15, Annex A, Spain’s objections to request 4: "the documents requested
have, once again, no relevance to this quantum phase of the arbitration, but could only
have been hypothetically relevant to the liability phase" (emphasis added); PO 15,
Annex A, Requests Nos 2; 3; 5; 6; and 7: "Therefore, it is self-evident that this request
is related to arguments made during the liability phase, for which the document
production phase is long expired. To grant this request would unfairly re-open analysis
of the liability phase, which would place Respondent at a disadvantage without a right
of response. Accordingly, such requests should be summarily rejected.”

understands that the request for restitution has been abandoned. In the event that this
understanding were incorrect, the Tribunal would in any event not grant such relief in
light of its conclusion that the Primary Claim, which is predicated upon the Claimants’
expectation to receive the fixed FIT under RD 661/2007 over the regulatory lifetime of
the plants, is ill-founded.

Quantification of Loss and IRR

As recalled above, having deliberated on the Parties’ case as it had developed through
their written submissions on liability, their oral submissions at the hearing on liability,
and their PHBs, the Tribunal issued PO12, setting out its “directions to the Parties” .4®

It is helpful to reproduce the relevant portions of PO12:

1. Without prejudice to its forthcoming determinations on the claims
before it, including without prejudice to its decision on liability, the
Tribunal is of the view that it would be materially assisted by hearing
the Parties on certain aspects of the quantum. Specifically, the
Tribunal would be assisted by each Claimant quantifying its so-
called alternative claim (Claimants’ Reply, para. 583 ff.) as further
specified in the following paragraphs.

2. For such purpose, the Parties shall assume that, at the time when
the investments were made, the investors had _ legitimate
expectations to achieve reasonable profitability within the terms of
Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law (as it stood at the time of the
Claimants’ investments).

3. Within this specification, the Claimants may present their quantum
cases as they deem appropriate and the Respondent may answer
such cases as it deems appropriate. That said, the Tribunal would
be particularly interested in submissions based on the following
assumptions:

(a) The harm allegedly suffered by the Claimants is assumed
to be equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the
reasonable return under Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity
Law over the regulatory lifetime of a plant (as specified
below) and (ii) the return the Claimants would make under
the Disputed Measures for the same period. With respect to
(ii), the Parties shall work with two distinct assumptions:
first, they shall assume that the New Regime undergoes a
reasonable revision of the rates every six years. Second,
they shall assume that there are no such revisions.

=

Reasonable profitability within the meaning of the 1997
Electricity Law at the time of the investments is assumed to
be equal to, first, 7% on average post tax and, second, 8%
on average post tax;

(c) In respect of reasonable profitability, the Parties shall work
with two distinct assumptions (to the extent these

See supra section II.D.

208

assumptions make any difference to their computations):
first, they shall assume a greenfield investment and,
second, they shall assume a brownfield investment.

(d) The regulatory lifetime of a PV plant is assumed to be 30
years;

sz

Remuneration exceeding the 7% or 8% profitability
addressed in (b) above which a plant has achieved prior to
the enactment of the Disputed Measures is assumed to
either (i) be taken into account or (ii) not to be taken into
account for the purposes of calculating the aggregate
average reasonable return over the 30-year regulatory
lifetime of a plant;

G

The valuation date is assumed to be either (i) the date of the
valuation as proxy for the date of the award or (ii) the date
of the Disputed Measures.

[el
667. In its subsequent PO18, the Tribunal then asked the experts for assistance in

computing a possible loss under the Alternative Claim. For that purpose, it invited them
to prepare the EJM and set out certain parameters and variables, as follows:

12. The EJM shall be based on the following parameters:

a. The harm allegedly suffered by the Claimants shall be
calculated per Claimant,

b. The harm shall be calculated by using the methodology used by
Brattle in its DCF computation. Thus, the DCF methodology
shall be based on the calculation of an Alternative Tariff
designed to provide a 7% post-tax return (as described below).
The harm shall be calculated by discounting the cash flows to
arrive at the net present value of the Claimants’ assets in the
scenarios without Measures and with Measures.

c. The experts shall use a holding IRR as opposed to an exit IRR
in both scenarios (with Measures and without Measures);

d. As valuation date, the EJM shall use the date of the alleged
breach as it was set by agreement of the Parties, i.e. 30 June
2014;

e. For the Claimants’ return in the scenario without Measures, the
EJM shall use a rate of return of 7% post-tax. Post-tax shall
mean the return considering the impact of all taxes in force at
the valuation date.

f. As cost base, the EJM shall use

i. Alternative 1: The “marginal plant” approach, with the
following

a) Sub-alternative 1: “Size re-classified marginal plant

sensitivity” (following the approach described in the
Brattle Quantum Rebuttal Report, paras. 227 et seq.);

209

668.

669.

b) Sub-alternative 2: “IT code sensitivity” (following the
approach described in the Brattle Quantum Rebuttal
Report, paras. 227 et seq.);

ii. Alternative 2: The “greenfield costs” approach, with the
following

a) Sub-alternative 1: Including “developer premiums’;
b) Sub-alternative 2: Excluding “developer premiums”;

g. The EJM shall compute the harm in the scenario without
Measures assuming that the regulator

i. Alternative 1: Took account of the tax shield;
ii. Alternative 2: Did not take account of the tax shield;
h. The EJM shall compute the harm

i. Alternative 1: Assuming that revisions of returns occur
under the New Regime every six years in the scenario
with Measures;

ii. Alternative 2: Assuming that revisions of returns do not
occur under the New Regime every six years in the

scenario with Measures;

i. The EJM shall compute the Alternative Tariff applied in the
scenario without Measures

i. Alternative 1: Taking into account past profits;

ii. Alternative 2: Not taking into account past profits.
In the following paragraphs, the Tribunal thus discusses the elements of the
computation of the losses, if any, and the resulting IRRs as they are set out in PO12
and PO18, in the expert evidence, including especially the EJM and the Joint

Memorandum, and in the Parties’ submissions.

Before doing so, as a preliminary point, the Tribunal notes that there is no substantial
disagreement between the Parties as to the general principles governing reparation for
unlawful acts in international law. In particular, the Respondent does not dispute the
principle that, if liability were established, it has an obligation to make full reparation for

the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.&9

See, e.g., PO12 R-PHB1, paras. 191-194.

671.

i. Methodology to Calculate the Harm
(a) The Parties’ Position
(i) | The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants submit that their expert, Brattle, quantified the change in the value of
their investment using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) analysis and that the Tribunal’s
directions in PO12 guided this quantification exercise. They note that PO12 directed
them to compute their damages by comparing two scenarios: (a) what they refer to as
the “Actual scenario”, which measures the cash flows (and consequently, the IRR) now
expected by the Claimants after the Disputed Measures, and (b) what they term the
“But For” scenario, which measures the cash flows (and consequently, the IRR) that
the PV investors could have reasonably anticipated in the absence of the Disputed
Measures.®®° For the Claimants, if the IRR in the But For scenario is higher than the
IRR in the Actual scenario, it means that Spain violated their legitimate expectations by
failing to provide the target rate of return under the New Regime. Further, the same

quantification would also serve as a basis for calculating their damages.®*'

The Claimants submit that, as a first step, Brattle measured the Claimants’ cash flows
in the But For scenario by implementing the assumptions set out in PO12. In that
regard, Brattle notes that PO12 requires them to assume that the target reasonable
rate of return Spain considered while designing the Original Regime is 7% or 8% after
tax. In other words, rather than the RD 661/2007 FIT, the Claimants would be entitled
to some other remuneration (to be calculated) that would enable them to obtain the
above target return. For the Claimants and Brattle, it is axiomatic that such
remuneration “must be calculated on a like-for-like basis with the reasonable rate of
return offered by Spain at the time of Claimants’ investments”. This is because, first,
a like-for-like comparison reflects the legitimate expectations that the Claimants would
have had at the time of making their investments. Second, it is also appropriate from
an economic perspective, as it allows the two measures of returns (Actual and But For)
to be placed on a comparable footing.®?

PO12, para. 3(a). PO12 assumed that the quantum of damages / harm suffered by the
Claimants equals “the difference [...] between (i) the reasonable return under Article
30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law over the regulatory lifetime of a plant [...] and (ii) the
return the Claimants would make under the Disputed Measures for the same period”.

674.

With this in mind, Brattle notes that under the Original Regime, Spain designed an
incentive scheme based on a FIT per MWh for all qualifying installations, for all
production over the entire operational lifetime of the installations. Consequently, Brattle
is of the view that a “tariff per MWh” of production is consistent with the Claimants’
expectation at the time they made their investment. Therefore, in order to determine
the cash flows in the But For scenario, Brattle constructed an “Alternative Tariff’ per
MWh of production that would permit an efficient PV plant to recover costs and earn an
after tax return of 7% or 8%, on a like-for-like basis as the RD 661/2007 FITs. It then
applied the Alternative Tariff to the production forecast for each of the Claimants’ plants
to determine the cash flows in the But For scenario.®

As with the But For scenario, Brattle forecast the cash flows in the Actual scenario (for
the period after the Disputed Measures) by implementing the PO12 assumption

regarding periodic updates to the remuneration under the New Regime.®°5

Having determined the cash flows in the But For and Actual scenarios, Brattle
proceeded to measure the Claimants’ damages by applying a DCF analysis. For this
purpose, PO12 required the Claimants to measure the damages on an ex ante basis
as well as an ex post basis. The Claimants adopt June 2014 for the ex ante valuation
date as this was the date on which Spain finally defined the parameters under the New
Regime.®*° For the ex post calculation, the Claimants explain that Brattle adopts
December 2016 as a proxy for the date of the award, and subsequently updates the
valuation date to reflect the passage of time and availability of additional ex post

information.®”

Brattle explains that under either approach, it has measured the damages using three
steps, which it illustrates and explains as follows:

1 duly 2013: Effective date of 0413/2014

The first step of Brattle’s valuation methodology looks back prior to the valuation date
and considers the difference between the cash flows under the But For and Actual
scenarios since the inception of the Disputed Measures in November 2010, and their
cumulative effective till the valuation date. Regardless of which valuation date is
ultimately used, Brattle explains that the difference between the But For and Actual
scenarios is calculated on the basis of each Claimants’ actual historical operating and
financial data.®®°

The second step looks forward from the valuation date and estimates the net present
value (“NPV”) of the Claimants’ investment under both the But For and Actual scenario
by performing a DCF analysis. In other words, Brattle derives the NPV of the Claimants’
investments by discounting their future cash flows (in both scenarios) to the valuation
date to account for market risk and the time value of money.®9

In the third and final step, Brattle “considers that the PV Investors will not receive
payment for damages until sometime in the future. The analysis accounts for the delay
in compensation by adding pre-award interest to our June 2014 and December 2016

damage estimates, using published data concerning the yields on Spanish Government
bonds”.860

(ii) | The Respondent's Position

The Respondent observes that pursuant to PO12, the Parties were invited to present
a quantification of the damages allegedly suffered by the Claimants as a result of the
Disputed Measures, on the assumption that the harm was equal to the difference
between the rate of return under Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law and the return
the Claimants would make under the Disputed Measures. In other words, according to
Spain, PO12 required the Parties to compare the “actual” rate of return obtained by the

Claimants’ plants against a rate of return of 7% or 8% after tax.®°!

For Spain, the proper methodology to calculate damages was established by the
Tribunal in PO12 which directed the Parties to calculate “returns”. According to the
Respondent, the Claimants’ DCF calculation “does not calculate returns and thus fails
to apply the methodology ordered by the Tribunal”.8®? For Spain, the correct approach
is to perform an analysis of the IRRs of the Claimants’ PV plants, which is “the most
common and widely accept method to measure the economic profitability of
projects”.®°> Furthermore, “[t]he calculation of returns established by the Tribunal is the
correct methodology for assessing damages in this particular case as it is undisputed
that the only reasonable expectation that the Spanish regulatory regime could have
generated in investors is that their plants would obtain reasonable returns, and not any
particular amount of cash flows” .864

Therefore, Spain explains, Econ One calculated the “actual” IRR for each of the
Claimants’ PV plants using Brattle’s DCF model for the Actual scenario, by taking into
account “(i) the costs associated with the development, operation and maintenance of
the PV Plants; (ii) the cash flows generated by the PV Plants up until the relevant
Valuation Date; and (iii) the value of the PV Plants as of that Valuation Date (based on
the cash flows that the PV Plants can be expected to generate going forward, taking

into account the Disputed Measures)”.®® It then carried out “an ‘apples to apples’

comparison, contrasting the expectation of a 7/8% RRoR [reasonable rate of return] at
project level as was defined in the regulation and assumed in PO12, with an actual
scenario with the Measures that reflects the reality of each of Claimants’ Plants and

focuses on the returns at project level by considering only greenfield costs”.

Spain notes that for the But For scenario, PO12 directed the Parties to assume that “‘at
the time when the investments were made the investors had a legitimate expectation
to achieve reasonable profitability in accordance with the terms of Article 30.4 of the
1997 Electricity Law” and further stipulated the target reasonable return as 7% or 8%
after tax.8°” As a result, Spain explains that Econ One did not make any calculations
for the But For scenario, “but limited itself to consider that such scenario would permit
Claimants to obtain a 7/8% post-tax return”. For the Respondent, this approach to the
But For scenario follows from the abovementioned directions in PO12 itself.8°

By contrast, Spain submits that the Claimants’ calculation of their But For scenario

“does not make any sense”.8°?

Spain contends that the But For scenario is supposed to reflect the Claimants’
legitimate expectation of reasonable profitability in accordance with Article 30.4 of the
1997 Electricity Law. In that regard Spain emphasizes that Article 30.4 only specifies
the parameters that will be considered while fixing the premiums for the RE sector, i.e.
the investment costs and that “the ultimate target of the remuneration [...] is to cover
the investment cost, operating costs and obtain a reasonable rate of return according
to the cost of money on capital markets”. It “has never fixed a specific remunerative
formula” for calculating such premiums.®”° In other words, while Article 30.4 confirms
that producers can legitimately expect a reasonable return, it does not explain how
such return will be calculated, much less the form it may take.

However, disregarding this facet of the provision, Spain observes that the Claimants

7/8% post-tax return to a “made up ‘Marginal Plant’, on the premise that this
methodology allegedly reflects how Spain calculated the RD 661/2007 FIT.®’1 Spain
submits that the Claimants’ methodology is incorrect because it implies that they
expected to receive a tariff on a EUR per MW of electricity-produced basis when, as
explained immediately above, Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law never guaranteed
the formulas for fixing remuneration.®”* Hence, Spain contends that the specific
remunerative formula under RD 661/2007 (i.e. a EUR per MWh tariff) had nothing to
do with the principle of reasonable profitability under the 1997 Electricity Law and could
not have constituted a legitimate expectation under Article 30.4.8”? In other words, the
Claimants could not have legitimately expected to receive an “Alternative Tariff”.

Spain further submits that the Claimants’ criticism of Econ One’s valuation methodology
is without merit. In particular, it refers to the Claimants’ criticism that Econ One’s
calculation does not perform a like-for-like comparison by comparing the Claimants’
actual IRRs against the hypothetical Alternative Tariff. Spain replies that it is the
Claimants’ valuation methodology that is flawed, for the following reasons:

e First, as discussed immediately above, there is no evidentiary basis to apply
an Alternative Tariff at all.8’4

e Second, Spain submits that the present situation is not a case where the
regulator is setting the tariff, where it would have to consider the “standard” or
“typical” costs of a plant as it would be impossible to look at the actual costs
of each plant. Rather, in the present situation, the Tribunal’s task is to resolve
the dispute between the Parties. For Spain, “[t]he only way to do this is to
calculate the [actual] returns of such Plants [...] by considering the enterprise
value of the Claimants’ Plants and greenfield costs” and not the “fictitious” or
“imaginary” Alternative Tariff created by Brattle.8’5

to assume standardised scenarios in order to calculate the remuneration for PV plants,
investors on the other hand consider the real returns that their PV Plants would obtain
based on such remuneration. Obviously, the legitimate expectation of the Claimants’
PV Plants was to receive a return in the vicinity of the target RRoR established by the

690.

e Third, contrary to the Claimants’ allegation, Econ One’s calculation of the But
For scenario does not convert the target rate of return into a cap on the amount
of damages. According to Spain, the 7% or 8% return is “taken as a benchmark
to compare it with the actual returns that Claimants’ Plants are obtaining with
the Measures”. Spain explains that if a plant earns more than the target rate
of return in the scenario with the Measures, even if such rate of return is less
than the IRR that was earned under the Original Regime, such a plant would
not be entitled to receive any damages as this would result in over

remuneration.8”6

Accordingly, Spain asks the Tribunal to disregard the But For scenario proposed by
Brattle.

(b) Discussion

The Tribunal notes that with regard to the methodology to quantify the harm there
appear to be two main points in dispute between the Parties, namely whether Brattle’s
use of (i) the so-called “Alternative Tariff’ and of (ii) the DCF method is appropriate.

Having reviewed the Parties’ positions, the Tribunal has come to the conclusion that
Brattle’s approach based on the Alternative Tariff provides an appropriate methodology
to calculate the “reasonable rate of return” equal to 7% or 8% post-tax. This is because
the Alternative Tariff represents the revenue stream that provides an efficient plant with
the assumed rate of return (7% or 8 % post-tax) in the scenario without Measures.

In the Tribunal’s view, Spain’s criticism that there is no evidence that the Claimants
expected to receive the Alternative Tariff and that the Alternative Tariff is “fictitious” is
misconceived. Of course, as such, the Alternative Tariff never existed, as the only
relevant tariff that existed at the time of the Claimants’ investment was the RD 661/2007
FIT. However, either Spain must accept that the Claimants could legitimately expect to
receive the fixed FIT under RD 661/2007 over the regulatory lifetime of the plants (in
which case the Primary Claim would be well-founded, which the Tribunal has concluded
is not the case) or Spain must acknowledge that the Claimants were entitled to receive
the reasonable return on offer at the time of the Claimants’ investments. To calculate
the latter, the Tribunal accepts that the Alternative Tariff appropriately represents the

regulator on their initial investment (i.e. based upon their real greenfield costs)”
(Quantum Rejoinder, paras. 70-72. See also ibid., paras. 135-146).

revenue stream that provides the reasonable return that Spain claims the Claimants’
installations were entitled to receive.

Second, the Tribunal also accepts Brattle’s use of the DCF as an appropriate valuation
methodology in this case. The DCF method is an accepted valuation method in both
financial theory and in the practice, including by arbitral tribunals. While the use of the
DCF may not be suited to all cases, especially where the business to be valued is not
a “going concern” and lacks a clear record of profitability, there is no reason to discard
a DCF in this case for two main reasons. First, the Claimants’ installations have been
operational since 2008 or earlier, which provides a reliable and sufficient record of past
financial performance.®”” Second, there is no major uncertainty regarding the plants’
future cash flows as, on Spain’s case, the Disputed Measures continue to provide
investors with a reasonable rate of return for the entire regulatory life of the plant.

The Tribunal notes that other tribunals have likewise resorted to the DCF method for
the purposes of the damages calculations in other Spanish renewable energy cases.
See, e.g., Eiser Infrastructure Limited and Energia Solar Luxembourg S.a rl. v.
Kingdom of Spain, |CSID Case No. ARB/13/36, Final Award, 4 May 2017, Exh. CLA-
215, para. 465 (“DCF has frequently been applied as an appropriate and effective
method for arriving at a valuation of a business operating as a going concern prior to
adverse government actions. ‘DCF techniques have been universally adopted,
including by numerous arbitral tribunals, as an appropriate method for valuing business
assets [...]’ While in this case the Tribunal does not reach the expropriation claim, the
calculation of damages involves a comparable assessment of potential future revenues

footnotes omitted)); Masdar Solar & Wind Cooperatief U.A. v. Kingdom of Spain, |CSID

renewables) have a relatively simple business, producing electricity, whose demand

data”); Greentech Energy Systems A/S and others v. Kingdom of Spain, SCC Case No.

of time).”).

Therefore, in terms of general valuation methodology, the Tribunal considers Brattle’s
DCF methodology reasonable under the circumstances, as it seeks to quantify the
Claimants’ cash flows in the scenario without Measures and in the scenario with
Measures and then discounts these cash flows to determine the present value of the
Claimants’ plants.

Furthermore, the Tribunal notes that Spain’s expert, Econ One, relied on Brattle’s DCF
model when carrying out its calculations in the scenario with Measures without
performing its own analysis. Econ One in particular used Brattle's DCF model to
discount the future cash flows to derive the enterprise value of the installations:

DR. FLORES: And what is the value of these futures [sic] returns that are

yet to come? As a proxy for that we have taken the enterprise value,
calculated by Brattle.

Ll

THE PRESIDENT: Can | just ask a question about the enterprise value. You
say you took it as calculated by Brattle; is that right?

DR FLORES: Correct, yes.

THE PRESIDENT: And that is essentially future cash flow -- net cash flows,
discounted back to present value.

DR FLORES: Correct. That's correct, yes.°7

By contrast, in the scenario without Measures, Econ One’s analysis “doesn’t discount

future cash flows”.879

With regard to the inputs into Brattle’s DCF model, the Tribunal observes that they were
undisputed until the PO12 Hearing. In particular, in its two quantum reports, Econ One
did not take issue with the discount rates, production forecasts, pool prices and interest
rates used in Brattle’s model. As noted above, on the contrary, Econ One relied on
those same inputs in its valuation for the scenario with Measures.®®°

On the last day of the PO12 Hearing, however, Econ One suggested for the first time
that it disagreed with one of the inputs into Brattle’s DCF model, namely the discount

rate (and more specifically, the regulatory risk premium) in the scenario without
Measures.®*! The Tribunal considers that, as the discount rate and the regulatory risk
which it includes are important factors in a DCF analysis, Econ One should have raised
any concern in its reports in response to Brattle’s damage calculation.

For these reasons, the Tribunal accepts Brattle’s use of the DCF as an appropriate
valuation methodology. Accordingly, in PO18, the Tribunal instructed the experts to
calculate the harm allegedly suffered as follows:

“[Bly using the methodology used by Brattle in its DCF computation. Thus,
the DCF methodology shall be based on the calculation of an Alternative
Tariff designed to provide a 7% post-tax return (as described below). The
harm shall be calculated by discounting the cash flows to arrive at the net
present value of the Claimants’ assets in the scenarios without Measures
and with Measures”.82
The assumed rate to be used in the scenario without Measures (7% or 8%) is discussed

next.

ii. The Rate of Return in the Scenario Without Measures
(a) The Parties’ Position

The Claimants submit that, for the scenario without Measures, an 8% target rate of
return is appropriate. They submit that both the CNE and the Ministry of Industry
contemplated a return of 8%.8°3 Moreover, Spain’s expert, MG&A, confirmed during the
Hearing on Liability that “the CNE had in fact approved the proposed RD 661/2007 on
the basis that PV installations would receive between 7.6% and 8% after tax” returns.
The Claimants further submit that Spain’s efforts to discredit the CNE report are without

merit.2

Spain, for its part, submits that, in the scenario without Measures, the Tribunal should
adopt a target rate of 7%. It submits that the target rate of return at the time of the
Claimants’ investment was 7% after tax, which position is supported by the evidence
of both of Spain’s experts.®*> By contrast, there is no evidence to support the Claimants’
position that the target rate of return was 8%. Spain contends that the Claimants’ and

Brattle’s reliance on CNE Report 3/2007°* to advocate for an 8% post-tax return is
misplaced, as this report refers to an 8% return for facilities that have been operating
since 2004 and with a capacity of 5kW. These parameters do not apply to the
Claimants’ PV plants, most of which were built in 2008 and have an installed capacity
of 100kW.®7

(b) Discussion

The contemporaneous documents in the record contain references to rates of return in
the area of 7%, 8%, or in between the two.

First, according to the Economic Memorandum (Memoria Economica) of the Draft
Royal Decree which was to become RD 661/2007, prepared by the Ministry of Industry,
Tourism and Energy, PV plants up to 10 MW would receive a remuneration of
“approximately 7%”, and plants above 10 MW would have a return lower than 7%:

3.2.1 Photovoltaic Solar Sector

A new definition of power is drafted in Section 3, with respect to the
applicable economic regime, in order to avoid inefficient configurations as a
result of a multiplicity of converters.

In the tranche from 100 kW to 10 MW the remuneration is increased by
regulated tariff and maintained in the rest, in order to adequately reflect the
costs of these installations.

The market option is not considered for these installations.

The remuneration corresponding to the photovoltaic solar sector can be
found in Table 3, sub-group b.1.1.

For installations up to 10 MW, these regulated tariff values provide a
reasonable IRR at 25 years of approximately 7%.

Within the power range exceeding 10 MW, an IRR of less of 7% is taken into
account. Photovoltaic installations of this size are not normal and if
implemented would not respond exclusively to profitability criteria.

The power objectives provided up to now are extended, establishing 371
MW as reference installed power objective with right to remuneration for
photovoltaic installations.®*

The PER 2005-2010 also referred to a 7% figure:

Rate of Return (IRR), measured in legal tender and for each standard
project, around 7%, on equity (before any financing) and after taxes.
(Respondent's translation)

Similar language referring to a 7% IRR can also be found in the PER 2000-2010.8°

Moreover, the press release issued by the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism in
May 2007 equally refers to a 7% rate in the following terms:

The new regulation guarantees a return of 7% for wind farms and hydro-
electric facilities that opt to transfer their production to distributors and
between 5% and 9% if they participate in the electricity production market.
Photovoltaic facilities with greater capacity practically double their
compensation, those of a lesser size stay at the same level, and the
guaranteed return is 7%.°®' (Claimants'’ translation)

Finally, the CNE Report 3/2007 refers to the 7% rate “proposed by the Ministry”.®® It is
true, however, that the CNE Report 3/2007 also refers to other IRRs, which range from
6.5%, to 6.7%, to 7.6%, to 7.9%, and to 8.2%.®°5 In particular, the Tribunal notes that
for PV installations of up to 100 kw (which according to both Parties constituted “many”
or “most” of the Claimants’ plants”), the CNE refers to IRRs of 7.6% and 8%:89

On this basis, it emerges from the information available to operators at the time when

the Claimants made their investment that the envisaged IRR would vary, depending on
the capacity and type of the plant. This said, the emphasis in the PER 2005-2010 and

the PER 2000-2010, as well as in the Memoria Economica and the Ministry's press

release shows an intent to guarantee “approximately” or “around” 7%. There is no

dispute that the two PERs and the Ministry's press release were public (the Claimants

actually rely on them to substantiate their expectations) and that, as the Tribunal has

previously concluded,®%” the Memoria Economica was publicly available upon request.

Therefore, on balance, the Tribunal considers that the “reasonable rate of return” that
the Claimants could have expected at the time of their investments was in the range of
7%.°% This is the rate of return which the experts used in the EJM in accordance with
P18.

The Tribunal finally notes that the rate of 7% is broadly aligned with those granted by
other European Union Member States, such as France, Italy, Estonia, Latvia,9° and
the Czech Republic.°"

iii. Exit v. holding IRR
(a) The Parties’ Position

The Claimants submit that Brattle calculates the IRR that an investor would receive
“throughout the entire regulatory lifetime of its investment” (so-called “long-term holding
IRR” or holding IRR).°°2 The Claimants submit that only holding IRRs (as opposed to
Econ One’s exit IRRs) are compatible with the Tribunal’s instructions in PO12 which
“implicitly requested the parties to calculate a holding IRR ‘over the regulatory life of a
plant”.°°5 According to Brattle, “holding and exit IRRs can diverge significantly because
of interest rate fluctuations because interest rates affect exit values but not underlying

cash flows” 94

The Respondent, for its part, submits that the Tribunal should use Econ One’s exit IRRs
for the computation of the Actual Scenario. Econ’s exit IRRs are calculated using the
initial investment cost, historical cash flows generated and the enterprise value at the
ex ante and ex post valuation dates established in PO12. The enterprise value is the
market value of the remaining life of the Claimants’ PV Plants expressed at the

See also Stadtwerke, para. 337 (where, in considering “whether the impact upon the
Claimants’ investment specifically was reasonable or proportionate through an
assessment of the rate of return earned by the Claimants’ investment before and after
the disputed measures’, the tribunal found that the “reasonable rate of return” at the
time the Claimants made their investment was “around 7% post-tax”).

valuation date using a discount rate.°°5 Thus, Econ One calculates the IRR that an
investor would receive assuming that it sells its investment at some point, effectively
cashing out the estimated fair market value of the assets through the sale. In any event,
for Econ One, the distinction between exit and holding IRRs “is not particularly relevant
here since there is only a small difference between the two calculations” .9°

(b) Discussion

The Tribunal considers that, for the purposes of the computation of the IRRs, a holding
IRR is to be preferred over an exit IRR. This is because Spain calculated the reasonable
rate of return over the useful life of an installation (i.e. a holding IRR) and not on a sale
of the plant at some moment in the future. In the words of Spain’s expert, MG&A:

The remuneration model for renewable energies in Spain has always been

based on the objective of conferring a Reasonable Rate of Return calculated

over the whole of the installation’s useful life, that is, from the moment the

plant is connected and electricity production begins until the end of its useful
life.9°7

In other words, for purposes of assessing the alleged harm to the Claimants’
investments, it is logical to have regard to the IRR that an investor would receive
throughout the entire regulatory lifetime of the plant. By contrast, the Tribunal sees little
justification in assuming that an investor sells its investment at some point, effectively
cashing out the estimated fair market value of the assets through the sale.

Accordingly, in PO18, the Tribunal directed the experts to “use a holding IRR as
opposed to an exit IRR in both scenarios (with Measures and without Measures)”.98

iv. The Valuation Date
(a) The Parties’ Position

The Claimants submit that the Tribunal should adopt an ex post or “date of the award”
valuation date. They contend that according to investment arbitration jurisprudence, an
ex post valuation is appropriate where it allows a tribunal (a) to ensure full reparation
and wipe out the consequences of a wrongful act; and/or (b) to include more recent
and comprehensive data, thereby reinforcing the accuracy of the valuation. The
Claimants submit that both criteria are satisfied in the present case because, first, an

718.

ex post assessment ensures use of actual production figures, market information and
macroeconomic data, making the valuation more accurate. Second, it accounts for
potential changes to the rate of return over time, thereby capturing the additional harm
that the Claimants will suffer.°°°

If an ex ante valuation date were to be used, the Claimants submit that the appropriate
date should be 30 June 2014, i.e. the date “when the June 2014 Order was
implemented, which sets the precise economic parameters for calculating the Special
Payment under the New Regime”.9'°

By contrast, Spain submits that the Tribunal should adopt an ex ante valuation date for
the following reasons:

e Article 13(1) of the ECT expressly refers to the date of valuation as being the
“date of the unlawful act for the purpose of calculating an investor's alleged
damages in case of an expropriation”. The same date of valuation should apply

(b) Discussion

While in their later submissions the Claimants expressed a clear preference for a
valuation on the date of the award, in their first Quantum Memorial the Claimants
accepted that tribunals admit both an ex ante and an ex post valuation depending on
the specific circumstances of a case.%"* Indeed, the Claimants referred the Tribunal to
prior arbitral decisions where tribunals adopted an ex ante approach both for
expropriation and other treaty breaches based on the date on which the disputed
measure or measures effected an “irreversible deprivation”.°'7 On that basis, the
Claimants suggested June 2014 as the appropriate date for an ex ante valuation, to
reflect the date of the Parameters’ Order which, in their submission, was the final act in
the series of Disputed Measures.°"8

724,

In the Tribunal’s view, according to the specificities of the dispute, an ex post valuation
may sometimes be preferable because reparation should ideally stand in lieu of
restitution and an ex post valuation allows for the most recent information to be taken
into account. This said, a valuation at the time of the breach, i.e. ex ante, appears
particularly appropriate when the consequences of a later evolution of prices, interest
rates, or other inputs are unrelated to the impugned measures and the (higher) harm
can thus not be deemed to derive from the measures.

In this case, as Brattle explained, there appear to be two main drivers for the difference
between the ex post and ex ante figures, namely the lower interest rates and the
(related) possibility of revision of the returns.°'° It is clear that the decrease of the
interest rates was not caused by the Disputed Measures, but was mainly due to the
evolution of the financial markets and to macroeconomic conditions. As for the periodic
revisions, they are linked to the evolution of interest rates. To the extent that the
calculation of the IRR and the corresponding loss, if there is one, seeks to track
reasonable profitability, it should be measured on the conditions that prevail in the
markets depending on the economic and financial surroundings.

In the circumstances, the Tribunal considers that using a valuation date linked to the
date of the award would not be justified. It thus opts for an ex ante valuation, which is
the approach reflected in PO18. That order indeed provided that “[a]s valuation date,
the EJM shall use the date of the alleged breach as it was set by agreement of the
Parties, i.e. 30 June 2014”.920

v. Harm Calculated per Claimant
At the PO12 Hearing, the experts agreed that the EJM would calculate the harm “per

investor” or per Claimant (rather than for each plant):

MR CALDWELL [Brattle]: [...] we've basically got models per investor. And
then some centralised —

THE PRESIDENT: Yes, it's per investor, since some investors have several
plants.

DR FLORES: Yes.

THE PRESIDENT: And | think you agree with the fact that we'll look at it per
investor. Is that right?

See PO12 Hearing Tr. [English version] (Caldwell), 17 January 2018, at 81:23-82:9.
PO18, para. 12(d).

228

725.

726.

727.

729.

DR FLORES: Yes.°"

Accordingly, in PO18, the Tribunal instructed the experts that “[t]he harm allegedly
suffered by the Claimants shall be calculated per Claimant’ .°22

The Joint Memorandum provides the following agreed explanations:

The harm allegedly suffered is calculated per Claimant entity, rather than per
investor group. There are 26 Claimants in total, but some Claimants are
100% wholly owned subsidiaries of other Claimants so there is no need to
distinguish between them for the purposes of the EJM. Within the 14 investor
groups we distinguish between 19 Claimant entities. For example, the
investor group HgCapital includes two Claimant entities: Mercurio Solar
S.a.r.| and Tyche Solar S.a.r.l.

The Claimant entities included in the EJM are listed in the EJM.°°

Therefore, in light of the experts’ agreement and the absence of objection by the
Parties, the Tribunal will establish the harm allegedly suffered by Claimant, that is for
each of the 19 Claimant entities, as listed in the EJM.

vi. Cost Base
(a) The Parties’ Position
(i) | The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants submit that the IRRs in the scenario without Measures should be
calculated on the basis of an efficiency benchmark, the so-called “marginal plant”, and
not on the basis of the actual greenfield costs incurred for each of the Claimants’ plants.

According to the Claimants, the IRRs in the scenario without Measures must be
determined by applying the same assumptions that Spain used when designing the RD
661/2007 regime. The Claimants explain that Spain never published the cost base (the
cost and production parameters) that it employed to determine the FITs applicable
under RD 661/2007. In their view, there is nevertheless evidence to demonstrate that
the FITs offered under RD 661/2007 (and consequently the IRR) were calculated on

the basis of a “marginal plant” or “levelised cost target” ,9*4 i.e. a hypothetical standard
plant with the most efficient cost and production parameters.975

By contrast, the Claimants submit that the Respondent's suggestion that the greenfield
cost base should be adopted is unfounded.°”* In particular, the Claimants observe that
the “greenfield costs” option (i.e. Alternative 2 in PO18, para. 12(f)(ii)) advocated by
Spain, which adopts the actual greenfield costs of the plants as the cost base, would
result in the totality of the Claimants’ efficiency gains being “stripped away”.°27
Moreover, adopting this option would not only penalize efficient investors, but would
also reward investors who built or bought inefficient plants. In the Claimants’
submission, the inefficient plants that failed to beat the cost target should earn less than
7% after tax. However, if the greenfield costs approach were adopted, those inefficient
PV plants would be awarded damages allowing them to achieve 7% after tax returns.°7°

The Claimants then explain the marginal plant cost base which they adopted for their
But For or without Measures scenario. Because Spain never published the costs and
production data on the basis of which it calculated the RD 661/2007 FITs, Brattle had
to identify the marginal plants used for each of three size categories provided under
RD 661/2007. For this purpose, Brattle took the 42 standard installations defined by
Spain under the New Regime (corresponding to the Claimants’ plants) and grouped
them according to the three size categories that existed under the Original Regime, i.e.
(i) 100kW and under; (ii) between 100kW and 10MW; and (iii) above 10MW.°79 Once
regrouped, for each of the three size categories, Brattle identified the standard plant
that represented the marginal plant under the Original Regime. This resulted in the so-
called “pure” marginal plant option, according to the Claimants.°° The Alternative Tariff

The levelised cost of a PV plant is the “the price at which the power station would have

to sell all its power, increasing each year with inflation over the power station's entire
useful life, to recover all operating costs and maintenance costs, to compensate
investors for all their capital outlays, and to grant them a reasonable return on their
investment’. See, Quantum Memorial, para. 37 citing to Brattle’s Second Expert
Report, para. 26.

PO12 C-PHB2, paras. 140-141; PO12 C-PHB1, para. 78.

The denomination of “pure” for this marginal plant option is used by the Tribunal for
easier understanding in order to distinguish it from the two other marginal plant options
proposed by Brattle, i.e. the “size re-classified marginal plant” and the “IT Code”
marginal plant, which were ultimately retained in PO18 (see PO18, para. 12(f)(i)).

for each of the Claimants’ plants was determined based on the size category into which
each plant fell. The Claimants submit that the Tribunal should adopt the “pure” marginal
plant as the cost base as it most closely resembled the actual RD 661/2007 marginal
plant.

However, in the event that the Tribunal would not agree to use the “pure” marginal
plant, Brattle proposed two alternative efficiency standards for calculating damages.
The first alternative was based on the so-called “size re-classified marginal plant” and
the second, on using the actual “IT Code” applied by Spain to each of the Claimants’
PV installations under the New Regime.

Under the size re-classified marginal plant option, Brattle regrouped the 42 standard
installations into the five size categories introduced by the New Regime (as opposed
to the three size categories under RD 661/2007 which it had done for the “pure”
marginal plant). These five categories are the following: (i) less than or equal to 5kW;
(ii) between 5kW and 100kW,; (iii) between 100 kW and 2MW,; (iv) between 2MW and
10MW; and (v) above 10 MW. This analysis “assigns each project a marginal plant
based on the new size category assigned to it under the New Regulatory Regime,
rather than a marginal plant based on the original size category assigned to it under
RD 661/2007”.99"

The second alternative calculation is based on using the actual “IT Codes” applied by
Spain to each of the Claimants’ PV installations under the New Regime.%? In other
words, the “Own IT-Code” cost base adopted the efficiency benchmarks that Spain
itself established under the New Regime.

The Claimants contend that, compared to the “pure” marginal plant option, the “size re-
classified marginal plant” cost base, “allows Spain to (i) create new efficiency standards
ex post’ as it contemplates five size categories and therefore five marginal plants (as
compared to the three original categories under RD 661/2007).°°5 Further, it allows

BOR Il, para. 227.

As explained by Brattle, “[t]he June [2014] Ministerial Order defines 42 separate
standard installations (IT-codes) for PV projects previously receiving the FITs under
RD 661/2007. For each of the 42 separate IT codes, the June Ministerial Order defines
construction costs, and operating costs and production levels throughout the expected
30-year regulatory life of the standard installation”. See BQR Il, para. 116 (internal
footnote omitted).

The Tribunal notes that these size categories are (i) installed capacity less than or equal
to 5kW; (ii) installed capacity more than 5kW but less than or equal to 100kW; (iii)
installed capacity more than 100 kW but less than or equal to 2MW,; (iv) installed

Spain to “re-classify the Claimants’ plants [...] ex post’, from the smaller categories
under RD 661/2007 to the larger size categories defined under the New Regime,
thereby reducing the cost and production parameters to which they are subject. Overall,
it allows Spain to appropriate some of the efficient gains achieved by the Claimants
under RD 661/2007. Nevertheless, it is to be preferred to the “IT Codes” option, so say
the Claimants, as it allows the Claimants to retain at least some of their efficiency

gains.94

By contrast, the Claimants submit that opting for the “Own IT-Code” cost base in the
EJM would allow Spain to appropriate a substantial portion of their efficiency gains, in
contradiction to the undisputed evidence of both Parties’ experts that the Claimants
were entitled to retain their efficiency gains.9°5 For the Claimants, applying the Own IT-
Codes cost base would allow Spain to retroactively change the fundamental
characteristics of the regulatory regime applicable to existing investments, inasmuch
as this option not only re-categorises plants depending on their size but also depending
on the year of commissioning and the technology used. It therefore introduces many
levels of remuneration for different types of plants, where only three existed under the
Original Regime.%°6 In the circumstances, the Claimants submit that there is no
compelling reason to depart from the “Size Re-classified” marginal plant and choose
the “Own IT-Code” option instead.

The Claimants submit that if, despite evidence to the contrary, the Tribunal adopts the
actual greenfield costs of the plants as the cost base (as advocated by Spain), then the
quantification proposed by Brattle should be preferred. In that regard, the dispute
between the experts concerns the inclusion of developer premiums in the calculation
of greenfield costs.

Brattle notes that, in the event the Tribunal decides to include developer premiums in
the greenfield costs, both Parties agree on the quantification of these costs.°°” Thus,
for Brattle, the dispute between the experts concerns only the situation were developer

capacity more than 2MW but less than or equal to 10MW; and (v) installed capacity
greater than 10 MW. Of these five size categories, the Claimants 68 PV plants fall into
categories (ii) to (v), and are assigned a marginal plant based on which size category
they fall into.

premiums are excluded. Should the Tribunal decide to exclude developer premiums,

then the Tribunal should opt for Brattle’s calculations.

The experts’ quantification of the greenfield costs in a situation excluding the developer
premiums differs because of their different understandings of the components of
“developer premiums’. For Brattle, it is not appropriate to exclude from the greenfield
costs elements of the price paid by an investor to acquire a project prior to construction
(as Econ One does), because part of such price will have compensated the original
developer for the costs that it incurred for designing the project and obtaining the
necessary permits. Thus, these amounts should be included in the calculation of
greenfield costs.9°°

(ii) | The Respondent's Position

Spain submits that the remuneration scheme for PV installations, including the RD
661/2007 FIT, has always been based on the “costs of standard installations that reflect
the typical efficient greenfield costs in the market for the construction of certain type of
installation in a given year”.°°° Furthermore, Spain contends that “the typical costs of
the standard facilities included in the Parameters’ Order IT Codes are [...]
representative of the real costs in the market at the time of construction of the PV
Plants”.94°

By contrast, Spain asserts that the “marginal plant” used by Brattle is not representative
of the typical costs and production of the Claimants’ plants. This is because Brattle’s
marginal plant applies the costs of the most expensive (but efficient) 5kW plant
constructed in 2007 to calculate the “Alternative Tariff’ and applies the same tariff to all

Quantum Reply, paras. 129-130.

PO12 R-PHB1, para. 96. Spain has also insisted that its regulatory framework has
always provided that the reasonable return will be obtained at the plant level or, in other
words, that the investment costs considered and the profitability obtained are calculated
with reference to greenfield investors (i.e., the promoters who undertook the
development, construction and commissioning of the installation). Such remuneration
does not cover the extra costs incurred by “secondary”, “financial” or “brownfield”
investors, such as the Claimants, who paid a premium for the acquisition of the asset.
Spain contends that the calculation of the remuneration under the current regime also
considers the profitability of the project at the plant level (i.e., for greenfield investors),
as is demonstrated by RDL 9/2013 and the Order on Parameters, which refer to the
reasonable return for the “facilities”. See R-PHB1, paras. 338-343.

746.

of Claimants’ plants “which are approximately 3.8MW on average” in size and were
constructed in 2008, when costs of construction were lower.%*

In Spain’s submission, the fact that the marginal plant is not representative of typical
costs is reinforced by the alternative cost bases proposed by Brattle. These show that
“(i) [...] using a 100 kW plant instead of a 5 kW plant, reduces the alleged damages by
around 30% and (ii) using the IT Codes which are the representative of the standard
costs of Claimants’ Plants, again, reduces the claimed damages by around 40%”.942

Thus, the Respondent concludes, “Brattle's ‘Marginal Plant’ theory does not make
economic sense and there is absolutely no evidence in the record to support that this
was the expectation of Claimants”.%4

More specifically, Spain contends that the IRRs should be calculated using the
Claimants’ greenfield costs excluding developer premiums, as calculated by Econ
One.°4 Spain recalls that greenfield investment costs are the costs incurred at the
beginning of a project's lifecycle that are necessary to begin the operation of a PV
facility.°45 It contends that the only appropriate way to calculate greenfield costs is by
excluding developer premiums, since these are not “greenfield costs” (i.e. costs
necessary to put the plant in operation) and their inclusion would lead to unreasonable

results.%6

For Spain, Brattle’s argument that developer premiums should be included in the
greenfield costs is speculative and unsupported by the evidence, because “[alt least
part of such acquisition prices will have compensated the original developer for the
costs that it incurred in designing a project and compiling the necessary permits”.94”

If the Tribunal agrees with Spain, the latter further states that the Tribunal should opt
for Econ One’s calculations of the greenfield costs excluding developer premiums, as
Brattle’s calculations “continue to be completely overstated”.°8

Finally, if the Tribunal were to adopt an approach based on the Alternative Tariff, the
Respondent agrees with the Claimants that their greenfield costs should not be
considered as the cost base for the Alternative Tariffs under the EJM. While Spain’s
position is that the only legitimate expectation was for the Claimants to obtain a
remuneration that would provide them a rate of return on their reasonable and efficient
greenfield costs (as opposed to a tariff per MWh), if the scenario without Measures
were to “be calculated on the expectation of receiving a remuneration based on
alternative tariffs of € per MWh, the consistent approach would be to use the standard
efficient costs in the market at the time of investment to calculate such tariff, which is

represented by the IT Codes”.94°

(b) Discussion

The first question to be decided with regard to the cost base is whether the Alternative
Tariff should be calculated using an efficiency benchmark such as the “marginal plant”,
ie. essentially a standard plant (PO18, para. 12(f)(i), Alternative 1), or the actual
greenfield costs of each of the Claimants’ plants (PO18, para. 12(f)(ii), Alternative 2).
On the basis of the record and the expert evidence, the Tribunal comes to the
conclusion that the appropriate option is the marginal plant as opposed to the actual
greenfield costs of an individual installation, for the following reasons.

First, there is no serious dispute between the Parties that the reasonable return
calculated by Spain at the time when the Claimants’ plants were built was based on a
marginal plant.

In its Quantum Counter-Memorial, Spain confirmed that the regulatory regime in place
at the time of the Claimants’ investments was a marginal plant system:
Spain has always claimed:

a) That the tariffs offered under RD 661/2007 were calculated in order to
give the installations an implicit RRoR;

b) That such RRoR was based on implicit levelised-costs associated with an
efficient marginal plant; [...]°°°

235

751.

752.

753.

754.

Further, Spain’s expert in the liability phase, MG&A, opined that the regulatory regime
was based on a standard or marginal plant:

As can be verified according to the basis of the CNE reports 4/2004 and

3/2007, the CNE has pursued exactly the same steps to calculate the

remuneration for photovoltaic energy in 2004 (for the development of RD

436/2004), in 2007 (for the development of RD 661/2007) and afterwards in

2008 (for the preparation of RD 1578/2008). This procedure involves

analysing the investment and operating costs of a standard type photovoltaic

infrastructure and determining the income required to generate an Internal

Return Rate after taxes higher than the Target Rate of Return (TRR).%°"
MG8A also explained that the reasonable return under the 1997 Electricity Law was
calculated using “a methodology based on installation types with standard technical
and economic variables” and that one of the “two main principles” of the 1997 Electricity
Law was that the reasonable return was defined with reference to “the standard
economic and technical parameters for installation types for each technology”.°>? This
is also consistent with the contemporaneous documents describing the reasonable rate
of return under the RE framework. For instance, the PER 2005-2010 defines the

reasonable rate of return as follows:

Return on Project Type: calculated on the basis of maintaining an Internal

Rate of Return (IRR), measured in legal tender and for each standard

project, around 7%, on equity (before any financing) and after taxes.°%°
It is natural that the Spanish regulator would refer to a standard plant, rather than the
actual costs, in setting the premiums under the 1997 Electricity Law, as it would be
almost impossible for it to look at the actual costs of all installations ex ante. In fact, the
use of a marginal plant system appears to be standard regulatory practice in other

countries too.

While the Tribunal’s task in this case is to calculate the Claimants’ alleged harm as
opposed to setting tariffs or other premiums (which is the regulator's task), this
difference in perspective does not warrant abandoning the marginal plant approach
which is implied in Spain’s energy incentives framework. Thus, the Tribunal concludes
on this point that the regulatory framework at the time of the Claimants’ investment was
designed to offer a 7% return after tax on the marginal plant, being noted that the actual

returns for a particular PV installation could vary based on the plant's own
characteristics.

Finally, the Tribunal notes that the Parties agree that, if an Alternative Tariff is used to
calculate profitability in the scenario without Measures (which was the Tribunal’s
determination, see supra at VI.B.4.c.i(b)), the only consistent approach is to consider
the costs of a standard plant as the appropriate cost base. In particular, in its latest
submission, the Respondent has taken the following view:

[T]he Claimants submit that their greenfield costs should not be considered

as the cost base for the alternative tariffs. Spain agrees. As explained

previously, Spain's position is that the only legitimate expectation was for

the Claimants to obtain a remuneration that would provide them a RRoR on

their reasonable and efficient greenfield costs, not on a tariff based on € per

MWh. However, as the Tribunal has decided in PO18 that the but-for

scenario should be calculated _on the expectation _of receiving _a

remuneration based on alternative tariffs of € per MWh, the consistent

approach would be to use the standard efficient costs in the market at the

time of investment to calculate such tariff, which is represented by the IT

Codes.°5
For these reasons, the Tribunal decides that the appropriate cost base is the marginal
plant. This being so, the next question is which of the three marginal plant options

proposed by Brattle is the most appropriate one to quantify the Alternative Claim.

The first marginal plant option, which is sometimes referred to as the “Marginal Plant”
option in capital letters by the Claimant and which the Tribunal refers to as the “pure”
marginal plant option to distinguish it from the other two alternatives, essentially takes
the 42 standard installations defined by Spain under the New Regime (that correspond
to the Claimants’ PV plants built in 2007 and 2008) and regroups them according to the
three size categories that existed under the regime in place at the time of the Claimants’
investments. With regard to this option, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent has
convincingly established that Brattle’s “pure” marginal plant is a 5kW PV installation,
whereas the Claimants’ installations have higher capacities. Because of the
shortcomings of this option linked to the size of the plants, in PO18, the Tribunal
directed the experts to only take into account the two remaining options, namely the
size re-classified marginal and the IT Codes marginal plants, which incorporate
sensitivities responding to Spain's criticism.9°

PO12 R-PHB2, para. 150 (emphasis added, internal footnote omitted).

See PO18, para. 12(f)(i).

237

758.

759.

760.

761.

Between those two options, the Tribunal considers that the size re-categorization
performed by Brattle in the size re-classified marginal plant option correctly remedies
the deficiency of its “pure” marginal plant. By contrast, the “IT Codes” option is less
appropriate, as it would wipe out all of the efficiency gains that investors obtained
compared to the marginal plant under the regulatory regime in place at the time of the
Claimants’ investments. As the Tribunal already noted (see supra at para. 619), the

guarantee to obtain a reasonable return did not imply that it acted as a “cap”.

For these reasons, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that the cost base should use
the marginal plant approach, with the size re-classified marginal plant sensitivity (PO18,
para. 12(f)(i)(a)). In this respect, the Tribunal notes that the Parties’ experts agree on
the input for this cost base.’ Hence, the Tribunal will select the option “Standard

installation — size reclassified” in parameter 2 of the EJM.

vii. Tax Shield
(a) The Claimants’ Position

In the EJM, the experts concur that “[g]iven that the Alternative Tariff is calculated on a
pre-tax basis, it must include a gross-up to account for corporate taxes”. It is for this
reason, the Claimants submit, that Brattle used a 17% tax rate to gross-up the 7% or
8% post-tax return into a pre-tax IRR in order to calculate the revenue line in its But-

For scenario.°°

However, the Claimants submit that the experts disagree on three matters pertaining

to the calculation of the effective tax rate:

i. They divergence on whether the calculation of the effective tax rate should
take into account the “interest tax shield”. The Claimants explain that the tax
shield is the reduction in payable taxes as a result of the interest payments to
be made on loan financing, which, under the Spanish tax code, can reduce
the overall amount of taxes paid by a company.%° It is the Claimants’

See Joint Memorandum, para. 13, noting that “Brattle and Econ One agree concerning
the relevant standard costs in each of the two marginal cost scenarios. The cost base
includes both the initial investment cost and, when evaluating past profits, also
considers the historical profitability over the period 2006-2013”.

contention that the Tribunal should not take the tax shield into account
(Alternative 2 in PO18, para. 12(g));

ii. They are also in disagreement on the calculation of the interest tax shield in
the event that the Tribunal decides to include the tax shield (contrary to the
Claimants’ position);

ili. They further put forward different methodologies for calculating the effective
tax rate.

(i) Interest tax shield

It is the Claimants’ submission that the Tribunal should not take into account the interest
tax shield in the effective tax rate calculation, as Spain did not consider the benefits of
the tax shield when setting the tariffs under the Original Regime. The Claimants
underline that the revenues provided to the PV plants under the Original Regime was
on a pre-tax basis. However, the reasonable return was calculated on a post-tax basis.
Consequently, according to the Claimants, it would have been impossible for Spain to
guarantee a 7% post-tax return without considering a specific tax rate for calculating
the FIT.

Actually, there is ample evidence, so the Claimants argue, in support of their position
that Spain did not consider any tax shield. First, the Claimants point out that Spain’s
(and Econ One’s) current position on the inclusion of the interest tax shield is directly
contradicted by the position adopted by Spain’s previous expert, MG&A. That expert
repeatedly confirmed that the reasonable rate of return offered under RD 661/2007 did
not take the effects of debt into account.°*' Thus, until PO12, it was undisputed that
Spain did not consider the tax shield when setting the RD 661/2007 FIT.

Second, the Claimants refer to the PER 2000-2010 and the PER 2005-2010, both of
which specify that the reasonable rate of return for a standard project is calculated on
the basis of preserving a certain internal rate of return, before any financing.% For the

Claimants and Brattle, the phrase “before any financing” corroborates that Spain did
not consider the interest tax shield while determining the reasonable rate of return.%°

Finally, the Claimants contend that their position is confirmed by the Greentech
Documents.%4 According to the Claimants, the Greentech Documents contain the
calculations that underlie the Casos Tipos in the PER 2005-2010, on the basis of which
Spain determined the RD 661/2007 FITs. These calculations show that interest
payments on loans were not considered.%° The Claimants discuss the DCF analysis
contained in the Greentech Documents and argue that, if the PER DCF model
considered the tax deductibility of interest on loans (whether third-party or shareholder
loans), the model would deduct interest payments from the “Gross Margin” when
calculating the “Taxable Income”.°® The absence of any such deductions for interest
supports the fact that Spain did not consider the benefits of financing when calculating
the target rates of return of 7% after tax set out in the PER 2005-2010.°°7

The Claimants seek to refute Spain’s attempts to discredit the Greentech Documents,
on the ground that, by reference to their metadata, these documents were created in
2017 (as initially argued by Spain) or in 2009 (as subsequently argued by Spain) and
could thus not have been served to set the RD 661/2007 FITs. The Claimants submit
first that Spain produced these documents in the Greentech arbitration in response to
a request to produce documents relevant to determine the RD 661/2007 FITs. Thus,
Spain itself represented that these documents predated RD 661/2007. Second, the
content of these documents itself evidences that they were produced in 2005 during
the preparation of the PER 2005-2010, and not in 2017 or 2009. Third, the DCF
calculations in these documents is consistent with the calculations for Casos Tipos in
the PER 2005-2010.%8 Fourth, the Greentech Documents confirm that the tax shield

was not taken into account in calculating the target rate of return.%°

In the circumstances, the Claimants submit that “all of the evidence on the record,
including AME’s [MG&A’s] testimony, shows that Spain has consistently defined target

rates of return for renewable projects on a before financing basis, that is, without taking
into account the tax shield”.97°

(ii) If at all, tax shield to be computed according to Brattle’s
approach

In the alternative, should the Tribunal determine that the interest tax shield must be
considered, the Parties’ experts disagree as to how the shield should be built into the
effective tax rate. According to the Claimants, this requires certain assumptions about
the type of financing at issue. In particular, assumptions need to be made about (i) the
proportion of external loan financing in the capital structure; (ii) the term of the loans;
and (iii) the interest rate.9”1

The Claimants note that the PER 2005-2010 (based on which the RD 661/2007 FITs
were determined), only provides guidance as to the first of these three assumptions,
stipulating that RE installations would be financed with 77% debt. Consequently, so say
the Claimants, Brattle has adopted this figure for its calculation.9’2

Given the absence of guidance for the two other parameters, the Claimants explain
that Brattle uses the best evidence available to it: the actual third party loans entered
into by the project companies. On this basis, Brattle assumes a loan-term of 15 years
and an average interest rate of 5%, both being broadly reflective of the terms of the
actual loan agreements. For Brattle, these parameters are reasonable, given the initial
expectation of a 25-year regulatory life under RD 661/2007 and given that the average
loan interest rate would need to be below the overall project rate of return (i.e. below
7%).973

The Claimants note that Econ One disagrees with the parameters chosen by Brattle.
Instead, it assumes 85% financing, a loan term of 20 years and an interest rate of 7%
on the basis of a distinction between third-party and shareholder loans. According to
the Claimants, this distinction is arbitrary. It is “nothing more than an ex post invention
of Econ One”24 and was “never mentioned in the PER 2005-2010, the Memoria

Economica or any of the contemporaneous regulatory evidence referred to by Econ
One”, nor was it addressed by MG&A.

In addition, the Claimants find the assumptions adopted by Econ One inappropriate for
other reasons as well. This is because the “debt profile assumed by Econ One would
leave a representative standard installation under the New Regime unable to meet its
debt obligations” and in breach of the financial covenants found in typical loan
documentation.9”5

In sum, the Claimants submit that the Tribunal should not consider the interest tax
shield while determining the effective tax rate. Alternatively, if the Tribunal were to take
into account the interest tax shield, the Claimants submit that it should adopt the debt
profile proposed by Brattle, which results in an effective tax rate of 10.8%.976

(iii) | Methodology for calculating the effective tax rate

According to the Claimants, Brattle and Econ One also diverge on the determination of
the effective tax rate. This divergence, say the Claimants, boils down to two questions:
“(i) what period of depreciation to take into account; and (ii) whether a single effective
tax rate should be calculated for the lifetime of a plant or whether a different rate should
be calculated for each year of that lifetime”.°””

As regards the first issue, Brattle chooses a depreciation period of 25 years, as this is
the period actually used by Spain in the PER 2005-2010 and subsequently confirmed
by the Greentech Documents. According to the Claimants, there is no reason to depart
from this approach.9”8

In connection with the second issue, the Claimants submit that a single effective tax
rate should be calculated for the lifetime of a plant contrary to Econ One’s approach of
applying a series of annual tax rates. The Claimants argue first that Econ One’s current
position, which was only put forward in the EJM, departs from its earlier one under
PO12 “where [Econ One] noted the time profile of tax payments but nevertheless used
a single effective tax rate”.°’° For the Claimants, this is “another opportunistic attempt

to reduce damages at the 11' hour”.°°° Second, the Claimants allege that Econ One's
approach “results in systematic under-recovery because of inconsistencies between
the cash flow profile used by Econ One to derive the annual effective tax rates in the
first place and its final re-profiled series of Alternative Tariffs”.°®' Econ One's approach
allegedly never results in a 7% after-tax rate of return. Finally, the Claimants submit
that Spain did not adopt Econ One’s approach when determining the RD 661/2007
tariff.98

For these reasons, the Claimants submit that Econ One’s approach must be rejected
and a single effective tax rate should be calculated for the lifetime of the plant.

(b) The Respondent's Position

Spain’s position on the effective tax rate and tax shield is as follows:

¢ The effective tax rate should reflect the real taxes paid by PV installations and
therefore include the tax shield that those facilities enjoy under the Spanish tax

regime;
¢ The tax shield should be calculated following the Econ One methodology; and

¢ The correct calculation of the effective tax rate is the one provided by Econ
One.°83

(i) Interest tax shield

Spain contends that the tax shield must be taken into account in calculating the effective
tax rate. It explains that PV facilities, like any Spanish company, are eligible to deduct
interest payments and depreciation from their taxable income and to apply investment
tax credits, thereby reducing corporate taxes. Furthermore, according to Spanish tax
law, “projects are eligible to deduct the interest payments on shareholder loans” which
substantially reduce taxes due.%5 Moreover, as PV facilities are capital intensive, and
therefore enjoy a substantial depreciation tax shield, their tax rate should be lower than

average. As a consequence of these tax deductions, in the Respondent's view,
Claimants’ PV Plants paid few to no taxes.°86

In response to the Claimants’ argument that Spain did not take the interest tax shield
into consideration when it set the RD 661/2007 FIT, Spain contends that:

e The PER 2005-2010 did not include a consideration of the effective tax rate
applicable to PV plants, since that depends on the characteristics of each
individual plant;9°”

e The reference in the PER 2005-2010 to an investment with 100% own
resources refers to project returns and had nothing to do with the applicable
effective tax rate;9°° and

e There is no evidence that the Claimants invested in reliance on the fact that the
PER 2005-2010 calculated the remuneration to PV plants considering a 17%
tax rate and no legitimate expectation can be formed on this basis.%°°

With respect to the Greentech Documents, Spain contends that they are irrelevant for
the resolution of this dispute.°° Initially it maintained that the metadata showed that the
documents were created in 2017, which would have meant that they were not used to
calculate the tariff of RD 661/2007 as they post-date RD 661/2007 by 10 years.°°"
Subsequently, when disclosing the excel spreadsheets underlying the Greentech
Documents, the Respondent contended that the documents were created in 2009, thus
in any event post-dating RD 661/2007.% In addition, Spain argues that the Claimants
cannot pretend that they had legitimate expectations at the time of investing in Spain
based on the Greentech Documents, as they admit not having seen such documents
prior to the disclosure in this arbitration in 2018.9

In contrast, the Respondent submits that the Claimants should have been aware of
CNE Report 3/2007, which mentions 0% taxation in its calculations.°%

(ii) Tax shield to be calculated according to Econ One’s
methodology
The Respondent contends that for the calculation of both the effective tax rate and the
tax shield, the Tribunal should follow Econ One’s approach. This means that:

= The calculation of the tax shield should consider an 85% level of debt (as
opposed to Brattle’s 77% figure). For the Respondent, debt financing of
85% is a conservative assumption, given that “some of the Claimants’
plants had shareholder loans for over 100% over its greenfield investment

cost”.995

= The calculation of the tax shield should consider a 20-year debt with a 7%
interest rate, which again is proven by the Claimants’ own loan
documentation (covering external loans as well as shareholder loans).9%°

(iii) Effective tax rate to be calculated according to Econ One’s
methodology
The Respondent argues that the Tribunal should adopt Econ One’s calculation of the
effective tax rate. Specifically, it should use the following specifications:

= The appropriate depreciation period for the calculation of the effective tax
rate must be 20 years (and not 25 years, as argued by the Claimants). For
the Respondent, the Claimants’ own documents support a 20-year
depreciation period, while the reference to a 25-year period in the PER
2005-2010 (on which the Claimants’ rely) relates to the technical useful life,
and not to depreciation for tax purposes;997

= The effective tax rate should consider the time profile of tax payments,
which means applying the effective tax rate on an annual basis in such a
way that there is no offset for taxes in the early years (when no taxes are

expected) and a 25% offset in the later years.9% For the Respondent, to
assume that the projects pay the same 10.8% effective tax rate every year,
as Brattle does, is incorrect.%9

(c) Discussion

The reasonable profitability guaranteed by the 1997 Electricity Law aims at a post-tax
returns, whereas the Alternative Tariff is computed on a pre-tax basis. It is therefore
necessary to gross up the Alternative Tariff to reach a post-tax return.

In light of the experts’ evidence and the Parties’ submissions, the main issue arising in
connection with the tax gross up appears to be whether the latter should account for
the interest tax shield available to investments with debt financing. Accordingly, the
Tribunal asked the experts to compute the loss in the without Measures scenario as

follows :

g. The EJM shall compute the harm in the scenario without Measures
assuming that the regulator

i. Alternative 1: Took account of the tax shield;
ii. Alternative 2: Did not take account of the tax shield[.]!°°

In addressing the interest tax shield, the experts disagreed on essentially two matters,
i.e. (i) the methodology to estimate the effective tax rate, an estimate that they both
deem necessary,‘ and (ii) the inclusion of the tax shield in that estimate and, if so,
the relevant modalities.

As a result of these divergences, the experts have built four options of effective tax
rates into the EJM, i.e. 16.9% (not taking into account interest tax shield under Brattle’s
methodology), 15.5% (same under Econ One’s methodology), 10.8% (taking into
account interest tax shield under Brattle’s methodology), and 4.7% (same under Econ
One’s methodology).

The Tribunal notes that the record is not entirely conclusive on whether the regulator
did or did not take into account the tax shield when setting the premiums. On the one
hand, certain documentary evidence appears to suggest that when designing the RD

661/2007 premium, the regulator envisaged a 7% post-tax return without taking into
account financing and, hence, without taking into account a possible tax advantage (so
the PER-2000-2010 and the PER 2005-2010).1° On the other hand, the CNE Report
3/2007 mentions “0% taxation” in its calculations.

Be that as it may, some of the documents mentioned above, such as the two PERs
form the basis for the calculations of the RD 661/2007 tariff. As such, they cannot be
determinative for present purposes. Indeed, in its analysis of the Primary Claim, the
Tribunal has held that the Claimants could have no legitimate expectation of an
immutable RD 661/2007 tariff and the underlying methodology, but only to a reasonable
return of 7% post-tax. It is true that, when implementing the 7% guarantee, the Tribunal
was guided on some issues by the choices which the regulator made for RD 661/2007.
The Tribunal took such guidance because these choices appeared economically well-
founded in light of the issue under review or because they were in line with standard
practices. This does not imply that the Tribunal must systematically follow the
methodology of RD 661/2007.

In this particular instance, the evidence on record indicates that the Claimants expected
to pay little or no taxes on their revenues, mainly because they expected to be able to
deduct interest on loans. In other words, they expected to benefit from the tax shield.
For instance, in its investment proposal, NIBC forecasted that its Aldesa plant would
not pay any tax on its profits until 2029.1° Similarly, in a document from 2009 relating
to Ampere’s acquisition of a participation in the Aznalcollar plant, the plant was forecast
not to pay any tax until 2027.15 Comparable projections may be found for other
investors, including AES, MEIF (for the Cadiz Plant) and Whiteowl Capital.1°°6 For the

Tribunal, there can be no better evidence of the Claimants’ expectations than their own
projections.

Another consideration also plays in favour of taking account of the tax shield. As a
matter of law, compensating the Claimants for taxes they have not paid would be
contrary to the principle that reparation cannot exceed the harm effectively suffered. In
other words, one cannot do better in litigation than in real life.

Finally, the Tribunal has carefully reviewed the so-called Greentech Documents and
the Parties’ multiple submissions thereon.” The Tribunal considers that these
documents are unhelpful to resolve the present issue, as — on the Claimants’
submission — they allegedly informed the calculations contained in the PER 2005-2010
and “pertain[] to Spain’s administrative analysis regarding how Spain determined
remuneration under RD 661/2007”.1% As was explained above, since the Claimants
have no entitlement to the FIT under RD 661/2007 and its methodology, the latter lack
relevance in a context such as the present one, where other elements of the record
lead to a different outcome.

In addition to their difference about the tax shield, the experts are also divided on the
method to establish the effective tax rate, specifically on (i) what period of depreciation
to take into account; (ii) the effect of financing; and (iii) whether a single effective tax
rate should be calculated for the lifetime of a plant or whether a different rate should be
calculated for each year of that lifetime.

Having reviewed the experts’ evidence, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that it
must calculate the effective tax rate in line with the principles that guided its foregoing
analysis on the tax shield. This being so, it notes that on most of the issues, Brattle
relies on the PER 2005-2010, while Econ One uses actual data from the Claimants’
documents. In particular, Brattle considers that it is appropriate to use a 25-year
depreciation period because it is “the one actually used by Spain in the PER 2005-

The Tribunal considers that the Claimants’ request that the Tribunal draw adverse
inferences from the Respondent's failure to produce the Greentech Documents has
become moot as the Respondent eventually produced the Greentech Documents. In
any event, the Tribunal considers that, having regard to the extensive documentary
evidence produced by both Parties, any failures that may have occurred in the
document production process (which have not been established) in no way alter its
conclusions of law and fact.

Document Production, 15 October 2018, para. 13.

2010”.1°°9 It further relies on the PER 2005-2010 in respect of the possible effect of
financing and its conclusion that “the PER [...] indicated an assumption that renewable
installations would be financed with around 77% debt”.'°'° Moreover, it considers that
“[a] 15-year loan term [...] makes sense given initial expectations of a 25-year
regulatory life under RD 661”.10"1

As was discussed above, the Tribunal is not bound by the RD 661/2007 methodology
when calculating the 7% reasonable return in the scenario without Measures and
should not grant the Claimants more than their actual harm (see supra at ...). In that
light, Econ One’s assumptions and calculations appear more appropriate. In this
respect, the Tribunal accepts that the 20-year depreciable life used by Econ One is the
typical tax advantage utilized by photovoltaic facilities.°'? It also finds Econ One's
assumption of a 7% interest rate on shareholder loans more reflective of actual
conditions than Brattle’s 5% rate, as in fact certain plants had interest rates higher than
10%.'°'3 Furthermore, it finds Econ One's 85% financing assumption reasonable,
because, as a matter of fact, the actual PV plants of the Claimants benefitted from a
principal balance above 90%.1°"4

Finally, on the question of the application of a single effective tax rate for the lifetime of
a plant or of different rates for each year of that lifetime, the Tribunal is persuaded that
it is more appropriate to apply the effective tax rate on an annual basis, such that there
is no offset for taxes in the early years when no taxes are expected, and a 25% offset
in the later years. This approach is consistent with the history of the PV plants, which

paid no taxes in the period preceding the Disputed Measures. 10'5

For these reasons, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that the harm in the scenario
without Measures must be computed assuming that the regulator took account of the
tax shield and implementing Econ One’s estimate of the effective tax rate. Hence, the
Tribunal will select the option “Include Interest Tax Shield (Econ One)” in parameter 1
of the EJM.

Revisions of Rate of Return
(a) The Parties’ Position

The Claimants submit that the Tribunal should assume that, in the scenario with
Measures, revisions of returns occur under the New Regime every six years as it is
undisputed that under the New Regime “Spain is set to revise the pre-tax reasonable

return at the beginning of 2020 and then every six years thereafter”.1°'S

The Claimants explain that selecting their preferred alternative for the EJM actually
lowers the Claimants’ damages, because, based on data available as of June 2014,
which is the valuation date, the experts “forecast the pre-tax return to evolve to: 7.2%
for 2020-2025, 8.4% for 2026-2031, 8.5% for 2032-2037, and 8.1% for 2038

onwards”.1017

Separately, the Claimants also note that according to the New Regime regulations
currently in force and the data now available (which would have been considered with
an ex post valuation date), the returns will be further reduced, because the return for
the period of 2020-2025 will be lower than the amounts predicted in 2014. For the
Claimants, “[t]his reflects the unpredictable nature of the New Regime and, therefore,

the high regulatory risk under the New Regime”.1°"8

Spain agrees with the Claimants that the DCF should consider the scheduled revisions
of the rate of return and submits that it has always been its position that reasonable
profitability is a flexible concept that should be reviewed periodically to reflect the

changes in the cost of money in the capital markets.10'9

(b) Discussion

In light of the Parties’ agreement and of the fact that this appears the correct solution,
the Tribunal will assume that revisions of returns will occur under the New Regime
every six years in the scenario with Measures. Indeed, as was also set out by the
experts in the Joint Memorandum, with the Disputed Measures in place, the applicable
reasonable pre-tax rate of return as of the valuation date is 7.398% and Spain is set to
revise such tax at the beginning of 2020 and then every six years thereafter. The
revisions will be based on the evolution of the Spanish 10-year government bond
yield.'°?° The Tribunal further notes that the experts agree on the forecast evolution of
the rates of return.1°21

Accordingly, the Tribunal selects the input “Assume Revision of Returns Occur” in
parameter 4 of the EJM.

ix. Past profits
(a) The Parties’ Position

The Claimants submit that the revenues that they have received before June 2014
when the New Regime was implemented must not be considered in constructing the
Alternative Tariff (Alternative 2, para. 12(i)(ii), PO18). For the Claimants, this option is
the correct choice, as otherwise the Tribunal would endorse “one of the most severe
aspects of the New Regime”, i.e. the retroactive clawback of past profits.1022

In the event the Tribunal decides not to take account of past profits, the Claimants
submit that the Tribunal should adopt Brattle’s implementation of that option. According
to the Claimants, Econ One’s implementation is inappropriate. The Claimants
essentially contend that the straight line depreciation assumed by Econ One is not
proper because the RD 661/2007 tariffs increased annually in a non-linear manner in

PO12 R-PHB2, paras. 201-202.

accordance with inflation. As a result, the capital recovery tended to be lower in the
early years of the project and higher in later years as a result of the inflation indexation.
Consequently, the recovery was less than that implied by straight line depreciation.1°7

By contrast, Spain submits that the only way to calculate profitability is by considering
the full regulatory life of a project. It thus contends that the Tribunal should consider
“past profits”, i.e. the revenue obtained in the period from the day that the PV plant
commenced operation and June 2014, when the Order on Parameters was issued.1°24

Spain explains that from an economic perspective, the only manner to measure a rate
of return is to consider the entire life of a project, which entails that all past profitability
must be accounted for in the calculations."°°5 This has also been confirmed by the EC
Decision on State Aid.1026

Contrary to what the Claimants allege, Spain takes the view that the Disputed
Measures are not retroactive and only have prospective effect. Thus, Spain argues that
the so-called “retroactive claw-back of past profit” referred to by the Claimants is
nothing more than the regulator considering historical data in setting the future

framework. 1027

However, should the Tribunal decide that the correct solution is to ignore past profits,
then Spain contends that it should follow Econ One’s calculations rather than
Brattle’s.1°75 In Spain's view, Econ One is right in only ignoring excess profitability (i.e.
higher than 7% post-tax) and in assuming that in the first 6-8 years the Claimants’ PV
plants recovered a portion of their initial investment cost based on normal profitability
necessary to recover the investment over the 30-year useful life.1°7°

(b) Discussion

The Parties disagree as to whether the computation of the loss, if any, in the scenario
without Measures must take or not take account of past profits earned by the Claimants’

plants before the Disputed Measures. Accordingly, in PO18 the Tribunal provided two
alternative permutations as follows:

The EJM shall compute the Alternative Tariff applied in the scenario without
Measures

i. Alternative 1: Taking into account past profits;
ii, Alternative 2: Not taking into account past profits.1°°°

The New Regime essentially envisages that the 7.398% profitability is calculated for
the lifetime of the plants taking into account past earnings made in excess of that target.
The Tribunal is of the view that the inclusion of past profits in the computation would be
tantamount to repealing or clawing back earnings which were legitimately made under
the previous regime. Thus, it considers that, for the purposes of quantifying the
Alternative Claim, it would not be admissible to deduct past profits when calculating an
investor's remuneration going forward.

This conclusion is consistent with the Tribunal’s prior finding on the Primary Claim that
as long as RD 661/2007 was in force (and the economic conditions allowed it), efficient
installations could outperform the reasonable return target and were entitled to keep
the profits which the system allowed them to make.'°°' The contrary solution would
imply that the State can change legislation with retroactive effect, which would be
contrary to the principle of non-retroactivity. In this respect, the Tribunal cannot follow
Spain when it argues that the Disputed Measures are not retroactive, as “they do not
seek to recover any subsidies received before the date the legislation comes into effect.
Rather, they simply seek to change the regime in a forward looking way”. Although
it is true that payments already received need not be returned under the New Regime,
in practice this particular aspect of the New Regime entails that payments under RD
661/2007 are deducted from future remuneration and treated as offsets to the total
amount that investors will be allowed to earn going forward. The Tribunal thus has no
hesitation to find that it is correct not to take past profits into account when calculating
an investor’s remuneration going forward.1°%°

PO18, para. 12(i).

See supra para. 619.

Rejoinder, para. 1044.

The Tribunal finds confirmation in the decisions in RREEF, according to which the claw
back would deprive investors of acquired rights in violation of the non-retroactivity
principle (see RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Limited and RREEF Pan-European
Infrastructure Two Lux S.a rl. v. Kingdom of Spain, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/30,

253

814.

815.

816.

The experts concur on the calculation of the Alternative Tariff taking into account past
profits (which option, however, the Tribunal has now discarded), but disagree on the
calculation of the Alternative Tariff ignoring past profits.

On this latter aspect, the Tribunal favors Econ One’s method, as it correctly ignores
only excess profitability (i.e., profitability above 7% post tax). By contrast, Brattle
disregards any past revenue. In the Tribunal’s view, the latter approach is incorrect, as
under a regime guaranteeing a 7% return (which is what the Claimants should have
legitimately expected and which is thus to be assumed in the scenario without
Measures), the Claimants would have made such return and there is no good reason
not to take that 7% return into account to establish the IRR over the lifetime of the plant.
Only the profits above 7%, which represent the extra gains of efficient plants and
operators, must not be considered to compute the IRR over the operational life of the
plant. Doing otherwise would be equivalent to taking these efficiency gains away from
the Claimants, a claw-back that the Tribunal has deemed inadmissible for the reasons

explained above.

The Tribunal is further convinced that Econ One’s approach is also more reasonable in
a number of other respects. First, as Spain’s expert does, it is sound to assume that in
the first years of operation the plants recovered a portion of their initial investment
amount. In other words, it is reasonable to assume that an installation from 2008 which
started operating in 2009 should have recovered 5/30 of the initial investment amount
by the entry into force of the New Regime and, consequently, the remaining investment
to be recovered as of 2014 is 83.3% of the initial investment cost base. By contrast, the
Tribunal sees no good reason to assume a new plant with over 100% of the initial
investment cost base yet to be recovered as of 2014, as Brattle does. Furthermore,
Econ One does not add inflation to the asset base, which Brattle does thereby unduly
inflating the harm.1°%4

RREEF and noted that “[t]o claw back those profits on the basis of a subsequent
judgment that they were ‘excessive’ was inconsistent with the principle of stability in
Article 10.1 of the ECT and has not been shown to have been necessary to resolve the
tariff deficit problem, which would have been solved in any event by the Disputed
Measures without much further delay and without the element of claw-back of
payments earlier lawfully made’).

For these reasons, the Tribunal selects the input “Ignoring Past Profits (Econ One)” in

parameter 3 of the EJM.

x. Initial Investment Costs

The issue of the greenfield costs which was already evoked in the context of the cost
base, also plays a role to establish the Claimants’ initial investment for purposes of the
experts’ IRR calculation. In this respect, the Joint Memorandum provides the following
explanation, it being noted that these paragraphs are agreed between the experts:

X. Interpreting the IRRs

113. As indicated above, the results file displays Claimant IRRs for each
combination of inputs, assuming that the Measures are in place. Of the six
possible inputs in PO18, paragraphs 12 (f)-12 (i), only three affect the IRR
calculation:

* Initial Investment Amount
+ Revision of RRR
* Interest Tax Shield

114. Initial Investment Amount: There are four options for the initial

investment amount for IRR calculations. The four input options are

summarized by investor group in Table 2, which are then subdivided into

Claimant entities. As indicated in that table, the costs will be the same for all

four inputs for several of the Claimant entities. The Claimant entities with

differences are explained in detail in Section V.B above.1°°5
The Tribunal considers that greenfield investment costs are the costs borne at the
beginning of a project's lifecycle that are necessary to bring a plant into operation. This
includes the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) costs associated with
the photovoltaic modules and the civil works required to put them in place, the cost to
connect the facility to the electricity grid, initial inventory required for normal operation,
permitting and licensing fees. The Tribunal agrees with Spain that other costs that may
be borne by investors are not strictly necessary for the operation of the plant. These
include costs associated with debt financing, acquisition premiums paid to developers
or for brownfield assets (investments that are either nearly or completely developed
and operational).

Developer premiums fall in the second category. They are not strictly speaking
greenfield costs in the sense that they are not required to bring a plant into operation.
The Tribunal notes that Brattle does not dispute that brownfield costs should not be

included in the calculation of the Claimants’ IRRs for the purposes of considering
whether they obtain returns in accordance with the reasonable profitability principle
under the 1997 Electricity Law.1°

However, Brattle argues that:

Removing the entire acquisition price is inappropriate [...]. At least part of

such acquisition prices will have compensated the original developer for the

costs that it incurred in designing a project and compiling the necessary

permits. The available accounting data do not distinguish what part of the

price relates to direct cost recovery, and what part represents a “premium”

in the sense of a profit for the original developer. We continue to include the

greenfield acquisition prices in our estimates of greenfield construction

costs.'°37
The Tribunal is unconvinced that, lacking clear evidence shedding light on the
composition of the acquisition prices, it would be appropriate to include the developer
premiums in the costs. Hence, it considers that on balance it should exclude developer

premiums from the calculation of the IRR.

This being so, the experts disagree on the figures of greenfield costs in the option
“Excluding developer premiums”. As summarized in table 2 of the EJM, Brattle values
the total costs excluding developer premiums at EUR 1,802.8 million, whereas Econ
One’s figure is EUR 1,772.2 million.'°°* There is thus a difference between the experts’
numbers of EUR 30.6 million, which is due to the fact that Brattle characterizes the cost
items included in this amount as costs other than developer premiums when Econ One
regards them as developer premiums. The disagreement between the experts relates
to seven Claimants, the disagreement being relatively minor for five of them.1°9

The Tribunal has reviewed the experts’ calculations and in particular sections IV.B.3
(‘Excluding ‘Developer Premiums’ (Brattle)”) and IV.B.4 (“Excluding ‘Developer
Premiums’ (Econ One)”) of the Joint Memorandum and the passages of the expert
reports referred to therein. It reaches the conclusion that Econ One's calculations of

BQR II, para. 99 (“A final measurement issue is highlighted by Econ One's exclusion
of any ‘development premiums’ from its estimates of greenfield costs. We agree with
Econ One that the Original Regulatory Regime return target relates to greenfield
investment, as opposed to brownfield investment, which involves purchases of plants
already in operation or nearing the end of construction. We therefore ignore the
brownfield acquisition premiums paid by many of the PV Investors from our own
estimates of greenfield costs”, internal footnotes omitted).

the greenfield costs excluding developer premiums better comport with the notion of
greenfield costs that the Tribunal has retained, i.e. those costs necessary to bring the
plant into operation (see supra at 819). It is also better in line with the position taken
above according to which, lacking clear evidence that an item forms part of greenfield
costs as defined earlier, that item should not be included in such costs and thus
deducted as developer premiums. For these reasons, the Tribunal selects the input
“Exclude ‘Developer Premiums’ (Econ One)” in parameter 5 of the EJM.

xi. Interest
(a) The Parties’ position

The Claimants note that the treatment of interest was not a parameter identified in
PO18 as something that should be the subject of different parameters in the EJM. The
Claimants explain that during the course of the preparation of the EJM, Econ One took
the view that, although it agrees that interest should be calculated on lost historic cash
flows, it disagreed that the EJM should allow the Tribunal to make that calculation.
Thus, the Tribunal will need to determine whether it wishes to take advantage of the
EJM for purposes of calculating interest on lost historic cash flows, which the Claimants
believe it should. 1°

With regard to pre-award interest, the Claimants submit that interest must be applied
to both the lost “historical” cash flows (in the period from 2011 to June 2014) and the
lost “future” cash flows (from June 2014).1°4' Brattle takes the view that the 10-year
Spanish bond rate is the appropriate rate for pre-award interest.

With regard to post-award interest, the Claimants contend that the rate should be higher
than the pre-award interest rate, in order to reflect the higher risks associated with a
debt that is overdue and to encourage payment of the award by Spain in priority to
other indebtedness. 1°42

With regard to the EJM, the Claimants explain that the model does not compute interest
beyond the valuation date of June 2014. The disagreement between Brattle and Econ
One as to the implementation of interest in the EJM is therefore limited to the
computation of interest on the lost “historical” cash flows, in the period from 2011 to

June 2014.13 The Claimants submit that the “Include Interest in Past Damages” option
(supported by Brattle) in the EJM, applying interest at the 10-year Spanish bond rate
to all harm suffered by the Claimants, should be preferred to Econ One's option of
“Exclude Interest From Past Damages”, which does not calculate interest on lost
“historical” cash flows in the EJM. 14

The Respondent argues that PO18 did not instruct the experts to include interest
calculations in the EJM, which is the reason why Econ One did not include interest in
the EJM.1°45 For Spain, this approach is in accordance with “the purpose of PO12 and
PO18 [which] is to assist the Tribunal in determining liability, not damages”.1° That
apart, Spain contends that calculation of interest up to June 2014 is unhelpful at this
stage because the date of the Award is not known.1%7

Subject to the preceding argument, Spain and Econ One submit that the appropriate
pre-award interest rate is the six-month EURIBOR as it is a short-term risk-free rate
without spread.'°48 Spain objects to the choice of interest rates proposed by Brattle and
the Claimants. It submits that the 10-year Spanish bond rate put forward by Brattle is
inappropriate as it is higher than the risk free rate and rather than “compensat[ing] the
Claimants for the passage of time”, it would effectively serve to “discipline or otherwise
incentivize [S]tates towards one policy approach or another”. Moreover, there is no
rationale that justifies the 2% spread above LIBOR advanced by the Claimants as such
a spread would only be applicable in order to protect a lender against the risk of default
of the borrower.149

Finally, Spain opposes the Claimants’ claim for a higher rate of interest. For Spain, a
higher post-award rate of interest has a punitive character, which is incompatible with
the compensatory nature of damages under international law. Further, a higher rate
also presumes, without any legitimate basis, that Spain will not discharge its obligation
to promptly pay the damages awarded by the Tribunal. Instead, Spain submits that the

Tribunal should apply a risk-free rate for post award like for pre-award interest, as this
has been considered appropriate by other international tribunals.105°

(b) Discussion

The determination of interest has two aspects in this case. First, interest on so-called
lost “historical” cash flows must be determined, i.e. cash flows from 2011 to June 2014
must be carried forward from the date they were earned until the valuation date. This
question is related to one of the inputs in the EJM (parameter 6). Second, from the
valuation date on, any amount due must bear interest until payment in full.

In this section, the Tribunal addresses the first question, i.e. the calculation of interest
on lost historical cash flows. The second question is addressed in section VI.B.4.c.xiii
below, which deals with interest on the amounts awarded.

As explained in the Joint Memorandum, “[bJoth experts agree that the historical cash
flows must be rolled forward with interest to achieve full compensation”.1°°' However,
Brattle and Econ One are in disagreement on the “prejudgment” interest rate.
Having reviewed the experts’ positions, the Tribunal considers it is justified to apply the
Spanish 10-year borrowing rates to bring the lost historical cash flows forward to the
valuation date. It reaches this conclusion because, by not allowing Claimants to earn
the guaranteed return for a number of years, Spain has exposed the Claimants to risks
that are identical to those assumed by investors who have lent money to Spain, and
the government bond rate reflects the remuneration paid to market participants for
bearing those risks. Furthermore, Spain now bases the remuneration under the New
Regime on Spanish 10-year bond yields.

Thus, the Tribunal will resort to Brattle’s implementation of the interest input, i.e. to the
option “Include Interest in Past Damages” in parameter 6 of the EJM, thereby letting
interest accrue at the 10-year Spanish bond rate to update lost past cash flows to June
2014.

xii. Overall Results of Loss Computation
(a) The Claimants’ position

The Claimants make the following conclusive remarks on the IRRs that result from the
implementation of the EJM in accordance with the parameters set out in PO18. They
submit that following the Tribunal’s directions in PO18 and its letter of 24 September
2018, the EJM contains the IRR calculation for the Claimants’ PV plants (but not for the
Claimant entities themselves) in the scenario with Measures. 1055

They recall that the IRR calculation (both in the But For and Actual scenario) in the EJM
is affected by three out of the six inputs in PO18: (a) the cost base; (b) whether the
calculation considers future revisions of the reasonable rate of return; and (c) whether
the interest tax shield is taken into account in the computation of the effective tax rate.
Given the multiple disagreements between the Parties’ experts regarding these
parameters, there are “32 possible sets of Claimant IRRs with the Measures in
place”.1°54 The Claimants are of the view that given the multitude of potential IRRs for
each Claimant, the IRR results set out in the EJM “will be of little value to the Tribunal

unless they are interpreted in the context of the assumptions that underlie them”. 1055

In that regard, the Claimants underline that Spain has admitted that the New Regime
offered a lower rate of return than the Original Regime. This implies that an IRR
calculation for the New Regime’s standard installations in the Actual scenario that
results in returns above 7% after tax by definition cannot be using the same
assumptions as those used by Spain when setting the RD 661/2007 tariffs.

With that in mind, the Claimants invite the Tribunal to compare the IRR results under
Brattle’s preferred methodology (not including the tax shield in the effective tax rate
calculation), which are shown in Table 5 from the Joint Memorandum, with those under
Econ One’s preferred methodology (including the tax shield in the effective tax rate
calculation), which are in Table 6 from the Joint Memorandum.1°° The Claimants
underscore that Brattle’s results show that under the New Regime all of the standard
installations receive returns of 6.1% to 6.2% post-tax, which is substantially less than
the 7% post-tax return that the Tribunal determined and Spain argued was on offer

under the Original Regime.'°5’ By comparison, using Econ One’s approach, standard
installations would achieve around 7% post-tax IRRs, which is the same as the target
return alleged to be offered under RD 661/2007. According to the Claimants, this is
inconsistent with the fact that the New Regime reduced returns. °°

Finally, the Claimants argue that Spain’s focus on the IRRs is consistent with Econ
One’s position that those investors whose plants’ returns exceed 7% are not entitled to
damages. This approach is, in the Claimants’ view, wrong, because it eliminates
damages for those investors whose plants were more efficient than the standard
(marginal) plant and rewards those investors whose plants suffered from

inefficiencies. 1°°

that he achieves 7.7 IRR because his initial investment costs are lower.

Then the disputed measures reduce his IRR to 7.2. You simply -- you say

he's above 7, he's fine. We don't deal with him anymore. You don't consider

that he's entitled to damages for the difference between 7.7 and 7.2.

DR FLORES: That is correct. We did not calculate damages for that.

THE PRESIDENT: And the situation is different for Brattle, where Brattle
considers that this drop from 7.7 to 7.2 entitles that claimant to
damages. Is that right?

MR LAPUERTA: Yes.

841. In conclusion, applying Brattle’s preferred damages permutations under the EJM, the
Claimants contend that the 14 Claimant groups are entitled to an aggregate amount of

Where certain Claimant entities do not achieve at least 7%, Spain contends that this
underperformance was not the result of the Disputed Measures, but rather attributable
to “private decisions made by those Claimants”.1°

The Respondent underscores that the Claimants attempt to downplay the importance
of their IRRs as they are fatal to their case.' It further contends that Brattle’s IRRs
are “simply not the Claimants’ IRRs”.'°° This is because, as Spain has already
explained, Brattle’s IRRs (i) assume that the Claimants’ plants paid and will pay a 17%
tax rate, which is incorrect,’ and (ii) are based on “Brattle’s calculation of the
Claimants’ greenfield costs which is not supported by the evidence on the record and
incorrectly includes developers’ premiums”.'°©”

(c) Discussion

In sum, the Tribunal opts for the following parameters in the EJM to determine the IRRs

in the scenario with Measures and the harm resulting from the difference between the

two scenarios (with and without Measures):

Parameter 1 (Interest Tax Shield): “Include Interest Tax Shield (Econ One)”

Parameter 2 (Cost base): “Standard Installation — Size Reclassified” [Brattle]

Parameter 3 (Past Profits): Ignoring Past Profits [Brattle], however for the

methodology/calculations: “Ignoring Past Profits (Econ One)”

Parameter 4 (Revision of RRR): “Assume Revision of Returns Occur”

[agreed]

Parameter 5 (Initial Investment for IRR Calculation): “Exclude ‘Developer

Premiums’ (Econ One)”

Parameter 6 (Interest): “Include Interest in Past Damages” [Brattle]

Selecting these parameters yields, in turn, the following results:

As can be seen from the chart, for 10 out of 19 Claimant entities within the list agreed

between the experts (see supra at VI.B.4.c.v), the IRR with the Disputed Measures in

place is below 7%. By contrast, for the remaining 9 Claimant entities the IRR with the

Disputed Measures in place is in excess of 7%. For the reasons explained supra at

648, by reducing the reasonable rate of return below 7%, Spain acted unreasonably
and disproportionately and hence violated FET. Therefore, the Claimant entities whose
IRR with the Disputed Measures are lower than 7% are entitled to compensation and
the harm calculated by the experts in the EJM represents the measure of compensation
for each Claimant entity.

More specifically, the following Claimant entities are entitled to receive the following
amount as a result of the Respondent's breach:

With respect to some of these investors (Ceconat, DIF/Ampere, NIBC and KGAL), the
Respondent has argued that “this underperformance was not a result of the Disputed
Measures, but rather directly attributable to private decisions made by those
Claimants”.1°°° The Tribunal is not convinced by the Respondent's arguments and
considers them insufficiently substantiated. In particular, it notes that the Respondent
relies on certain criticism voiced by Econ One in relation to the IRRs of these

investors.'°”° It is true that in its reports and presentations, Econ One discusses the

possibility that high costs depressed these IRRs, either through inefficiency or related
party transactions. However, Econ One does not rely on direct evidence, let alone
conclusive one, showing that costs were inflated. It merely suggests that inflation
“could” or “may” have occurred based on the involvement of related parties in the
construction or operation and maintenance of the plants.

In addition to the lack of proof, the Tribunal finds that costs are already correctly
factored in the EJM, and it is unconvinced that they should gain relevance again here
in the manner advocated by Spain and Econ One. Finally, the fact that the two Claimant
entities belonging to the KGAL group “on average” are making an IRR higher than
7%'°"' is irrelevant for present purposes, as the Tribunal must consider the harm “by
Claimant entity” and not on average across various Claimants entities. Accordingly, the
entity belonging to the KGAL group (Infraclass Energie 4 GmbH & Co KG), whose IRR
is below 7% (in this case, 5%), is entitled to compensation.

Interest on Amounts Due’?

 

xl

Having concluded that the Claimant entities listed above are entitled to recover
damages as a consequence of Spain’s breach of the ECT, the Tribunal now deals with
interest on the amounts due.

Article 26(8) of the ECT provides that “the awards of arbitration [...] may include an
award of interest [...]’. It is well-established that interest forms an integral part of any
award of compensation, the aim of which is to achieve full reparation and to re-establish
the situation which would have existed if the illegal acts had not been committed. As
mentioned above, the full reparation principle is not disputed between the Parties.
Tribunals have repeatedly held that, in order to achieve full reparation, it is necessary
that an award of damages bear interest.'°7

With regard to interest running from the valuation date to payment in full, the Tribunal
considers that interest must accrue at the same rate and upon the same terms both
before and after the award. This is the consequence of the fact that the Respondent's

obligation to pay damages does not arise on the date of the award but rather at the
time when the internationally wrongful act caused harm.°’4 Additionally, as noted in
Micula, there is in any event no basis to distinguish between pre- and post-award
interest as the purpose of both is to compensate for the deprivation of funds.1°75

In the Tribunal’s view, the interest should be compounded in line with generally
accepted financial practice. If the Claimants had not been deprived of the funds to which
they were entitled, they could have invested them and would have earned compound
interest. Similarly, if as a result of the deprivation, they had to borrow money, they would
also have paid compound interest. Case law confirms this choice.1°’6

In conclusion, interest on any amount awarded shall accrue at the Spanish 10-year
bond rate, compounded semi-annually, from the valuation date until payment in full.

TAX GROSS-UP

The Claimants’ position

The Claimants make a tax gross-up claim in accordance with the full reparation
principle under international law. They contend that any amount awarded would be
subject to corporate taxes in their home jurisdictions (The Netherlands, Luxembourg,
and Germany), whereas dividend distributions made in the ordinary course would not

ARB/06/4, Award, 15 April 2016, Exh. RLA-197, paras. 436-438.

“As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal does not see why the cost of the deprivation of
money (which interest compensates) should be different before and after the Award,
and neither Party has convinced it otherwise. Both are awarded to compensate a party
for the deprivation of the use of its funds. The Tribunal will thus award pre- and post-
award interest at the same rate” (See Joan Micula, Viorel Micula and others v. The

have been subject to taxation.1°’” They have presented memoranda from tax lawyers
confirming the tax treatment of an award in each of those jurisdictions.'°”8

The Claimants further explain that the EJM does not include their tax gross-up claim
given that the precise amount of the tax gross-up will only be ascertainable after the
Tribunal has determined the amount owing to the Claimants in its award. In the
circumstances, the Claimants propose that, “[t]he grossed-up sum can be calculated
and agreed by the Parties’ experts in accordance with the Tribunal’s decision on other
aspects of quantum”.'°’9 They contend that “[t]hereafter, there would be a number of
potential options pursuant to which the Tribunal may address the tax gross-up claim”,
including:

(a) award the tax gross-up in the amount computed by the experts on the

condition that the appropriate entity provides a written undertaking that any

amount not paid over to the relevant tax office is returned to Spain (i.e. an
undertaking against double recovery);

(b) order for the full amount of the tax gross-up to be placed into an escrow
account, pending a final determination from the appropriate tax authority,
following which the relevant amount would be paid over and any remaining
funds returned to Spain; and

(c) order that Spain hold the Claimants harmless from any amount of tax
due, in which case no funds would pass until the tax authorities reach a
decision.

The Respondent’s position

The Respondent submits that the Claimants’ request for a tax gross-up should be
denied for the following reasons:1°"

a. First, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to consider a tax gross-up claim
pursuant to Article 21 of the ECT, which carves out taxation matters;

b. Second, Spain cannot be held responsible for taxation by other States;

1082

1083

c. Third, any award would be exempted from taxation in the States of each
of the Claimants’ nationalities because it would be considered a dividend
payment; and

d. Fourth, the claim is uncertain and speculative and has been previously
rejected by numerous tribunals on this ground. In any event, the Claimants
have not proven their tax gross up claim, as the Tribunal has decided to
treat the various memoranda from tax advisors submitted by the Claimants
as party submissions rather than evidence.'°°2

Discussion

The Tribunal has reviewed the Parties’ submissions on the tax gross-up claim, including
the tax law memoranda (Exhs. C-702 to C-704) which, in accordance with its letter of

6 December 2017, it had decided to treat as party submissions on law.

As an initial matter, it disagrees with the Respondent that it lacks jurisdiction to consider
the tax gross-up claim pursuant to Article 21 of the ECT, which carves out taxation
matters. In the Tribunal’s view, Article 21 is concerned with whether or not the Tribunal
has jurisdiction over a dispute where the impugned measures are taxation measures.
By contrast, as a tax gross-up claim on amounts awarded concerns the computation of
damages, it is unrelated to the nature of the measures complained of.

While it thus has jurisdiction over the Claimants’ tax gross up claim, the Tribunal does
not regard it as well-founded. In line with other arbitral tribunals which have dismissed
similar claims, the Tribunal is of the view that such tax gross up would be speculative
and uncertain.'°8° So for instance, the speculative nature of the claim was stressed in
Servier v. Poland,

PO12 R-PHB2, para. 426(d), discussing the Tribunal’s letter to the Parties dated 6

December 2017.

See, e.g., Venezuela Holdings et al v. Venezuela, |CSID Case No. ARB/07/27, Award,
9 October 2014, paras. 386-388, Exh. CL-188 (“this claim is speculative and
uncertain”); Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Europe v. Venezuela, Decision on
Liability and the Principles of Quantum, 30 December 2016, paras. 904-905, Exh. RL-
199 (“such request is speculative and unfounded; the Tribunal therefore sees no basis
for ordering an indemnification against foreign taxation liabilities as requested by
Claimant. Consequently, Claimant's claim that Respondent be ordered to indemnify
Claimant in respect of any double taxation liabilities that would arise in France or
elsewhere that would not have arisen but for Venezuela's adverse measures is
denied”).

1089

Although the Tribunal has considered the possible tax ramifications of this

Award, it can find no reason to speculate on the appropriateness, one way

or another, of any proposed “gross-up” to take into account potential tax

liability, whether in Poland or in France. The ultimate tax treatment of an

award representing the “real value” of an investment must be addressed by

the fiscal authorities in the investor's home jurisdiction as well as the host

state.10%
Furthermore, the Tribunal finds confirmation in its conclusion that such a tax gross-up
would be speculative in the Claimants’ enumeration at para. 205 of the PO12 C-PHB2
of the “potential options pursuant to which the Tribunal may address the tax gross-up
claim” (quoted supra at para. 857). It notes that at least two of them are subject to a
possible determination by the competent tax authorities.1°°5 This, in the Tribunal’s view,

corroborates the uncertainty that surrounds the Claimants’ tax gross-up claim.

Moreover, the Tribunal is unconvinced that a tax gross-up would meet the requirement
of causation of the loss. As held by the tribunal in Rusoro v. Venezuela, “[a]ny tax
liability arising under [the home State's] tax laws (or from any other fiscal regime, other
than the [respondent State]), does not qualify as consequential loss arising from [the
respondent's] breach of the Treaty and does not engage [the respondent's] liability”.1°°

Finally, in the Tribunal’s view, it is significant that no investment treaty tribunal, including
ICSID tribunals who have found Spain liable in respect of the measures at issue here
(see, e.g., Eiser,'°” Masdar,'°°8 and Antin'°®°), appears to have upheld similar claims.

For these reasons, the Tribunal dismisses the tax gross-up claim.

THE CLAIMANTS’ POSITION

The Claimants request that the costs they have incurred in the liability and quantum
phase be borne entirely by the Respondent.'°°° The total costs incurred by the
Claimants (as on 14 June 2019) is GBP 11,387,747.75.10%

According to the Claimants, in the event the Tribunal decides in their favor and
dismisses the various defenses advanced by Spain, the Claimants should be entitled
to recover their entire costs on a full indemnity basis pursuant to the “loser pays”
principle enshrined in Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules.'°? The Claimants submit
that an award on costs on this basis is necessary to reinstate them in the position they
would have been in but for Spain’s violations of the ECT.

The Claimants further argue that Spain should bear all costs because Spain has
unnecessarily delayed the arbitration and increased the costs of the proceedings by
making meritless applications, claims and objections. In particular, Spain aggravated
the dispute by introducing the New Measures after the Claimants had filed its original
SoC. This necessitated “a wholesale overhaul of [the] entire claim’, as admitted by
Spain, in order to include submissions and evidence on the New Measures, which
significantly increased the complexity of the case and by extension, the Claimants’
costs.'°°3 Moreover, the Claimants contend that Spain has adopted multiple
inconsistent positions throughout these proceedings. For example, during the PO12
phase, Spain “performed a volte face [and] abandoned its previous assertion that [...]
the reasonable profitability calculated by Spain at the time the Claimants’ plants were
built was based on a marginal plant [...] These inconsistencies unnecessarily increased
costs as the Claimants were required to litigate issues that previously had been agreed
between the parties”.1°%4

Further, Spain’s conduct in relation to document production also significantly increased
the costs of these proceedings. The Claimants note that although they disclosed over
several thousands of documents in this proceeding, Spain raised repeated and
baseless complaints against the Claimants’ production, the resolution of which

generated multiple rounds of correspondence and even required a telephone hearing,
on Spain’s insistence. Moreover, even though the Tribunal rejected Spain’s complaints,
the latter persisted making baseless arguments once again in its PO12 Counter-
Memorial. In addition, Spain failed to disclose a single document since PO12. The only
documents that Spain “was forced to disclose after years of misrepresentation and
dilatory tactics” were the Greentech Documents. The Claimants submit that Spain was
under an obligation to disclose these documents from October 2017, especially after
the Claimants had identified the failure to produce these documents and the Tribunal
ordered their disclosure on 29 October 2018. Yet, Spain only disclosed the documents
on 3 May 2019 after another order from the Tribunal. 1095

Finally, Spain has repeatedly tried to re-litigate its intra-EU objection, which must have

cost consequences. 10%

The Claimants further oppose the allegations made by the Respondent in support of its
request that the Claimants should bear the entire costs of the proceeding. They also
object to certain categories of costs claimed by Spain on the ground that these do not
fall within recoverable costs identified in Article 40(2)(f) of the UNCITRAL Rules
because they have not been actually “incurred”, such as (i) EUR 577,460.57 with
respect to yet unbilled Econ One fees;'°” and (ii) EUR 325,993.80 of legal fees and
EUR 61,189.70 of expert fees that are alleged pending settlement. 109°

In the circumstances, the Claimants request “that the Tribunal renders an award
pursuant to Article 40(1) and (2) of the UNCITRAL Rules: [...] ordering that Spain bear
all of the Claimants’ costs of the arbitration [...] [and] [...] interest thereon at such

reasonable commercial rate as the Tribunal thinks appropriate, compounded

325,993.80 was included in respect of legal fees which had been incurred since the
previous invoice but which were not later invoiced to Spain due to contractual budget
limitations and therefore this should be removed from the calculations” and that “[a]
total of EUR 574,181.30 was recorded as having been paid in respect of expert
professional fees to Mac Group & Altran and a further EUR 61,189.70 was included in
respect of fees which had been incurred but which had not been invoiced to Spain. This
should be replaced by the total of EUR 629,161.00 to reflect amounts which were
definitively invoiced to Spain by Mac Group & Altran during the Merits phase”.

monthly”.1°°° The Claimants also request that costs “be allocated per Claimant group
in accordance with [the] percentages” set out in Section 4.4 of the Claimants’ PO12
Costs Submission dated 14 June 2019 “[s]hould the Tribunal grant the Claimants’
request that Spain bear all of the Claimants’ costs of the arbitration”.11°°

THE RESPONDENT’S POSITION

The Respondent seeks an award of costs, pursuant to Article 42(1) of the UNICTRAL
Rules, on the grounds that the Claimants’ claims are without merit and should be
dismissed entirely.1'' It claims costs in the amount of EUR 6,075,665.52.112

Spain submits that it introduced regulations in the exercise of its legitimate right to
regulate the electricity sector, that these regulations were foreseeable and in conformity
with the legal principles of sustainability and reasonable profitability. Therefore,
according to the Respondent, the Claimants commenced the present arbitration “on the
basis of a completely speculative claim and on unfounded legal grounds”.113 A
concrete example of the Claimants’ conduct increasing the costs incurred by Spain is
their assertion that Spain breached its obligation to provide full protection and security
to their investments. The Claimants have devoted to this claim no more than four
paragraphs in the ASoC and five paragraphs in the Reply and did not address it ina
substantial way during the Liability Hearing. Nevertheless, Spain had to devote
considerable time and resources in defending such an unfounded claim.1%

In the same vein, the Respondent calls on the Tribunal to consider the conduct of the
Parties when allocating costs. It argues that the Claimants’ procedural behavior has led
to significant delays and costs. For example, the Claimants’ misconduct was evident
during the document production phase, where the Claimants engaged in a fishing
expedition, requesting 79 categories of documents, all of which were largely irrelevant.
Moreover, the Claimants “ambushed the proceedings at the eleventh hour with an

Schedule 1 of the PO12 C-Cost Submission dated 14 June 2019, setting out the various
categories of costs incurred by them since the commencement of the arbitration
proceedings, but excluding the costs associated with the Jurisdictional Phase, in
Schedule 1 of their PO12 Cost Submission.

unjustified application” to include numerous new documents into the record. As the
Claimants introduced these documents into the record only days prior to the Liability
Hearing, the Respondent was not afforded an opportunity to “thoughtfully consider or
analyze such documents or to rebut the documents with evidence”.""°5 The Respondent
also criticizes the Claimants’ decision to aggregate a large number of claims in the
same arbitration. It finds that this concentration led to a significant increase in the costs
of the quantum phase, as it was necessary to analyze the loss of each of the 26
Claimants allegedly arising out of the Disputed Measures, which increased the legal
fees and expert costs.11°°

Moreover, the Respondent contends that the Claimants “unreasonably and
unnecessarily, [sought] to repeatedly push for Spain to disclose to them the so-called
Greentech Documents”, even though these documents were “utterly irrelevant to the
resolution of this dispute”. The Claimants’ refusal to accept this fact caused many
unnecessary procedural steps and added costs which should be paid by the
Claimants. 11°”

Thus, Spain concludes that while it has acted in good faith throughout this arbitration,
it continues to be met by ambushes, inappropriate and costly distractions and a litany
of procedural abuses by the Claimants. Spain also oppose the arguments in support of
the Claimants’ request that Spain should bear the entire costs of the proceeding.

Spain further objects to the amount of costs sought by the Claimants as being
unreasonable, and in some cases insufficiently described. For example, the legal fees
claimed by the Claimants are twice as high as the Respondent’s,’'° when counsel on
both sides worked in much the same way.''°° Similarly, the Respondent objects to the
expert fees charged by the Brattle Group in the quantum phase as being unreasonable
and double the expert fees and costs claimed by Spain for the same period.

In the circumstances, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to order the Claimants to
bear the costs of all phases of the arbitration which remain subject to the Tribunal’s

Discussion
The costs of the arbitration pursuant to Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules
Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides:

The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in the final award and,
if it deems appropriate, in another decision.

Article 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules specifies the categories of expenses that qualify
as “costs of arbitration” in the following terms:

The term “costs” includes only:

(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each
arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with
article 41;

(b) The reasonable travel and other expenses incurred by the
arbitrators;

(c) The reasonable costs of expert advice and of other assistance
required by the arbitral tribunal;

(d) The reasonable travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent
such expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;

(e) The legal and other costs incurred by the parties in relation to the
arbitration to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the
amount of such costs is reasonable;

(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the fees
and expenses of the Secretary-General of the PCA.
Thus, Article 40(2) recognizes broadly three categories of costs and expenses: (i)
“Tribunal Costs” comprising of the fees and expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal and
Secretary; (ii) “Party Costs” comprising of the legal and witness related costs incurred

by the Parties; and (iii) “Administrative Costs” comprising here of the fees and expenses
of the PCA, including with regard to hearing and other expenses.
Cost advances

On the date of issuance of the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction, out of the total
advances deposited by the Parties, a sum of EUR 74.42 remained in the deposit after
deducting the amounts incurred towards the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, the
Secretary and the PCA. This amount was credited to the subsequent phase of the
arbitration.11"1

Thereafter, the Parties advanced the following additional sums with the PCA:

a. On 14 November 2014, the PCA acknowledged receipt of EUR 200,000 from each
Party towards their respective shares of the advance on cost;

b. On 18 and 31 December 2015, the PCA acknowledged receipt of EUR 250,000
from each Party towards their respective shares of the advance on cost;

c. On 15 December 2016, the PCA acknowledged receipt of EUR 200,000 from each
Party towards their respective shares of the advance on cost;

d. On 15 and 21 December 2017, the PCA acknowledged receipt of EUR 205,000
from each Party towards their respective shares of the advance on cost;

e. On1 and 13 December 2018, the PCA acknowledged receipt of EUR 150,000 from
each Party towards their respective shares of the advance on cost; and

f. On 13 December 2019 and 13 January 2020, the PCA acknowledged receipt of
EUR 150,000 from each Party towards their respective shares of the final advances
on cost.

Accordingly, the total advance paid by the Parties, following the Preliminary Award on
Jurisdiction, amounts to EUR 1,155,000 each (EUR 2,310,000 in total).

Tribunal and administrative costs
In the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal determined the total costs of the

proceeding and the allocation of such costs for the Jurisdictional Phase (i.e., from 11

Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction, para. 373.

276

1113

January 2013 until the completion of the jurisdictional phase).1"'* However, the Tribunal
reserved its determination on the allocation of costs incurred in the “Pre-Jurisdictional
Phase” (i.e. from the commencement of the arbitration until the date of Spain’s
jurisdictional objection of 11 January 2013) for subsequent decision.1""5

Therefore, the present decision concerns the costs incurred by the Parties for:

a. The Pre-Jurisdictional Phase (from the commencement of the arbitration until 11
January 2013);

b. The liability and quantum phase (from the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction until
this Final Award).

a. For the Pre-Jurisdictional Phase
As set out in paras. 350-355 of the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction, the costs incurred
towards the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, the Secretary, and the PCA in the Pre-
Jurisdictional Phase are EUR 157,773.36, detailed as follows:

 

Tribunal and Secretary fees EUR 142,606.00
Tribunal and Secretary expenses EUR 7,706.17
Administrative Costs EUR 7,461.19
Total Costs up to 11 January 2013 EUR 157,773.36

b. For the liability and quantum phase

In the liability and quantum phase, the members of the Tribunal collectively spent a
total of 2,548.6 hours as follows: The Hon. Charles N. Brower, 853.6 hours; Judge
Bernardo Sepulveda-Amor, 569 hours; and Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler, 1,126 hours. In the
Terms of Appointment, it was agreed that the Tribunal’s time would be compensated

at an hourly rate of EUR 500 exclusive of VAT, where applicable.

In the same period of time, the Secretary of the Tribunal has spent a total of 966.1
hours. In the Terms of Appointment, it was agreed that the Secretary would be
compensated at an hourly rate of EUR 280 exclusive of VAT, where applicable.

897.

Therefore, while the total fees of the Tribunal and the Secretary (excluding VAT) would
amount to EUR 1,544,808, in order to avoid requesting additional funds, the Tribunal
decided to reduce its fees to EUR 1,473,150.8 for this phase of the arbitration.

The Tribunal and the Secretary have incurred expenses in the amount of EUR 74,729.

While the PCA fees for this phase of the arbitration would have amounted to EUR
86,845, in line with the Tribunal’s decision to reduce its fees as explained supra, the
PCA has charged fees in the amount of EUR 83,149.93 for the administration of the
case and its registry services.

Other costs, relating in particular to the hearings expenses, the IT costs (including the
Opus 2 services), catering, court reporting services, interpretation, as well as the
translation of the Award, amount to EUR 679,044.69.

Thus, the total costs of the proceedings relating to the liability and quantum phase
amount to EUR 2,310,074.42, detailed as follows:

 

Tribunal and Secretary fees EUR 1,473,150.8
Tribunal and Secretary expenses EUR 74,729
Administrative Costs EUR 762,194.62
Total Costs EUR 2,310,074.42

c. Total Tribunal and administrative costs

Hence, the total costs of the proceedings for both the Pre-Jurisdictional Phase and the
liability and quantum phase amount to EUR 2,467,847.78. Considering that it was
necessary for the Tribunal to reduce its fees, there is no unexpended balance to be
returned to the Parties in accordance with Art. 43(5) UNCITRAL Rules. The PCA will
provide the Parties with the case’s statement of account once the 30-day time period
under Arts. 37 to 39 has elapsed.

Allocation of the costs of the arbitration

Article 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules sets out the standard on the basis of which the
Tribunal must determine the allocation of the above categories of costs:

1. The costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the
unsuccessful party or parties. However, the arbitral tribunal may
apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that

278

898.

899.

900.

901.

1114

1115

1116

apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of
the case.

2. The arbitral tribunal shall in the final award or, if it deems appropriate,

in any other award, determine any amount that a party may have to pay

to another party as a result of the decision on allocation of costs.
Thus, the first sentence of Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that the
unsuccessful party shall “in principle”'''* bear all of the costs of the arbitration. Both
Parties accept such “loser pays” principle and have argued their cost requests
accordingly.''® The second sentence of Article 42(1) grants the Tribunal the authority
to apportion costs among the Parties if, in light of the “circumstances of the case”, it
decides that such apportionment is “reasonable”.

The Tribunal starts with the outcome of the arbitration and notes that the outcome of
the liability and quantum phase is not clear-cut. The Claimants brought two claims, the
Primary and the Alternative Claims. The Tribunal found that the Primary Claim was not
well-founded, which entails that Spain is the prevailing Party on such claim.

With regard to the Alternative Claim, approximately half of the Claimant entities within
the list agreed between the experts was able to prove that the IRR with the Disputed
Measures in place was below 7% and was thus considered entitled to compensation.
This part of the Claimants has thus prevailed on the Alternative Claim, although it was
awarded less than what it claimed. In assessing the outcome, it bears noting that these
Claimants would not be made whole had they not resorted to arbitration, which could
not be done without incurring costs whatever the amounts claimed and awarded.

Finally, the remaining Claimants succeeded neither on the Primary nor on the
Alternative Claim. This being so, however, the Tribunal does not accept Spain’s
contention that the Claimants initiated a “groundless arbitration’, based on “a
completely speculative claim and on unfounded legal grounds”.11"® As mentioned
above, the Alternative Claim did in part succeed. As to the Primary Claim, while the

See the English version of the first sentence of Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules,
which provides: “[t]he costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the
unsuccessful party or parties” (emphasis added), while the Spanish version reads: “[I]as
costas del arbitraje seran a cargo de la parte vencida o las partes vencidas”, without
including the equivalent of the words “in principle”.

Tribunal has come to the conclusion that it was not well-founded, it was certainly not

frivolous.

Thus, pondering the relative weight of the outcome on the claims and the various
considerations made above, the Tribunal considers that the cost allocation that most
appropriately reflects the outcome of the proceedings is for the Claimants, on the one
hand, and the Respondent, on the other, to bear the costs of the proceedings in equal
shares and for each side to bear the legal fees and other expenses which it incurred.

In line with Article 42(1) second sentence, the Tribunal has further reviewed the other
circumstances which according to the Parties have aggravated their cost burden and
is of the view that none of those circumstances changes the allocation just set out. In
particular, with respect of document production, it does not consider that the Claimants
made excessive document production requests. As far as the Respondent is
concerned, it is true that the latter was not forthcoming in the production of the
Greentech Documents. However, this incident is not material enough to make a
sensible difference in the overall cost allocation. Similarly, on the intra-EU objection,
while the Tribunal has denied Spain’s request to re-open jurisdiction, such request was
not frivolous, keeping in mind developments such as Achmea and the Member States
Declarations. Finally, the Tribunal finds no fault in the Claimants’ decision to bring the
claims in an aggregate form. It is true that conducting one arbitration on behalf of 14
groups of investors inevitably increases costs compared to proceedings involving only
one claimant. By contrast, it is not true that conducting one arbitration with 14 groups
of claimants is more expensive than the total costs of 14 arbitrations with one claimant
(or claimant group).

Furthermore, the Tribunal has reviewed the amounts of the costs claimed by each
Party. Both sides have incurred costs which are certainly considerable. However, as
both accept, these proceedings were highly complex.''!? Seen in light of such

PO12 C-Costs Submission, para. 19 (“this is a complex ECT arbitration in which there
was substantial briefing by both parties and voluminous amounts of fact and expert
evidence. Moreover, unlike most investment treaty arbitrations, this case involves 14
separate and independent Claimant groups, each with a separate documentary record
and separate fact witnesses”); PO12 R-Costs Submission, para. 12 (“The costs claimed
properly reflect the nature of the dispute and the positions that Spain necessarily had
to adopt given Claimants' amended pleadings and the extent of evidence. In particular,
the Tribunal will recall that Spain had to answer a case brought initially by 88 Claimants
and after the Jurisdiction Phase by 26 Claimants, which required the individual review
of documentation provided by each Claimant’).

1122

complexity and the high stakes involved, the costs incurred by the Parties are not
unreasonable. It is true that the Claimants’ legal costs are considerably higher than
those of the Respondent. The disparity may be due to a number of factors. First, as
explained by the Respondent, “the fees paid to Herbert Smith Freehills were
established pursuant to a public tender dated 14 September 2011 and are considerably
below what is considered to be market value”.1""8 Furthermore, the Claimants produced
seventeen fact witnesses and Spain only two. Thus, the difference between the legal
fees incurred by the Parties is not unjustifiably disproportionate.

Moreover, the Tribunal has reviewed the Claimants’ objections against specific cost
items presented by Spain. The Tribunal could dispense with ruling on these objections,
in light of its decision that each Party bear the costs related to its own representation.
However, for the sake of completeness, it briefly addresses the main objections raised
by the Claimants to the following cost items.

First, in respect of the costs claimed by Spain for the Abogacia del Estado, the Tribunal
is satisfied by Spain’s explanation that “[s]ince the Abogacia del Estado does not have
a system based on hourly rates, its legal fees have been calculated considering one
third of the legal fees of Herbert Smith Freehills, which is proportional to the amount of
resources and time expended by the Abogacia del Estado in these proceedings”."1"°
Second, the Tribunal has taken note of the Claimants’ objection that certain costs
claimed for the Econ One services have not been “incurred” by Spain, because they
have not yet been invoiced and “no undertaking has been provided confirming that
Spain will incur these costs”."17° At the same time, it has also noted the Respondent's
representation that these amounts are “owed under the contract between Spain and
Econ One but ha[ve] not yet been invoiced by Econ One”."'21 The Tribunal has no
reason to doubt this representation and considers that the statement that this amount
“is owed” is substantively equivalent to a representation that “it will be incurred”.1122

Finally, with respect to the allocation of the Claimants’ costs among themselves, the
Tribunal understands from the table set out in Section 4.4 of the Claimants’ PO12 Costs

R-Costs Submission, para.6(iii).

PO12 C-Reply Costs Submission, para. 8.

PO12 R-Costs Submission, para. 11.

The Tribunal is also satisfied of Spain’s explanations in respect of certain figures that
had been included in its previously submitted cost submissions and have been
corrected in its later submissions. See PO12 R-Costs Submission, para. 8.

Submission dated 14 June 2019 that the Claimants may have internal arrangements in
place as to how the arbitrations costs are divided. Accordingly, the Claimants have
requested that “[s]hould the Tribunal grant the Claimants’ request that Spain bear all of
the Claimants’ costs of the arbitration, the Claimants request that these costs be
allocated per Claimant group in accordance with these percentages” (emphasis
added). In light of the Tribunal’s decision (which is not that “Spain bear all of the
Claimants’ costs of the arbitration”), the Tribunal need not address the Claimants’
request that costs be allocated in accordance with the percentages set out in the table.
Furthermore, the Tribunal is not privy to the Claimants’ internal arrangements for the
scenario that only some of them would succeed on (part of) the claims. This being so,
as the Claimants have brought their claims in an aggregate form and in light of the
determination that each side must bear its own costs, the Tribunal considers that it is
appropriate to leave it to the Claimants to make any relevant determination on the
apportionment of costs among themselves in accordance with their internal
arrangements or otherwise.

Concurring and Dissenting Opinion of Charles N. Brower

1. | concur with my esteemed colleagues in finding that Respondent has breached the
Energy Charter Treaty (“ECT”). Where | part company with them, however, is on their
acceptance of Claimants’ Alternative Claim, based on an expected Reasonable Rate of
Return (“RRR”), whereas | see no reason whatsoever to deprive Claimants of their Primary
Claim, assessing their damages according to RD 661/2007, which every one of the eleven
renewable energy awards against Spain issued by other arbitral tribunals to date, arising
out of the same controversy and facts not credibly distinguishable from those of the
present case, has done. The difference in the present case, as will be shown below, would

appear to be possibly as high as approximately €540.9 million.

2. 1am of the view that no tribunal should accept an Alternative Claim over a Primary Claim
without justifiable reasons for dismissing the Primary Claim, and in the present case |
discern no justifiable reason whatsoever for departing from those eleven other tribunals’
acceptance of the Primary Claim in like circumstances. In fact, the interpretation that my
colleagues give to the language of the Old Regulatory Regime (“ORR”), allegedly providing
such reasons, is inconsistent with the line of jurisprudence established by the tribunals
that considered these very same issues before us. Unlike the position taken by my
colleagues at paragraphs 638-639 of the Award, no other Tribunal has found that the RRR
was “a key element of the regime established by RD 661/2007,” or that it served “as the
limit of ECT-compliant regulatory changes,” let alone that “the Claimants are only entitled
to compensation under Article 10(1) of the ECT if they establish that the new regime
violates the guarantee of reasonable rate of return.” In this respect | recall well this
statement in our Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction, also cited at paragraph 521 of the

Award:

The Tribunal considers that it is not bound by previous decisions. At the
same time, in its judgment it must pay due consideration to earlier
decisions of international tribunals. Specifically, it believes that, subject to
compelling contrary grounds, it has a duty to adopt principles established

in a series of consistent cases. \t further believes that, subject always to the
specific text of the ECT, and with due regard to the circumstances of each
particular case, it has a duty to contribute to the harmonious development
of international investment law, with a view to meeting the legitimate
expectations of the community of States and investors towards the
certainty of the rule of law.? (Emphasis added.)

3. Of the now eighteen known awards? involving the same treaty, the same Respondent
State, and the same measures as are at issue in the present arbitration, fifteen have found
for the Claimants.? In all but four of those fifteen cases (all four being factually
distinguishable from the present one)* the tribunals have ruled that Claimants were
entitled to full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act
represented by the displacement of the ORR by RDL 2/2013, RDL 9/2013, Law 24/2013,
RD 413/2014 and the June 2014 Order (the “New Regulatory Regime” or “NRR”). Thus, all

eleven tribunals have issued awards effectively granting the present Claimants’ Primary
Claim. The Award’s rather cursory dismissal of those cases is factually misleading. In
paragraph 554 of the Award, for example, after conceding in paragraph 553 that “/a]
number of tribunals... have upheld claims that in substance were broadly similar to the
Primary Claim in this arbitration,” the Award argues that “[i]n particular, in several cases
. .., the tribunal appears to have been presented with no claim equivalent to the
Alternative Claim,” citing Novenergia and other cases. As demonstrated below, however,
and effectively conceded in that same paragraph 554 of the Award, in every single one of
the eleven cases on which my analysis relies, the Alternative Claim was either (1) pleaded
by the Claimants (in five cases), (2) pleaded by the Respondent as a defense (in four cases,
including the cited Novenergia) or (3) placed before the tribunal by the Claimants’
damages expert (in two cases). Thus, each of the eleven Tribunals involved confronted
and rejected the Alternative Claim, irrespective of whether it was first asserted by the
Claimants, by their experts, or by the Respondent. Despite my colleagues’ valiant efforts,
their stance is clearly incongruent with the statistics, as in seven out of the eleven cases
in which the Primary Claim has prevailed, the Claimants had indeed put before the
Tribunal an alternative calculation of damages based on an RRR, and in the remaining four
the Respondent undeniably had pleaded the Alternative Claim as a defense. The Award’s
distinction in paragraph 554 among “an actual” Alternative Claim pled by Claimants
themselves (group (1)), the Alternative Claim pled as “merely a defense from the
Respondent” (group (2)) and one in the form of “alternative damages calculations from
the [Claimants’] experts” (group (3)) is a classic “distinction without a difference.” The
reality is that each and every one of the tribunals on whose awards | rely, and on which
the Award should have relied in accordance with this Tribunal’s views recorded in
paragraph 2 above, confronted and dealt with the Alternative Claim. Moreover, it is with
some consternation that | note my colleagues do not seem to have made up their mind
as to whether the PV Investors case belongs to group (1) or (3), as at paragraph 665 of the
Award “[flinally, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants have formulated the relief sought

not by reference to the Primary/Alternative Claim, but more generally for compensation

(

as a result of Spain’s alleged breaches,” before venturing to “understand[] that the
request for restitution has been abandoned,” then deciding that its “understanding” is of
no consequence whatsoever as “the Tribunal would in any event not grant such relief in

light of its conclusion that the Primary Claim. .. is ill-founded.”

Below, | address each of the eighteen awards. First, | address in paragraph 5., infra, the
eleven awards that upheld the investors’ entitlement to the projected returns on their
investment on the basis of the regime in place at the time of the investment (Primary
Claim), namely: (i) Eiser, (ii) Novenergia, (iii) Masdar, (iv) Antin, (v) Greentech, (vi) SolES,
(vii) 9REN, (viii) Cube, (ix) OperaFund, (x) Infrared and (xi) Watkins. Second, in paragraph
6., infra, | address the four cases that awarded damages on the basis of the RRR theory
(Alternative Claim): (xii) RREEF, (xiii) NextEra, (xiv) BayWa and (xv) RWE Innogy. Third, in
paragraph 7., infra, | discuss the three cases which dismissed the Claimants’ claims
entirely: (xvi) Charanne, (xvii) solux and (xviii) Statdwerke. Lastly, in paragraph 8., infra, |
take stock of the awards, in light of the present case, and conclude that since like cases

should be treated alike, the Claimants’ Primary Claim rightly should prevail.

Cases in which the Primary Claim has prevailed:

In Eiser, Claimants invested in three concentrated solar plants (“CSP”) beginning in
October 2007. All three plants were registered in the Administrative Register (“RAIPRE”)
on 8 June 2012. Claimants sought restitution of the legal and regulatory regime (RD
661/2007),> or, should restitution not be possible, damages which, pursuant to the
Chorz6w Factory standard,® should be calculated on the basis of the reduction of the fair
market value of their investment as measured by the (then) present value of past and

future cash flows calculated on the basis of the feed-in-tariff (“FiT”) to which they were

° Case Concerning the Factory at Chorzéw (Claim for Indemnity), Jurisdiction, 26 July 1927, PCU Rep Series A, No. 9,

p. 209.

entitled pursuant to RD 661/2007.’ Claimants also developed an Alternative Claim based
on Respondent’s theory of an RRR.® The Tribunal, however, determined the RRR theory
to be “unpersuasive” because “ECT Article 10(1) does not entitle Claimants to a
‘reasonable return’ at any given level, but to fair and equitable treatment.”° While the
Eiser Tribunal did state that “[a]bsent explicit undertakings directly extended to investors
and guaranteeing that States will not change their laws or regulations, investment treaties
do not eliminate States’ right to modify their regulatory regimes to meet evolving

circumstances and public needs,”'°

it concluded that under the circumstances, not
credibly distinguishable from those of PV Investors, the NRR “was profoundly unfair and
inequitable as applied to Claimants’ existing investment, stripping Claimants of virtually
all of the value of their investment.”*" Accordingly, after rejecting the RRR Alternative
Claim, the Tribunal “agree[d] that the Claimants’ approach for determining its [sic]
damages — assessing the reduction of the fair market value of its investment by calculating
the present value of cash flows said to have been lost on account of the disputed measures
— offers an appropriate means to determine the amount of reparation due in the

circumstances of this case,”? and then awarded damages accordingly.

(ii) In Novenergia, Claimant pleaded a number of breaches of Article 10(1) ECT (FET and
stable/equitable/favorable/transparent investment conditions), as well as Article 13 ECT
(expropriation). On damages, Claimant submitted that the Kingdom of Spain must place
the Claimant in the situation in which it would have been had the Respondent not
breached its international obligations by abolishing the ORR, quantified as the difference
between the fair market value of its investment immediately before the expropriation

occurred, using the DCF method, and its fair market value once the NRR had destroyed

the ORR.3 Claimant invested on 13 September 2007 and registered its PV plants with the
RAIPRE by September 2008."4 This chronology describes also the PV Investors’ Primary
Claim. The Respondent contended that the language of RD 54/1997 provided that
investors could only expect to receive an RRR (effectively identical to the Alternative Claim
pleaded by PV Investors and others), and the Tribunal found that contention to be
“unconvincing, since these principles were still generally vague and insufficiently defined
at the time of the Claimant's investment” and thus “they cannot be considered apposite
for the assessment of the reasonability of the Claimant's expectations at the time of the
investment.” The Tribunal then clarified that neither the pre-2013 laws nor the Supreme
Court decisions “could have given the Claimant the expectation that a reasonable rate of

return would be limited to 7%’** and ultimately concluded that:

[...] the Claimant has convincingly established that its initial expectations
were legitimate since there was nothing to contradict the guaranteed FiT
in RD 661/2007 and the surrounding statements made by the Kingdom of
Spain in e.g. "The Sun Can Be All Yours". [...]*”

Accordingly, Novenergia is thoroughly comparable to the present case, particularly as
regards the timing and type of investment, the measures challenged, the treaty provisions
invoked, and the Tribunal’s rejection of the Respondent’s defense identical to PV

Investors’ Alternative Claim.

(iii) In Masdar, Claimant, citing Article 35 of the ILC Articles,+® requested that the Tribunal

order Respondent to restore the RD 661/2007 regime’? or, in the alternative, award

8 ILC Articles, Article 35: “A State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to make
restitution, that is, to re-establish the situation which existed before the wrongful act was committed, provided and
to the extent that restitution:

(a) _is not materially impossible;

(b) does not involve a burden out of all proportion to the benefit deriving from restitution instead of
compensation.”

29 Masdar, para. 555.

damages based on the FiT expected under that regime. Claimant also developed an
Alternative Claim based on an RRR. The Tribunal noted that Article 10(1) of the ECT
protected investors' legitimate expectations that "the legal framework will not be subject
to modification in a manner contrary to specific commitments made to the investor."7° In
particular, the Tribunal found that Spain gave investors "a very specific unilateral offer,"**
concretized vis-a-vis the RAIPRE registrations, that the qualifying installations would
receive the RD 661/2007 FiT, as Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007 constituted a stabilisation
commitment.” The implication in paragraph 554 of the present Award that the aforesaid
result was due “to the investors [having] received specific individual confirmations from
the State that their plants would receive the FiT payments across their life span” is
inaccurate. As highlighted in two other recent awards, the letters obtained by the Masdar
investors “simply confirmed what was already in RD 661/2007 and were issued after not
before the claimant in that case made its investment,”?? and the Masdar Tribunal
“expressly left open the possibility that Article 44(3)’s stabilization promise could
constitute a ‘specific commitment’ by Spain”, but “did not need to decide whether the
legislative commitment alone could give rise to legitimate expectations, because there
were other commitments.””4 In respect of the RRR theory the Masdar Tribunal (relying on
Eiser) considered that Article 10(1) entitled investors not to a mere RRR, but instead to
fair and equitable treatment.?° In this case the Claimants invested in three CSPs which

began in May 2008 and for which RAIPRE registration was secured by December 2011.

(iv) In Antin, Claimants sought restitution of the legal and regulatory regime under which they
made their investments in two CSPs (RD 661/2007 as modified by RD 1614/2010 and RDL
14/2010 as the CSP thermosolar installations were acquired and developed in June 2011,

with RAIPRE registration for both plants by 22 December 2009) or, in the alternative,

damages for loss in the fair market value of their investments, comprised of lost historical
and future cash flows.” The Tribunal observed that Spain breached Claimants’ legitimate
expectations in light of the “precision and detail exhibited in the royal decrees, particularly
the contemplation that treatment would be accorded for a defined period of time”.*” With
respect to the RRR theory (which formed both Claimant’s Alternative Claim and one of
Respondent’s defenses) the Tribunal observed that:

[...] what Spain labels a “reasonable rate of return” seemingly depends on
governmental discretion. This is in plain contrast with the relative precision
of the Original Regime —in force when the Claimants made their
investment— which provided for objective and identifiable criteria for
determining the remuneration due to CSP plants, which were expressly
specified in the regulation and were dependent on the market.”°

(v) In Greentech, Claimants submitted that Respondent breached the ECT by modifying the
FiT regime resulting from the RD 661/2007,7 or, in the alternative, by abrogating the ORR
regime and thereby making a “fundamental change” in a manner that had not taken into
account the circumstances of existing investments made in reliance on the prior regime.?°
On quantum, Claimants sought damages for the diminution in the market value of their
investments.31 In addition, their experts (FTI) placed before the Tribunal an alternative
calculation of damages paralleling the Alternative Claim, i.e., based on an RRR.2%

Consequently the Greentech Tribunal confronted four options for assessing damages:

a. as a projection of the FiTs that the plants would receive under the RD 661/2007
under Claimants’ Expert’s primary calculation;?

b. as a projection of the FiTs that the plants would receive under the RD 661/2007
under Respondent’s Expert’s alternative calculation;?4

c. as an RRR under Respondent’s Expert’s primary calculation; 3°

d. as an RRR under Claimants’ Expert’s alternative calculation.*°

The Tribunal found only options a. and b. to be consistent with its finding on liability that
the Respondent had abrogated the RD 661/2007 scheme when it introduced the NRR in
violation of Article 10(1) of the ECT, and, accordingly, dismissed c. and d., which had
reflected Claimants’ expert’s as well as Respondent’s calculations of an RRR Alternative
Claim. Claimants, in this case, had invested in two PV plants and one PV project
(comprised of 18 100-KW plants) during the period May 2009 through May 2010. The
plants were registered with the RAIPRE, respectively, on 28 August 2008 (Madridejos),?”
25 September 2008 (La Castilleja),?® and 20 May 2008 (Fotocampillos).2? The Greentech
Tribunal found “that the Claimants had the legitimate expectation that the legal and
regulatory framework would not be fundamentally and abruptly altered, thereby
depriving investors of a significant part of their projected revenues,” while at the same
time opining that “the Claimants did not have legitimate expectations that they would
receive the precise FiT specified in RD 661/2007 for the entire lifetime of their PV plants.”“°
Contrary to 9Ren and OperaFund (as noted below), the Respondent’s “specific
clarification . .. that [Masdar’s] facilities would receive the RD 661/2007 FiTs throughout
their operating lives,”*+ added to the Greentech Tribunal “not [being] persuaded” by the
Claimants’ view that “Article 44.3 RD 661/2007 is a specific assurance giving rise to a
legitimate expectation that the Claimants would receive fixed FiTs for the lifetime of their
PV plants.”** The Greentech Tribunal then “[cJonclude[d] that the Respondent’s
enactment of the New Regulatory Regime constituted a fundamental change to the legal
and regulatory framework that crossed the line from a non-compensatory regulatory
measure to a compensable breach of the FET standard in the ECT’? and awarded damages

accordingly.

(vi) In SolEs, Claimant asserted that it was entitled to damages based on the reduction in the
value of net profit flows to equity investors that had resulted from Spain’s
implementation of the disputed measures,“ on the basis of the FiTs. As to Claimant’s
legitimate expectations, the Tribunal cited Antin to reconfirm that “an investor’s
legitimate expectations can also arise from provisions of law and regulations and from
statements made by or on behalf of the State for the purpose of inducing investment by a
class of investors.”*° The plants were registered with the RAIPRE, respectively, on 10
December 2009 (Badajoz |) and February 2010 (Badajoz II),4° and Claimant acquired
control of them in March 2010. Given that the investment in Spain effectively was made
in March 2010 (when Claimant acquired its interest in the plants), the Tribunal reasoned
that “there were no developments between March 2010 and May 2010 that could have
altered in a material way the legitimate expectations of a PV investor’.*” Respondent
asserted that the investor was entitled to an RRR only and that that was guaranteed by
the new measures. Claimant developed its Alternative Claim on this theory. The Tribunal
determined that it was not necessary to discuss the Alternative Claim in that it did not
find that Article 10(1) of the ECT entitles Claimant to a particular return.*® Instead, the
Tribunal accepted Claimants’ proposal for damages based on a “but for’ scenario with a

25-year duration of the feed-in tariffs set in 2010 under the Special Regime.*?

(vii) In 9Ren, Claimants sought damages using two different models: (i) as diminution in the
fair market value of their investments in the five Solaica plants (given they had been sold
in June 2015); and (ii) as lost profits on their investments in the three Espafia Plants on

the revenues estimated on the basis of the applicable tariff rates under RD 661/2007 and

RD 1578/2008.°° Claim (ii) is substantially similar to the PV Investors’ Primary Claim.
Regarding the RRR, the Tribunal concluded that Claimants reasonably relied on a
legitimate expectation that the FiT benefits of RD 661/2007 would continue for the useful
life of seven of its eight facilities,> having registered seven of the eight facilities with the
RAIPRE before 29 September 2008,* and thus that Spain’s decision to abolish the regime
of RD 661/2007 was “inconsistent with the clear terms of RD 661/2007 that granted tariffs
for the entire operating life of a facility.”°? Accordingly, the Tribunal ruled out
Respondent’s proposal for compensation based on an RRR™ and accepted Claimant’s
proposal for damages based on historical performance (under the RD 661/2007 regime).°>
Claimant’s date of investment, 23 April 2008, and its efforts to ensure that its projects
complied with the FiT requirements (including timely registration under RAIPRE), were
significant to the Tribunal in establishing that Claimant would receive the benefits set out

in RD 661/2007.°°

(viii) In Cube, Claimants claimed for loss of expected cash flows, on the basis of RD 661/2007,
to flow from fixed tariffs and market premiums. Claimants invested in the PV sector (three
PV facilities) in April-June 2008 and in the hydroelectric sector (sixteen facilities) in 2011-
2012. The Claimants’ PV investments in the Puente Génave, San Martin de Pusa and Ecija
plants were duly registered under RD 661/2007 and the investment in the Rambla plant
had been registered under RD 1578/2008.°*” In respect of the commitment expressed by
the Spanish Government to the FiT regime, the Tribunal considered that Claimants’

expectations that the regime would not be altered were legitimate, since the Spanish

before 29 September 2008 in order to be “grandfathered” under RD 661/2007.” (internal footnotes excluded); and
ibid., para. 105, clarifying that the eighth plant was registered with RAIPRE on 23 March 2011 and entitled to

regulatory regime clearly promised that the investments would be subject to certain
regulatory principles that “as a matter of deliberate policy” were to be maintained in force
fora finite length of time.>® Respondent submitted that Claimants were entitled to an RRR
only. The Tribunal ruled that Respondent’s assertions could not be substantiated, neither
by the language of the ORR (including, e.g., the sole reference to “reasonable rate of
profitability” in RD 661/2007 Article 44(3)) nor by the accompanying Press Release,>°
because “[wJhatever the rationale behind the structure of tariffs and premiums set out in
RD 661/2007, the clear representation was that the structure would be maintained in the

terms set out in the Royal Decree.”

(ix)

In OperaFund, Claimants, citing Chrozow Factory and ILC Articles 31-38, pleaded that
Respondent committed an internationally wrongful act, and that damages should put
Claimants in the position in which they would have found themselves had Respondent

not breached the ECT.® The Tribunal, referencing Novenergia and Masdar, reasoned:

The Tribunal, therefore, has no doubt that the stabilization assurance
given in Article 44(3) is applicable for the investments by Claimants.
Indeed, it is hard to imagine a more explicit stabilization assurance than
the one mentioned in Article 44(3): “revisions [...] shall not affect facilities
for which the functioning certificate had been granted.”

Claimants invested in five PV installations between July 2008 and July 2009, but all of the
Claimants’ facilities were registered in RAIPRE by 29 September 2008. In reference to
Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007, the Tribunal determined that “the RAIPRE registration is
an important additional element in order to assess the legitimate expectations of the

investors” and that “[sJuch a stabilization promise could be perfected by the registration

58 Ibid., para. 388.

59 Ibid., para. 287.

® Ibid., para. 296.

® OperaFund, para. 605.

® Ibid., para 485.

® RD 661/2007, Article 44(3): The revisions of the regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits indicated in this
section shall not affect facilities for which the commissioning certificate had been granted prior to January 1 of the
second year following the year in which the revision had been performed

(x

of the RE plants to receive the preferential FiT under RD 661/2007.”* The Tribunal
concluded that “the formal registration led to the investors’ entitlement to receive the
benefits under RD 661/2007 (including not being subject to regulatory change).”®
Respondent also submitted in this arbitration that Claimants were entitled to an RRR only
and that these were already guaranteed by the Special Regime. Claimants then submitted
an Alternative Claim pleading that the Special Regime did not guarantee an RRR. The
Tribunal observed: “This alternative is not applicable as, above, the Tribunal has accepted
Claimants’ primary claims for breach of the FET standard and thereby of Article 10(1) of
the ECT and thereby dismissed the alternative that Respondent only guaranteed a
reasonable return. There is, thus, no need for the Tribunal to determine this alternative

claim.”®

In Infrared, Claimants submitted that Spain violated their legitimate expectations that the
ORR would remain stable (i.e., immutable) throughout the lifespan of the plants or, in the
alternative, that Spain violated its FET obligations by abrogating essential elements of the
ORR, or at least its transparency obligations.®” The Tribunal determined that Claimants
had legitimate expectations that the plants registered on the RAIPRE would be shielded
from subsequent regulatory changes® in that they were assured that the regulated tariff
and pool plus premium would have continued to apply for the operational lifespan of the
plants registered on the RAIPRE.® As in Greentech, Claimants’ expert presented to the
Tribunal an alternative calculation of damages based on an RRR,’ as to which the Tribunal

observed:

[...] the pith of the breach here does not consist in a variation of the
reasonable rate of return, but rather in the frustration of Claimants’
legitimate expectation that the Mordn and Olivenza plants would be

shielded from revisions of the regulated tariff, the pool price premium and
the applicable lower and upper values contained in RD 661/2007. A
valuation that is premised principally on the “reasonable” rate of return
without regard to the actual remuneration impaired by the Measures at
Issue seems equally ill-adapted to the regulatory and legislative landscape
in the present case [...].”2

In this case, Infrared invested in two CSP plants in July 2011, which were registered in the

RAIPRE

in May and December 2012.

(xi) In Watkins, Claimants sought restitution and/or compensation for losses to its 2011

investment in the Spanish wind generation sector. The wind farms were duly registered

with RAIPRE by 9 December 2010 and the Claimants were entitled to the RD 661/2007

economic regime.”? In determining that Spain radically altered the applicable legal and

regulatory framework”? the Tribunal rejected Spain’s contention that the investors were

guaranteed only an RRR in preference to the view developed by Eiser, Novenergia, Antin

and Masdar over RREEF (see xii, infra).’4 The Tribunal specifically wrote:

71 Ibid., para. 543.

The Claimants in this case have put forward extensive evidence of
contemporaneous documents showing that Spain offered investors a fixed
guaranteed return and not just a reasonable return. The Tribunal has
considered the contemporaneous evidence and it is not persuaded that
the evidence adduced by the Respondent is sufficient for determining a
“reasonable return” and neither is it in fulfilment of the representations
made by the Respondent with regard to the stability of the legal and
economic regime that would be applicable to RE projects in order to entice
investments into the wind sector. The Tribunal concludes that the
Respondent’s methodology for determining reasonable rate of return in
the light of the amendments to the legislation is, in the Tribunal’s view, not
based on any identifiable criteria. The Tribunal is therefore of the view that
the RREEF Decision does not in any way, assist the Respondent in its
primary contention that the Claimants were only entitled to a reasonable
return on their investments and that in the Tribunal’s view, is a very narrow

and erroneous interpretation of the RREEF Decision.’> (Emphasis in
original.)

With the parties having pled extensively on the matter,’® the Tribunal wrote further:

The Tribunal has considered the arguments of the Claimants and the

Respondent in respect of the RREEF Decision with regard to reasonable

return and is of the view that the RREEF Decision does not, in any way,

assist the Respondent in its contention that the Claimants were only

entitled to a reasonable return on their investments and the Tribunal is of

the view that the argument advanced by Spain is a very narrow and

erroneous interpretation of the RREEF Decision, especially with regard to

the issue of reasonable return.””
Respondent’s Alternative Claim also was rejected as a matter of valuation based on the
Tribunal’s determination on the merits, which accepted the Claimants’ Primary Claim that
the Claimants had a legitimate expectation to obtain tariffs under RD 661/2007 and not
to receive a return that was implicit in those tariffs.’® Regarding the standard of proof for
calculating compensation, the Tribunal agreed with Claimants that “[...] the standard is to
show the existence of damage with reasonable certainty and then only offer a basis on
which the Tribunal can, with reasonable confidence, estimate the amount of their loss” .”9
Ultimately, the Tribunal adopted the DCF method proposed by Claimants, which
calculated compensation as the difference between the returns in the actual scenario,

and the returns under RD 661/2007 of 8% and 9% post-tax for each of the two

investments.®?

(i) In RREEF, a case involving CSP and wind plants, the Tribunal determined that Respondent
breached its obligations under the ECT via application of the NRR. As the applicable legal
standard for compensation, a 2-1 majority concluded that the only legitimate expectation
of the Claimants was to receive an RRR for their investment.* In arriving at this decision,
the Tribunal referred to Article 30(4) of Law 54/1997,°? the preamble of RD 661/2007,
and the National Action Plan for Renewable Energy in Spain of 30 June 2010.** Notably,
in relation to the date of final registration with the RAIPRE,®° the RREEF investments were
made on 28 December 2010 (wind farms), 2011 (Arenales CSP Plant) and 2012 (Andasol
CSP Plant), hence well after the first regulatory shift from the ORR via the 2010 Decrees®>
and months after the enactment of the National Action Plan for Renewable Energy in
Spain of 30 June 2010. As the Tribunal clarified, Claimants’ legitimate expectations must
be judged by the regime in place at the time of the investment (relying on Novenergia).°”
In his dissent, Robert Volterra described Spain’s conduct as “bait and switch,”*® regarded
Spain’s admission that the switch was to reduce profit levels of the investors as fatal to

its theory,®° and stressed that Spain had not proven its assertion that the regulatory

8. RREEF, para. 386.

restructuring to the subsidy system was made in response to the cost of money in the
capital markets (as an objective and variable element to evaluate the concept of a
reasonable return),®° thus leading him to opine that Spain “breached the ECT in multiple
ways, not merely in relation to a ‘reasonable rate of return,’”** and to disagree with his
fellow arbitrators regarding the scope of the Claimants’ legitimate expectations.°?
Whereas the PV Investors Claimants unquestionably invested under the ORR (final
registration with RAIPRE before 29 September 2008), RREEF invested at a time when the
regulatory changes of 2010 already had foreshadowed alteration of the FiT regime
following the introduction of more exacting RRR language into the 2011-2020 Renewable
Energy Plan. These factors distinguish RREEF from PV Investors and the eleven cases

that have rejected the Alternative Claim.

(ii) In NextEra, Claimants asserted, relying on Chorzow Factory and Art. 31 of the ILC Articles,
that they were entitled to full reparation by means of restitution or full compensation.*
Claimants started investing in Spain as early as 2007 via a subsidiary of NextEra.°>
Claimants’ Primary Claim calculated compensation on the basis of the revenues expected
pursuant to the pool plus premium option under Regulatory Framework |. Claimants also
presented an Alternative Claim based on Respondent’s defense of an RRR. As to the RRR

the Tribunal observed that:

[...] the assurances made by the Spanish authorities were not about a
reasonable return; they were about the regulatory certainty and stability
that NextEra could expect. The denial of legitimate expectations is based
on the failure to provide that certainty and security by changing

fundamentally the regime under which remuneration was to be

calculated.°°
In addressing damages the Tribunal disregarded the DCF method proposed by the
Claimants and instead calculated damages in a “but for’ scenario based on the RD
661/2007 regime because Claimants’ Termosol Plants had been in operation only since
June 2013 (final registration with RAIPRE for No. 1 and 2 Termosol Plants occurred on 29
May 2013 and 7 June 2013, respectively), i.e., less than a year before the NRR entered
into full force, thus making it difficult to calculate future profits based on such a short
amount of time.®” Thus, as with RREEF, the circumstances of PV Investors and the eleven
cases that rejected the Alternative Claim are easily distinguishable from NextEra, in that
the PV Investors Claimants obtained their RAIPRE before 29 September 2008,°° hence well

before the 2010-2013 changes to the Spanish energy regulatory regime.

(iii) In BayWa, Claimants argued that they were entitled to full reparation for the harm
suffered due to the disputed measures, with damages consisting of the difference in value
of the Claimants’ investment under the NRR and the ORR scenarios, assuming BayWa had
a right to receive payments under RD 661/2007.°° Claimants also developed an
Alternative Claim based on an RRR.?™ The Tribunal, by a 2-1 majority, relying on RREEF,
held that Claimants were entitled only to an RRR and found that Claimants were already
achieving more than an RRR with their wind farms. The majority determined that Spain
had breached the ECT because of the clawback provision contained in the NRR, and

ordered the parties and their experts to identify the quantum. A significant factor

distinguishing BayWa from the present case and the eleven cases that have rejected the
Alternative Claim is how the investments were generated. The BayWa Claimants invested
in two wind farm projects during the years 2003-2012 and 2009-2012, respectively,
increasing their ownership significantly in 2011,° which date (2011) Claimants fixed as
the date as of which to judge their legitimate expectations (which evidently is a date much
later than that of PV Investors’ investments).!° It should be noted as well that BayWa’s
original investment was made in 1997, when expectations for the investment pre-dated,
by many years, the ORR, a point considered by the BayWa majority.‘ The source of
expectations also differs. The BayWa Claimants invested in wind farms, and the PV
Investors Claimants in photovoltaic plants. The PV Investors Claimants’ expectations
accordingly were informed by different State representations (e.g., the notorious
presentation "The Sun Can Be Yours"), which did not factor into Baywa’s investment-
backed expectations into wind. Thus, the BayWa majority’s determination that the
Claimants had no right to the continuation of the Special Regime is not analogous to the

present case.

(iv) In RWE Innogy, the Tribunal held that the enactment of the NRR breached Article 10(1)
of the ECT twice in that: (i) its claw-back provision unduly required Claimants to pay back
certain sums received between the adoption of RDL 9/2013 and Order IET 1025/2014 (the
“clawback” provision), and (ii) it placed an excessive and disproportionate financial
burden on certain of the Claimants’ plants. Regarding the second breach, the Tribunal
clarified, relying on RREEF, that Claimants were entitled only to an RRR of 7.398%, an
assessment prompted by a number of factors that are not present as regards PV Investors.
First, RWE started investing in Spain as early as 2001. Therefore, in a reasoning analogous
to BayWa, the Tribunal held that at that time the investors could not rely on
representations made by the Spanish Government in RD 436/2004 or RD 661/2007. In

fact, RWE had invested under the legal framework of RD 2818/98, whose language, the

291 Ibid., paras. 73-74.
202 Ibid., para. 350.
293 Ibid., para. 473.

Tribunal determined, could not have been intended as a statement that incentives would
not be changed at some point in the future, and therefore could not reasonably have
been relied upon as such.!™ Concerning the second tranche of investments made in June
2008 with the acquisition of the Urvasco plants, Claimants were found not to have carried
out due diligence on the regulatory risk appropriate to the size of their investment.1%
With respect to investments made from 2010 onwards, the Tribunal considered that at
that point in time the investors had been alerted to the prospect that changes were on
the horizon.°° In the present case, however, it is undisputed that the PV Investors
Claimants relied on the ORR in making their investments in Spain, having met the 29
September 2008 RAIPRE deadline. Second, the RWE investments were in hydro and wind,
not in solar energy, hence, unlike the PV Investors, the RWE Claimants could not rely on
the representations made by the Spanish Government in respect of the solar and
photovoltaic sector. As a result of these factors, the Tribunal rejected in toto Claimants’
case for a breach of legitimate expectations and resorted to the principle of

proportionality to set compensation at an RRR.

7. Cases in which the Kingdom of Spain has prevailed:

In Charanne, the scope of the dispute was limited to the 2010 measures. The Tribunal first
acknowledged that “a State cannot induce an investor to make an investment, hereby
generating legitimate expectations, to later ignore the commitments that had generated
such expectations.”*’ Ultimately, the Tribunal determined that “the Claimants could have
easily foreseen possible adjustments to the regulatory framework as those introduced by
the rules of 2010.”*°8 It must be stressed that the analysis in this case was truncated in
that the measures taken from 2013 onwards were not considered. This decisional

framework readily distinguishes Charanne from PV Investors.

(ii) In Isolux, Claimant invested on 29 October 2012. The Tribunal noted that as of October
2012, the FiT regime was already the object of various studies that made its modification
inevitable. In particular, the Tribunal recalled that in March 2012 the National Energy
Commission issued a report indicating that the Special Regime was under review,
recommending various changes to the regulatory regime. In September of the same year
the Spanish Supreme Court stated that "/t/he reasonable remuneration for investments
established by Law 54/1997 does not imply, we repeat, that the remuneration must
necessarily be received through the regulated tariff.”1°9 Thus, the context of the Isolux
investment was markedly different from that of the PV Investors, which had invested in

Spain up to five years before Isolux.

(iii) A 2-1 majority in Stadtwerke held that the Spanish measures were proportionate and
reasonable and that Claimants could not have any expectation that the ORR would have
been maintained as it was at the time they invested, relying substantially on Spanish law
(which it determined to be relevant in the ECT context).1?° Professor Kaj Hobér dissented,
opining that the Claimants’ reasonable expectations at the time of their investment
included an expectation that there would not be any fundamental and radical changes to
the RD 661/2007 regime?! (and that Spain's contention that Claimants were only entitled
to an RRR was incorrect)."!? Timing was a significant factor in this case. The majority
evidently was influenced by the fact that while Claimants had invested in Spain in October
2009, their CSP plants were registered in the RAIPRE only in April 2012.43 PV Investors is
distinguishable in that all of their investments had been registered with RAIPRE by the 29
September 2008 deadline, thus justifying their legitimate expectations under the ORR.14

8. The present award is based expressly on jura novit arbiter.5 Though we are not bound
by the doctrine of stare decisis, | find compelling the jurisprudence formed by these other
renewable energy cases involving Spain’s history of regulating the field. Eleven of the
eighteen Tribunals have granted the Primary Claim over the Alternative Claim, despite
having the Alternative Claim presented to them, in circumstances that this Award itself
describes as “broadly similar to the Primary Claim in this arbitration,” citing Eiser, Masdar
and Novenergia.!® All eleven have concluded that Spain had guaranteed that the
investors were entitled to the FiT in place at the time of the investment, i.e., the Primary

Claim, and could not be limited to an RRR, i.e., the Alternative Claim.1!”

9. As discussed directly above, none of the three cases (Charanne, Isolux and Stadtwerke) in
which Spain prevailed is in any way analogous to the present case, due to the markedly
different timing of their investments and the consequent difference in those investors’
legitimate expectations, considering the contemporaneous state of the Spanish
regulatory framework. In Charanne, the tribunal did not consider the Spanish measures
beyond 2010. In /solux, the investment came at a time when changes to the regulatory
regime were evident. In Stadtwerke, the RAIPRE registration, which Claimants advanced
as concretizing their legitimate expectations, occurred only in 2012, whereas PV Investors’

legitimate expectations were based on RD 661/2007 inasmuch as their RAIPRE

registration had been made by 29 September 2008, following Spain’s 27 September 2007

announcement that RD 661/2007 would close to new investments in PV projects one year

later.

the Nextéra tribunal accepted the Primary Claim but applied a reasonable rate of return to calculate damages
because the NextEra plants had operated under the RD 661/2007 regime for only a few months. The Tribunal
declared that it could not use the DCF method since Claimants could not prove what kind of cash flow they could
have enjoyed ina "but for" scenario. Accordingly, the Tribunal had to use the method proposed by Claimants in their
Alternative Claim, which was their expectation of a reasonable rate of return

22

10. The Alternative Claim prevailed in four cases (RREEF, NextEra, BayWa and RWE Innogy),
none of which is in any way analogous to the present case. The NextEra Tribunal only
applied an RRR because the DCF method advanced with the Claimants’ primary claim
could not be applied owing to NextEra’s late entry into the market. In RWE Innogy, the
Tribunal’s reliance on the principle of proportionality, resulting in an award of an RRR, is
distinctly different from the present case, as each turns on legitimate expectations
formed at the different times their respective investments were made. The same is true

of BayWa and RREEF.

11. The type of investment also sets these four cases apart from the present case, although
the Award makes no effort to reconcile this important reality with its novel, indeed
unique, reading of the ORR. Investment type has been a significant factor in ascertaining
the claimants’ legitimate expectations, which has included review of different sets of
regulations applicable to specific types of investments, as well as consideration of
different representations and ancillary assurances that targeted specific types of
investments. Accordingly, it is well documented in these renewable energy awards that
PV facilities differ from CSP, wind and hydro facilities, each of which was governed by
different regulations and was the object of different representations by the Government

of Spain.14® None of the four awards granting the Alternative Claim involved PV

218 In the words of one Spanish official, “the CSP and PV sectors were different since the former produces more
electricity using less subsidies than the latter, which explained the retroactive changes affecting PV facilities” . Antin,
para. 127. It was also noted in Antin that in 2010 CSP plants generated 0.8% of the electricity and received 3% of
Special Regime subsidies, whereas PV plants generated 7% of the electricity and received 37% of the Special Regime
subsidies. (Antin, para. 132.) The Charanne Tribunal observed that RD 1578/2008, 1565/2010, and 14/2010
regulated exclusively the PV industry, whereas RD 1614 2010 regulated solar, thermal and wind technologies and
not PV. (Charanne, para. 154-155.) The Cube Tribunal noted that the regulation of CSP also involves “different
regulatory incidents” from PV. (Cube, para. 508.) Similarly, a number of presentations and ancillary documents
contemporaneous to the implementation of the ORR addressed specifically PV investors, e.g., the Renewable Energy
Promotion Plan 2000 — 2010 (“PER 2000 ~ 2010”) and the notorious presentation “The Sun can be Yours.”

installations.**? In fact, the tribunals in all cases involving PV installations invested under

the ORR have granted the Primary Claim and rejected the Alternative Claim.12°

The most recent Watkins Tribunal also was critical of the RREEF award, particularly
concerning that Tribunal’s finding that Spain committed to provide an RRR to investors,
which it described as “not supported by a number of awards which have found that Spain
did promise investors that it would not alter retroactively the specific tariffs of RD
661/2007 and RD 1614/2010”, instead concluding that “the persuasive views set out in
the decisions of Eiser, Novenergia, Antin and Masdar” should be favored.’21 Further,
relying on Robert Volterra’s dissent in RREEF, it criticized the conclusion of his co-
arbitrators that an RRR was not fixed and could evolve depending on the cost of money
in the capital market, for being “inconsistent with the evidence that was before the RREEF
tribunal especially as the cost of money in the capital markets was substantially the same
in 2007 when the RD 661/2007 regime was implemented and in 2013 when the new

regime was implemented.” 122

Errare humanum est, perseverare autem diabolicum.

Clearly the timing of the respective investments has been a critical distinguishing factor
in ascertaining the legitimate expectations of investors, hence further reason to view the
present case ina far different light from the four cases that granted the Alternative Claim.
The pre-RD 661/2007 investments of RWE Innogy and BayWa indisputably affected those
Tribunals’ assessment of the Claimants’ legitimate expectations as not being fixed by the
RD 661-2007 regime. Similarly, investments made once regulatory changes evidently

were on the way, as the BayWa and RREEF Tribunals found, could not legitimately expect

419 RREEF involved CSP and wind, BayWa involved wind, RWE Innogy involved hydro and wind and NextEra involved
CSP plants.

statutorily fixed returns. The PV Investors’ Primary Claim, on the contrary, is not affected
adversely by either the timing of their investments or their type. They invested between
2007 and 2009, but all their investments were registered with the RAIPRE before the 29
September 2008 deadline, guaranteeing each of their PV installations full economic
benefits under RD 661/2007. Indeed, the timing of the RAIPRE registration has had a
significant impact in a series of these Spanish RE cases. The Antin,'?? Masdar,'**
Novenergia,'*> and OperaFund’*® Tribunals all found that registration in RAIPRE was not
simply an administrative requirement, but actually gave rise to the legitimate
expectations of investors so registered. | refer to the Novenergia tribunal’s finding on this

point:

665. The Tribunal considers that Law 54/1997 and RD 661/2007 were
clearly enacted with the objective of ensuring that the Kingdom of Spain
achieved its emissions and RE targets. In order to achieve that objective
the Kingdom of Spain created a very favourable investment climate for RE
investors, and the nucleus of such investment climate was the Special
Regime. The requirements placed on the PV plants to qualify for the Special
Regime were limited to registration with the RAIPRE, a requirement which
all of the PV Plants had met within the prescribed cut-off date.

666. In the Tribunal's view, a number of relevant statements or assurances
were made by the Respondent with respect to the Special Regime, as
initially introduced through Law 54/1997 and further developed by RD
661/2007 and legislation in between:

(e) In Law 54/1997, it was stated that RE facilities admitted to the
Special Regime would be authorized to incorporate "all the energy
produced by them into the system" and would "obtain reasonable
rates of return" as set by the government.

(f) RD 436/2004 was enacted as expressly aiming at "provid[ing]
those who have decided or will decide in the near future to opt for
the special regime with a durable, objective, and transparent
framework".

23 Antin, para. 552.

224 Masdar, paras. 512-520.

25 Novenergia, paras. 665-667.
28 OperaFund, para. 483.

25

(g) Under RD 436/2004, PV plants were entitled to incorporate into
the grid all of the electric energy produced in exchange for a FIT or
premium for the lifespan of the PV plants.

(h) Under RD 661/2007, which replaced RD 436/2004, PV plants
enrolled in the RAIPRE before the cut-off date would be entitled to
(i) incorporate all of their net production into the grid; (ii) a FIT that
would only be updated in accordance with the national CPI; and (iii)
receive a fixed FIT for the lifespan of the PV plants.

667. These were the legal sources in force in the Kingdom of Spain when
the Claimant made its investment and the Tribunal agrees with the
Claimant that the above statements and assurances were indeed aimed at
incentivising companies to invest heavily in the Spanish electricity sector
and that the Claimant made its investment in reliance of the terms provided
in RD 661/2007. The commitment from the Kingdom of Spain could not
have been clearer. A considerable number of RE companies also invested
in reliance on these statements and assurances.’2’ (Citations omitted.)
(Emphasis added.)

In view of this provision, for the present case, the RAIPRE registration is an
important additional element in order to assess the legitimate
expectations of the investors... .

Claimants’ investments were made between July 2008 and July 2009, in
reliance upon the fact that the PV plants were finally registered in the
RAIPRE under RD 661/2007 and granted the RD 661/2007 FIT economic
rights. Thus, the formal registration led to the investors’ entitlement to
receive the benefits under RD 661/2007 (including not being subject to
regulatory change).

The Tribunal, therefore, has no doubt that the stabilization assurance
given in Article 44(3) is applicable for the investments by Claimants.
Indeed, it is hard to imagine a more explicit stabilization assurance than
the one mentioned in Article 44(3): “revisions [...] shall not affect facilities
for which the functioning certificate had been granted.” As put by the

228 Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 provides: “The revisions of the regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits

indicated in this section shall not affect facilities for which the commissioning certificate had been granted prior to

January 1 of the second year following the year in which the revision had been performed.”

Novenergia tribunal, “RD 661/2007 was so adamantly clear that its
understanding by common readers did not require a_ particularly
sophisticated analysis.”?2° (Citations omitted.) (Emphasis added.)

16.1 accordingly see no reason to depart from such sound reasoning, repeatedly applied
without exception by eleven predecessor tribunals confronting the same problem, as my
esteemed colleagues have done. Against such a record it is intellectually disingenuous to
say, as the Award does in paragraph 555, that “[i]t is not entirely unsurprising, and indeed
to some extent to be expected in a system based on ad hoc adjudication, that arbitral
tribunals may assess relevant circumstances in different ways.” One would not expect a
tribunal that declaredly+*° operates on the principle of “jura novit arbiter’ to diverge
from, indeed utterly reject, eleven predecessor tribunals’ unanimous awards that
addressed the same issue. Focusing even more narrowly on the sub-category of those
eleven cases to which the present case belongs, in every one of the four of them that, like
the PV Investors, specifically involved PV installations and timely RAIPRE registration (i.e.,
before 29 September 2008), the Primary Claim has prevailed over the Alternative
Claim.13+ In other words, PV Investors, Novenergia, Cube, 9Ren, and OperaFund all have
involved the same technology, close timing of investments, the same incentives, the same
compliance with RAIPRE registration deadline, the same assurances, the same
regulations, the same investment treaty, the same host State, and the same measures in
dispute. Logic dictates that the PV Investors would harbor the same expectations and that
this sub-category of the eleven cases be followed absent compelling contrary reasons.

The present Award, regrettably, states no such compelling reason.

. Although the Primary Claim itself has not been quantified in these proceedings, due to
the Tribunal’s extended excursion into and concentration on the Alternative Claim, | am

of the opinion that a proxy offered by the Claimants may be used at least to approximate

the Primary Claim damages of which this Award deprives the PV /nvestors.3? The
Novenergia Tribunal awarded damages on a €/MW of PV capacity basis. The damages
awarded in Novenergia were €53.3 million (excluding interest) and corresponded to an
installed capacity of 18.8 MW.? This leads to €2.84 million in damages for each MW of
capacity. If one assumes that PV Investors have 222.4 MW of capacity, and that each MW
is valued at €2.84 million, Claimants would receive approximately €632 million in damages
instead of €91.1 million, a difference of €540.9 million from the sum provided under the
Alternative Claim in this Award, representing a mere recovery of less than seven percent

of what Claimants’ legitimate expectations should have generated in damages.
