L INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

1. This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on the basis of the Agreement
between the Government of the Kingdom of Norway and the Government of the
Republic of Latvia on the Mutual Promotion and Protection of Investments, which was
signed on 16 June 1992 and entered into force on 1 December 1992 (the “BIT”),! and
the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals
of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the “ICSID

Convention”).

2. The Claimants in this case are Staur Eiendom AS (“Staur’’), EBO Invest AS (“EBO”)
and Rox Holding AS (“Rox”), which are all private limited liability companies
incorporated under the laws of Norway (collectively referred to as the “Claimants”’).
Staur, EBO and Rox own 18%, 72% and 10%, respectively, of (SIA) Rixport, a limited

liability company incorporated under the laws of Latvia (“Rixport”).2

3. The Respondent in this case is the Republic of Latvia (“Latvia” or the “Respondent”.

4. The Claimants and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the “Parties.” The

Parties’ representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

5. As discussed further below, the arbitration concerns a dispute arising out of a project
for the development of Riga International Airport in Latvia (the “Airport”) and, more
specifically, a number of Land Lease Agreements that Rixport entered into in
November 2006 with a Latvian State-owned company, SJSC International Airport Riga
(“SJSC Airport”). The Land Lease Agreements, which were the subject of
subsequent amendments, provided for the development of four parcels of land adjacent

to the Airport.

6. The Claimants initiated the arbitration on the basis that they made substantial
investments through Rixport in connection with the Land Lease Agreements, but that
the Respondent has through its actions effectively frustrated those investments and, in
doing so, breached its obligations under Articles III and VI of the BIT on equitable and

reasonable treatment and unlawful expropriation, respectively, as well as the umbrella

Tex. Cl.
2 CL. Mem. 12.

clause that they contend has been incorporated in the BIT by virtue of the BIT’s Most

Favoured Nation (“MFN”) clause.3

In addition to declaratory and other relief, the Claimants seek an order that the
Respondent pay to the Claimants full reparation in accordance with the BIT and
customary international law, in an amount that was initially quantified as “up to EUR
26 million,”4 but that evolved during the course of the arbitration, with the amount of
EUR 41.9 million ultimately being claimed as compensation for the Claimants’ alleged

loss.5

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 4 November 2016, ICSID received a Request for Arbitration, dated 4 November
2016, from the Claimants (the “Request”’).

On 6 December 2016, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request under the
ICSID Convention. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the
Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance
with Rule 7(d) of ICSID’s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and

Arbitration Proceedings (the “Arbitration Rules”).

By the Claimants’ letter, dated 1 March 2017, and the Respondent’s communication of
2 March 2017, the Parties agreed that the arbitral tribunal would consist of three
arbitrators, with one arbitrator appointed by the Claimants and the Respondent,

respectively, and the third, the President, to be appointed by agreement of the Parties.

On | March 2017, the Claimants appointed Professor Kaj Hobér, a national of Sweden,
and the Respondent appointed Mr. Toby Landau QC, a national of the United Kingdom,
as arbitrators in this case, and Professor Hobér and Mr. Landau accepted their

appointments.

On 13 April 2017, the Parties agreed, via a ballot procedure, to appoint Mr. Eric
Schwartz, a national of France and the United States, as President of the arbitral

tribunal, and Mr. Schwartz accepted his appointment on the same date after having

3 In addition, the Claimants initially claimed an entitlement to relief based on the Respondent’s alleged breaches of customary
international law (see, ¢.g., Cl. Mem., Request for Relief {16(I1)). However, that claim was not subsequently pursued and was,
thus, dropped from the Claimants’ subsequent iteration of their claims in their Reply.

5 TR, Day 1, p. 134; TR, Day 8, pp. 89-91

been so informed on behalf of the ICSID Secretary-General by Mr. Francisco Abriani,
Legal Counsel at ICSID.

By letter, dated 13 April 2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID notified the Parties that
all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore
deemed to have been constituted on that date in accordance with Article 6(1) of the

Arbitration Rules. Mr. Abriani was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

On 12 June 2017, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first

session by teleconference with the Parties.

On 6 July 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. | recording the agreement
of the Parties on procedural matters, as confirmed during the first session, and the
Tribunal’s decisions on disputed issues, including, in particular, whether, as requested
by the Respondent, the proceedings should be bifurcated, with a first phase devoted to
jurisdiction and liability and a second phase concerning quantum. As stated in
Procedural Order No. 1, the Tribunal determined that bifurcation would not be
appropriate in the specific circumstances of this case, given that: (i) the Respondent
acknowledged that it would be difficult for the Tribunal to rule on its jurisdictional
objections separately from considering issues of liability; (ii) the Respondent also
appeared to concede that the resolution in its favor of its jurisdictional objections would
not fully dispose of all of the Claimants’ claims; and (iii) the claims, and in particular
the issues of quantum, did not appear to be of such a degree of complexity that
bifurcation could be expected to generate a level of savings substantial enough, if the
Respondent’ s case on jurisdiction and/or liability were successful, to outweigh the risks

of delay and additional costs if the Respondent were unsuccessful.

In addition to recording that the proceedings would not be bifurcated, Procedural Order
No. 1 provided, inter alia, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect
from 10 April 2006; the procedural language would be English; and the place of
proceeding would be Paris, France. Procedural Order No. | also set out a timetable
(the “Procedural Timetable”) for the proceedings culminating in a hearing (the

“Hearing”), for which two weeks were reserved from 4-15 March 2019.

In accordance with the Procedural Timetable, the Claimants filed their Memorial on 6
November 2017. Accompanying the Memorial were the witness statements of Messrs.
Petter Lundeby and Bernt @sthus; an expert report on quantum of Mr. Michael Pilgrim
of FTI Consulting; factual exhibits (C-1 to C-161); and legal authorities (CL-1 to CL-
89). Following the submission of the Claimants’ Memorial, the Respondent objected

that it contained various deficiencies, in relation, in particular, to certain of the exhibits

submitted. The Respondent’s objections were subsequently resolved, to the
Respondent’s satisfaction, with, inter alia, certain exhibits (C-74, C-75 and C-83)

being stricken from the record, with the Claimants’ agreement.®

On 6 March 2018, the Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial together with the
witness statements of Mr. Artiirs Saveljevs, Ms. Aida Skalberga and Ms. DZineta
Innusa; an expert report on quantum of Mr. Andrew Grantham of AlixPartners, with
exhibits; 129 additional factual exhibits (R-1 to R-129); and 71 legal authorities (RLA-
1 to RLA-71).

Document production requests, in the form of Redfern schedules, were subsequently
exchanged by the Parties on 27 March 2018 and were followed by the submission by
the Respondent on 10 April 2018 of objections to certain of the Claimants’ requests.
The Claimants made no objections to any of the Respondent’s requests and voluntarily

produced on 24 April 2018 a number of documents in response to those requests.

On 24 April 2018, the Claimants applied to the Tribunal for an order directing the
Respondent to produce requested documents that the latter would not produce

voluntarily or claimed not to have in its possession, control or custody.

By its Procedural Order No. 2, dated 4 May 2018, the Tribunal decided upon the
Claimants’ application and directed the production of certain documents by the
Respondent to the Claimants by 29 May 2018, without prejudging the Tribunal’s
ultimate position as to the evidentiary value and relevance of the documents being

ordered to be produced.

On 14 June 2018, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal to complain that the Respondent
had failed to produce certain of the documents that it was directed to produce in
Procedural Order No. 2 and that other documents had been, or, according to the
Respondent, would be, produced late, thus requiring the Claimants to request a one-
month extension of the deadline for the submission of their Reply to the Respondent’s

Counter-Memorial from 6 August 2018 to 6 September 2018.

After considering the Respondent’s reply, dated 18 June 2018, the Tribunal issued
Procedural Order No. 3 on 25 June 2018, in which, based on the Respondent’s
affirmation that it had carried out a diligent search, but had not found any responsive
documents, the Tribunal declined to order any further production in respect of the

documents that were the subject of the Claimants’ application and that the Respondent

had not produced or otherwise undertaken to produce. With respect to the Claimants’
request for an extension of time, the Tribunal granted the Claimants a one-week
extension, until 13 August 2018, for the submission of their Reply. In so deciding, the
Tribunal indicated that it did not consider that the Respondent’s delay in the production
of documents warranted a one-month extension for the submission of the Reply, as
requested by the Claimants, in circumstances where the Claimants had been in
possession of the Respondent’s Counter-Memorial since 6 March 2018 and only a
small number of documents had been produced late. The Tribunal directed other

consequential adjustments to the Procedural Timetable.

In accordance with the amended Procedural Timetable, the Claimants submitted their
Reply on 13 August 2018, together with a witness statement from Mr. Morton
Lilleberg; a second witness statement from Mr. Lundeby; a second expert report of Mr.
Pilgrem; additional factual exhibits (C-162 to C-375); and additional legal authorities
(CL-90 to CL-118).

The Respondent then submitted its Rejoinder, as directed, on 13 December 2018,
together with a witness statement of Mr. Juris Kanels; second witness statements of
Mr. Saveljevs and Ms. Innusa; a second expert report of Mr. Grantham; additional
factual exhibits (R-130 to R-198); and additional legal authorities (RLA-72 to RLA-
87).

On 7 January 2019, in accordance with the amended Procedural Timetable, each of the
Parties informed the other and the Tribunal that they intended to call all of the other
side’s witnesses, and each other’s quantum expert, for cross-examination at the

Hearing.

On 21 January 2019, after having had the opportunity to consult and comment on a
draft agenda, the Parties participated in a telephone conference with the Tribunal to
discuss the organization of the Hearing. Following the telephone conference, on 22
January 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 in which it confirmed, inter
alia, that the Hearing would be conducted at the World Bank in Paris, France from 4-
12 March 2019, for opening oral statements and the examination of the witnesses and
experts, and on 14 March 2019, for oral closing submissions, which were to be made
in place of written post-hearing briefs. It was decided that the total hearing time would
be 52 hours, with 24 hours available to each Party on a chess-clock basis and the
remaining 4 hours allocated to housekeeping matters and Tribunal questions. The
Secretary of the Tribunal would keep the time used by each Party and the Tribunal. It

was further confirmed that arrangements were being made for real-time transcription

of the hearing, in addition to audio recording and simultaneous interpretation for

witnesses giving their evidence in Latvian.

The Parties were directed to agree on a hearing schedule, taking into account that Ms.
Innusa, as the Respondent’s party representative, would be allowed to remain in the
hearing room before giving her oral evidence (unlike the other fact witnesses) and that
the Parties’ fact witnesses would be examined before the Parties’ experts. Procedural
Order No. 4 further confirmed the rules that would apply to the scope and manner of
witness examination; the use and distribution of visual aids, including demonstrative
exhibits and PowerPoint presentations during the Hearing; and the submission of new
evidence during the hearing, which was to be prohibited, except in exceptional
circumstances with the prior approval of the Tribunal. The Parties were also directed
to prepare a joint consolidated set of hearing bundles and to try to develop an agreed

factual chronology.

On 4 February 2019, the Parties confirmed their agreement on an indicative timetable
for the hearing on the understanding that the Parties would each be permitted to use

their allocated time as they saw fit.

In accordance with Procedural Order No. 4, the Claimants submitted observations on
5 February 2019 on three documents included as exhibits to the Respondent’s
Rejoinder on 13 December 2018.7. The Respondent responded to the Claimants’

observations on 19 February 2019.
An agreed Joint Factual Chronology was submitted by the Parties on 25 February 2019.

On 2 March 2019, the Claimants submitted two documents that it intended to use during
its oral opening statement at the Hearing as demonstrative exhibits, as permitted by
Procedural Order No. 4. The Respondent objected, however, to the submission of one
of the two documents on the basis that it did not identify the exhibits from which the
information in the document had been derived, and it requested that it be resubmitted
with the relevant exhibits identified and any new evidence removed. The Tribunal,
thus, informed the Parties that it would disregard the document in these circumstances,
subject to the Claimants having the right to make an application to the Tribunal for its
inclusion in the record. Ultimately, the document was revised by the Claimants to
include all required exhibit references and was used during the Claimants’ oral closing

statement. For its part, the Respondents submitted demonstrative exhibits RD-1 to

7 xs, R-142, R-182 and R-183

33.

RD-6 on 3 March 2019 and introduced additional demonstrative exhibits (RD-7 to RD-

The Hearing was held in Paris, France over 8 working days from 4 to 14 March 2019.

A written transcript (“TR”) and audio recording were made of the Hearing.

An updated version of the agreed Joint Factual Chronology was submitted by the
Claimants on behalf of the Parties on 5 April 2019.

On 26 April 2019, the Parties exchanged submissions on costs in support of their
respective claims for the costs of the proceedings. Reply costs submissions were

submitted, respectively, by the Claimants and the Respondent on 6 and 7 May 2019.

On | August 2019, with the Tribunal’s permission, the Respondent entered into the
record of the arbitration a copy of a decision of the Kurzeme Regional Court, dated 5
July 2019, together with an English translation. This decision was issued in civil
proceedings in Latvia that were originally initiated by Rixport against SJSC Airport in
March 2013, as further discussed in Section III below. On 16 August 2019, the
Respondent informed the Tribunal, as the Claimants also confirmed on 19 August
2019, that the Kurzeme Court’s decision had not been appealed and had therefore
become final, thus bringing to an end the corresponding litigation proceedings in Latvia

which had been running in parallel with this arbitration.

By letter, dated 4 November 2019, the Tribunal declared the arbitration proceedings

closed in accordance with Rule 38(1) of the Arbitration Rules.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

Before considering the Claimants’ claims, it is helpful to set out the Tribunal’s findings

on the principal facts that serve as the basis for those claims.

Although it has reviewed in detail all of the Parties’ factual allegations and the evidence
that has been submitted in support of them, the Tribunal has only undertaken in this

Section of the Award to provide a summary of those facts (and its assessment of the

40.

41.

42.

43.

same) that provide context for the claims. To the extent necessary, the relevant facts

are addressed in more detail in Sections V and VI below.

As mentioned above, this arbitration concerns investments said to have been made by
the Claimants through Rixport in a project for the development of land adjacent to the
Airport. The project was, as also stated above, the subject of four Land Lease
Agreements (the “Land Lease Agreements”) that were each entered into on 3
November 2006 between Rixport (then called SIA EBO International, but for
convenience referred to herein as Rixport both before and after it changed its name to
Rixport’) and SJSC Airport, respectively with respect to four parcels of land adjacent

to the Airport referred to in the Land Lease Agreements as Draws 1-4.9

The Land Lease Agreements were subsequently amended on 7 November 2007 (the

“2007 Amendments”) !° and 5 November 2010 (the “2010 Agreement”). !!

The Land Lease Agreements were awarded pursuant to a public tender process that was
launched by SJSC Airport in June 2006 after an earlier tender that had been announced
in November 2005 was discontinued in March 2006. The tenders were issued for the
purpose of procuring one or more agreements for the development of land adjacent to
the Airport in accordance with a so-called “Detailed Plan” prepared by SJSC Airport
for the northeastern sector of the Airport and approved by the Marupe Municipal
Council in 2003 (the “2003 Detailed Plan’’).!2

The Airport is located within the territory of the Marupe Municipality and is therefore
subject to its zoning regulations, as set forth in the Municipality’s Spatial Plan.!3 The
Construction Board of the Marupe Municipality is also the organ in charge of reviewing
applications for construction permits and deciding whether to grant them on the basis
of the applicable legislation and zoning regulations, as well as the Municipality’s

overall strategy. !4

It is common ground that the Airport is owned and operated by SJSC Airport, which

also owns the surrounding parcels of land that are the subject of the dispute in this

arbitration. SJSC Airport was originally a State-owned company created under the
laws of the USSR and was taken over by the Latvian Government upon Latvia’s
independence. On 21 April 1997, it became a joint stock company, although it
remained wholly State-owned, with the Ministry of Transport holding all of its capital
shares on behalf of the State. During the periods relevant to this arbitration, it was
managed by a Management Board and, until June 2009, a Supervisory Council. As
from June 2009, its Supervisory Council was eliminated and some of the Supervisory
Council’s functions were taken over by the shareholder.!5 The extent to which actions
taken by SJSC Airport are to be attributed to the Latvian State is, as discussed below,

one of the principal issues in this arbitration.

A new tender for the land adjacent to the Airport was announced on 16 June 2006, and
SJSC Airport issued tender documents including a Tender Regulation, a draft Tender
Land Lease Agreement, City Construction Regulations and a map of the north-eastern

sector of SJSC Airport’s territory.

Rixport submitted its Tender Application (the “Tender Application”) on 18 August
2006, and it was announced on 4 October 2006 that it had won the tender.!© After a
period of negotiations, the Land Lease Agreements were entered into on 3 November
2006 for each of the four Draws. As discussed further below, each of the agreements
was concluded for a period of 25 years, subject to possible extension. Under the
Technical Business Proposal annexed to the Land Lease Agreements, Rixport
undertook to use the land for the construction of hotels, conference and exhibition
facilities, a business park and greenery and recreational areas (the “Technical Business

Proposal”).!7

In the event, however, nothing was constructed by Rixport. The construction of an
office building on part of Draw 2 was commenced, but not completed, by one of its
affiliates. Under the 2010 Agreement, Rixport returned Draw 4 to the Airport as of 1
January 2011. In May 2013, Rixport purported to cancel the Land Lease Agreements
for Draws 2 and 3, and in March 2014 it purported to cancel the Land Lease Agreement
for Draw 1. In parallel, Rixport initiated proceedings in March 2013 before the Riga
Regional Court (which were transferred to the Kurzeme Regional Court) in which it

requested the court to cancel the Land Lease Agreements for Draws 1-3 and award

compensation to Rixport in an amount in excess of EUR 24 million.!8 The court (and
subsequent court decisions culminating in the judgment of 5 July 2019 mentioned

above) rejected Rixport’s claims.

The Claimants have taken the position in this arbitration, as Rixport did before the
Latvian courts, that Rixport’s development plans were thwarted by “constant changes
to the SJSC Airport’s development and master plans and the public detailed plan, thus
postponing any planning or construction into an unforeseeable future,” while Rixport
was meanwhile obligated to pay rent on the leased land and incur other expenses that

exhausted all of the capital from the Claimants’ investments. !9

The Respondent has, in turn, disputed that SJSC Airport prevented Rixport from
proceeding with the development of the leased land and has attributed Rixport’s failure
to progress the project to the deterioration of the Latvian economy following the global
financial crisis in 2008, which made Rixport’s project unrealistic and unprofitable “in
the foreseeable future.”20 In the circumstances, according to the Respondent, “Rixport
sought to buy time... .”2! Thus, the Respondent notes that “Rixport did not secure
financing for the project, did not apply for construction permits, and never began

construction.”22

After a period of “unsuccessful settlement discussions” in 2013, 2014 and 2015, the
Respondent notes that SJSC Airport notified Rixport by letter, dated 18 May 2015, of
the cancellation of the Land Lease Agreements for Draws 1-3 as a result of Rixport’s
defaults, in particular its failure to pay rent and penalties owed as of 30 April 2015.23
On 16 December 2016, SJSC Airport commenced proceedings against Rixport before
the Riga District Court to request that the Land Lease Agreements be cancelled on the
basis of Rixport’s non-payment, and, by a judgment issued on 18 December 2017, the

court granted SJSC Airport’s request.24

As this judgment was not appealed, there does not appear to be any dispute between

the Parties that the Land Lease Agreements were cancelled by no later than that date.

The facts relevant to the present arbitration are now considered in more detail.

A. The Claimants’ Investments in Rixport

Rixport was incorporated as a Latvian company, with EBO as its sole shareholder, on
15 March 2006 for the purpose of tendering for the Land Lease Agreements.2> EBO
was, in turn, then wholly owned by EBO Eiendom AS, a Norwegian company, which
was jointly owned by two Norwegian companies, EBO Gruppen AS (owned by Mr.
Roger Eide) and Staur Holding AS (which was owned by members of the @sthus
family, including Mr. Bernt @sthus).2© The EBO and Staur groups, according to Mr.

   

@sthus, “had long experience from developing real estate proje

 

's,” although they had
no previous experience developing real estate in Latvia, and the Airport project was
“substantially larger” than any project they had developed before.” It appears from
the evidence that at some point during 2008, Staur acquired the EBO group’s interest

in EBO Eiendom AS.28

EBO’s initial equity investment in Rixport was LVL 2,000, which, as at 1 January
2005, was the equivalent of EUR 2,846, for 20 shares in an amount of LVL 100 each.29

On or around 12 May 2006 (or 22 August 2006), EBO entered into a Shareholders
Agreement with Vitrium AS, a Latvian company owned by Mr. Petter Lundeby, which
provided for the issuance of 13,580 additional Rixport shares in an amount of LVL 100
per share, with EBO to subscribe to 6,780 additional shares and Vitrium AS to
subscribe to 6,800 shares, with the result that EBO and Vitrium would each hold 50%
(6,800) of Rixport’s shares.30 In the event, Mr. Lundeby made his investment through
two Norwegian companies, Vitrium International AS and Vitrium Development AS,
and, as at 29 December 2006, EBO and the Vitrium companies respectively owned
7,028 Rixport shares, which they had each purchased for LVL 702,800, or the

equivalent in each case, as at 1 January 2005, of EUR | million. As at that date,

Rixport’s share capital, thus, totaled LVL 1,405,600, i.e., the equivalent of EUR 2
million.3! No explanation has been provided by the Parties concerning the increase in
the number of Rixport’s issued shares, as compared to the number described in the

Shareholders Agreement.

Subsequently, on or around 19 January 2007, Rox purchased 10% (1,406) of Rixport’s
then outstanding shares from EBO and the Vitrium companies, with EBO and the
Vitrium companies each selling Rox 5% of Rixport’s shares. The total amount paid by
Rox was NOK 70 million, or the equivalent of EUR 8.4 million (although EBO and the
Vitrium companies had only paid the equivalent of EUR 200,000 to Rixport for those

shares when they were initially issued).32

The following year, on or around 17 April 2008, Staur, in turn, acquired an 18% interest
in Rixport by purchasing 2,530 shares from one or both of the Vitrium companies.33
There is no evidence concerning the amount paid by Staur for those shares.34 Pursuant
to an agreement dated 7 July 2008, EBO acquired the Vitrium companies’ remaining
27% interest in Rixport (apparently held at that point by Vitrium International AS) for
a price of EUR 18.9 million by providing Vitrium International AS with a “debt
certificate” in a corresponding amount.35 At or around the same time, Vitrium

International AS acquired a 37.5% shareholding in EBO from EBO Eiendom AS.3©

As a result of these transactions, the Vitrium companies ceased to be direct
shareholders in Rixport (although Vitrium International AS apparently continued to
hold an indirect interest through EBO),37 and the Claimants in this proceeding, EBO,

Staur and Rox, respectively held 72%, 18% and 10% of Rixport’s shares.

Although the Rixport share registry does not record the transfer of shares in Rixport

from Vitrium International AS to EBO before 26 January 2011,38 the corresponding

increase in EBO’s shareholding nevertheless appears to have occurred in 2008,

according to EBO’s annual report for that year.39

It has not been disputed that the Claimants’ respective shareholdings in Rixport have

not subsequently changed.

Based on Rixport’s accounts, it appears that EBO, Staur and Rox also made loans to
Rixport that, as of 31 December 2016, totaled EUR 8.9, 1.1 and 0.5 million,
respectively.49 Money also appears to have been advanced by EBO Eiendom AS,

although it is not a Claimant in this proceeding.

It is undisputed that the funds contributed by the Claimants to Rixport were
subsequently used by it to make payments to SJSC Airport under the Land Lease
Agreements and for other expenses incurred in connection with the development

project.4!

B. The Procurement of the Land Lease Agreements

As mentioned above, SJSC Airport organized a tender for the development of land
adjacent to the airport in November 2005. That tender envisaged the development of
a hotel and conference center, but it was discontinued in March 2006, according to the
Respondent “due to changes to the development plans for the Airport, namely the
introduction of [a] finger pier building and expansion of the landside terminal (known
as stages 5 and 6 of the development, respectively).”42 As discussed further below, it
was replaced by a broader tender in June 2006, which was the basis for the Land Lease

Agreements that were ultimately concluded between Rixport and SJSC Airport.

The Airport’s development plans were developed by SJSC Airport and, according to
the Respondent, were the subject of “frequent ... review and discussion, taking into
account a number of elements and factors, such as flights, passenger numbers, cargo
volumes, required infrastructure capacity, or the funds available for infrastructure
development.”43 During the course of 2006, SJSC Airport was anticipating, in the

context of the economic conditions prevailing at the time, that there would be a need

to develop the infrastructure of the Airport to accommodate increased use and a
growing volume of passengers. It appears that, at the time, SJSC Airport considered
that the Airport would need to be able to accommodate up to about 7.5 million
passengers in the near to medium term,“4 although in 2006 only 2.5 million passengers

used the Airport (a nearly 150% increase since 2004).45

There is a dispute between the Parties, which is considered further below, as to whether
the development plans for the Airport at the time of the June 2006 tender (and
thereafter) were the product only of SJSC Airport’s internal deliberations or whether
they were dictated or otherwise influenced by the Ministry of Transport. It is the
Claimants’ position that the Latvian Government played a “key role” in the Airport’s
development and effectively directed the related actions of SJSC Airport,46 which the
Claimants have more generally characterized as being a de facto organ of the Latvian

State.47

In this regard, the Claimants have argued that SJSC Airport is effectively controlled by
its sole shareholder, the Ministry of Transport. In support of their position, the
Claimants have referred, inter alia, to the laws governing the operation of SJSC Airport
and to various decisions and policy making acts of the Government, including, with
regard to the June 2006 tender, an Ordinance of the Cabinet of Ministers dated 6 July
2006, approving the “Operational Strategy 2007-2009 of the Ministry of Transport,”48
and the 12 July 2006 Order of the Cabinet of Ministers “to expand the Airport and

transform it into a business area.”49

The Operational Strategy states that it is a “policy planning document ensuring
medium-term planning of the ministry’s activities in the transport and communication
industry on the basis of approved policy documents.”59 It “defines the goals to be
attained and results of the policy in the industry until 2009” and other matters until
2013 in order, inter alia, “to improve the middle term budget planning process.”5! With
respect to the Airport specifically, the Operational Strategy includes among the “main

tasks” referred to therein the Airport’s “territorial development,” including “finish[ing]

construction of the airport’s business park by 2010.”52 In addition, and among other
documents relevant to the June 2006 tender, the Claimants have referred to the Ministry
of Transport’s National Transport Development Programme (2000-2006), as updated
in 2002, which envisages the reconstruction of the Airport’s passenger terminal and the
development of the infrastructure of the Airport’s “territory’;>3 the Ministry’s
Transport Development Guidelines 2007-2013;54 and the Ministry’s Operational
Programme “Infrastructure and Services 2007;"55 all of which, according to the
Claimants, “defined the tasks to be implemented at the . .. Airport under the instruction

and management of the Ministry.”>°

68. Whether or not these government planning and policy documents and decisions have
any bearing on the Claimants’ claims, which the Respondent disputes,>7 it is common
ground that the June 2006 tender took into account SJSC Airport’s then Airport
terminal expansion plans and envisaged the development of a business park in addition

to hotels, a conference center, exhibition facilities and a recreational area.

69. As stated above, the June 2006 tender concerned four separate plots of land (referred
to as Draws 1, 2, 3 and 4). The Draws were intended for different development
purposes, and applicants could tender for one or more Draws, provided that they all
had to bid for Draw 1. The Tender Documents included a Tender Regulation;>8 a draft
Tender Land Lease Agreement;>? a map of the north-eastern sector of the Airport’s
territory, including the four Draws; and a document referred to as “City Construction
Regulations;”6! in addition to a form for the tender security; a form for the financial
proposal; and maps showing the utilities located on the Draws. The Tender Regulation

provided, inter alia, that:62

70. According to the Claimants, the project was brought to the attention of Staur by Mr.
Lundeby in late 2005, soon after the announcement of the first tender in November of
that year.63 Mr. Lundeby had been engaged in business operations in Latvia since
1997, and when he learned of the Airport project, he approached Staur, apparently with
a view to partnering with Staur or a Staur entity in bidding for the project. As already

noted, Rixport was created in March 2006 as a vehicle for the bid.

63 Lundeby first witness statement 5.

71. According to Mr. Lundeby, following the new public tender announced in June 2006,
he worked “intensively through the summer of 2006 preparing the tender application”
together with Staur.°4 He testified that drawings were prepared by an architectural
firm engaged for this purpose (Griff architects), based on the “conceptual project
produced by SJSC Airport,” and that a detailed project schedule was prepared together
with a technical business plan.©> The work of Mr. Lundeby and Staur culminated in
the submission of a Tender Application by Rixport for all four of the Draws on 18
August 2006.%

72. In its Tender Application, Rixport stated:67

EBO is convinced about prospects of developing the Riga International
Airport into a leading Northern European business centre.

EBO has an intention to participate in development of the Riga
International Airport into a leading European destination and hub for air
traffic between East and West Europe, as well as into a leading destination
for international conferences, trade fairs, exhibitions (“expo”) and
business venues in the Northern Europe. Opportunity to expand business,
to participate in conferences and to enjoy entertainment events and shows
with easy and fast access by low cost and convenient air transport and to
choose accommodation based on budgets and preferences represent a
strong business case.

EBO is confident in its ability to create synergies between various business
functions to be represented in the airport area in a way which will be
unique among airport areas in Europe. The design and functional
description of the business park in this proposal will facilitate attraction
of business and leisure travelers from all of Europe and beyond it.

To achieve the described vision EBO believes that a holistic approach
must be applied for the development of the total area connected to the
existing airport, i.e. the future business activities shall me [sic] merged
with the new airport to create optimal synergies between both components.

23. Rixport further specified that the volume of construction contemplated would amount
to approximately 300,000 square meters, with a total financial investment by Rixport

of slightly more than EUR 400 million, broken down as follows:

e¢ EUR 200 million for the development of Draw 1, which would be developed

in a first stage within 36 months and comprise a combination of three hotels (a

64 Ta. at (7.

4+ star, a 4 star and a budget hotel) and conference/convention, exhibition

(“expo”), office and parking facilities;

e EUR 140 million for the development of Draw 2 as a leading regional office

park within 36-60 months;

e EUR 60 million for the development of Draw 3 for major landmark
international or local head offices in office towers, with parking, within 36-60

months; and

e EUR 1-20 million for the development of Draw 4 as either (i) a landscaped
area with recreational zones or (ii) such an area incorporating additional expo

space, within 36-60 months.

Rixport, thus, undertook that the total time for planning and construction of all Draws
would not be longer than 60 months, but that Draw 1 would be completed within a
shorter term of no longer than 36 months. It added that if it was awarded all Draws,
the time for implementation of Draws 2-4 could be adjusted according to the Tender
Regulations. A more detailed breakdown of Rixport’s “progress plan” was set forth in
Rixport’s accompanying Technical Business Proposal in the form of a Gantt Chart for

each of the Draws.®8

Rixport also undertook that financing of the development would consist of a
combination of equity and bank loans, with EBO Gruppen AS and Staur Holding AS
guaranteeing that they would provide Rixport with a “total financial investment in the
amount of up to 200 million Euros.” In addition, the Technical Business Proposal
included letters from Rezidor SAS, Ryanair and Choice Hotels Scandinavia expressing
interest in operating the three hotels that Rixport proposed to construct on Draw 1,
Rixport’s proposal being that the “main” airport hotel (to be operated by Rezidor)
would be connected to the airport “under roof cover,” with direct access to exhibition
and business centres.70 The other two hotels are described in the proposal as a
“business hotel” to be operated by Choice International and a “budget hotel” to be

operated by Ryanair.

Notwithstanding the size of the financial commitment undertaken in the Tender
Application, there is little evidence before the Tribunal that the project was the subject
of substantial, if any, meaningful due diligence. In his evidence, Staur’s Mr. @sthus
stated that “the project had a strong commercial rationale.”7! However, he
acknowledged that, prior to submitting the Tender Application, neither Rixport nor its
investors engaged any outside consultants to value or perform any due diligence on the
project.72 Rather, he testified that a “form of ... spreadsheet” was prepared internally,
with input provided by Mr. Rune Enge, the CFO of Linstow, a Norwegian real estate
developer active in Latvia and with whom Mr. @sthus had a close relationship.73 The
spreadsheet has not been produced in the arbitration, however, because, according to
Mr. @sthus, it was lost as the result of a computer server crash before the arbitration
commenced.74 Nor have the Claimants produced any other documents evidencing the
due diligence, if any, that Rixport or its investors carried out internally in advance of
bidding for the project. During the hearing, Mr. Lundeby was examined at some length
about other kinds of due diligence that might have been performed (e.g., with respect
to such matters as the existing legal and regulatory framework applicable to the
development work to be carried out). However, he had no personal involvement in any

such due diligence or specific knowledge about how it might have been carried out.75

Despite the apparent lack of significant due diligence, Mr. Osthus testified that he was
confident in the “strong commercial” rationale of the project.”© This appears, from his
evidence, to have stemmed from the robust state of the Latvian real estate market at the
time. Mr. Osthus stated at the Hearing: “... the Latvian real estate market had grown
for quite some while and at a high pace. There were no clouds on the horizon at the
time.”77_ He further noted that: “Latvia, or Riga more specifically, was the most
popular target for the pension funds and for the other real estate investors in Europe [in

2006 and 2007]. So we had a perfect timing coming in at that point.”78

Mr. @sthus’ confidence was also evidently buoyed by the success of his past real estate
development activities, which he explained had prospered based on a business model

under which tenants for the buildings to be constructed were procured in advance of

construction and the buildings were then sold to investors prior to construction based
on the future cash flows that could be expected to be generated by the tenants that had

been procured.79

According to Mr. @sthus, Rixport’s decision to proceed with the project was also
founded on the assumption that “the plan for the expansion of the airport was done and
budgeted for, and ready to implement,” i.e., that there would be no changes to the
Airport’s development plans that would interfere with or alter the key assumptions

underlying Rixport’s Technical Business Proposal.80

In this regard, both Mr. @sthus and Mr. Lundeby contended in their evidence that, as
stated by Mr. Lundeby: (i) the “main driver for the economy of the project was to build
a hotel with direct access to the terminal;” and (ii) “the hotel close to the terminal had
to be built first” because the “other buildings had little or no stand-alone value without

the hotel connecting it to the airport terminal.” 8!

According to Mr. Osthus:82

The working hypothesis was that early construction of the first airport
hotel in Latvia - also the only one with direct access to the airport - and
the revenue from parking substantially would reduce the financial risk
related to the project. The risk mitigation would take several forms: a)
The first hotel would in itself generate an immediate valuation boost, and
help reduce equity needs, as it was highly attractive as an acquisition
target for long term real estate investors, b) revenue from parking this
close to the airport had the potential to cover operational cost, and hence
reduce the risk related to potential delays and c) on a different level, it
would pave the ground for the next development steps. The construction
of the hotel and the parking facilities first was also crucial for the
subsequent development; it had to commence first, to avoid that access to
other facilities was through a construction site.

Although Mr. @sthus acknowledged that the Tender Regulation contained no
representation that the Airport’s then development plan might not change83 — to the
contrary, it expressly contemplated “possible amendments” to the 2003 Detailed Plan

and required the winner of the tender to “coordinate its plan of development with the

Airport” and any such amendments*4 - it is the Claimants’ case, based on the evidence
of Mr. @sthus, that, in July 2006, prior to the Tender Application being submitted, he
was given “the impression” that the Airport’s development plan was not subject to
change. He claims that this was suggested to him at a meeting convened at Mr. Osthus’
request with the then-Minister of Transportation, Mr. KriSjanis Peters, and Mr. Ainars
Slesers, who Mr. @sthus described as a prominent figure in Latvian politics.85
Although he was not then serving in the Latvian Government, Mr. Slesers was a
previous Deputy Prime Minister of Latvia, former Minister of Transportation and
Deputy Mayor of Riga who, according to Mr. @sthus, continued to wield influence
within the Latvian Government and was “clearly understood” to be the Minister of
Transportation’s “boss.”86 Mr. Slesers subsequently replaced Mr. Peters as the
Minister of Transportation in November 2006, and Mr. Peters was then appointed
Chairman of SJSC Airport’s Supervisory Council in January 2007 and later that month
Chairman of its Management Board.87 Mr. Slesers would subsequently remain in his
position until March 2009, when the first of several successive Ministers took his
place.88 Mr. Peters, meanwhile, would remain Chairman of SJSC’s Management

Board until December 2010, when the entire Management Board was replaced.89

According to Mr. Osthus, Mr. Slesers explained his vision for the Airport at the July
2006 meeting, including the need for a four-star hotel to be connected to the Airport.
He also allegedly “confirmed that there was a deadline to develop the business park by
2010” and that “the finance was secured in terms of budgets to do this.”99 There is,
however, no written record of this meeting or of the alleged assurances orally given to

Mr. @sthus by Mr. Slesers in the presence of the then-Minister of Transport.

It is nevertheless Mr. Osthus’ evidence that he gave the “green light” for Rixport to
submit the Tender Application on 18 August 2006 after he received Mr. Slesers’

replied on 13 and 21 September 2006.92 In its letter, dated 21 September 2006, Rixport
provided further details, inter alia, concerning the buildings that it proposed to
construct, its investment plan and available finance, with annual investment in the
project progressively increasing from EUR 20 million in 2007 to EUR 140 million in
2011. Rixport noted: “[The] exact financing scheme, including required equity volume
and arrangement with the bank objectively depends on [a] number of circumstances,
like the size of the project finally granted under the tender, particular development
stage, as well as on type of the project (facilities). Taking into account the size,
expected lengths and complexity of the project, the financing scheme and gearing may
differ and be changed as may be required from time to time. The final sourcing and

lending will depend on tenant demand and market circumstances.”

On 28 September 2006, the Management Board of SJSC Airport voted to accept
Rixport’s bids for all four Draws, subject to certain conditions.9? The decision of the
Management Board was then approved by the Supervisory Council of SJSC Airport on
2 October 2006,94 and Rixport was announced as the winner of the tender on 4 October
2006,%5 following which Rixport and the Airport entered into negotiations to finalize

the terms of the Land Lease Agreements.

Rixport has contended that the Ministry of Transport was also involved in the
negotiation of the Land Lease Agreements,°® although the only example of such
involvement to which it has referred is a meeting that was held on 20 October 2006
among Rixport, representatives of SJSC Airport’s Supervisory Board and then-
Minister Peters.97 It is common ground that the meeting was requested by Rixport in
order to obtain the Minister’s support for the inclusion in the leases of an “investment
protection clause” in the event of their termination or expiration.°8 Mr. Osthus, who
attended the meeting together with Mr. Lundeby for Rixport, testified that, during the
meeting, the Minister “gave his support to” the change requested by Rixport and that
Rixport was “advised to take this to the airport with this recommendation, and it was

implemented.”99 The only written record of the meeting, however, is contained in two

letters, dated 23 and 24 October 2006, from Rixport to Mr. Dzintars Pomers, the then-

Chairman of SJSC Airport’s Management Board.

88. In the first, Rixport recorded: !00

During the meeting, [Rixport] presented its land development project to
the participants of the meeting, as well as expressed concerns on
observation of investment protection terms in the proposed lease
agreements as required in order to have sound economical basis for
successful completion of the project.

During the meeting we got [the] impression that it is policy of the Riga
international Airport as well as its sole shareholder to ensure
economically grounded investment protection terms in accordance with
Latvian legislation and internationally accepted standards.

We were advised to submit the draft agreements with adjusted investment
protection terms to you directly. Therefore please find enclosed adjusted
text of the agreements in Latvian and English languages, which contain

the relevant investment protection principle . . . and which at the same
time fully correspond to Latvian laws and internationally accepted
standards.

We kindly ask you to review the enclosed drafts and accept for signing at
the Management Board as well as to obtain the required opinion of the
Supervisory Board.

89. In the second, Rixport stated: !0!

Pursuant to today’s telephone conversations of our legal counsel. . .. we
hereby submit the draft lease agreements with additional proposal for
clause 8.5, ensuring interests of Riga Airport. This investment protection
clause is based on our discussion in the meeting of October 20, 2006 with

. the Minister of Transportation, and . . . the Chairman of the
Supervisory Board of the Riga International Airport, and with Mr. Andulis
Zidkovs, the Member of the Supervisory Board of the Riga International
Airport.

Therefore please find enclosed adjusted text of the agreements in Latvian
and English languages, which contain the relevant investment protection
principle together with terms protecting interests of Riga Airport.... At
the same time, the clause fully corresponds to Latvian laws and
internationally accepted standards.

We kindly ask you to review the enclosed drafts and accept for signing at
the Management Board as well as to obtain the required opinion of the
Supervisory Board.

The adjusted text proposed by Rixport has not been produced by the Claimants,
however, and it is therefore not possible for the Tribunal to determine the extent to
which, if at all, Rixport’s proposed language for Clause 8.5 was adopted. The Tribunal
does have before it, however, an earlier exchange of letters on this subject between
Rixport and SJSC Airport, dated 17 and 19 October 2006, respectively, concerning
amendments to Clause 8.5 proposed by Rixport, with the proposed amended text that
was then being requested by Rixport set out.!02_ The language then proposed by
Rixport was rejected by SJSC Airport, and it is apparent from a comparison with Clause
8.5, as agreed, that none of the language then proposed found its way into the Land
Lease Agreements. In its letter, dated 17 October 2006, Rixport indicated that the
amendments being proposed were intended “to reflect application” of the “investment
protection terms” set forth in the BIT, given that, according to Rixport, “when applying
for the tender, . . . [it had] at great extent relied on . . . [those] investment protection
terms,” which it believed SJSC Airport “being the state owned company observes and
accepts.”!03 SJSC Airport responded, however, that Rixport could not properly refer
to the BIT, given that “the agreement on the lease of land . . . is a private law contract
and the aforementioned provisions of an intergovernmental agreement [do] not apply

to land lease relations between private law entities.” !04

As the Respondent has correctly noted, it is, in any event, not possible to determine
from the evidence if Minister Peters had specific input in respect of, or influence over,

any provision of the Land Lease Agreements. !05

It is, moreover, not disputed that SJSC Airport was not required, at least as a formal
matter, to obtain the approval of the Latvian Government, as the shareholder, before
entering into the Land Lease Agreements. The agreements were approved by SJSC’s
Management Board on 1 November 2006! and by its Supervisory Council on 2
November 2006.!07 The Land Lease Agreements were then executed and entered into

force on 3 November 2006. !08

C. The Land Lease Agreements

93. The four Land Lease Agreements are nearly identical, save that they have different
provisions concerning the intended uses and development timelines for each of the

Draws. !09

94. Each of the agreements includes six annexes, including the Technical Business
Proposal that formed part of Rixport’s Tender Application, the Tender Regulation and
a document referred to as “Construction provisions of the detailed planning of the NE
Sector of the Airport.”!!0 As the Respondent has noted, this was an extract from a
document prepared for SJSC Airport by Arhis, a Latvian architectural firm, and is
distinct from, and not to be confused with, the 2003 Detailed Plan approved by the

Marupe Municipal Council.!!!

95. The agreements also each provide for a term of 25 years, subject to possible extension

for an additional 25 years (Clauses 5.1 and 5.2).

96. Except in the case of Draw 4, which consisted of only one plot, each of the Draws was
subdivided into a number of parcels (“Land Plots’). SJSC Airport undertook to
transfer the Land Plots to Rixport, and Rixport undertook to develop them in
accordance with its Technical Business Proposal, the terms of the agreements, the 2003
Detailed Plan, the Latvian Law on Construction, the Law on Aviation, the General
Construction Regulations and requirements of other legal acts and the Tender
Regulations as well as the “Construction provisions of the detailed planning of the NE

Sector of the Airport,” as annexed to the agreements. ! !2

97. Under the lease for Draw 1, Rixport undertook to “ensure construction of 3, 3+ or 4
star hotels” and to “attract an hotel operator,” in addition to constructing on the part of
the land not reserved for the hotel(s), “a business park, which includes the construction,

creation and use of the institutions of transaction, shopping and/or services, governing,

109 Ex. C-38,

110 Bx. R59.

111 Ajthough the Claimants have contended that “it would clearly be reasonable to assume” that the “Construction provisions” in
question “were part of the 2003 Detailed Plan” (Cl. Reply $84), it has failed to explain why any such assumption should reasonably
have been made, and this does not appear consistent with the evidentiary record before the

culture, education, science and medicine.”!!3 Rixport was also to ensure “the

management and economic activity of the buildings included in the business park.”!!4

The Draw was to be developed to 50% of its maximum permissible construction density
within three years,!!5 provided, however, that the period for the development of one
of the Land Plots (B-18) was subject to being extended due to possible changes in SJISC
Airport’s development plans for the Airport.!!© This is a matter that was discussed
between Rixport and SJSC Airport prior to the conclusion of the Land Lease
Agreements. On 12 October 2006, Rixport informed SJSC Airport that, given that the
latter was reserving its right to postpone the development of parcel B-18, which was
intended to be used by Rixport for the main airport hotel, it was not “clear . . . when it
will be feasible to construct the connection of the 4+ star hotel with the airport (under
one roof).”!!7 Rixport therefore indicated that it wished “to retain the right to use other
parcels for construction of hotels provided it is necessary” and proposed that the “exact
description of the hotels in clause 2.1 of the Land Lease Agreement ... be... replaced
with a general reference to construction of hotels and other buildings,” !18 as, in fact,

occurred in the Land Lease Agreement, as finalized.

In the case of Draw 2, Rixport undertook to “ensure construction of office
buildings.” !!9 Construction was to commence within 24 months and to be developed

to 50% of the Draw’s maximum permissible construction density within five years. !20

The Land Lease Agreement for Draw 3, meanwhile, provided that Rixport would
“ensure construction of office buildings (towers)” and a parking lot.!2!_ No deadline
was specified for the commencement of construction. However, as in the case of Draw
2, Draw 3 was to be developed to 50% of its maximum permissible construction density

within five years. !22

The land that was the subject of Draw 4 was also to be developed within five years,
with no deadline specified for the commencement of development.!23 Rixport

undertook to “ensure development of a park and greenery zone.” !24

In each case, if Rixport’s development works were delayed for more than three months
following the deadline for completion, Rixport was obliged to pay SJSC Airport a
penalty of EUR 1,000 per week of additional delay. !25

The Land Lease Agreements provided for annual rental payments by Rixport in the
following amounts: (i) EUR 12 per m? for Draw 1; (ii) EUR 7 per m? for Draw 2; (iii)
EUR 16 per m? for Draw 3; and (iv) EUR | per m? for Draw 4,!26 with discounted
rates during the first two years “to facilitate possibilities of the LESSEE to ensure faster
development.” !27 The agreements also each required Rixport to make a one-time non-
refundable payment for the development and maintenance of infrastructure by SJSC

Airport for the Draws in an amount of EUR 150,000 per hectare of land. !28

Rixport was also responsible for the payment of real estate taxes for the leased land. !29

In addition, penalties were payable by Rixport in the event that it was late in paying the
amounts due to SJSC Airport under the agreements.!30 If Rixport failed to pay the
applicable real estate tax, then it would be paid by SJSC Airport, and Rixport would be

required to reimburse it together with a penalty. !3!

The Claimants have noted that a “key obligation” for SJSC Airport in each agreement
was “not to worsen the rights of the LESSEE provided in the Agreement for the whole
or a part of the leased LAND, not to lease and give permission to use or hold the whole
or any part of the leased LAND to this [sic] persons or in some other manner encumber

the LAND without a written consent of the LESSOR.” !32

Under Clause 8.5 of each lease (i.e., the provision that the Claimants say was adjusted
following Rixport’s meeting with Minister Peters on 20 October 2006), Rixport was
entitled to “get compensation for the market value of the Buildings” if an agreement
was either (i) terminated by SJSC Airport before its expiration or (ii) not prolonged for

an additional period of 25 years. !33

Each of the leases further provided that disputes that could not be resolved amicably
were to be referred to the Latvian courts, !34 although the Claimants, contrary to the
Respondent, have taken the position that the relevant provision was not an “exclusive”
forum selection clause. According to the Claimants, “it merely provides that the local
courts would be competent to decide on the claim,” without obligating Rixport to refer

claims to the domestic courts. !35

There are also a certain number of matters for which the Land Lease Agreements, as

concluded in November 2006, made no express provision:

First, as the Respondent has correctly observed, they did not provide for the expansion
of the Airport terminal in accordance with any particular technical plan or timeline. !36
To be sure, Rixport was required to take account of SJSC Airport’s detailed planning,
as incorporated in the agreements. However, the agreements did not impose any

specific obligations on SJSC Airport in this regard.

Nor was the development of Draws 2-4 tied in any way, or made contingent upon, the
development of Draw 1.!37 Although the Claimants have argued that Draw | was
required to be developed first,!38 each of the Land Lease Agreements was a stand-
alone agreement, and Rixport’s obligations under the agreements for Draws 2-4 did not
depend on the progress of Draw 1’s development, even if, as the Claimants have
contended, Draw | was intended to be developed by Rixport before the other Draws.
Nor was the development of Draw | stated to be dependent upon parcel B-18 being

delivered first.

In addition, as the Respondent has argued, !39 the Land Lease Agreement for Draw 1
did not require that Rixport be provided with any specific type of access between any
of the buildings to be constructed and the Airport terminal, other than, arguably, as
stated in Rixport’s Technical Business Proposal, that the “main” airport hotel would be
“connected” to the Airport “under roof cover,” which could have taken the form of a

tunnel, a covered bridge or walkway.

D. Amendments to the Land Lease Agreements

After the Land Lease Agreements were signed, it is the Claimants’ position that
Rixport commenced its work, including planning construction work and initiating
commercial negotiations with tenants and operators of hotels. According to the
Claimants, the first hotel was designed in early 2007 and Rixport “was ready to
commence construction . . . shortly after having entered into the Land Lease
Agreements.” !40 It is nevertheless apparent from the evidence that: (i) relatively
little work was carried out; (ii) Rixport had not applied for any construction
permits, let alone commenced any construction; and (iii) Rixport had by April 2007
fallen several months behind the high-level work programme that it had submitted

together with its Tender Application.

As the Respondent has noted, without this being contested: “By April 2007 the
Claimants had not yet concluded a contract [with a consultant] for [the] planning and
permitting process .... They had not registered the leased land in the Lease Registry
.... And they only engaged a contractor for the geological survey of the leased land on
15" June 2007.”!4! The Respondent further observes that there is no evidence “of any
attempts to pre-sell” any office buildings by April 2007, in accordance with the

Claimants’ alleged business model. !42

The Claimants have argued that, insofar as there were any delays, this was the fault
of SJSC Airport and the Latvian Government because, almost immediately after
the Land Lease Agreements were signed, Rixport was informed that changes would
be made to the plans for the Airport’s development that could affect the land leased

by Rixport.

According to Mr. Lundeby, who was then Rixport’s CEO, Rixport was told by SJSC
Airport that the development plans would be changed “[s]hortly after we had signed
the Land Lease Agreements” and that, as early as December 2006, Rixport knew that
Mr. Slesers, the newly-appointed Minister of Transport, had “bigger plans” for the
Airport.!43 The Claimants have also referred to reports in the Latvian media in January
2007 that the new Minister had established as a goal for the Airport “reaching 30
million serviced passengers in the future.”!44 These reports are consistent with a
“Declaration” of the Latvian Cabinet of Ministers, dated 7 November 2006, that the
Cabinet would “encourage the construction of an essentially new international Riga
airport with the goal of reaching 30 million serviced passengers in the future” (without
any timeframe being specified, however).!45 The Claimants assert that the
“Respondent's target of reaching 30 million passengers a year had a significant impact
on the Claimants’ project,” !46 and it is Mr. Lundeby’s evidence that this “explains why
Rixport did not apply for any construction permits shortly after having signed the Land

Lease Agreements.” !47

The Claimants have failed to establish, however, that the allegedly new passenger
target of the new Minister was unknown to Rixport when it entered into the Land Lease
Agreements in November 2006. To the contrary, as the Respondent has noted, the
Claimants’ position is inconsistent with the Claimants’ own evidence and assertions
several years later that the Claimants’ bid was based on the expectation that the Airport
terminal would be expanded “over the long term” to be able to accommodate 30 million
passengers per year.!48 Moreover, in commencing this arbitration, the Claimants
themselves contended that “[d]uring the negotiations regarding Rixport’s tender
proposal, the Latvian Minister of Transport at that time made clear that the basis for
the development plans was that the airport would serve up to 30 million passengers on

an annual basis.” !49

Thus, the announcement of this supposedly new goal in December 2006 should not, as
Mr. Lundeby has testified, have had any effect on the Claimants’ development plans

during the months immediately following the signature of the Land Lease Agreements.

The Tribunal notes in this connection that, while Rixport indicated in a PowerPoint
presentation dated 11 December 2006, that SJSC Airport’s terminal expansion plans
would “cater for” passenger growth to “20-30 million in the long term future,” nothing
is stated in the presentation about this “long term” goal affecting Rixport’s

development plans for Draws 1-4 or the agreements entered into with SJSC Airport. !50

In any event, it does not appear that the aspirations expressed by the Cabinet of
Ministers on 7 November 2006 were, in fact, subsequently acted upon by SJSC Airport.
When discussed by SJSC Airport’s Supervisory Council in January 2007, they were
greeted with skepticism, and it was resolved that a work group should be established
“to assess the airport development by involving experts and specialists of the aviation
sector.”!5! In this regard, the uncontradicted evidence of Mr. Saveljevs, the Director
of SJSC Airport’s Commercial Department since September 2007, was that SJSC
Airport had its “own operational plans, which were based on the forecasts of
passengers, which were prepared by the consultants in the industry, such as NACO,”

and that SJSC Airport did not adopt plans “proposed by any politician.” !52

It is nevertheless common ground between the Parties that changes were made to SJSC
Airport’s terminal expansion plans in 2007, and it is apparent from the evidence that
those plans were discussed with and approved by the Ministry of Transport at a meeting
on 21 May 2007.!53 However, the plan then adopted appears to have differed from
the expansion plan that Minister Slesers may originally have had in mind, presumably
in view of the input of the work group that the Supervisory Council had decided to

establish in January 2007.

Thus, while SJSC Airport decided in May 2007 to revise its terminal expansion project,
the plan then adopted was intended to enable the Airport to accommodate 15 to 20
million passengers per year and not 30 million, as Minster Slesers may have hoped in
November 2006. As Mr. Saveljevs explained, the revised plan maintained the same 5"
and 6" stages of development already envisaged, but contemplated that they would
proceed simultaneously, rather than sequentially, thus requiring a temporary terminal

to be constructed pending the work to be carried out.!54_ Mr. Saveljevs testified that

there was also a “long-term” plan for a 7" stage of development.!55 However, there is

no evidence that this corresponded to Minister Slesers’ thinking in November 2006.

As SJSC Airport’s new plans were being developed, it informed Rixport, by letter,
dated 27 April 2007, that: !56

At the moment, based on the proposal of the Ministry of Transport and
pursuant to assignment of the airport the specialists of the design office
“Arhis” together with the consultants of the office “Aviaplan” (Norway)
are reviewing the possible options for extension of the passenger terminal
with the aim to ensure service to 15 to 20 million passengers per year in
perspective.

Reviewing of the developed options by participation of representatives of
the Ministry of Transport, analysis of the options and taking of the final
decision is planned in week 20, 21 of 2007.

After taking of the respective decisions, we will immediately provide
information to you regarding the possible changes in the planning of
territory.

SJSC Airport’s April 2007 letter was followed by a further letter, dated 21 June 2017,
in which SJSC Airport advised Rixport that, based on the new plans developed for
SJSC Airport by Arhis, and accepted by the Ministry of Transport on 21 May 2007,
Land Plots B-18 and B-16 in Draw 1 would be “necessary for further development of
the Airport.” SJSC Airport therefore proposed that amendments be made to the Land
Lease Agreements according to which those plots would be removed from the
agreements, while an “analogue land plot in [the] business park of Airport — parcels

No. F-1, F-3 and B-3” would be added in their place. !57

Neither letter stated that the new development plan was intended to ensure the servicing

of 30 million passengers per year.

The Respondent has submitted that when SJSC Airport sent these letters to Rixport, it
considered that it “was still possible to negotiate an agreement, amending the
boundaries of the Draws ... as Rixport had taken no steps to develop the land.”!58

The Claimants dispute this, although they do not deny that no corresponding

construction permits had been applied for and that no construction work had begun.

Rixport also did not raise any objections to SISC Airport’s proposal.

Instead, Rixport responded to SJSC Airport by letter, dated the same day, in which it
indicated that it was willing to return the parcels in question, provided, however, that
the Land Lease Agreements would be amended to take into account, inter alia, the
value of the land plots being returned (which were foreseen to have direct access to the
Airport terminal), the fact that Rixport had been paying rent for areas that could no
longer be developed and that it had also “halted lease negotiations with large tenants
because of the uncertainty caused by changes to the terminal extension.”!59 The
Claimants argue that Rixport had no other option but to accept SJSC Airport’s proposal
and that “[t]his situation was a direct consequence of decisions regarding development
of the Airport by the Ministry of Transport.” !©0 However, it does not appear from the
evidence before the Tribunal that Rixport was coerced into agreeing to amend the Land
Lease Agreements, irrespective of the possible impact of any Ministry of Transport

decisions.

During the several months that followed, Rixport and SJSC Airport negotiated a series
of amendments to each of the Land Lease Agreements. The amended agreements were
executed on 7 November 2007.!6! During the course of the negotiations, Rixport took
the initiative of proposing (and obtaining) a number of amendments that differed from

or were supplemental to SJSC Airport’s initial proposals.

Thus, for example, while SJSC Airport initially requested only that Land Plots B-18
and B-16 in Draw | be returned in exchange for new Land Plots F-1, F-3 and B-3
(which covered an area of approximately the same size), Rixport proposed to return
Land Plot B-14 and part of Land Plot B-12 (in addition to Land Plots B-18 and B-16)
in exchange for two additional areas of land in Draw 1 (referred to as Land 2 and Land
3), which, together with the remainder of Draw | (referred to as Land 1), covered a
much larger area than the original surface area of Draw 1. Land 2 of Draw | was
situated in front of the existing terminal building and was to be used for the construction
of hotels, including in particular, what has been referred to as the “main” airport hotel,
which was to be connected to or have direct access to the terminal, together with

parking facilities, while Land 3 of Draw | was to be used for possible additional

parking facilities, a hotel above the parking, conference halls and office premises. In
addition, Rixport obtained the right to lease additional land in Draw 2 (Land Plots A-
18, A-16, D-15 and D-13), with the result that Rixport would, and ultimately did,

receive a much larger area of land under the amended leases for Draws | and 2.!62

The main additional terms of the amended leases were as follows:

First, the precise borders and total areas of Draw 1 were to be fixed later, with Land 2
and Land 3 to be transferred to Rixport after the development of SJSC Airport’s
“Technical project.”!©3 The total area was to be specified by no later than 30 June
2008, and, in the case of Land 2, the land was to be made available for construction
work by 1 January 2009.!64 No specific date was established for the delivery of Land
3, although its specific area was, as in the case of Land 2, to be identified by 30 June
2008.!65 In addition, all of Land 1, except Land Plots B-2 and B-4, was required to be
used by SJSC Airport during work on the extension of the Airport terminal, which was
stated to be planned for completion by September 2011. Thus, only two parcels of land
were available for development in Draw | as of the date of the amendments: Land Plots

B-2 and B-4 of Land 1.!66

In these circumstances, Rixport was granted significant rent holidays until it would be
placed in the position of being able to start development of the land that was not yet

available to it, in addition to rent discounts thereafter, !©7

Second, although in the case of Draws 2, 3 and 4, Rixport could carry out development
without restriction as from the date of the amendments, the deadlines for the
development of those Draws were extended to 1 August 2013 (in the case of Draws 2

and 3) and 1 September 2014 in the case of Draw 4.168

Third, the amended agreement for Draw 1 provided Rixport with “exclusive rights to
operate short term parking for the airport terminal.”!69 When the amendment was

entered into, SJSC Airport was operating a short-term parking facility on Land 2 of

Draw 1, which, as already mentioned, it undertook to vacate by | January 2009.
Rixport, meanwhile, was given the right under the amendment to construct a multi-
storey parking facility on Land 2 and was required to pay to SJSC Airport 10% of the
monthly turnover of that facility.!70 A dispute subsequently arose, as discussed further
below, concerning the nature of the “exclusive rights” accorded to Rixport under the
amended agreement and whether, as Rixport subsequently contended, they applied to
the parking facilities being operated by SJSC Airport on Land 2 prior to the

construction of Rixport’s own parking facilities.

Although, as just stated, the agreements, as amended, permitted Rixport to proceed
immediately with the development of Draws 2, 3 and 4 (and Rixport was not otherwise
prevented from doing so), Rixport failed to undertake any construction work, except
with respect to a single office building on Draw 2. After commencing work on the site
in May 2008 and obtaining a construction permit on 3 July 2008,!7! Rixport obtained
SJSC Airport’s agreement to allow the building to be developed by a wholly-owned
special purpose vehicle, SIA Rixport Office (““Rixport Office”), which then entered
into a Land Lease Agreement with SJSC Airport for the lease and development of the
land on 8 October 2008.!72 The lease provided for the completion of the office
building by 1 August 2013, consistent with the development deadline in Rixport’s

amended Land Lease Agreement for Draw 2.

Although no other construction work was undertaken by Rixport on any of the Draws,
Rixport nevertheless claims to have continued to invest substantial resources, during
the first part of 2008, in “develop[ing] the architecture of the business park” through
Griff, its architect for the project.!73. It also engaged Jones Lang LaSalle Hotels
(“Jones Lang”) to act as its advisor in securing an occupational lease or hotel operator
for “an upscale business hotel”!74 and to prepare a “Business Plan/Equity Investment
Memorandum” (the “Investment Memorandum”) to “serve as the basis for
negotiating a joint venture agreement between [the] existing shareholders of Rixport

... and a strategic equity partner” for the project. !75

The Investment Memorandum was issued in April 2008 and describes how Rixport

then planned to carry out the project. Although it can be seen from the Investment

Memorandum that Rixport still planned to develop all four of the Draws in a manner
that was broadly consistent with the Technical Business Proposal that was submitted
together with its Tender Application in 2006, the total anticipated development costs
appear to have increased by approximately 50% from EUR 400 million to EUR 600
million, and the planned development period had also more than doubled from 5 years
to 10-15 years from the date of the Investment Memorandum, with the result that
Rixport had decided to divide the project into two phases.!76 The first phase, for
which Rixport was seeking additional investment, was to be completed by the end of
2013, at a projected cost of approximately EUR 430 million, and was to include: (i) the
construction of seven office buildings, with construction commencing in stages
between 2008 and 2012; (ii) the construction of two hotels, with the construction of a
budget hotel to commence first in 2009 and the construction of a 4-star hotel connected
to the Airport terminal (the “main” Airport hotel) to commence in 2010; and (iii) the
development of Airport terminal parking between 2010 and 2013. Excluded from the
first phase were convention and exhibition facilities, a third hotel, more than half of the
contemplated office building space and the greenery area to be developed on Draw

4177

Under examination, the Claimants’ Mr. Osthus stated that Rixport received “indicative
interest” in the project from “several of the large investment banks.”!78 However, no
actual investment partners ever appear to have been found, and the Investment
Memorandum was “pulled”, according to Mr. @sthus, around the time of Lehman
Brothers’ collapse in September 2008 and the worldwide financial crisis that
ensued.!79 There is, moreover, no evidence, that Rixport had by that time secured any
binding commitments from any hotel operators for the planned hotels, including the
budget hotel, which, according to the Investment Memorandum, was still of interest to

Ryanair. !80

It is common ground that the financial crisis had a severe, detrimental effect on the
Latvian commercial real estate market,!8! as well as on the economies of Latvia and
the neighboring countries in the Baltic region, which also affected the expected

passenger growth of the Airport, at least in the near to medium term.

The deterioration of the economic climate in Latvia also appears to have had an impact
on the completion of the office building that Rixport Office had already begun to
construct on Draw 2. Construction was suspended in or around late 2008. According
to the Claimants’ Mr. Lundeby, “prices for construction had dropped substantially,”
and Rixport Office wished to renegotiate the construction contract with its contractor,
NCC Konstrukcija (“NCC”), which it was unable to do.!82 As a result, Mr. Lundeby
testified that the project was “put on hold.” !83 (Ultimately, as discussed below, the

building was never completed.)

Moreover, Rixport did not subsequently undertake to construct any of the other office
buildings that it had indicated in the Investment Memorandum that it planned to
construct between 2009 and 2013. Ina letter to SJSC Airport, dated 2 October 2009,
Rixport acknowledged that: “The progress of the Rixport office project has been
affected by the escalating global financial crisis since last fall and the deteriorating
medium term macroeconomic outlook for Latvia continuing into this year, in that the
Riga office market has substantially changed in terms of demand and rent levels relative

to the prevailing conditions when the project was commenced earlier in 2008.” !84

The Claimants have nevertheless contended in this arbitration that Rixport did not
proceed with the development of the office park and other facilities on Draws 2, 3 and
4 following the November 2007 amendments to the Land Lease Agreements because
they “were to be developed after the development of Draw | Land 2” (where the “main”
airport hotel was to be constructed).!85 According to the Claimants: “the undisputed
first step of the Claimants’ development project was to construct the Airport hotel” on
Draw 1, and the required Land Plots were not being made available by SJSC

Airport. !86

The Tribunal notes, however, that this contention is in tension with Rixport’s own
development plans, as set forth in the Investment Memorandum, which provided that
work on the business park would proceed first, with construction of the “main” airport
hotel not contemplated to commence until 2010. Rixport’s position is, moreover, not
supported by the terms of the Land Lease Agreements themselves, as amended in

November 2007, which did not make the development of Draws 2, 3 and 4 contingent

on the prior delivery of any part of Draw | and, in fact, did not contemplate, as already
indicated, that Land 2 of Draw 1 would be made available for construction before 1

January 2009.

The Claimants nevertheless have complained that the technical project for the Airport
was “constantly changing” in 2008.!87 While this is not disputed by the Respondent,
it is unclear what, if any impact, these changes had on Rixport’s development plans,
given that (i) construction of the “main” Airport hotel was not scheduled to commence
until 2010; (ii) Rixport had not yet secured an operator for that hotel; and (iii) the
changes in question did not prevent Rixport from commencing the development of the
business park (which it did in 2008, but later suspended for reasons having nothing to
do with SJSC Airport’s evolving development plans). It is, moreover, unclear how
viable the project remained in late 2008, after the start of the financial crisis and
Rixport’s apparent failure to attract an equity investment partner or otherwise to raise
the capital that would have been needed for it to complete the development work that

it had contracted to perform. !88

In June 2008, and again on 25 November 2008, SJSC Airport informed Rixport that
“there are several technical projects ongoing in the Airport in relation to ensuring the
future development plans of the Airport’s terminals.”!89 As a result, SJSC Airport
advised Rixport that, contrary to the amendment of the Land Lease Agreement
executed in November 2007 (at least in the case of Land 2 of Draw 1), Land 2 and
Land 3 of Draw 1 would not be available until 1 January 2010.!99 In the meantime,
SJSC Airport indicated that Rixport would not be charged rent and would instead be
asked to pay a smaller land reservation fee. No impacts were envisaged in respect of

Draws 2, 3 or 4.

By letter, dated 3 December 2008, Rixport requested that, in these circumstances, it: (i)
should be released from making infrastructure payments for Land 2 and Land 3 of Draw
1 until 1 March 2010; and (ii) should be granted a rent discount for Land Plots B-2 and
B-4 of Land | of Draw 1 until one year before the opening of the new Airport

terminal.!9! Rixport proposed to draft corresponding amendments to the Land Lease

187]. Mem. (114.

Agreement for Draw 1.!92 Rixport reiterated this request by letter, dated 5 January

2009.!93 It had also apparently lost interest by that time in developing Draw 4 and,

thus, proposed that the Land Lease Agreement for Draw 4 be terminated, with Rixport

to receive a rent holiday until the lease’s termination in addition to receiving back all

infrastructure payments already made by Rixport in respect of the Draw 4 land.!94

Although SJSC Airport was prepared to make certain related concessions to Rixport,

Rixport and SJSC Airport continued to engage in discussions throughout 2009 and into

2010 concerning additional potential amendments to the Land Lease Agreements

occasioned by, inter alia:

a draft “masterplan” for the Airport issued by the German construction
company, Hochtief, in April 2009, which Rixport considered would affect its
rights under the Land Lease Agreements for all of the Draws by, among other
things, moving the position of the Airport terminal to a new location, running
a railway through land leased to Rixport and requiring Rixport’s concept for

the business park to be changed; !95

the aborted negotiation and/or award of a public-private partnership (“PPP”)
contract in 2009 to TAV Airports Holding, a Turkish company, and SIA
Skonto Biive Consortium for the construction of a new Airport terminal and

other facilities; !96

a project developed during 2009 for the possible construction of a new Airport
terminal building for airBaltic, which Rixport also considered would

negatively affect its rights;!97 and

the opening of the 2003 Detailed Plan for changes by the Marupe Municipal

Council in order to take account of the airBaltic terminal plan.!98

Although the Hochtief “masterplan,” the PPP contract and the plan for a new airBaltic

terminal were never implemented, it is nevertheless the Claimants’ position that these

plans, for as long as they were outstanding, had significant implications for, and
interfered with the progress of, Rixport’s own development plans. Moreover, disputes
had also arisen between Rixport and SJSC Airport concerning unpaid rental and
infrastructure payments, which Rixport considered that it should not have to make in
the circumstances, and Rixport’s contention, which SJSC Airport rejected, that Rixport
had the right under the November 2007 amendment of the Land Lease Agreement for
Draw | to operate the existing parking facilities that SJSC Airport was operating on

Land 2 of Draw 1.!99

148. — Against this contentious background, Rixport and SJSC Airport engaged in a prolonged

 

period of iations that culmi din the si of an on 5 November
2010 further amending each of the Land Lease Agreements (defined in [41 above as
the “2010 Agreement”).2°0 The 2010 Agreement was followed by a subsequent
agreement, dated 30 December 2010, which formally terminated the Land Lease
Agreement for Draw 4 as of | January 2011, thus leaving only Draws 1, 2 and 3 to be

developed by Rixport.20!

149. The principal terms of the 2010 Agreement were as follows:

150. First, it was agreed that Rixport’s indebtedness to SJSC Airport in respect of unpaid
invoices for rent and infrastructure charges was to be reduced from EUR 3,040,306.80
to EUR 144,658.20, which Rixport undertook to pay in two equal parts on 15 December
2010 and 1 July 2011 (Clause 1.12). This reduction appears to have been the product
of Rixport being granted: (i) a 100% rent holiday in respect of all four Draws for the
period between 24 March 2010 and 18 August 2010, when the 2003 Detailed Plan was
opened for changes; (ii) a rent holiday on account of “encumbrances” (a possible
railway) for the period from 1 July 2009 until 31 December 2009 in respect of Land
Plots B-2 and B-4 of Draw | and for Draw 3; (iii) the release of Rixport from rent
payments for parts of Land | of Draw | until the removal of the encumbrance to those
parts; and (iv) credits in respect of Draw 4, which Rixport would be returning.202 In
addition, it was agreed that Rixport would make infrastructure payments only in respect
of the land fully available for development and transferred to the possession of Rixport

at the date of si of the which, ding to the included

Land | and Land 2 of Draw 2, Draw 3 and Draw No. 4 (although, as already stated,
Rixport was to receive credits in respect of Draw 4, which was to be returned).293

Infrastructure payments for the remaining land were to be made later.2°4

Second, Rixport was granted a number of rent holidays and discounts as from the date

of the agreement in respect of Draws 1, 2 and 3.205

Third, the deadlines for Rixport’s development of the leased land were postponed until
30 November 2015 in the case of Draws 2 and 3.29 In the case of Draw 1, the deadline
for the development of Land 1 was postponed until three years after SJSC Airport
informed Rixport “about removal of encumbrances and .. . about plans of development
of passenger terminals” relating “to the rights of’ Rixport and approved by SJSC
Airport’s Board (the “Notice about removal of encumbrances”).2° Special

provisions, as described below, pertained to Land 2 and Land 3 of Draw 1.

In the case of Land 2 of Draw 1, where Rixport’s “main” Airport hotel and terminal
parking facilities were to be developed, the 2010 Agreement catered for the possibility
that SJSC Airport might decide to construct a new terminal in addition to the existing
terminal (as was still being considered for airBaltic). The 2010 Agreement, thus,
specified that if SISC Airport “decides to construct a new passenger terminal separately
from the existing passenger terminal of the airport and not to extend the existing airport
terminal, or to construct a new passenger terminal and to extend the existing terminal,”
Rixport “has [the] right to construct the Hotel foreseen in the Lease Agreement . . . [for
Draw 1] with direct access to the main flow of people between passenger terminals of
the airport,” in which case Rixport and SJSC Airport would sign an agreement for the
lease of the land plot concerned and amend the lease for Draw | to exclude Rixport’s
right “to construct the Hotel in the Land 2 of Draw 1.”298 In addition, the party
developing the new terminal would have no right to develop or operate a hotel

connected to the terminal.

In the event, however, that SJSC Airport decided to extend the existing terminal and

not to construct a new passenger terminal, then Rixport would retain its right to develop

the hotel and parking facilities on Land 2 of Draw 1 as provided in the Land Lease
Agreement for Draw 1, as amended on 7 November 2007.20 In such case, Land 2 of
Draw | was to be developed “by constructing the hotel and parking, by commissioning
it and starting operations of the hotel simultaneously with commissioning of the
extended part of the terminal.”2!0 The agreement nevertheless at the same time

changed the borders of Land | of Draw 2.2!!

Although the 2010 Agreement did not state when a decision might be made concerning
the possible construction of a new terminal or when, in the alternative, an extended
terminal could be expected to be completed, it nevertheless provided that Rixport had
the “right to take over . . . Land 2 of Draw 1 and [the] long term parking which is
located on it, including rent of fixed assets of the Lessor . . . with a written request to
the Lessor 3 (three) months in advance, by concluding the respective agreement to the
Lease Agreement . . . [for Draw 1], including rent of the fixed assets.”2!2 In such case,
Rixport was to “pay rent ... in the amount of 10% ... from the turnover of [the] parking
operations ... plus applicable VAT, and ... rent for sq. m. of the Land 2 of Draw | in
the amount as determined in cl. 3.1 of the Lease Agreement for Draw 1 ....”2!3 This
provision was intended to address the dispute over Rixport’s right to exploit SJSC’s
parking facilities. However, the 2010 Agreement further provided that if Rixport
proceeded to develop its own multi-storey parking facility on Land 2 of Draw 1, it
would be required to remove SJSC Airport’s existing parking facilities at its own
expense.2!4 In addition, SJSC Airport retained the right to operate short-term parking

facilities of its own at the Airport.2!5

As for Land 3 of Draw 1, Rixport confirmed that it was ready to transfer that land back
to SJSC Airport if requested by SJSC Airport to do so by 31 December 2012.2!6 In
the event that SJSC Airport did not request the return of that land, the deadline for its

development remained undefined.?!7

Fourth, Rixport was to “be involved and take part in working groups of the Lessor
which are discussing future development plans of the land plots in the area of the

airport, if it might concern” Rixport.?!8

Finally, Rixport and SJSC Airport agreed that the 2010 Agreement would operate to
extinguish all past, present and future claims of Rixport and SJSC Airport against each
other “in relation to fulfillment of mutual obligations arising out of the Lease
Agreements for the period before signing of this Agreement, including, after payment

of the remaining debt indicated in cl. 1.12 of the Agreement .. . .”2!9

The 2010 Agreement therefore had the effect, according to the Respondent, of
“wip[ing] the slate clean” by establishing a new baseline for the relationship between

Rixport and SJSC Airport.220

Rixport has noted that “[n]o specific changes were made to the provisions in the 2007
Agreement that SJSC Airport was planning to complete the extension works of the new
airport terminal” by September 2011.22! However, neither the 2007 Amendments nor
the 2010 Agreement obliged SJSC Airport to do so. To the contrary, the November
2007 amendment of the Land Lease Agreement for Draw | expressly envisaged the
possibility that the extension works would not be completed by September 2011 and
provided that, if development of the Airport terminal(s) was delayed, the terms for
commencement and completion of development of Draw | by Rixport would be

“extended for the period equal to the respective delay upon request of” Rixport.222

The Claimants have argued that Rixport was “forced into accepting the 2010
Agreement.”223 However, there is no evidence that this was the case. Under
examination, Mr. @sthus acknowledged that Rixport and its investors had the option of
“walking away, bagging our losses” and/or “litigating” insofar as they considered that
they had been damaged by SJSC Airport’s (and, in their view, the Latvian
Government’s) conduct.224 But ultimately, it was Mr. Osthus’ belief that entering into

the 2010 Agreement and settling all past claims was the better option because “we were

of the opinion that we would make money; not only recover, recoup what we had lost,
but also make a profit,” given that “the financial crisis was getting to an end” and
Rixport anticipated that it would be able “to reap the benefits . . . of being able to
contract construction in a low market and basically take our time developing this

area.”225

E. Events following the 2010 Agreement

Notwithstanding the agreement reached in November 2010, Rixport did not

subsequently undertake any construction work on any of the Draws.

Nor was construction work ever recommenced on the office building that Rixport
Office had started to construct on Draw 2 in 2008, but, as already noted, decided to

suspend in 2009 in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.

Ultimately, Rixport Office was declared insolvent in May 2010 by the Riga District
Court,226 and in April 2011 the unfinished building was purchased at an auction by a
Latvian affiliate of Staur, SIA Staur Building (“Staur Building”).227 A year later, on
29 June 2012, Staur Building entered into a Land Lease Agreement with SJSC Airport
for a term extending until 2 November 2031, with a possible 25-year extension.228
Like the earlier lease with Rixport Office, the lease provided that Staur Building would
complete the construction of the building by 1 August 2013, but Staur Building failed

to do so.

As Rixport Office had allowed the construction permit that it had obtained for the
building to expire, Staur Building was required to obtain a new construction permit,
but, for reasons that have not been explained, it did not contact the Marupe
Construction Board until 20 February 2013 to inquire about the reissuance of the earlier
construction permit.229 By letter, dated 14 March 2013, the Construction Board
informed Staur Building that it should either apply for a new permit or re-register the

earlier permit.230 Staur Building then waited until 4 July 2013, i.e., less than a month

before construction was to be completed, to apply for a new permit,23! which was

issued on 1 August 2013 for a period of two years.232

An issue then arose concerning the terms of the construction permit issued because the
new permit, in accordance with the requirements of the applicable legislation, limited
the maximum height of the building to 44.5 meters (i.e., 40 meters above the height of
the runway), as compared to 49 meters, for which Rixport had obtained approval from
the Latvian Civil Aviation Agency in 2007.233 After being petitioned by Rixport, in
2014, the Latvian Civil Aviation Agency would not authorize construction of the
building to a height above 44.5 meters.234 The Respondent has explained that the
agency’s new position was in accord with legislation adopted on 5 January 2008, after
the agency’s permission had first been obtained, that limited the height of buildings
near airport runways to 40 meters above the height of the runway, and that Staur
Building should have been aware of this legislation when it purchased the building in
2011.35 It has not been contended that the lower authorized height prevented the
completion of the building, although the Claimants have complained that the building
had to be redesigned,236 and the Respondent has acknowledged that there “may have

been a cost involved with adjusting the original plans.”237

It then took Staur Building until 19 March 2014 to submit a sketch design of the
building to SJSC Airport for its approval,238 which SJSC Airport required to be
revised.239 In addition, Staur Building was required to pay amounts claimed to be due

to SJSC Airport before the design would be approved.240

It is unclear from the record what happened thereafter. The Respondent says that, when
the issues raised in March 2014 were resolved, it approved Staur Building’s design in
February 2015.24! However, Staur Building was complaining to SJSC Airport in
January 2015 that approval of its design was wrongly being delayed by SJSC Airport’s

insistence that Staur Building first pay delay penalties, which Staur Building did not

consider to be due.242 Whether or not, as contended by the Respondent, the design
was ultimately approved in February 2015, it is common ground that Staur Building
did not subsequently proceed with any construction work. Instead, it pressed SJSC
Airport for amendments to the lease and the cancellation of invoices for rent. In the
face of SJSC Airport’s refusal to agree, Staur Building then purported, by letter dated
9 September 2015, to revoke the lease and also demanded repayment by SJSC Airport
of all amounts paid by Staur Building under the lease since its conclusion in June
2012.243 The Claimants contend that Staur Building took this action because it

“realized that SJSC Airport had no intention of cooperating.” 244

On 28 June 2016, SJSC Airport commenced proceedings before the Riga District Court
to request the lease’s cancellation because of Staur Building’s failure to pay rent, and
in October 2017 Staur Building filed a counterclaim for cancellation of the lease and
the damages that Staur Building claimed to have incurred.245 On 12 April 2018, the
Riga District Court issued a judgment cancelling the lease agreement and dismissing

Staur Building’s counterclaim.246 The judgment was not appealed.

The Claimants have also argued that Rixport was prevented from undertaking
construction work on all of the Draws that were the subject of the Land Lease
Agreements subsequent to the 2010 Agreement. They have attributed Rixport’s failure
to begin developing the leased land “to the never ending changes initiated by SJSC
Airport and the Latvian Government” in relation to the Airport’s development during
the period following the 2010 Agreement,247 as well as SJSC Airport’s allegedly
repeated refusal to provide Rixport with information concerning the details of the

development plans for the Airport.248

The Claimants have referred specifically to the following:

e First, they have noted that the airBaltic terminal project was terminated in May

2011249 (although Rixport was not made aware of this at the time).250

According to the Claimants: “... termination of the agreement with airBaltic
meant that approx. 18 months had been wasted on a potential development
project involving construction of a new airBaltic terminal. It also meant that
the status of the Airport terminal expansion project was again totally

unknown.”25!

Second, they have pointed to the application that SJSC Airport made on 26
April 2011 to the Construction Board of the Marupe Municipality to reopen
the 2003 Detailed Plan for the purpose of developing a new, amended Detailed
Plan.252 The application to reopen the Plan was approved by the Construction
Board on 25 May 2011253 and, after two years of development, a new Detailed
Plan (the “2013 Detailed Plan’’) was approved by the Marupe Municipality
on 3 July 2013254 and published in the Official Journal of Latvia on 10 July
2013.255 It is undisputed that SJSC Airport requested changes to the 2003
Detailed Plan in order to permit SJSC Airport to carry out infrastructure
projects at the Airport being financed by the European Union (“EU”) Cohesion
Fund. Those infrastructure projects comprised the renovation, reconstruction
and construction of runways, aprons, taxiways and lighting and drainage
systems, in addition to certain other facilities.25° The Claimants contend that
the work on a new Detailed Plan between May 2011 and July 2013 put Rixport
“in a deadlock-situation” because it could not obtain construction permits
while the new plan was being prepared, and it was also kept in the dark about
the details of the plan being developed until February 2013, when it “learned
about SJSC Airport’s draft detailed plan via other channels.”257 It is also the
Claimants’ position that the 2013 Detailed Plan adversely affected Rixport’s
rights by: (i) imposing restrictions on building heights and density that did not
apply previously; (ii) providing for the possible division of a land parcel (D5)
upon which Rixport had intended to build the main Airport hotel; (iii)
indicating railway routes across the leased land; (iv) changing open ground

level parking facilities to a multilevel parking facility; and (v) moving the main

Airport hotel away from the terminal behind the parking facilities.258

Third, the Claimants have referred to a new Business Plan, dated 22 September
2011, for the Airport, which was prepared by SIA Ernst & Young Baltic (the
“2011 Business Plan”) and approved by SJSC Airport before the end of that
month (but not shared with Rixport or the Claimants at the time).259 The
Business Plan stated that: “The most significant investment activity that the
Airport is planning to implement after 2020, is the 2™ stage of expansion of
the existing terminal.”260 According to the Claimants, it follows from this
statement that “expansion of the Airport terminal (2 stage) would not be
initiated within the next ten years (or more).”26! The Claimants argue that, as
a consequence, “the Airport hotel could not be constructed and operations
started” for another decade, given that, under the 2010 Agreement, the hotel
was to be commissioned “simultaneously with commissioning of the expanded
terminal.”262, For the Claimants, this explains SJSC Airport’s disinterest in
releasing Land 2 of Draw 1 to Rixport?63 (although Rixport did not, in fact,
formally request the transfer of that parcel to Rixport until 25 October

2013).264

Fourth, the Claimants have referred to a sketch design of the terminal that
Rixport received from SJSC Airport on 25 March 2013.265 According to the
Claimants: “The sketch envisaged a completely different arrangement of the
area compared to what SJSC Airport and Rixport had agreed to in 2006. To
Rixport’s astonishment, the sketch depicted a multilevel parking-facility in
front of the terminal, instead of the hotel SJSC Airport and Rixport had agreed
Rixport would construct,” with the hotel placed behind the parking facility
“contrary to Rixport’s right to construct a hotel directly connected to the

terminal.”266 In addition, rail tracks separated the hotel from the terminal.267

259 C1. Reply 9328-339; Ex. C-228.

e Fifth, the Claimants have complained that a new Municipal Spatial Plan was
issued by the Marupe Municipality on 18 June 2013 for the period 2014-2026
(the “2013 Spatial Plan”) that adversely affected Rixport’s rights because,
like the 2013 Detailed Plan, it provided, inter alia, for possible rail tracks
crossing the leased land.268 The 2013 Spatial Plan was required to be issued
because the plan in place when the Land Lease Agreements were entered into
was expiring in 2014. The Respondent has explained that a Municipal Spatial
Plan divides the land of a municipality into zones in which certain land uses
are permitted or prohibited, in accordance with the Municipality’s planning
strategy for a period of 12 years. The type of zone determines whether a
planning permission for a particular development can be granted. It differs
from a Detailed Plan, which is usually prepared by the landowner, subject to
the Municipality’s approval.26? Rixport challenged the 2013 Spatial Plan
before the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Regional Development
(“MEPRD”’), but the MEPRD rejected the challenge concerning the possible
railway on the basis that the railway remained subject to further studies and
specifications and that its location was only potential. For the Claimants, the
MEPRD “did not in any way recognize the fundamental fact that a railway
crossing Rixport’s land would have paramount impact on Rixport’s plans .. . .
[and] Rixport’s need for predictability with respect to what the land Rixport
had been leasing since 2006 was to be used for.”270 In this regard, the
Claimants have noted that the technical study for the railway line was not
expected by the MEPRD to be completed until 2015, which, thus, placed

Rixport “in a situation where it could not act” until that time.27!

172. Because of the continuing delay in the finalization of the development plans for the
Airport, and Rixport’s alleged inability to progress with its own development work in
the circumstances, Rixport requested SJSC Airport to agree to further amendments to
the Land Lease Agreements in addition to various rent and infrastructure payment

discounts and holidays.

173. The first possible amendments appear to have been discussed between Rixport and

SJSC Airport at meetings in February 2012 concerning the development of the “main

airport hotel directly connected to the terminal” and the long-term parking on Land 2
and Land 3 of Draw 1. Rixport proposed returning Land 2 and Land 3 of Draw | to
SJSC Airport “to operate . . . as an integrated airport parking facility” and, accordingly,
that the infrastructure payments for those land plots be deducted from future lease and
infrastructure payments.272 The proposed amendments were rejected, but SJSC
Airport indicated that the “Airport is ready to return to discussion of the . . . proposals

. when the further development ...will be specified.”273

174. Then, on 5 July 2012, Rixport complained to SJSC Airport about the uncertainties

surrounding the Airport’s development and the consequences for Rixport. It wrote:274

In April 2010 the airport informed Rixport that the new detail plan will be
completed in the summer of 2011. However, the detail plan has not been
completed until this moment and plans of the airport are not clear. Until
now Rixport has not been informed and invited to any meeting with the
airport in connection to development of the territory surrounding the
terminal which has been leased to Rixport, despite the obligation of the
airport pursuant to cl.3.1 of the Agreement of November 5, 2010 to involve
Rixport in working groups of airport, when discussing future development
plans of the land plots. Pursuant to information available to us through
press, the development of airport is delayed and could be started only in
2015/2016.

On May 25, 2011, the Municipality of Marupe Region has adopted
decision No. 11 “On development of detail plan for the Eastern part of the

. “International airport “Riga””. All areas leased to Rixport are
included into the respective detail plan territory. . . . [T]he Chief of the
Construction Authority of Mdrupe Regional Municipality — Ms. Aida
Lismane, has informed Rixport that starting planning and construction in
the territory of the detail planning would not be permitted and reasonable
until clarification of development plans of the airport, because the borders
of red lines and access of transport to the terminal (including a possible
railway connection) have not been determined yet. Since the detail
planning of airport has not been opened for adjustment, the Construction
Authority is not able to issue to Rixport any Planning and Architecture
Tasks for construction .... It means that Rixport is not able to draft and
approve any technical projects for construction in all land plots rented
from airport until the new detail planning will enter into force... .

Taking into account the above-mentioned, Rixport is in the opinion that
discount should be applied to rent for Draw 2 and Draw 3 in full amount
of rent from May 25, 2011 until entrance into force of the new detail plan.
Besides, discounts for development stage for the first two years after
entrance into force of the new detail plan and development terms of land
and deadlines for the payment of infrastructure fees should be prolonged.

175.  Rixport added, with respect to the land plots adjacent to the terminal that:

The main airport hotel, which is connected to the terminal, and operation
of the short term parking are the substantial rights of Rixport, arising out
of the valid Land Lease Agreements. If the airport proposed changes in
the respective rights of Rixport, a fair compensation has to be provided to
Rixport.

176. Rixport thus requested SJSC Airport to: (i) provide “detailed information about the
development plans of the airport terminal;” (ii) provide “other development plans of
the airport which could influence land plots leased to Rixport;” (iii) confirm that
Rixport “will be involved in working groups” of the airport in accordance with the 2010
Agreement; and (iv) confirm “the readiness of airport to reach the agreement with
Rixport about rent holidays and amendments in other main terms of the Land Lease
Agreements during the period when the detail plan is open for changes and Rixport is

not able to use the land for the purpose indicated in the Land Lease Agreements.”

177. By letter, dated 21 August 2012, SJSC Airport responded to Rixport that it was “ready
to involve Rixport in the working groups of [SJSC] Airport regarding development
plans of the terminal of airport and other development plans of the Airport, which
concern the land plots rented to Rixport.”27> It further indicated that it was “ready to
evaluate the issue about granting of rent discounts and amending other material terms
of the Land Lease Agreements,” given that “the detail plan of the NE sector of the
Airport was opened for adjustments”, but only as from the time “when Rixport
submitted the request for architectural and planning” approval to the Construction
Board of the Marupe Municipality, which it understood from Rixport’s letter to be 18
April 2012. It further indicated its willingness to take over Land 3 of Draw | in
accordance with the 2010 Agreement, “with a precondition that the Airport will not
have any restrictions regarding further usage of the land plot.” It also proposed to
review “other terms of the Land Lease Agreements based on mutually beneficial

conditions.”

178. Discussions between Rixport and SJSC Airport ensued. However, no agreements were
reached in respect of any amendments to the Land Lease Agreements.276 Nor did SJSC
Airport ultimately agree to grant Rixport any rent discounts or other relief on account

of the opening of the 2003 Detailed Plan in May 2011 (or for any other reason) or to

take over Land 3 of Draw No. 1, which SJSC Airport confirmed that it would not do,
by letter, dated 20 December 2012.277

179. SJSC Airport, thus, continued to invoice Rixport for rent and infrastructure payments
through 2012, although Rixport stopped paying those invoices in or around August
2012.278 In December 2012, the Board of SJSC Airport then resolved to suspend the
issuance of invoices to Rixport as from 3 December 2012 until the date of entering into
an agreement with Rixport.279 However, in the absence of any agreement having been

reached, that resolution was revoked on 9 September 2013.280

180. By the time of the 9 September 2013 resolution, the relationship between SJSC Airport
and Rixport had deteriorated to the point that the two of them were in litigation with
each other in respect of the Land Lease Agreements before the Latvian civil courts. As
already mentioned, on 6 March 2013, Rixport commenced a civil action against SJISC
Airport before the Riga Regional Court.28!_ Subsequently, the case was transferred to
the Kurzeme Regional Court, where it continued until a judgment was rendered on 13
February 2015,282 which was followed by an appellate judgment of 13 April 2016,283
a Supreme Court judgment of 8 November 2018 remanding the case to the Kurzeme
Regional Court for reconsideration284 and finally the Kurzeme Regional Court’s

judgment of 5 July 2019.285

181. As originally filed on 6 March 2013, Rixport’s claim was for a judgment: (i) ordering
SJSC Airport to repay to Rixport all lease and other payments made by Rixport to SJSC
Airport since 25 May 2011; (ii) declaring that Rixport had no obligation to pay any
invoices issued since that date and, accordingly, ordering SJSC Airport to issue credit
invoices to Rixport in respect of outstanding invoices; (iii) postponing the deadline for
the making of infrastructure payments in respect of Land 2 and Land 3 of Draw | and
Land 2 of Draw 2; and (iv) ordering SJSC airport to issue a credit invoice for an
infrastructure payment invoice, dated 28 November 2007, in respect of Land 2 of Draw

Lease Agreements for Draws 2 and 3,286 and on 28 May 2014, it requested the court
to terminate the Land Lease Agreement for Draw | as well.287 In addition, it requested
an order invalidating the 2010 Agreement, the equivalent of approximately EUR 25
million in reimbursements for payments made under the Land Lease Agreements, for
expenses allegedly incurred in connection with the development of the business park,

lost profits and interest.288

182.  Rixport took the position before the Kurzeme Regional Court that the Land Lease
Agreements should be terminated because, as a result of the changes to SJSC Airport’s
development plan and the 2003 Detailed Plan, SJSC Airport had effectively failed to
transfer the leased land to it for its use and Rixport no longer had an interest in
developing it. According to Rixport, the “essence” of its argument was that:289

The claimant has lost the interest to use the land because if development
of draw I by constructing a hotel and a parking, which should be opened
simultaneously with the terminal as it is foreseen in the Agreement of
November 5, 2010 will happen only in year 2020, the construction of draw
2 and draw 3 will be finished not earlier than in year 2022, it is only in the
16" year of lease and 9 years before the end of the term of lease agreement.
Thus, the claimant would have only 11 years to profit, because the term of
the lease agreement is November 3, 2031.

183. In addition, Rixport asked the court to invalidate the 2010 Agreement on the basis that
SJSC Airport had not informed Rixport at the time of the signature of that agreement
that the terminal expansion project would not be completed until 2020.29°

184. | SJSC Airport disputed all of Rixport’s claims and submitted a counterclaim for unpaid
rent invoiced under the Land Lease Agreements (in an amount of EUR 3,228,830.98
as of 30 June 2014) plus contractual penalties in an amount of EUR 476,138.09 and
interest.29! In SJSC Airport’s view, Rixport had failed to establish that SJSC Airport
had delayed the transfer of any of the Draws, that Rixport had lost its interest in the
leased land or that SJSC Airport had deceived Rixport when it entered into the 2010
Agreement.292

While SJSC Airport acknowledged that there had been changes to the boundaries of
the leased land and the Airport’s development plans since the Land Lease Agreements
were entered into, it submitted that “the boundaries were changed by mutual agreement,
and, furthermore, all issues had been settled in the 2010 Agreement, in which Rixport
had confirmed that it did not have and would not have any claims against SJSC Airport

for the time period up to the signature of the Agreement.”293

As regards the changes to the 2003 Detailed Plan, SJSC Airport denied that this had a
negative impact on Rixport’s development rights. It also submitted that, in any event,
Rixport could have continued to carry out construction under that plan until the 2013
Detailed Plan was issued and subsequently upon its suspension as a consequence of
actions filed before the Latvian administrative courts by Rixport and Staur Building for
its nullification or amendment. For SJSC Airport, the “leased land remained unused at

Rixport’s choice.”294

In this arbitration, the Respondent has also developed a number of arguments that echo

those made by SJSC Airport before the Latvian courts.

Among others, it has emphasized that Draws 2 and 3 were not encumbered, and that
Rixport was not prevented by any of the circumstances of which the Claimants have
complained from developing those Draws. The Respondent has noted, with respect to

the reopening and changes of the 2003 Detailed Plan, in particular, that:

e the only part of the planned new works that might have affected the leased land
were drainage works on Draws | and 2, which Rixport had approved, and

which did not interfere with Rixport’s own planned development;29>

* contrary to Rixport’s assertions, Rixport was not prevented from applying for
and obtaining construction permits while the new Detailed Plan was being
prepared, given that the 2003 Detailed Plan remained in effect during that
period and the Construction Board of the Marupe Municipality continued to

issue construction permits to other parties during that time;2%° and

e the 2013 Detailed Plan did not contain any changes, in any event, that
prevented the development of any part of the leased land or that were not

otherwise foreshadowed by the 2003 Detailed Plan and existing legislation.297

It is also the Respondent’s position, as already noted, that, irrespective of any
encumbrances on Draw | (which were addressed in the 2010 Agreement), Draw | was
not required to be developed in advance of the other Draws. Nor was it necessary, in
the Respondent’s view, for the Claimants to develop the main Airport hotel and parking
facilities on Draw | before developing the business park on the other Draws. To the
contrary, the Respondent argues that “Rixport was obligated to develop an entire
business park, not only an airport hotel.”298 It is, moreover, the Respondent's position
that, while Rixport may have wished to wait until SJSC Airport’s development plans
were permanently fixed before proceeding with the business park development, this
was not “reasonable,” given that an airport’s development plans are continually
evolving.299 Because Rixport took no steps to develop the business park, SJSC Airport
appears to have formed the view by the time of the proceedings initiated against it by
Rixport in the Latvian courts that Rixport’s only interest was in developing the main

Airport hotel and parking facilities on Draw 1.300

The Respondent has argued, further, that Rixport was also not prevented by the delay
in the finalization of the plans for the terminal expansion from proceeding with the
development of an Airport hotel on Land 2 of Draw 1. Although it does not dispute
that the 2010 Agreement provides, as the Claimants have argued, that the hotel and
parking facilities on Land 2 of Draw 1 were to be commissioned “simultaneously with
commissioning of the extended part of the terminal”30! and has acknowledged, during
the arbitration, that expansion of the main terminal building was delayed and is
currently not expected to be completed until 2022,30? it has nevertheless taken the
position that the commissioning date stated in the 2010 Agreement was merely

intended to ensure that the hotel was built “no later than the airport terminal.”393

According to the Respondent, the 2010 Agreement did not preclude it from being built

earlier.304

In this regard, the Respondent has also submitted: “Rixport held the lease for the land
closest to the airport terminal; any hotel constructed on this land would have been
within walking distance of the terminal, no matter the technical details of terminal
expansion.”305 SJSC Airport’s Mr. Saveljevs has testified that he provided Rixport
with the development sketch (about which Rixport has complained, as mentioned
above) on 25 March 2013 in order to “reassure” Rixport that it could develop an airport
hotel with a “direct connection” to the terminal on Land 2 of Draw 1.306
Notwithstanding the Claimants’ complaint that the sketch indicated that there would be
a parking facility and a railway between the hotel and the terminal, for Mr. Saveljevs,
this did not pose a problem as the “distances are not that far”307 and a “passage” could

be provided.308

He has further noted that Rixport did not make a request for SJSC Airport to vacate
Land 2 of Draw | until its letter, dated 25 October 2013, in which Rixport requested
that that parcel be vacated by 1 April 2014.399 However, by that time, the Latvian
court proceedings had already been initiated by Rixport, and it is Mr. Saveljevs’
evidence that SJSC regarded the request as a mere “negotiating tactic,” given that the
request “was not backed by any evidence of . . . [Rixport’s] development plans (e.g.,
construction permit, sketch design, erc.).”3!0 During the hearing, he added that “we
decided that we cannot risk the parking of an airport and transfer the land to Rixport,
knowing that we are already in a court and Rixport is not fulfilling its contract

obligations by paying the rent payments.”3!!

It is undisputed that Land 2 of Draw | was not subsequently made available to Rixport,
but it is also the case that Rixport purported to terminate the Land Lease Agreement

for Draw 1 by letter dated 21 March 20143!2 (i.e., before 1 April 2014) and, as noted

above, amended its claim before the Kurzeme Regional Court on 28 May 2014 to

request that lease’s cancellation.

In parallel with the litigation initiated by it in the Latvian courts, Rixport (and Staur
Building, in the case of the Detailed Plan) took action in August 2013 to challenge both
the 2013 Detailed Plan and 2013 Spatial Plan before the Riga Administrative District
Court and the MERP, respectively.3!3. The Administrative District Court judgment
rejecting the challenge of the 2013 Detailed Plan was issued on 16 May 2014,3!4 and
the MERP decision dismissing the challenge of the 2013 Spatial Plan was delivered by
letter, dated 16 September 2013.3!5 In the arbitration, Rixport has noted that, in its
decision, the Administrative District Court referred to the Airport “as an object of
national interest” and that the public’s interests in respect of the Airport, thus, “should
be evaluated higher than the impairment of . . . [Rixport’s] rights and legal
interests.”3!6 The Respondent has observed, in this connection, that the Airport's
territory was granted this status on 2 July 2013 because of its ability to receive NATO
military aircraft.3!7 Although Rixport did not appeal the Administrative District
Court’s judgment in respect of the 2013 Detailed Plan, the judgment was appealed to
the Supreme Court by Staur Building, as a result of which (as at the date of the Hearing
in this arbitration), the 2013 Detailed Plan has remained suspended since 9 August

2013.38

Rixport also challenged, first before the Marupe Municipality and, then before the
Administrative District Court, a large number of construction permits issued to third
parties by the Municipality’s Construction Board during the period when the 2013
Detailed Plan was being developed.3!9 Rixport took the position that those permits

were not valid and that they infringed its rights in respect of the leased land. Rixport’s

 

hall were repeatedly dismissed by the Administrative District Court and, upon
appeal, by the Supreme Court as unfounded (although as at the time of the Parties’
submissions in this arbitration some Supreme Court cases remained pending).32 In at

least one of those cases, the court expressly dismissed Rixport’s contention, which it

has also advanced in this arbitration, that construction permits could not be granted

during the preparation of the 2013 Detailed Plan.32!

During the latter part of 2013 and in 2014, Rixport and SJSC Airport conducted
settlement negotiations and engaged in a mediation in order to attempt to resolve the
issues dividing them, but to no avail.322. During this period, on 11 September 2013,
SJSC Airport informed Rixport, in accordance with the 2010 Agreement, that
encumbrances on Land | of Draw 1 had been removed.323_ But Rixport did not

undertake to commence any development work on that Draw.

During the discussions between Rixport and SJSC Airport, there came a time when
Rixport sought to involve representatives of the Latvian Government. As early as
December 2012, Rixport had written to the Minister of Transport of Latvia to request
his assistance in resolving the issues that were then “open” between Rixport and SJSC
Airport “regarding ... future cooperation.”324 The Minister of Transport refused to
become involved on the basis that the management of SJSC Airport’s affairs was “not
within the competence of the Ministry of Transport” and that, pursuant to Section 301
of the Commercial Law, SJSC Airport’s Board of Directors, as the “executive
institution” of the company, was responsible for, among other things, “entering into

civil transactions and resolving issues arising out of the transactions.”325

Subsequently, in September 2013, the Norwegian Chamber of Commerce in Latvia
sent a letter to the Minister of Transport on Rixport’s behalf inviting him “to facilitate
reaching of an agreement” between SJSC Airport and Rixport.326 The Minister of
Transport once again responded that it was not within the Ministry’s competence to
become involved, and it merely undertook to forward the letter to SJSC Airport’s Board
“for further resolution of the issue.”327 This prompted two further letters, dated 17
October 2013 and 30 October 2013, to the Minister of Economics and Minister of

Transport respectively, requesting that they agree to meet with Mr. Osthus.328

199. A meeting was subsequently arranged on 7 November 2013 between Mr. @sthus, the

Minister of Transport and Ms. DZineta Innusa, a Deputy State Secretary at the Ministry

of Transport.329 No written record of the meeting has been produced in the arbitration.

However, according to Ms. Innusa, the meeting was brief and Mr. Osthus was again

advised to take up the matter with SJSC Airport directly because this was a

“commercial matter” that was not within the Ministry’s competence.330

200. On the same day, Mr. @sthus met with the Chairman of SJSC Airport’s Board. The

meeting was followed by a letter dated 11 November 2013 to the Chairman in which

Mr. @sthus proposed a possible new agreement in accordance with the following

principles:33!

329 Bx. C-129,

The parties would agree on a location for the Airport hotel directly connected
to the terminal building, with roof covered access. The plot would be surveyed
within one year of the agreement, and no other hotel would be permitted to be

established in front of the terminal by other parties.

Rent levels for Draw | would be reduced and rent would become due only

when the hotel and parking were ready for development.

Land 3 of Draw | would be returned by Rixport, without any financial penalty,

if Rixport did not start to develop it within five years of the agreement.

The parties would waive all payment claims against each other in respect of

Draw | as of the date of the agreement.

Rixport would have the exclusive right to operate short term parking at the
Airport on Land 2 of Draw 1 and would be able to operate long term parking

on any other part of Draw 1.

The term of the lease for Draw | would be extended for 10 years.

The lease agreements for Draws 2 and 3 would be “put on hold” for five years,

with Rixport only liable to pay a reservation fee during those years. It would

begin to pay rent, however, on any parts of those Draws that it decided to

develop during those years. In the absence of any development, the leases
would terminate, with all of the parties’ payment claims in respect of the Draws

being waived.

e All claims before the courts would be withdrawn, including in respect of

construction permits and the 2013 Detailed Plan.

These principles were stated in the letter to follow from the fact that the plans for the
Airport’s development, as at the time of the signing of the Land Lease Agreements in
2006, had been scaled back, which Mr. Osthus claimed that the Minister had recognized

in their separate meeting.

Meetings were subsequently held between representatives of Rixport and SJSC Airport
to discuss Mr. @sthus’ proposals on 19, 20 and 25 November 2013, but without any
agreement being achieved.532 Although, according to the minutes, he does not appear
to have attended any of these meetings, Mr. Osthus wrote to the Minister of Transport
on 24 November 2013 in order to complain that Rixport was getting nowhere with
SJSC Airport’s “bureaucrats,” who had “tangled the situation” and considered the
Ministry’s “signals” to be “irrelevant for the assessment of the situation.” Mr. @sthus,
thus, requested that Ms. Innusa participate in the negotiations.333 There is no record,
however, that she subsequently did, although she recalls in her evidence that she
participated in a further meeting with Rixport in 2014, together with other Ministry

officials, at which no substantive negotiations took place.334

Notwithstanding the lack of progress that had been made in concluding a new
agreement in 2013, further discussions were held between Rixport and SJSC Airport

in early 2014, but with no greater success.335

Messrs. @sthus and Lundeby have both stated in their evidence that they were told by
Mr. Saveljevs, who, as already indicated, was the Director of the Commercial
Department of SJSC Airport and one of Rixport’s principal counterparts in the
negotiations, that it would be difficult for SJSC Airport to continue the project with

Rixport “due to political reasons.”336 Mr. Saveljevs has no recollection of “ever saying

anything like this,” and claims that SJSC Airport “very much wanted Rixport . . . to

move forward with its development of the leased land.”337

Mr. @sthus has also claimed that he was introduced by Mr. Saveljevs to a company that
wished to build a hotel in front of the Airport and that when Rixport maintained that it
“would construct the hotel according to [its] agreement with the Airport without
partners, the attitude from the Airports [sic] side got very aggressive.”338 This also

does not accord with the evidence of Mr. Saveljevs, who has testified:359

. .. SJSC Airport informed Rixport that we had received an enquiry from
a company called SIA FAD Holding (“FAD”) interested in developing an
entertainment park and hotel at the Airport. We later received a letter
from Rixport, claiming that we had violated the Land Lease Agreements
by promising land leased to Rixport to another company. This was not the
case. As we explained to Rixport at the time, we had told FAD that the
plot of land in which they were interested was already leased to Rixport,
and that they would have to negotiate with Rixport for the use of the land.
As Rixport was apparently unwilling to negotiate with FAD, they moved
on. SJSC Airport did not look for alternative tenants on its own initiative,
and still wanted Rixport to develop the leased land.

Mr. Lundeby has suggested that SJSC Airport terminated settlement negotiations with
Rixport in February 2014 because of Rixport’s unwillingness to negotiate with
FAD.340 However, he acknowledged during the Hearing that he was no longer
personally involved in any such negotiations at the time,*4! and, according to Mr.
@sthus, settlement negotiations continued until the first quarter of 2016, when they
came to an end because “the distance between the parties were [sic] too substantial to

bridge.”342

Meanwhile, on 5 February 2014, Staur wrote to the Investment and Development

Agency of Latvia to seek its as

 

istance in resolving Rixport’s dispute with SJSC
Airport and threatened to commence an international arbitration against Latvia if an
agreement could not be reached.543 This, in turn, prompted the Investment and
Development Agency to write to the Prime Minister of Latvia on the subject on 27

February 2014.344 He then directed the Minister of Transport to examine the matter

by requesting information from SJSC Airport, which the Minister of Transport did on

12 March 2014.345

As of that date, SJSC Airport had written to Rixport listing the outstanding invoices
under the Land Lease Agreements and noting that the total amount exceeded the trigger
for insolvency proceedings under Latvian law.346 SJSC Airport warned Rixport that,
if the debt remained unpaid, insolvency proceedings would be commenced against

Rixport. However, there was never any follow up.

On 21 March 2014, Rixport notified SJSC Airport that it was cancelling the Land Lease
Agreement for Draw 1,347 and on 28 May 2014, as already noted, it amended its claim
before the Kurzeme Regional Court, in order to request an order cancelling that

agreement and additional related relief.348

This was followed on 30 June 2014 by the Claimants sending a notice of breach of the
BIT to the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Latvia.349 The Claimants took the
position that Latvia had breached its obligations to accord their investment in Rixport
equitable and reasonable treatment and to subject it to measures having an effect similar

to expropriation.

Meetings and negotiations followed with representatives of the Ministry of Transport

and SJSC Airport, but without an agreement being reached.350

On 13 February 2015, the Kurzeme Regional Court issued its judgment in the case
initiated against SJSC Airport by Rixport.35! The court dismissed all of Rixport’s
claims and granted SJSC Airport’s counterclaim in full. Rixport considered the
judgment to be flawed for a number of reasons, including the court’s failure, according

to the Claimants, to recognize that Rixport had been prevented by SJSC Airport from

developing the leased land in accordance with the terms of the Land Lease

Agreements.352_ Rixport thus appealed the judgment on 17 April 2015.353

A month later, SJSC Airport notified Rixport by letter dated 18 May 2015 that it was
canceling the Land Lease Agreements for Draws 1-3 as a result of Rixport’s defaults,
in particular its failure to pay rent and penalties owed as of 30 April 2015.354 Rixport

objected to the notice of cancellation by letter dated 17 June 2015.355

An appellate judgment was then rendered on 13 April 2016 by the Kurzeme Regional
Court, acting as an appellate body as permitted by Latvian law.35° The appellate
judgment was rendered by a panel of three of the court’s fourteen judges, unlike the
first instance judgment, which was rendered by a single (and different) judge.357 In its
appellate judgment, the Kurzeme Regional Court upheld the court’s first instance
judgment in its entirety. Although the Claimants have contended that they “had little
faith in a reasonable outcome of the judicial process in Latvia,”358 and have made a
claim in this proceeding, as discussed further in Section VI below, for denial of justice,
the appellate judgment was, in turn, appealed by Rixport to the Latvian Supreme Court

on 10 May 2016.359

While that appeal was still pending, the Claimants initiated this arbitration, as already

mentioned, on 4 November 2016.

On 16 December 2016, SJSC Airport then commenced its own proceedings against
Rixport before the Riga District Court to request that the Land Lease Agreements be
cancelled, in accordance with Clause 5 of each of the agreements, on the basis of
Rixport’s non-payment of amounts owed thereunder.360 By a judgment issued on 18

December 2017, after hearing both SJSC Airport and Rixport, the court granted SJSC

Airport’s request.36! The judgment was not appealed, with the consequence that the

Land Lease Agreements were cancelled as of 16 December 2016.

Subsequently, however, by a judgment of 8 November 2018, the Latvian Supreme
Court revoked the appellate judgment of the Kurzeme Regional Court rendered in
respect of Rixport’s claims and SJSC Airport’s counterclaims on 13 April 2016 and
remanded the case to the Kurzeme Regional Court for review.362 As the Respondent
has indicated, the “principal reason for the remand of the case” was the Supreme
Court’s finding that the appellate judgment had not addressed events occurring after
the 2010 Agreement and, in particular, whether Rixport “was able to exercise its rights

under the 2010 Agreement subsequent to the signature of that Agreement.”363

In remanding the case, the Supreme Court, thus, specified that the Kurzeme Regional
Court should consider “(i) how realistic it was for Rixport to carry out construction
while the 2013 Detailed Plan was being developed and (ii) whether this possibility to
construct corresponded to Rixport’s ‘plans and rights’ in the context of the Land Lease

Agreements.” 364

By a judgment of 5 July 2019, a new three-judge panel of the Kurzeme Regional Court
once again dismissed Rixport’s claims and accepted SJSC Airport’s counterclaims, but
unlike the earlier judgments, accepted SJSC Airport’s counterclaims only in part.365
The reconstituted panel decided, unlike its predecessor panel and the first instance
judge, to dismiss the part of SJSC Airport’s counterclaims that was for penalties
totaling EUR 476,138.09, while finding that SJSC Airport was entitled to rent in an
amount of EUR 3,228,830.98 plus interest and costs.

By emails, dated 6 and 19 August 2019, the Parties’ representatives confirmed that the
judgment was not appealed to the Supreme Court and has, thus, become final. The
Claimants’ counsel stated: “After more than six years of litigation in Latvia, the

Claimants have concluded that this process is futile.”

SUMMARY OF CLAIMANTS’ CLAIMS

Against the above factual background, the Claimants have advanced the following

claims against the Respondent in this arbitration:

First, they contend that the Respondent has failed to accord equitable and reasonable
treatment and protection to their investment, in breach of Article III of the BIT, which

provides that:366

Each Contracting Party shall promote and encourage in its territory
investments of investors of the other contracting party and accept such
investments in accordance with its laws and regulations and accord them
equitable and reasonable treatment and protection. Such investments
shall be subject to the laws and regulations of the contracting party in the
territory of which the investments are made.

It is the Claimants’ position that the Respondent has breached Article III by: (i) failing
to provide a transparent, consistent and stable business framework; (ii) violating the
Claimants’ legitimate expectations; and (iii) denying the Claimants’ justice by failing

to provide administrative and judicial due process.367

These breaches are claimed to have been the product of a series of acts and omissions
of SJSC Airport, the Marupe Municipality, the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of
Justice, the Latvian Parliament and the Latvian courts, all acting as organs of the
Latvian State, within the meaning of Article 4 of the Draft Articles on the
Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts of the International Law
Commission (the “ILC Articles”) or, alternatively, that are attributable to the State, in
the case of SJSC Airport, on the basis of the principles set forth in Articles 5 or 8 of the
ILC Articles.368

In addition, the Claimants assert that the Respondent has unlawfully expropriated the

Claimants’ investment, in breach of Article VI(1) of the BIT, which provides:369

Investments made by investors of one contracting party in the territory of
the other contracting party cannot be expropriated, nationalized or
subjected to other measures having a similar effect (all such measures
hereinafter referred to as “expropriation”) except when the following
conditions are fulfilled:

228.

229.

() The expropriation shall be done for public interest and under
domestic legal procedures;

(I) It shall not be discriminatory;

(I) It shall be done only against prompt, adequate and effective
compensation.

According to the Claimants, the Respondent has expropriated their investments through
a series of actions and omissions amounting to a creeping de facto expropriation, which
became a de iure expropriation on 18 December 2017 when the Land Lease
Agreements were declared cancelled by the Riga District Court.370 The Claimants
contend that the Respondent’s actions and omissions have led to “the virtual
annihilation of the investment, through the effective neutralisation of the Claimants’

rights.”37!

The Claimants also submit that Latvia has breached the umbrella clause contained in
Article 2(2) of the UK-Latvia BIT (and/or other BITs), which they say should be
considered to have been imported into the BIT by virtue of the BIT’s MFN clause

(Article IV).372 Article IV(1) provides:

Investments made by investors of one contracting party in the territory of
the other contracting party shall be accorded treatment no less favourable
than that accorded to investments made by investors of any third state.

Article 2(2) of the UK-Latvia BIT in turn provides that:373

Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered
into with regard to investments of nationals or companies of the other
Contracting Party.

The Claimants have referred to similar provisions in several other Latvian BITs, all of
which, according to the Claimants, have the effect, via the BIT’s MFN clause, of
making the Respondent liable to the Claimants under the BIT for SJSC Airport’s
alleged breaches of the Land Lease Agreements. In this regard, it is the Claimants’

position, that, although the Land Lease Agreements were entered into by Rixport and

233.

SJSC Airport, the contractual obligations “are those of the Respondent by attribution,

and the contractual rights are those of the Claimants, and not just Rixport.”374

The Claimants therefore request an award: (i) declaring that the Respondent has
breached the BIT in all of the above respects; and (ii) ordering the Respondents to pay
full reparation in an amount that, as already mentioned, they have most recently

quantified as EUR 41.9 million, together with interest and costs.375

Given that the Respondents have raised jurisdictional objections in respect of most of
the Claimants’ claims, those objections are addressed first below, followed by an

analysis of the claims on their merits.

JURISDICTION

The Claimants have commenced this arbitration pursuant to Article IX of the BIT,
which provides in the following terms for the settlement of “legal disputes” between
an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party “in relation to an

investment of the former in the territory of the latter”:

If any dispute between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other
Contracting Party continues to exist after a period of three months, the
investor shall be entitled to submit the case either to:

(C) The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes having
regard to the applicable provisions of the C ion on the Settl of
Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States opened
for signature in Washington, D.C. on 18 March 1965, or in case both
Contracting Parties have not become parties to this Convention,

(D) An arbitrator or international ad hoc arbitral tribunal established
under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Conunission on
International Trade Law. The Parties to the dispute may agree in writing
to modify these rules. The arbitral awards shall be final and binding on
both parties to the dispute.

Under Article I(1) of the BIT, an “investment” is defined to mean:

[E]very kind of asset invested in the territory of one Contracting Party in
accordance with its laws and regulations by an investor of the other
contracting party and shall mean in particular, though not exclusively:

() Movable and immovable property and any other property rights
such as mortgages, liens, pledges and similar rights;

dD) shares, debentures or any other forms of participation in
companies;

(II) claims to money which has been used to create an economic value
or claims to any performance under contract having an economic
value;

(IV) industrial and intellectual property rights, such as technology,
know-how, trade-marks and goodwill;

(Vv) business concessions conferred by law or under contract
including concessions to search for, cultivate, extract and exlott
[sic] antural [sic] resources;”...

In addition, under Article I(3) of the BIT, the term “investor” includes, inter alia: “Any
legal person such as any corporation, company, firm, enterprise, organization or
association incorporated or constituted under the law in force in the territory of that

contracting party.”

Pursuant to Article II of the BIT, the treaty applies to investments made after 1 January
1987 “in the territory of a Contracting Party in accordance with its laws and

regulations.”

The arbitration has, thus, been initiated under Article [X of the BIT on the basis that
the investments at issue were all made after 1 January 1987 and that the present
arbitration concerns a “legal dispute” in respect of investments that were legally made

and that constitute “investments” by “investors” within the meaning of the BIT.

In addition, the Claimants contend that the arbitration satisfies the jurisdictional
requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, to which both Norway and Latvia
are Contracting States and according to which ICSID has jurisdiction over “any legal
dispute arising directly out of an investment” between a Contracting State and a

national of another Contracting State.
The Claimants further note that, by invoking Article IX of the BIT in combination with

Article 25 of the ICSID Convention when submitting their Request, they have

expressed their consent in writing to submit the present dispute to ICSID.

69

239.

240.

241.

242.

With the exception of the denial of justice claims, the Respondent has raised three
objections to the Tribunal’ s jurisdiction in respect of all of the Claimants’ claims, which

the Respondent has set out in the following terms:376

(i) the Claimants’ claims, except the denial of justice claims, are contract claims
rather than treaty claims, given that they are fundamentally concerned with the
performance of the Land Lease Agreements, and disputes arising under those

agreements were to be submitted to the Latvian courts, as they have been;

(ii) the claims are primarily concerned with the acts and omissions of SJSC
Airport, a corporate entity whose acts and omissions are not attributable to the

Latvian State; and

(iii) the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over claims of Rox and Staur that are based on
events before they became shareholders of Rixport, i.e., on 19 January 2007

and 17 April 2008, respectively.

The Respondent has described the last of these as a “pure” jurisdictional objection,
while submitting that the first two objections can be “conceptualised in several different
ways,” i.e., as pertaining to jurisdiction, the admissibility of the claims or as objections
that defeat the claims on their merits.377 It nevertheless has argued that its objections
should be considered to have a jurisdictional character as it would follow, if they are
accepted, that there would be no dispute between the Parties within the meaning of

Article IX of the BIT.378

The Parties’ positions with respect to each of these objections are briefly summarized

below, followed by the Tribunal’s analysis and decision on its jurisdiction.

A. The Contract Claim Objection

It is the Respondent’s position that, with the exception of the denial of justice claims,
the claims do not fall under the dispute resolution clause in Article IX of the BIT

243. According to the Respondent, the Claimants are, in effect, undertaking to relitigate
claims that they brought unsuccessfully before the Latvian courts under the Land Lease
Agreements, which the Claimants describe as the “normative source of the Claimants’
claims.”380 In this regard, the Respondent argues that, while the Claimants “make
some complaints about the actions of the Marupe Council, with the exception of the
Claimants’ allegations relating to the alleged hindrance by the Marupe Council of
Rixport’s exercise of its contractual rights under the Land Lease Agreements, all of

these actions are irrelevant to the Claimants’ case.”38!

244. In addition, the Respondent contends that the actions of the Ministry of Transport about
which the Claimants complain cannot provide an independent basis for jurisdiction
because it is claimed that the actions of the Ministry had an impact on SJSC Airport,
“which consequently failed to respect Rixport’s contractual rights under the Land
Lease Agreements.”382 For the Respondent, the actions of the Ministry of Transport

“are but background,” and only the conduct of SJSC Airport is relevant.383

245. Relying, inter alia, upon the cases of Impregilo v. Pakistan, Toto v. Lebanon, Malicorp
v. Egypt, Hamester v. Ghana, BIVAC v. Paraguay and Pantechniki v. Albania,384 the
Respondent argues that for an alleged breach of a contract to amount to a treaty breach,
either “(i) the State must at least have gone beyond what a contractual party could do,
using its puissance publique to interfere with contractual rights in a manner that
amounts to an international wrong” or “(ii) the contractual forum must be
unavailable to hear the claims for reasons not attributable to the claimant itself”

(emphasis in the original).385

246. In the present case, it is the Respondent’s position that neither requirement has been
satisfied. The Respondent argues that the actions that SJSC Airport took with respect
to Rixport “were all actions that it took in its role as the counterparty to the Land Lease

Agreements,” and Rixport has had the opportunity to pursue claims before the

contractually chosen forum, the Latvian courts, that are “fundamentally the very same

claims” that the Claimants are now undertaking to assert under the BIT.386

Although the Respondent appears to accept that the “conceptual framework is slightly
different in the context of umbrella clauses,”387 it does not consider that there is any
applicable umbrella clause in this case or, in any event, a contract between the
Claimants and the Latvian State to which it might apply.388 This is discussed further

in Section VI below.

The Claimants dispute the Respondents’ contention that their claims are contract claims
and argue, to the contrary, that they are claims for treaty breaches in respect of their

investments in Latvia, based on the BIT.

The Claimants have, thus, undertaken to establish that their claims are different from
the claims brought before the Latvian courts and that their normative source is the
BIT.389 In this regard, the Claimants submit that: (i) “the claims do not relate to the
Land Lease Agreements per se, but rather to the regulatory, executive and judicial
conduct of the Respondent which made the investment project impossible to conduct”;
and (ii) “to the extent that some claims do concern the egregious violation of the Land
Lease Agreements . . . the Latvian State’s ‘behaviour went beyond that which an
ordinary contracting party could adopt’ and as such it forms a breach of the... BIT”

(emphasis in original).39°

As examples of acts that only a State could adopt, the Claimants refer to the
expropriation of the exercise of their contractual rights and the repeated amendments

of the plans for the Airport’s development.39!

According to the Claimants, the State “did not merely fail in its obligations under the
contract[s], but also incessantly interfered, by way of governmental action, making the
execution of the contract[s] impossible.”392 Relying on the Award in Alpha v. Ukraine,

the Claimants make the argument that it was the State that caused SJSC Airport to

breach its contractual obligations. They further submit that “the means of pressure and
interference the government exerted went beyond the bounds of the legal procedures

applicable to the SJSC Airport.”393

In addition, it is the Claimants’ position that their claims could not be settled by the
Latvian court system because, as already stated above, they do not relate to the Land
Lease Agreements themselves, but are treaty claims beyond the competence of those
courts. They further argue that, in any event, the Land Lease Agreements do not confer
exclusive jurisdiction on the Latvian courts, a contention that the Respondent
contests,3%4 and that “the Latvian court system has shown itself incapable of dispensing

justice.”395

B. The Non-Attribution Objection

The Respondent acknowledges that the acts or omissions of organs of the Latvian State,
such as the Ministry of Transport, the Marupe Council, the courts and the Ministry of
Justice, are attributable to Latvia. However, it argues that “the vast majority of the
acts” upon which the Claimants have based their claims are acts of SJSC Airport and
that those claims fall outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction because the acts of SJSC
Airport are not attributable to Latvia under international law,3° with the effect that,
for this reason, there also cannot properly be said to be a dispute between the Parties

under Article IX of the BIT.

The Respondent submits that the acts of SJSC Airport are not attributable to Latvia

because:

(a) SJSC Airport is a corporate legal entity under Latvian law that is separate from the
State and is therefore not a State organ within the meaning of Article 4 of the ILC

Articles;

(b) SJSC Airport does not exercise elements of governmental authority within the

meaning of Article 5 of the ILC Articles; and

397 1g,

(c) SJSC Airport does not and did not act in relation to any of the alleged breaches,
under the direction or control of the State of Latvia within the meaning of Article 8 of

the ILC Articles.397

Unlike the Respondent, the Claimants do not consider that the issue of attribution
pertains to the Tribunal’ s jurisdiction, but rather that it is an issue relevant to the merits

of its claims.398

With respect to attribution, it is the Claimants’ position, also contrary to that of the

Respondent, that the acts of SJSC Airport are attributable to the Respondent because:

(a) SJSC Airport, while legally separate from the State, is a de facto State organ under

international law;

(b) alternatively, SJSC Airport exercises elements of governmental authority associated
with the management, in the public interest, of the Airport, which is a “strategic State

asset” and “object of national interest”; or

(c) alternatively, SJSC Airport’s conduct is “instructed, directed or controlled by the

State.”399

The Claimants and the Respondent have made detailed and lengthy written and oral
submissions in support of their respective positions on attribution. The Tribunal has
carefully considered all of those submissions, but sees no need to describe them

comprehensively here. For present purposes, the following brief description suffices:

It is, as already noted, the Claimants’ view that SJSC Airport is an instrument of the
Latvian State, with no real autonomy of its own, notwithstanding its separate legal
personality. In this regard, the Claimants have relied heavily on the role allegedly
played by the Ministry of Transport in the control of SJSC Airport’s decision-making

and operations.

They have argued, first, that the Airport is “governed by its own specific legal

framework aimed at ensuring essential public interests’400 and have referred the

Tribunal to various provisions of the Latvian Law on State and Local Government
Capital Shares and Capital Companies and its successor legislation, the Law On
Governance of Capital Shares and Capital Companies (the “SOE Law”)40! in addition
to other statutes such as the Law on the Prevention and Squandering of Financial
Resources and Properties of a Public Person.492_ The Claimants also note that the
Cabinet of Ministers of Latvia has classified the Airport as an “object of national
interest, necessary to ensure essential public interests,” as recognized by the Riga

Administrative District Court.403

Second, the Claimants submit that SJSC Airport does not have an “independent” Board
and operates under the “close control” of the Ministry of Transport.4°4 They contend,
inter alia, that SSC Airport’s lack of independence from the State is confirmed by a
2015 OECD review of the corporate governance of State-owned enterprises (“SOEs”)
in Latvia (the “OECD Report”),495 according to which SOEs are commonly used by
the Latvian Government “as a vehicle for sectorial policies” without there being any
“clear distinction between the state’s ownership function from other state functions that
could influence conditions for Latvian SOEs.”406 They further note that, as from June
2009, when the Supervisory Council was abolished as a corporate governance body of
SOEs by an amendment to the SOE Law, State Secretaries representing the
Government shareholder “de facto [have] act[ed] as the board of directors for some of
the country’s largest enterprises and are individually responsible for the corporate
governance and management of all SOEs in their ministry’s portfolio,” according to

the OECD Report.407

The Claimants further submit that the findings and conclusions of the OECD Report
are supported by other documents, such as a “Position Paper on Competitiveness of
State-Owned Enterprises” prepared by the Foreign Investors Council in Latvia,498 a
presentation, entitled “Policy for Effective Management of State-owned Enterprises in
Latvia,” made by Mr. Juris Puce, the then-State Secretary of the Ministry of Economics,

Governance Concept of State Capital Shares’4!0 and two papers prepared by
academics at Riga Technical University, according to which SOEs in Latvia routinely
act as vehicles for the exercise of political influence and control in Latvia.4!! The
Claimants have drawn attention, in particular, to the affirmation of Mr. Puce in his
September 2011 presentation that: “Government is extensively involved in SOE
governing including significant political influence over operational decisions”

(emphasis in original).4!2

Third, the Claimants argue that SJSC Airport’s Board members are “politically
appointed and refer to themselves as state officials.”4!3 According to the Claimants,
“such ‘significant political influence’ has been very much present with respect to SJISC
Airport,” given the “extremely tight links to the Ministry of Transport (and other
Ministries)” of members of its Supervisory Council (until it was eliminated in 2009)
and its Management Board.4!4 These “tight links” are evidenced, according to the
Claimants, in particular by a number of press reports to which they have referred the
Tribunal.4!5 The Claimants have drawn attention, in particular, to the allegedly
“inappropriate[] close relationship between Krisjanis Peters, who was appointed as
chairman of the Management Board in 2007, and the man who appointed him, namely

Mr. Slesers, the Minister of Transport.”4!6

Fourth, as already mentioned, the Claimants also rely heavily on SJSC Airport’s
alleged financial dependence on the State.4!7 According to the Claimants, the
Government “decides all important financial matters, from the approval of the fees to
the use of the profits and the immovable assets.”4!8 The Claimants further argue that
SJSC Airport cannot take “any significant financial decisions itself,” given that all of
its purchases above EUR 143,000 (or previously the equivalent in lats) are required to

be approved by the Ministry of Transport.4!9

Fifth, the Claimants contend that the Ministry of Transport is “heavily involved” in
“nearly all decisions by [SJSC] Airport.”420 In this regard, the Claimants have
submitted, inter alia, that business plans of SJSC Airport were submitted for review to
the Cabinet of Ministers, the Ministry of Transport was involved in “discussions”
regarding the Land Lease Agreements, and decision-making, more generally, was
required to be approved by the Ministry of Transport.42! In addition, the Claimants
have referred to the 2018 report of a Latvian Parliamentary Investigation Commission
in relation to the airBaltic project, in which it was found, according to the Claimants,
that Mr. Slesers, when Minister of Transport, “(1) . . . saw the airport as his personal
project, taking decisions for his personal benefit; (2) . . . had a habit of negotiating the

details of Airport-related contracts in person . 3 (3). ..5 (4)... planned the

 

development of Riga Airport and the surrounding territory in detail; and (5) . . . took

pride in forcing out international investors.”422

Relying upon the judgments of the International Court of Justice in the Bosnian
Genocide and Nicaragua cases,‘?3 the decision on jurisdiction in Maffezini v. Spain424
and, in particular, the more recent UNCITRAL Award in Flemingo v. Poland,425 which
the Claimants describe as being “highly similar” to the present case,42° the Claimants
argue that the functions performed by SJSC Airport and the level of control exercised
over it by the State require that it be regarded as a de facto organ of the State under

Article 4 of the ILC Articles.

With respect to Flemingo v. Poland, the Claimants observe that that case, like this one,
concerned the termination of lease agreements that had been entered into by a local
investment vehicle of the investors with a State-owned enterprise (in that case, Polish
Airports State Enterprise, or “PPL”) that was established for the purpose of developing

and operating airports (in that case, in Poland).

In the Flemingo v. Poland case, the Claimants note that the tribunal “started from the
fact that ... PPL was owned and controlled by Poland,” as “demonstrated by the fact
that the State Treasury showed a level of control ‘by requiring PPL to obtain: (i)
approval of the Lease Agreements; (ii) approval of certain amendments thereto; and
(iii) approval of a temporary rent reduction.’”427 Similarly, the Claimants argue that
in the present case, SJSC Airport had to obtain (i) approval of the Lease Agreements
from the Ministry of Transport; (ii) approval for any amendments thereto; and (iii)

approval for the temporary rent reduction included in the 2010 Agreement.428

The Claimants further observe that, while the tribunal in Flemingo v. Poland noted that
PPL is “an independent ... self-financing organizational unit” under Polish law, with
its own legal personality, and conducts “its business operations independently, based
on its own plans,” such “expressions of quasi-independence and quasi-autonomy” were
not considered sufficient to “tip the scales” in circumstances where, as in the case of
SJSC Airport, according to the Claimants, PPL’s actions were guided by “the
objectives of the national socio-economic development plan” and were subject to

“many restrictions and forms of government control and interference.”429

The Claimants have drawn attention, in particular, to the Flemingo v. Poland tribunal’s

findings that:430

... the operation and management of an international airport is an activity
which is not usually carried out by private business, although a State may
delegate, through well-defined concessions, part of this management and
operation to private business. In the case at hand, however, the
management and operation was not delegated to private business but to a
State-owned entity... .

and:

For its assessment of whether PPL may be considered to be a de facto
State organ whose acts and omissions are attributable to Poland, the
Flemingo tribunal has attached much importance to the declaration from
Mr. Zbigniew Rynasiewicz, the Secretary of State in the Ministry of
Transport, who stated before the Polish Parliament in 2011 that “[PPL]
is an enterprise which is functioning within the structure of the Ministry
of [Transport]”. He moreover confirmed in 2013 that the Ministry of
Transport was participating in the modernisation of the Chopin Airport
by saying: “[w]hen it comes to questions on investments [...] the
supervision over PPL’s action is exercised by the minister responsible for

272.

273.

transport and in a way we are also responsible for all issues connected
with the functioning of the enterprise [PPL] — at the Chopin Airport in
Warsaw”. That the Secretary of State is not a legislator does not alter the
fact that the highest Polish authorities confirmed before the Polish
Parliament that PPL functioned within the structure of the Ministry of
Transport, which itself — through PPL — was participating in the
modernisation of the Chopin Airport.

Similarly, according to the Claimants, “in the present case, SJSC Airport is an
enterprise which is functioning within the structure of the Ministry of Transport — the
ministry as the holder of the state capital shares ensures implementation of the politics

in SJSC Airport and supervises its operation.”43!

Alternatively, should the Tribunal not accept that SJSC Airport is a de facto State organ
under Article 4 of the ILC Articles, the Claimants submit, as already indicated, that it
is empowered by the law of Latvia to exercise elements of government authority within
the meaning of Article 5 of the ILC Articles and/or has acted for relevant purposes on
the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, the State, within the meaning

of Article 8 of the ILC Articles.

For the purposes of Article 5, the Claimants argue that the “empowering law” is the
SOE Law, as supplemented by the Aviation Law. They observe that the SOE Law
“set[s] out the procedure according to which” SOEs “are to be founded, operated and
liquidated, as well as the procedure for managing capital shares, setting goals and
assessing operations.”432 Under the Aviation Law, they note further that SJSC Airport
“has been endowed with governmental authority to ensure sanitary, quarantine,

customs and border (passport) and other control of aircraft, crews and passengers.”433

In order to assess whether an entity exercises powers of governmental authority in
accordance with Article 5, the Claimants submit that it is necessary to consider whether
it could exercise such powers without governmental authorization, i.e., whether they
could be performed by “private actors.”434 In this regard, the Claimants note that SJSC
Airport has been “charged with several regulatory tasks that are clearly governmental

in nature,” including those just mentioned in the Aviation Law, in addition to

“regulatory matters such as civil aviation safety and emergency measure performance,

airport security and investigation,” in accordance with its Articles of Association.435

More generally, the Claimants affirm that the “management of such a strategic State
asset as an international airport could not possibly take place without the exercise of
governmental authority, sanctioned by State authorization.”436 According to the
Claimants, this includes, in particular, the management of lands granted to SJSC
Airport by the State and which could not be leased “without the explicit permission of

the State through the shareholder meeting.”437

The Claimants further argue that SJSC Airport’s powers have been bestowed upon it
in order to advance “classically sovereign objectives,” given that it was established to
operate “in the public interest” and is “publicly accountable” for the exercise of those

powers.438

They also refer to the requirement in the Land Lease Agreements that Rixport had to
pay EUR 150,000 per hectare of leased land in respect of non-refundable infrastructure
payments. According to the Claimants, “[t]his infrastructure was not intended for
commercial use only, nor was its usage intended to be restricted to Rixport or to the

Airport,” thus demonstrating its partially public purpose.439

With respect to Article 8 of the ILC Articles, it is the Claimants’ position that SJSC
Airport committed multiple acts upon the instructions, or under the direction or control,
of the State, including, inter alia, its decision to suspend or alter its development plans,
its dealings with airBaltic in respect of a possible new terminal, its application to the
Marupe Construction Board to amend the 2003 Detailed Plan and the alleged

postponement of terminal expansion until after 2020.440

In response, the Respondent disputes that any of SJSC Airport’s conduct can properly

be attributed to Latvia, whether under any of Articles 4, 5 or 8 of the ILC Articles.

With regard to Article 4, the Respondent submits, first, that in order for that provision
to apply, SJSC Airport must have the status of a State organ “in accordance with the
internal law” of Latvia and that there is no such thing as a “de facto State organ” under
Article 4.441 In this regard, the Respondent notes that it is undisputed that SJSC Airport

is not a State organ under Latvian law.

The Respondent nevertheless acknowledges that “international courts and tribunals
have considered that, in certain circumstances an entity may act ‘de facto’ as a State
organ,” but argues that “such findings have always been findings of fact that have only
been found to exist in ‘exceptional circumstances, since ultimately international law
looks to substance rather than form.’”442 According to the Respondent, such findings
have only been made in the “rarest of cases, such as in relation to the acts of armed
groups that exercise State authority without being prima facie part of the structure of
the State,” as in the Nicaragua and Bosnian Genocide cases referred to by the
Claimants.443 Under international law, the Respondent further argues, “the acts of
commercial companies, even when State-owned [such as SJSC Airport], are not
attributable to the State. They are structurally separate from the State and are engaged
in a commercial activity, and their conduct is therefore governed by private law.”444
The Respondent relies on the Commentary on the ILC Articles*45 in addition to
academic writings and a number of investment treaty cases in support of its position,
including, most recently, the Awards of the tribunals in the cases of Almds v. Poland*46
and Union Fenosa Gas v. Egypt,“47 in the latter of which the tribunal affirmed that:
“[C]ircumstances sufficient to connote the status of an organ of the State to a separate
legal person must be extraordinary, involving functions and powers considered to be

quintessentially powers of Statehood, such as those exercised by police authorities.”

The Respondent considers the Award of the Tribunal in Flemingo v. Poland, upon
which the Claimants heavily rely, to be “dubious authority” for failing to follow the
“heightened test prescribed by Article 4 of the ILC Articles to determine whether the

company managing the Chopin airport was a State organ.”448 The Respondent

considers that, in any event, the Flemingo v. Poland case is distinguishable from the
present one, given that, according to the Respondent: (i) SJSC Airport’s Management
Board is independent from the State; (ii) SJSC Airport is financially independent from
the State; and (iii) the Ministry of Transport did not interfere with the operation of SJISC

Airport.449

282. The Respondent notes, in support of its position, that in the Flemingo v. Poland case
the tribunal relied heavily on the repeated representation of the Secretary of State of
the Polish Ministry of Transport that the airport in that case was “functioning within
the structure of the Ministry” while there has never been any representation to that
effect here nor is that in any event the case of SJSC Airport.459 On the contrary, the
Respondent argues, “the Latvian State as Shareholder of SJSC Airport, represented by
the Ministry of Transport, consistently made it clear that, in accordance with Latvian

law, it could not interfere with the operation of the company.”45!

283. For the Respondent, it is immaterial that the State has the ability to appoint and remove
all of the members of SJSC Airport’s Management Board under the SOE Law. It does
not follow from this, in the Respondent’s view, consistent with the finding of the
tribunal in Unidn Fenosa Gas, that the company lacks autonomy. In arguing that SJISC
Airport is financially independent of the State, the Respondent also notes that SJSC
Airport is a profit-making company and, moreover, that Latvia is prevented from
financing SJSC Airport’s economic activity by EU law on State aid.452 As regards the
need for the Ministry to approve expenses of SJSC Airport above EUR 143,000, the
Respondent explains that “this measure was put in place in 2009 in the context of the
financial crisis to ensure that companies controlled by the State paid increased attention
to their spending and was revoked in 2017.”453 According to the Respondent, the
Ministry could not “opine” on whether such expenses were “appropriate,” but merely
ensured that the projected expenses were “included in the company’s budget, that an
appropriate tender process ha[d] been followed and that they compl[ied] with the

company’s articles of association.”454 The Respondent further emphasizes that the

Ministry of Transport has had no involvement in the preparation of SJSC Airport’s

business plans.495

In reliance, inter alia, on the evidence of Ms. Innusa and Messrs. Kanels and Saveljevs,
the Respondent further argues that, unlike in the Flemingo v. Poland case: (i) the State
was not involved in the negotiation of the leases at issue and was not required to
approve them or the amendments thereto; (ii) the State did not monitor SJSC Airport
in accordance with a law dealing specifically with its supervision; (iii) SJSC Airport
was not required to report “intensively and directly to the Minister,” and the Minister
could not “direct it to perform certain tasks and evaluate its finances and staff salaries”;
(iv) there was no agreement entered into between SJSC Airport and the Ministry of
Transport formalizing the latter’s supervision over the modernization of the Airport;
and (v) the Minister of Transport did not acknowledge that he was “controlling every

action of the airport company.”456

It is, thus, the Respondent’s position that the “very high” threshold for equating a

legally separate public corporation to a State organ is not met in the present case.

Nor, in the Respondent’s view, have the Claimants established that SJSC Airport was
empowered to exercise governmental authority within the meaning of Article 5 of the

ILC Articles.

The Respondent argues, first, that a “key requirement for governmental authority to be
exercised in accordance with Article 5 . . . [is that] governmental authority must be
conferred ‘by the law of that State.’”457 It is the Respondent's position that there is no
such Latvian law in this case. Although the Claimants have referred to the SOE Law,
the Respondent considers that that law is irrelevant because it merely provides for the
creation and management of SJSC Airport and is, thus, not a sufficient basis for the
attribution of SJSC Airport’s conduct to Latvia; nor are any laws under which SJSC
Airport may have received land from the State.458 The Respondent has referred in this

regard to a letter dated 16 July 2012459 from SJSC Airport to the Ministry of Transport

in which the former expressly confirms that it “has not been delegated tasks of state

administration” and the related supporting evidence of Ms. Innusa.460

288. The Respondent submits, further, that the Claimants’ argument that SJSC Airport has
been characterized as an “object of national interest” is “both wrong and
contradictory.”46! According to the Respondent, this status was not granted to SJSC
Airport, but to parts of the Airport’s territory because the Airport is “of strategic
importance for landing aircrafts which have been intercepted by NATO aviation.”462
The Respondent notes that, in any event, “the Claimants fail to identify any
governmental prerogative conferred on SJSC Airport by the characterisation of parts

of its territory as an ‘object of national interest.’”463

289. It is, moreover, the Respondent’s position that a “particular act of an entity involves
the exercise of governmental authority only if it involves the use of force or compulsive
State power, that is puissance publique,” and “[t]he mere exercise of public functions,

or acting in the public interest, does not meet this test.”464

290. The Respondent disputes that, as contended by the Claimants, SJSC Airport has been
endowed with any governmental authority under the Aviation Law for the purpose of
ensur[ing] sanitary, quarantine, customs and border (passport) and other control of
aircraft, crews and passengers,” and argues that, irrespective of that, the capacity in
which SJSC Airport interacted with Rixport concerned the leasing of land, which, as
recently confirmed in the case of Almds v. Poland, does not involve the exercise of
governmental authority.465 Rather, for the Respondent, the Land Lease Agreements
are “purely commercial agreements motivated by a purely commercial interest” and
cannot properly be characterized as a “governmental project.”46° More specifically,
the Respondent rejects the Claimants’ attempt to distinguish between the land leased
in the Almas v. Poland case (agricultural land) and the land at issue in the present case
and also rejects the Claimants’ contention that the Land Lease Agreements “went above

and beyond commercial purposes.”467

The Respondent further notes that, while the Claimants “have dedicated large parts of
their Reply to the argument that SJSC Airport had been endowed with governmental
authority,” they have been unable “to explain how the acts that they consider as
breaches of the BIT may have been carried out in the exercise of such governmental
authority.”468 In this regard, the Respondent refers to the following passage in the ILC

Commentary on Article 5 (emphasis in original):469

If it is to be regarded as an act of the State for purposes of international
responsibility, the conduct of an entity must . . . concern governmental
activity and not other private or commercial activity in which the entity
may engage. Thus, for example, the conduct of a railway company to
which certain police powers have been granted will be regarded as an act
of the State under international law if it concerns the exercise of those
powers, but not if it concerns other activities (e.g. the sale of tickets or the
purchase of rolling stock).

It is equally the Respondent’s position that, in invoking Article 8 of the ILC Articles in
the alternative, the Claimants have failed to identify any instance where SJSC Airport’s
allegedly wrongful conduct was carried out “on the instruction of, or under the direction
or control of” Latvia.47° According to the Respondent, the so-called instructions upon
which the Claimants rely are merely “high-level policy documents” setting out the
general objectives of the Government, “without specifying instructions as to their
implementation.”47! The Respondent submits that SJSC Airport “was free to determine
its own strategy in line with these broad objectives.”472 The Respondent argues that
the Claimants have, in any event, failed to establish that any actions that SJSC Airport
may have taken, allegedly as a result of a decision of the Ministry of Transport, would
have caused the Claimants any harm473 or were otherwise intended to achieve any
“State purpose”, as opposed to actions intended to further SJSC Airport’s “perceived

commercial best interests.”474

C. The Rox and Staur Objection

It is not disputed, as already mentioned, that each of the Claimants invested in Rixport

at different times. EBO was initially Rixport’s sole shareholder when it was established

in March 2006. Rox became a shareholder on or about 19 January 2007 and Staur on
or about 17 April 2008.

According to the Respondent, the timing of the Claimants’ respective shareholdings in
Rixport affects the Claimants’ claims in this arbitration in the following three different
ways: (i) only EBO can bring a claim for alleged breaches preceding January 2007,
and EBO and Staur for events preceding April 2008; (ii) legitimate expectations of the
Claimants can only arise at the time the investment of an investor is in fact made; and
(iii) any returns the investor has already made from its investment must be deducted

from its damages to avoid double recovery.47>

The Claimants accept that Rox and Staur did not make their investments in Rixport
before January 2007 and April 2008 respectively, but argue that none of the foregoing
“three effects affects the Claimants’ argumentation” in the present case.476 The
Claimants argue, first, that Rox, Staur and EBO each enjoy standing as “qualifying
investors” to bring the Claimants’ claims as they “jointly sustained the damages which
materialized over a significant period of time, while they were all owners of the
investment.”477 In this regard, the Claimants submit that the Claimants’ investment
was the subject of a “creeping expropriation” that, as discussed in Section VI below,
was completed on 21 March 2014, “at which point all three Claimants had had effective
control over the investment varying from 6 to 8 years.”478 For the Claimants, it is
immaterial whether the “very first act of the Respondent leading to this creeping
expropriation (being the Minister of Transport’s change of plans for the Airport in

November 2006) happened before” either Rox or Staur had become shareholders.479

Second, while the Claimants accept that legitimate expectations must be formed at the
time when the investment is made, it is their position that the “overall expectations that
EBO had legitimately formed” in July 2006 “were still legitimate when Rox became a
shareholder in January 2007 and Staur in April 2008,” although they concede that

“when Staur acquired its shares in 2008, some additional uncertainty had already arisen

due to the changed plans regarding the expansion of the terminal reflected in the 2007

Amendment.”480

Third, as none of the Claimants has, according to the Claimants, “made any returns
which could be deducted” from an award of damages, the Claimants argue that “the
fact that each Claimant became a shareholder at a different point in time . . . has no or

very limited effect on the damages of the case.”48!

D. The Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision

It is undisputed that all of the Claimants made investments in Latvia within the meaning
of the BIT and the ICSID Convention and that those investments were made subsequent
to the entry into force of the BIT. There is also no dispute that the Claimants are
Norwegian entities within the meaning of the BIT and that they are advancing claims
in this arbitration for the breach of specific provisions of the BIT by Latvia subsequent
to their investments. Nor is it disputed that the Parties have consented to the arbitration

of claims for such breaches under the Arbitration Rules.

The Tribunal therefore has little difficulty in deciding that it has jurisdiction ratione
personae, ratione temporis and ratione materiae over the claims being advanced in this
arbitration by the Claimants. In the view of the Tribunal, the Respondent’s
“jurisdictional” objections do not actually concern the Tribunal’s jurisdiction in respect

of the claims, as made by the Claimants, but concern instead the merits of those claims.

Although the Respondent has argued that the disputes that are the subject of the
Claimants’ claims, except the denial of justice claims, do not fall under the dispute
resolution clause in Article IX of the BIT because they are allegedly contract claims
dressed up as treaty claims and, thus, “have no autonomous existence as potential treaty
breaches,”482 the Tribunal does not consider that, for the purpose of determining
whether it has jurisdiction over the Claimants’ claims, it is for the Tribunal to undertake
to determine whether the Claimants’ claims should be recharacterized as contract
claims where, as here, they have been expressly advanced by the Claimants as claims

for specific breaches of the BIT.

ARB:

484 pan American Energy LLC and BP Argentina Exploration Company

As ICSID and other international tribunals have repeatedly found, the task of a tribunal
such as this one in considering whether it has jurisdiction over the claims before it is to
determine whether the claims, “in the way in which” they have been “stated,” fall
within the jurisdictional framework of the relevant arbitration clause and not whether
they are well-founded.483 As the tribunal observed in the case of Panamerican Energy
v. Argentina:484 “ . . . the claims made in the present case must be taken as they are by
the Tribunal at this stage of the proceedings, whose only task it is, in the present phase
of the proceedings, to determine whether, as formulated, they fit into the jurisdictional

parameters set out by the relevant treaty instrument or instruments” (emphasis added).

Although the Tribunal accepts, as acknowledged by the tribunal in the case of Malicorp
v. Egypt,485 upon which the Respondent relies,486 that, in considering its jurisdiction,
there may be scope for it to question whether a claiming party has improperly
undertaken to label as a treaty claim a claim that falls outside the purview of the relevant
treaty, the Tribunal does not consider that it should do so unless the claim manifestly

falls outside the boundaries of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

This is consistent with the approach adopted by the tribunals in the cases of Jan de Nul
v. Egypt487 and Hamester v. Ghana,488 upon which the Respondent also relies,489 in
considering whether the issue of attribution should be examined at the jurisdictional or
the merits stage. While the Hamester v. Ghana tribunal was of the view that the
question of whether the issue of attribution is, in a given case, one of jurisdiction or
one of merits is not “susceptible of a clear-cut answer,” it nevertheless referred
approvingly, as in Jan de Nul v. Egypt, to the application of a “prima facie” test at the
jurisdictional stage, i.e.: “[I]t is not for the Tribunal at the jurisdictional stage to
examine whether the case is in effect brought against the State and involves the latter’s
responsibility. An exception is made in the event that it is manifest that the entity

involved has no link whatsoever with the State.”490

Similarly, the Tribunal considers that unless it is manifest that the claims being
advanced by the Claimants could only be contract claims and could not conceivably be
characterized as treaty claims, it is not appropriate for the Tribunal to decline
jurisdiction on the basis that they are not treaty claims. This is particularly so where,
as here, the claims as presented are not stated to be for the breach of the Land Lease
Agreements and have been made in respect of the conduct of numerous actors who
were not themselves parties to those agreements, including, notably, the Ministry of

Transport, the Marupe Municipality and the Latvian courts.

For the same reasons, and consistent with the approach taken by the tribunals in both
Jan de Nul v. Egypt and Hamester v. Ghana, as well as the more recent Award in the
case of Almds v. Poland,49! the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s objection to
jurisdiction based on its contention that the conduct of SJSC Airport is not attributable
to Latvia. The Tribunal notes that the claims being advanced have been made against
the State rather than SJSC Airport, and, as in Hamester v. Ghana, “the Tribunal is not
faced ... with a situation where it is readily evident that the State is not involved at all,
or where the issue is capable of an answer based upon a limited enquiry (akin to other
jurisdictional issues).”492 As the Hamester v. Ghana tribunal stated: “On the contrary,
the evidential record . . . is more complex. In fact, the Respondent itself recognises that
some acts are attributable to the .. . Government, while denying that they amount to
international illegal behaviour. In other words, while the extent of the State’s
involvement is unclear, it is not contested that some acts are attributable to [the

State].”493 The same is equally true here.

Further, the Tribunal does not consider that the issues pertaining to the time when Rox
and Staur made their investments are of a jurisdictional character. Rather, in
circumstances where, as here, it is alleged that the treaty breaches continued over a
period of years, including the period after Rox and Staur became shareholders of
Rixport, they concern the possible extent of the Respondent’s liability, if any, to Rox

and Staur, respectively, and therefore relate to the merits of the claims.

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal holds that it has jurisdiction over the claims

advanced by the Claimants under the BIT.

THE MERITS

Before addressing the Claimants’ specific claims on their merits, it is appropriate to
begin this Section by considering certain of the issues that arise in respect of the
Claimants’ contention that the conduct of SJSC Airport is to be attributed to the
Respondent. Although, as already stated, the Claimants’ claims are only partially
founded on the conduct of SJSC Airport, a determination of the extent of the
Respondent’s responsibility for the behavior of SJSC Airport, if any, may potentially
narrow the issues that need to be considered in respect of the Claimants’ claims. In
particular, it is useful to address at the outset (i) whether SJSC Airport is to be treated
as an organ of the Latvian State and (ii) if not, whether it is empowered to exercise
elements of governmental authority sufficient to attribute its acts to the State. Whether
or not, in the absence of such a finding, any acts of SJSC Airport may be said to have
been violative of Latvia’s obligations under the BIT because they were performed at
the direction, or on the instruction or under the control, of the Respondent is a matter

that may be more usefully considered when addressing the Claimants’ specific claims.

The Tribunal, thus, considers, first, in Section VIA below the Claimants’ contentions
that SJSC Airport (i) is a de facto organ of the Latvian State or (ii) alternatively,

exercises elements of governmental authority sufficient to attribute its acts to the State.

The Tribunal then considers the merits of the Claimants’ breach claims in Sections
VIB to VLD below, including the question of whether specific conduct of SJSC

Airport can otherwise be attributed to Latvia.

The Parties agree that the possible attribution of SJSC Airport’s conduct to Latvia is to
be decided with reference to the rules on attribution that are set forth in the ILC Articles

and, in particular, Articles 4, 5 and 8.

A. Attribution

1. ILC Article 4 ~Is SJSC Airport a State Organ?

It is common ground that under Article 4, the conduct of a State organ acting as such
is attributable to the State. It is also common ground that, as stated in Article 4(2): “An
organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal
law of the State.” There is no dispute in the present case that SJSC Airport is not
considered under Latvian law to be an organ of the State and that, to the contrary, it has
been established, as already mentioned, as a corporate entity, with its own, separate

legal personality. It is therefore not a State organ de jure.

90

313.

314.

315.

316.

It has nevertheless been recognized in the Commentary to the ILC Articles, other
doctrinal writings and in the jurisprudence of international tribunals that a person or
entity may be characterized as an organ of the State as a matter of international law
even if it does not possess that character under the State’s internal law. As stated by
the tribunal in Almds v. Poland: “[I|nternal status does not necessarily imply that an
entity is not a State organ if other factors, such as the performance of core governmental
functions, direct day-to-day subordination to central government, or lack of all

operational autonomy, point the other way.”494

The question that therefore arises is whether such “other factors” exist in the present
case such as to warrant treating SJSC Airport, which is not a State organ in the Latvian

legal order, as a de facto State organ for present purposes.

As noted in Section V.B above, the Claimants have argued that SJSC Airport should
be treated as a de facto State organ for the following five reasons: (i) the Airport is
governed by its own specific legal framework aimed at ensuring essential public
interests; (ii) SSC Airport does not have an “independent” Board and operates under
the “close control” of the Ministry of Transport; (iii) SJSC Airport’s Board members
are “politically appointed” and “refer to themselves as ‘state officials’;” (iv) SISC
Airport is financially dependent on the State; and (v) the Ministry of Transport is
“heavily involved” in “nearly all decisions by SJSC Airport.” In these circumstances,
it is the Claimants’ position that the governance and activities of SJSC Airport are so
“intermingled” with those of the State in general and the Ministry of Transport in

particular that SJSC Airport should be regarded as part of the government structure.49>

Of the authorities upon which the Claimants rely in urging the Tribunal to disregard
SJSC Airport’s separate corporate structure (as mentioned in {265 above), the only one

that presents any similarities to the circumstances in the present case is the Award in

 

Flemingo v. Poland. The case of Maffezini v. Spain is not of any particular assistance
as, in that case, the acts at issue were found to be attributable to the State in accordance
with Article 5 of the ILC Articles and not Article 4. Moreover, neither the Bosnian
Genocide nor the Nicaragua case is apposite as each of those cases concerned actions
carried out by para-military forces exercising the kinds of police powers that are

generally considered to be quintessential powers of Statehood.

319.

The conduct that is at issue in this arbitration is of a far different character. We are
here concerned with conduct relating to the leasing of land, which as noted in the case
of Almas v. Poland, is not generally viewed as “an executive government function,”
even if the land belongs to the State and the lease is entered into with a State entity.49°
Nevertheless, the Claimants have pointed to the Flemingo v. Poland decision as
authority for the proposition that conduct in respect of leases entered into by an SOE
charged with the management of an airport, as in the present case, may be attributed to
the State where the SOE effectively operates, as stated in that decision, “within the

structure of the Ministry of Transport” and, thus, according to that decision, as a de

facto State organ.497

As already noted, the Respondent has been critical of the Flemingo v. Poland decision,
which it considers to be inconsistent with a long line of cases respecting the legal
separation between an SOE and the State, including, in particular, the cases of Unién
Fenosa v. Egypt, Jan de Nul v. Egypt, Bayindir v. Pakistan, EDF v. Romania, Hamester

v. Ghana, Tulip v. Turkey and Almas v. Poland.498

As the Respondent has noted, in none of those cases was the fact of State ownership
and the exercise of various elements of State control, such as the appointment and
replacement of Board members, oversight in relation to the SOE’s decisions or conduct
or other links with the State considered sufficient to overcome the SOE’s presumed
separateness from the State, provided that the SOE conserved at least some degree of
autonomy. Thus, for example, the Respondent points out that the tribunal in Jan de
Nul v. Egypt found that the “public authority” in that case (the Suez Canal Authority)
was not an organ of the State even though: (i) its chairman, Board members, managing
directors and general manager were all appointed by the State; (ii) it had to report to
the Prime Minister, who was in charge of approving all decisions of its Board of
Directors before they became effective; (iii) the revenues from its activity were
automatically transferred to the State’s treasury; (iv) its employees had the status of
State officials; (v) it was subject to public procurement law provisions applicable to
the State; and (vi) its acts were subject to judicial review only by administrative courts
in charge of adjudicating disputes with the government. Nevertheless, the Suez Canal
Authority was considered to be distinct from the State, given that it had its own legal

personality and was a commercial entity with its own budget.

Similarly, as already noted, the Respondent argues that in this case too the activities of
SJSC Airport are essentially commercial, and it operates under its own budget.
Moreover, it is the Respondent’s position that SJSC Airport enjoys far more autonomy
than the Suez Canal Authority. For the Respondent, neither the fact that SJISC Airport
has been established under an SOE Law, nor the fact that Board members may be
“politically appointed” suffices to deprive SJSC Airport of its legal separateness.
Moreover, the Respondent disputes the Claimants’ attempt to portray SJSC Airport as
an entity operating, like PPL in the Flemingo v. Poland case, “within the structure of
the Ministry of Transport.” The Respondent does not accept, in particular, that: (i)
SJSC Airport does not have an independent Board; (ii) SJSC Airport is financially
dependent on the State; and (iii) the Ministry of Transport is “heavily involved” in

“nearly all decisions by SJSC Airport,” as contended by the Claimants.

In support of its position that SJSC Airport operates in its own commercial interest and
autonomously from the State, the Respondent has relied heavily on the witness
evidence of Mr. Saveljevs and Ms. Innusa, who, as a Deputy State Secretary at the
Ministry of Transport since April 2010, has represented the Ministry’s State Secretary
as the holder of SJSC Airport’s shares, including in Shareholders’ Meetings, since that

time.

According to Mr. Saveljevs, inter alia: (i) the Ministry of Transport is not involved in

SJSC Airport’s business operations and avoided getting involved in its dealings with

 

Rixport;499 (ii) SISC Airport’s management takes decisions based on the commercial
interests of the Airport;50 (iii) while SJSC Airport has to take the “overall objectives”
of the Ministry of Transport into account, “such strategic plans do not translate directly
into . . . [SJSC] Airport’s concrete development plans or day-to-day operations,”59!
which Mr. Saveljevs insisted are based on SJSC Airport’s “own operational plans,” as
informed by passenger forecasts prepared by industry consultants;52 (iv) government
planning documents are “guidelines,” but “it is up to SJSC Airport’s management to
take specific decisions and actions;”5 and (v) SJSC Airport’s operations are financed

by the Airport’s income and not by funds from the State budget, except for the purpose

of supporting safety and security, as permitted under the regulations concerning State

aid to airports and airlines.504

In her evidence, Ms. Innusa has also confirmed that: (i) SJSC Airport is financially
independent from the State;>95 (ii) policy documents issued by the Ministry of
Transport do not constitute “instructions” to SJSC Airport;5 and (iii) SISC Airport is
responsible for the preparation of its own business plans, although they are subject to

review by the State shareholder to ensure their commercial reasonableness.5°7

She has further testified that: (i) to the best of her knowledge, the Land Lease
Agreements were neither communicated to nor approved by the Ministry of Transport

interfere with the management of SJSC Airport by providing directions or any other
guidance;509 (iii) she had no involvement in the negotiation of the 2010 Agreement,
which she only learned about “through informal discussions” with members of the
Management Board after it was entered into;5!9 (iv) the 2010 Agreement was not
required to be, and was not, approved by the Ministry of Transport as SJSC Airport’s
shareholder;5!! (vy) while Rixport and its shareholders requested on several occasions
that the Ministry of Transport intervene in their negotiations with SJSC Airport, the
Ministry of Transport regularly informed them “of the legal separation of competence
between the Management Board and the holder of capital shares, which prevents the
Ministry from intervening in SJSC Airport’s commercial activities;”5!2 (vi) Latvian
SOEs such as SJSC Airport, which are created to perform commercial activities, must
operate “on the basis of commercial principles” and are primarily regulated by Latvian
commercial law;5!3 and (vii) the competence of the Management Board is “very
broad,” with the State shareholder having limited authority to approve only certain

matters.

In this regard, Ms. Innusa has noted that when the Land Lease Agreements were entered

Council, and the State shareholder was only responsible for the “approval of the annual
accounts, the decisions on the use of profits from the previous year, the appointment of
the members of the Supervisory Council and the auditor, the approval of the articles of
association, decisions on increasing or decreasing share capital, reorganising the
company, approval of decisions regarding the acquisition of or increase in shareholding
in another company, acquisition or disposal of a business and abandoning existing
activities and initiating new activities, and decisions relating to the winding up of the

company.” 514

As already indicated, the Supervisory Council was eliminated as a corporate body in
June 2009 (until June 2016 when it was reinstated). According to Ms. Innusa, during
the period when SJSC Airport had no Supervisory Council, the State shareholder “took
over certain competences previously allocated to the Supervisory Council, such as the
appointment and removal of members of the Management Board, the approval of
certain transactions, like the alienation or encumbrance of real estate or the approval of
mid-term strategies” and matters outside SJSC Airport’s “usual commercial
activity.”515 Tt is her position that the removal of the Supervisory Council “resulted in
an increased autonomy of the Management Board” as the State shareholder did not
“replace the Supervisory Council in terms of supervising the activity of SJSC

Airport.”516

While Ms. Innusa has acknowledged, as the Claimants have noted, that approval by the
State’s shareholder representative of SJSC Airport’s expenses above a certain amount
(LVL 100,000/EUR 143,000) was required as from April 2009 until 2017 (when this
requirement was revoked following the reinstatement of the Supervisory Council), this
was, according to her, a measure that had its origins in the financial crisis in order to
“ensure that companies controlled by the State paid increased attention to their
spending in particularly difficult times for the Latvian economy.”5!7 According to her,
all corresponding applications of SJSC Airport were approved, without the

appropriateness of any of SJSC Airport’s expenses being questioned.5!8

arguing that, in fact, this is not a case where the Government merely “gives incidental
instructions.”>!9 Rather, according to the Claimants, the “Government is in charge of
the airport, taking all decisions that matter, and being kept informed on a continuous
and detailed level.”520 As mentioned above (see {{[260-261), the Claimants have
placed heavy reliance in support of their position on the OECD Report, a 2012 Cabinet
of Ministers Order on the Governance Concept of State Capital Shares, a 2011
presentation of Mr. Puce (then the State Secretary of the Ministry of Economics), and
other publications concerning the governance and management of Latvian SOEs
generally. They have also emphasized the role played by the State in appointing or
replacing Supervisory Council (and between 2009 and 2016, Management Board)
members, the extent to which Mr. Slesers allegedly implicated himself in Airport
governance matters while he was Minister (i.e., until March 2009) and the
inconceivability of SJSC Airport “somehow go[ing] against what is decided at the top

of the Ministry.”52!

The Tribunal has seen no evidence, however, that the Ministry of Transport played any
role or took any decisions in respect of the Land Lease Agreements that are the subject
of this arbitration or that, contrary to the Claimants’ assertion, “day-to-day governance
decisions” of SJSC Airport were directed by the Ministry.522. Much of the evidence
upon which the Claimants rely, including, in particular, the OECD Report, the 2012
Cabinet of Ministers Order and the 2011 presentation of Mr. Puce, is of a generic nature
and does not address specifically or in any detail the management of SJSC Airport, let
alone SJSC Airport’s award and administration of the Land Lease Agreements. In the
Tribunal’s view, the Claimants’ evidence does not call into question or otherwise
undermine the evidence of either Mr. Saveljevs or Ms. Innusa, both of whom the
Tribunal found to be credible witnesses, and, in particular, Ms. Innusa’s testimony that,
for as long as she was working for the Ministry of Transport, neither she nor any of her

colleagues “interfered with the business dealings or transactions of’ SJSC Airport.523

Moreover, there is no evidence that the Ministry of Transport had any material
involvement in the preparation of the tender for the Land Lease Agreements or their
subsequent negotiation or award to the Claimants or their later amendment and

termination. Although Rixport and its representatives approached the Ministry on

various occasions, both before and after the leases were awarded and, in seeking to
obtain the modification of a provision in the leases, sought the Ministry’s intervention
during their negotiation in October 2006, the Claimants have failed to establish that the
Ministry had any influence on the terms of the Land Lease Agreements. To the
contrary, the evidence shows that Rixport was expressly advised by SJSC Airport,
prior to the conclusion of the Land Lease Agreements, that SJSC Airport was of the
view that the agreements were “private law contract[s]” between “private law
entities.”524 There is no evidence that the Ministry of Transport, or the Latvian State,

more generally, was of a different view or conducted itself as if that were not the case.

It is also apparent from the evidence that the Ministry of Transport was reluctant to
become involved in the relations between Rixport and SJSC Airport when requested to

do so by Rixport, its representatives or others.52>

Although it has not been disputed that the Ministry of Transport appointed the members
of SJSC Airport’s Supervisory Council (when it had one) and its Management Board
(when there was no Supervisory Council), exercised oversight over SJSC Airport’s
conduct and developed policy objectives that SJSC Airport was required to take into
account, the role played by the Ministry was not unlike that ordinarily played by the
shareholder of any private company, and such conduct is not sufficient, in the
Tribunal’s view, for SJSC Airport’s separate legal personality to be disregarded and

for SJSC Airport to be treated as an organ of the State.

Unlike in the case of Flemingo v. Poland, upon which the Claimants have relied, this
is not a case in which the State ever assumed responsibility for the actions of the SOE

concerned, either expressly or impliedly.

While the Claimants have attributed considerable importance to the role allegedly
played, and statements made, by Mr. Slesers while he served as Minister of Transport
(and prior to his assuming that position), they have nevertheless failed to show that
anything that he did or said materially deprived SJSC Airport of its autonomy in respect

of the Land Lease Agreements, in particular, or more generally.

Nor in the Tribunal’s view, consistent with the position followed in the cases of Almds

v. Poland, Jan de Nul v. Egypt and Hamester v. Ghana, is an SOE required to be treated

as a State organ merely because certain of its activities may be regarded as important
to the national interest,>2° particularly where, as here, the SOE’s activities are primarily
of a commercial nature and, as recognized by the OECD Report upon which the
Claimants themselves rely, is “expected to finance [its] operations through commercial
activities.”527 What matters is the degree to which an SOE’s actions are directly

controlled by the State.

In the present case, there is insufficient evidence of such direct control for SJSC Airport
to be treated as a de facto organ of the Latvian State notwithstanding its distinct legal

personality, separate budget and management structure.

2. ILC Article 5 ~Is SJSC Airport Empowered to Exercise
Elements of Governmental Authority?

Under Article 5, “[t]he conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State
under article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of
the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international
law, provided that the person or entity is acting in that capacity in that particular

instance.”528

It is undisputed that two conditions must be satisfied in order for Article 5 to apply: (i)
the entity in question must be “empowered by the law of the State to exercise elements
of . . . governmental authority;” and (ii) that entity must be acting in that capacity in

the matter at issue.

The Parties do not agree with respect to the satisfaction of either of these conditions.
As noted above, the Claimants are of the view that both conditions have been met,

while the Respondent does not consider that either condition has been satisfied.

With respect to the first condition, the Claimants have argued, as already indicated, that
the “empowering law” is the SOE Law, as supplemented by the Aviation Law, under
which, according to the Claimants, SJSC Airport has been endowed with governmental
authority to “ensure sanitary, quarantine, customs and border (passport) and other
control of aircraft, crews and passengers.”>29 The Claimants submit more generally

that SJSC Airport has implicitly been endowed with governmental authority, given that

526 See, e.g., Almas v. Poland, Ex. RLA-8, (210.

342.

the Airport is a “strategic State asset,” the management of which “could not possibly
take place without the exercise of governmental authority.”530 As also noted above,
the Claimants further argue that SJSC Airport’s powers have been bestowed upon it in
order to advance “classically sovereign purposes,” given that it was established to
operate “in the public interest” and is “publicly accountable” for the exercise of those

powers.>3!

The Respondent counters that SJSC Airport has not been delegated with any tasks of
State administration, as SJSC Airport confirmed in a letter to the Ministry of Transport
dated 16 July 2012,532 and as stated by Ms. Innusa in her evidence.533_ For the
Respondent, the SOE Law is irrelevant for the reasons already mentioned above (see
287). Moreover, the Respondent observes that the matters referred to in the Aviation
Law have not been delegated to SJSC Airport to perform. Rather, these are functions
performed at the Airport by the Latvian State through civil servants having no
affiliation with SJSC Airport.>34 Equally groundless, according to the Respondent, is
the Claimants’ attempt to argue that governmental authority has implicitly been
conferred on SJSC Airport by virtue of the Airport’s strategic importance, given that,
under Latvian law, governmental authority can only be delegated through (i) an
“external regulatory enactment” or regulation adopted by the Government; or (ii) a
specific agreement between the State and the entity receiving the delegation.535 The

Respondents note that there has been no such delegation in the present case.

Having considered the Parties’ competing arguments and the relevant exhibits and
authorities, the Tribunal is not persuaded that there has been any delegation of
governmental authority to SJSC Airport under Latvian law. The Tribunal agrees with
the Respondent that the SOE Law does not delegate any governmental authority to
SJSC Airport, but merely provides for its establishment and governance. Nor do the
provisions of the Aviation Law upon which the Claimants rely, or any other enactment
or instrument, delegate the performance of any specific governmental tasks to SJSC
Airport. Although the Claimants have contended that SJSC Airport’s powers have
been bestowed upon it in order to advance “classically sovereign purposes,” they have
failed to demonstrate that SJSC Airport itself enjoys or is entitled to exercise any

sovereign powers at all, such as acts of a regulatory nature or otherwise involving the

use of the State’s public prerogatives or imperium, i.e., acts of “puissance publique.”
In this regard, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that it does not follow simply
from the Airport’s classification as an “object of national interest” that SJSC Airport
has been empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority, in the absence of
any showing that specific elements of governmental authority have, in fact, been

conferred upon SJSC Airport.

This having been said, even if it were to be accepted that SJSC Airport has been
empowered by the law of Latvia to exercise elements of governmental authority, the
Tribunal does not consider that the conduct of SJSC Airport that is at issue in this
arbitration can properly be said to implicate the exercise of governmental authority.
Rather, as in Almas v. Poland, Jan de Nul v. Egypt, Hamester v. Ghana and other cases
to which the Respondent has referred in its submissions, the conduct of SJSC Airport
with which this dispute is concerned is of a quintessentially commercial character, i-e.,
the management of its relationship with private investors in relation to the development
of real estate in accordance with contracts concluded for that purpose on commercial
terms and governed by Latvian private law. As the Respondent has correctly argued,
ordinary contractual acts, without more, are not generally considered to constitute acts
of governmental authority. Moreover, the land at issue was not intended to be used for
a public purpose, but was to be developed for commercial use in the form of hotels,
office buildings, convention, parking and other facilities, all of which were to be
privately owned and operated. As held by the tribunal in Almds v. Poland, the
commercial character of a lease transaction is not altered by the fact that, as here, the

land concerned is owned by the State or leased by a State-owned entity.

In arguing that SJSC Airport was exercising governmental authority in its dealings with
Rixport, the Claimants have acknowledged that “[t]he mere lease of land belonging to
the State may indeed not be an exercise of governmental authority as such.”536
However, they submit that the exercise of governmental authority was implicated in

this case because:537

(i) SJSC Airport was fully dependent on the Ministry of Transport for
the negotiation, execution and performance of the Land Lease
Agreements.

536 C1. Reply 4696.
537 4g,

345.

346.

347.

348.

(ii) ... the powers of the Ministry to appoint and remove members of
SJSC Airport’s Management Board and Supervisory Council
were far greater than those of Poland in the Almds case.

(iii) ... Almas concerned the lease of land for agricultural purposes;
whereas the lands here are being leased for the development of
public infrastructure, namely Latvia’s sole international Airport.
Any private landowner could lease out land for agricultural
purposes (zoning laws permitting), but private landowners could
never decide upon the creation and development of an
international airport and lease out land for that purpose.

Moreover, the Claimants observe that their “complaints in the present case relate to far
more than the mere lease of land: the focus of their claims is centered on the repeated
changes to the development plans, which have made the implementation of their

investment impossible.”538

The Claimants further dispute that the Land Lease Agreements are purely commercial
agreements, given that their objectives allegedly “went above and beyond commercial
purposes” insofar as it was the Ministry of Transport’s plan, as evidenced, e.g., by the
12 July 2006 Order of the Cabinet of Ministers (see [66 above), “to expand the Airport
and transform it into a business area.”539 The Claimants also refer to the requirement
in the Land Lease Agreements that Rixport had to pay EUR 150,000 per hectare of
leased land in respect of non-refundable infrastructure payments. According to the
Claimants, “[t]his infrastructure was not intended for commercial use only, nor was its
usage intended to be restricted to Rixport and SJSC Airport,” thus demonstrating its

partially public purpose.540

The Tribunal does not find any of these arguments convincing.

First, as already discussed, the Claimants have failed to establish that SJSC Airport was
“fully dependent on the Ministry of Transport for the negotiation, execution and
performance of the Land Lease Agreements.” To the contrary, there is no evidence of
any material involvement by the Ministry of Transport at all. Notably, the leases were
not required to be, and were not, approved by the Ministry; nor were any of the leases’
subsequent amendments. Rixport’s counterparts in the negotiation and performance of
the leases have, to the contrary, been shown to be representatives of SJSC Airport and

not the Ministry, which resisted being drawn into discussions with Rixport and its

350.

representatives when solicited. Further, there is no evidence that the Ministry had any
involvement in the decision of SJSC Airport to terminate the leases which, as in Almds

v. Poland, was effected on the basis of the leases’ terms.

Second, the powers of the Ministry as a shareholder, to appoint and remove members
of SJSC Airport’s Management Board and Supervisory Council, have no bearing on
whether SJSC Airport was exercising elements of governmental authority in its
relationship with Rixport. As the Respondent has correctly noted, in reliance upon the
ILC Commentary on Article 5, “[c]ontrol on the part of the State within its competence
as a shareholder has nothing to do with the exercise of governmental authority.”>4!
This is consistent with the position followed by the tribunal in Biwater Gauff v.
Tanzania, where acts of governmental authority were considered to refer to acts “which
exceed the normal course of conduct of a State shareholder.”>42 There has been no
showing in the present case that the Ministry acted as anything other than a shareholder,
leaving the day-to-day management of SJSC Airport’s affairs with Rixport to SISC
Airport.

Third, the Tribunal does not accept the distinction that the Claimants have drawn
between the agricultural lands at issue in Almds v. Poland and the real estate that is the
subject of this case. Although, as already discussed, the Claimants have undertaken to
ascribe a “strategic” character to the land that was the subject of the leases in this case,
based on the Airport being characterized as an object of “national interest,” the subject
of the Land Lease Agreements was not part of the Airport facility per se (i.e., its
terminal, runways or other areas and facilities needed for the Airport’s core operations),
but concerned land adjacent to the Airport that, as already stated, was to be used for the
development of privately-operated hotels, parking facilities and a business park. The
Tribunal sees nothing inherently governmental in the development of commercial
facilities of this kind and does not consider that such activity is to be regarded as an
exercise of governmental authority simply because the Ministry of Transport may have
considered the development of such facilities to be desirable. Nor is the Tribunal
persuaded that the EUR150,000 per hectare infrastructure payments provided for in the
Land Lease Agreements altered their commercial, as opposed to governmental,
character. It is undisputed that infrastructure needed to be constructed to provide access

to the land plots that Rixport had undertaken to develop, and Rixport’s agreement to

543

contribute to the construction of such infrastructure was not an unusual commercial

term of the leases in those circumstances.

Fourth, the Claimants have failed to show that the development and modification of
SJSC Airport’s development plans constituted any more of an exercise of governmental
authority than the leasing of the land that is the subject of this arbitration. As Mr.
Saveljevs has explained in his evidence, SJSC Airport develops internal business
development plans “like most businesses.”>43 These plans are not binding upon
anyone and are not required to be approved by the State. Even if they are prepared
with the objectives of the State for the Airport in mind, it does not follow that they are

themselves acts of governmental authority.

The Claimants have also contended that a report issued by a Latvian Parliamentary
Commission in January 2018 concerning alleged corruption by Minister Slesers during
his time in office, particularly in respect of dealings with airBaltic,>44 “shows that the
Airport was governed by ‘State power’, as illustrated for example in the appointment
and firing process of State officials.”545 However, as the Respondent has observed,
the report “had nothing to do with the Land Lease Agreements, let alone with Rixport,
or any action allegedly taken against it.”546 The Tribunal therefore does not consider
that this report bears on whether the conduct of SJSC Airport that is the subject of this

proceeding involved the exercise by SJSC Airport of governmental authority.
The Tribunal finds, on the basis of the evidence before it, that it did not.

As already noted, whether or not SJSC Airport can be considered to have acted under
the directions or control of the Latvian State, within the meaning of Article 8 of the
ILC Articles, is a matter that is considered below in the analysis of the Claimants’

specific treaty breach claims.

B. Equitable and Reasonable Treatment and Protection Claim
1. Claimants’ Position

As stated above, it is the Claimants’ position that the Respondent has failed to accord

the Claimants’ investments equitable and reasonable treatment and protection, in

Saveljevs first witness statement §45

544Excerpt of Final Report of the Parliamentary Investigation Commission about the Signs of State Capture and Pre-Litigation

breach of Article III of the BIT, by: (i) failing to provide a transparent, consistent and
stable business framework; (ii) violating the Claimants’ legitimate expectations; and
(iii) denying the Claimants justice by failing to provide administrative and judicial due
process. It is common ground that the “equitable and reasonable treatment and
protection” standard in Article III does not differ materially from the “fair and equitable
treatment” (“FET”) standard referred to in other BITs.547 The two standards are

accordingly referred to interchangeably hereafter.

With respect to the first of the above alleged violations (the failure to provide a
transparent, consistent and stable business framework), the Claimants found their claim
on the proposition that “the Latvian State, and in particular the Ministry of Transport
and SJSC Airport, enacted . . . a rollercoaster of regulatory change affecting the entire
functioning of the airport, subjecting the Claimants to incessant alteration in the
conditions governing the Land Lease Agreements and their implementation.”548
Insofar as, as already found, acts of SJSC Airport are not attributable to the State under
Articles 4 or 5 of the ILC Articles, then it is the Claimants’ position that they are
attributable to Latvia under Article 8, given that they allegedly flowed from
instructions, or otherwise were carried out under the direction and control, of the

Ministry of Transport.

The Claimants further contend that “[t]he process of adopting amendments to the legal

framework was fully non-transparent and stakeholders, such as Claimants, were not

 

allowed to present their views, in spite of repeated requests.”549 According to the

 

Claimants, the Respondent has also “failed to communicate in an ‘unbiased, even-

 

handed, SE and i way’ ding these conti s changes to the

regulatory and contractual framework.”550

The alleged changes about which the Claimants complain include the following:

(i) changes in the development plans prepared for the Airport by SJSC Airport,

based on the investor’s perspective but they are broader, demanding an overall degree

of substantive tranquility and coherence.”567

While the Claimants acknowledge that “a host State has the sovereign right to change
its regulatory framework, including development plans and detail plans for the purpose
of long term infrastructure projects in the public interest,”5°8 they argue that in this
case, the State “continuously disrupted the regulatory framework applicable to the
investments for no developmental benefits, and merely in response to the individual

preferences of whoever happened to be heading the Ministry of Transport.”569

They further argue that “such changes must be fair and equitable in light of the

investor’ s legitimate expectations.”570

In the present case, the Claimants contend that the Latvian State created the legitimate
expectation that the “applicable regulatory and contractual framework in Latvia at the
time of the investment” would not be altered and, accordingly, that Rixport’s
development project would be able to commence soon after the signing of the Land
Lease Agreements on 3 November 2006 and generate “investment-critical revenues”
by the end of 2009 and for at least 22 consecutive years thereafter.57!_ The Claimants
submit, in particular, that they had the legitimate expectation of a “shovel ready”
project in which they would be in a position to proceed immediately with the
construction of the “first phase” of a “phased-development,”572 the “first phase”, as
already mentioned, consisting, according to the Claimants, in the construction and
operation of an Airport hotel, with a connection to the Airport terminal.573 This, the
Claimants contend, was the “pre-condition for their investment and the condition sine

qua non for its profitability.”574

The Claimants submit that their corresponding expectation was created by “explicit
representations by Latvia vis-a-vis the Claimants” as well as by “implicit

representations.”575

The explicit representations are stated by the Claimants to have been made by the
Minister of Transport: (i) at a meeting in July 2006 among then-Minister Peters, Mr.
Slesers and Messrs. Osthus and Lundeby; (ii) at a further meeting of Messrs. Osthus
and Lundeby with then-Minister Peters in October 2006 “to sort out important clauses
regarding the protection of the investment in case of early termination of the Land
Lease Agreements”; and (iii) at a meeting that Mr. Lilleberg says he is “aware” was
held with “the authorities” prior to the Land Lease Agreements being signed “to get

assurances that the project garnered support at the highest level.”576
In addition, the Claimants rely on:

e the Ordinance of the Cabinet of Ministers dated 6 July 2006, approving the
Operational Strategy 2007-2009 of the Ministry of Transport, which includes
among its “main tasks” the approval by 2007 and start of “further passenger
terminal extension projects” and completion of construction of the Airport’s

“business park by 2010;7577

e the 2003 Detailed Plan and “plans prepared for the development of the Airport

based on the strategy and plans set out by the Ministry of Transport;”578

© specific terms of the Land Lease Agreements, including the tender documents,

the 2007 Amendments and the 2010 Agreement;579 and

e the Claimants’ “legitimate” expectation that changes would not be made that
would have “entirely unreasonable and disproportionate” consequences for the

Claimants’ investment.58°

According to the Claimants, the “most serious transgressions which have frustrated the
Claimants’ legitimate expectations” are: (i) the Ministry of Transport’s “repeated,
significant, unforeseen and belatedly communicated changes” to the development plans
of the Airport, with the result that “the land assigned to Rixport was never specified
and it was never possible to commence construction;” (ii) the “repeated and significant

changes to the number of passengers the airport facilities were expected to cater for;”

(iii) the “requirement to pay land lease for areas that cannot be utilized;” (iv) the
“unilateral postponement of transfer of Draw 1, land 2 and 3;” (v) SJSC Airport’s
failure to specify the new land plot for the Airport hotel under the 2007 Amendments
by 30 May 2008; (vi) SJSC Airport’s failure to make available the land in front of the
existing terminal for construction by Rixport; and (vii) the “failure to observe
Claimants’ right to be included as a stakeholder in the ongoing development

process.”>8!

The Claimants further insist that “[f]rom 2006 to this very day, it has been impossible
for Claimants to start any construction, and in particular on the land which they

explicitly stated they needed to develop first.”582

Insofar as the Respondent argues that the Claimants’ complaints merely call into
question SJSC Airport’s compliance with its contractual obligations under the Land
Lease A the 2007 A d or the 2010 A and do not amount
to a failure by the Respondent to accord FET treatment, it is the Claimants’ position
that a breach of contractual terms can form a breach of an FET standard and does where,
as in this case, the State interferes with a contract between an investor and a State entity
in such a manner as to “substantially depriv[e] the investment of its value and frustrat[e]

its economic purpose.”583

The Claimants also contend that the “regulatory changes in the present case were made
without any explanation as to Latvia’s long-term intentions in a consistent and non-
arbitrary manner or with any form of transparency.”>84 In support of their position,
they allege that the Respondent refused to respond to their concerns, answer numerous
letters, share with them the Airport’s development plans or include them in working
groups. They contend, in particular, that Latvia’s “own Environmental Monitoring
State Bureau has, with regard to the changes to SJSC Airport’s Development Plan in
2013, established that the Respondent acted in breach of transparency requirements of
the Environmental Impact Assessment Law and the principle of good administration,

the EU Charter of Human Rights Article 41.”585

The development plan at issue is a draft of a development plan prepared by SJSC
Airport for 2012-2036.586 The Claimants accuse SJSC Airport of failing to inform the
Claimants and the public of a meeting convened to discuss the environmental impact
assessment of the draft plan or inviting them to attend, in breach of “two legally binding
Orders of ... [the Respondent’s] . . . Environmental Monitoring State Bureau” of 2

August and 28 October 2013.587

In addition, the Claimants accuse the Respondent of generating confusion and “lack of
clarity” concerning Rixport’s right to obtain construction permits and carry out

construction work following the opening of the 2003 Detailed Plan.>88

Lastly, as already mentioned, the Claimants contend that Latvia’s conduct “amounts to
a denial of justice and a failure to provide due process.”589 More specifically, it is the
Claimants’ position that the Respondent has (i) failed to comply with administrative
due process standards and (ii) violated judicial due process standards that oblige it to
provide a fair trial and to administer justice adequately in the civil case initiated in
March 2013 by Rixport against SJSC Airport in respect of the Land Lease Agreements.
As discussed above (see {{{[180-186 and 212-220), the civil case resulted in a series of
judgments, the last of which was issued by the Kurzeme Regional Court on 5 July 2019,

but which has not been appealed to the Supreme Court.

The Claimants’ claim concerning the violation of administrative due process standards
concerns: (i) the failure of SJSC Airport and/or the Marupe Construction Board to
invite the Claimants to meetings concerning the 2013 Detailed Plan while it was being
prepared; (ii) SJSC Airport’s alleged failure to cause a public meeting to be held in
respect of the environmental impact assessment relating to SJSC Airport’s 2013
development plan for 2012-2036; and (iii) an insolvency notice that SJSC Airport sent
to Rixport on 3 March 2014 in respect of claims for outstanding rent and liquidated

damages under the Land Lease Agreements, although the claims were disputed by

Rixport, which, according to the Claimants, precluded SJSC Airport from sending such

a notice under Latvian law.59°

Although the Claimants have not elaborated upon the standard that is required to be
satisfied in order to succeed on a claim for the denial of administrative due process,
they have nevertheless referred in their submissions to the requirement set forth in the
judgment of the International Court of Justice (“ICJ’”) in the ELSI case, according to

which the actions complained of should “surprise a sense of judicial propriety.”>9!

In the case of the judicial due process claim, the Claimants argue that “three elements
in particular . . . entail separate and cumulative breaches of the [FET] standard in

Article III of the ... BIT.”592

The first is the fact that, due to a reform of the appeals mechanism in Latvia, the
Kurzeme Regional Court acted as both a first instance and appellate court in the
litigation between Rixport and SJSC Airport. Although different judges ruled upon the
case at the first instance and appellate stages, the Claimants nevertheless submit that
“[hJaving the same court adjudicate the same dispute in the first and second instance is
... incompatible with the core objective of an appeal procedure,”593 particularly where
the judges know each other well and work together on a daily basis. The Claimants
further note that the process by which the case was transferred from the Riga Regional
Court, where it was originally filed, to the Kurzeme Regional Court (formally to ensure
faster review of the case) was not transparent. In this regard, they cite a 2018 Report
on the Latvian judicial system of the European Commission for the Efficiency of
Justice (“CEPEJ”) of the Council of Europe that found that such transfers “might raise
questions as regards the full respect of the requirements of a ‘tribunal established by

law’ as well as the principle of legal certainty.”594

Second, the Claimants contend that the first judgment of the Kurzeme Regional Court
of 13 February 2015 was delivered in an electronic Word document created by Ms.
Dace Kalnina, who worked as a lawyer for the Ministry of Justice at the time of the
hearing on 13 February 2015 and when the judgment was emailed to the parties on 1

April 2015. According to the Claimants, the “mere fact that the document was created

by a servant of the Ministry of Justice may . . . ‘prompt objectively held misgivings as
to impartiality from the point of view of the external observer’” and implies that the

Latvian executive branch may have “colluded” with the Court.59>

Third, the Claimants complain that in order to have Rixport’s case heard by the courts,
they were obliged to pay court fees for each instance in an amount of EUR 8,715 plus
0.6% of the amount claimed in excess of EUR 711,435. They submit that court fees of
this magnitude constitute “an illegitimate barrier to access justice.”59© They note that
the CEPEJ has stated in its 2018 report that the court fees in Latvia for claims in excess
of EUR 500,000 “are much higher .. . than in other countries, and there is a risk of

violation of Article 6§1 of the European Convention on Human Rights.”597

According to the Claimants, in considering whether they have been denied judicial due
process, the Tribunal should construe and apply the Respondent’s obligations “in
accordance with the Respondents international human rights obligations [in particular,
the European Convention on Human Rights (“ECHR”), to which Norway and Latvia
are parties], which highlight their investment has not been accorded treatment in
accordance with the international standards in both investment and human rights law

that the host state has explicitly agreed to honour.”598

The Claimants further submit that the Respondent’s contention, as described below,

that the Claimants cannot properly maintain their denial of justice claim without having

  

exhausted local remedies is incorrect in circumstances where, as here, according to the

Claimants, further recourse within the Latvian judicial system would be futile.599

In their closing submissions at the Hearing, the Claimants also referred to the judgment
issued by the Riga Administrative District Court on 16 May 2014 in respect of
Rixport’s (and Staur Building’s) challenge of the 2013 Detailed Plan®° and made the
argument that the court found that the interests of the Airport, as an “object of national
interest” prevailed over the interests of Rixport (and in so finding effectively
disregarded Rixport’s contractual rights).! It was suggested at the Hearing that this

judgment constituted a violation of the Respondent’s obligations under Article III of

the BIT. However, the Claimants have not specifically asserted that there was any

related denial of justice.

2. Respondent’s Position
383. | The Respondent disputes that the Claimants have been denied equitable and reasonable

treatment and protection, in breach of the BIT.

384. — It denies, first of all, that the FET standard includes a “stand-alone obligation on the
host State to stabilise its regulatory and legislative system, divorced from the investor’s
legitimate expectations.”®°2 According to the Respondent, “[n]o investor is entitled
to expect that a general legislative measure will remain static, or that any regulatory
change that adversely affects its economic position creates a cause of action under
international law,” in the absence of specific undertakings of the State to the
contrary.003 The Respondent relies in this regard on the Awards in El Paso v.
Argentina and a number of other subsequent cases and distinguishes the situation in
PSEG v. Turkey, upon which the Claimants rely, given that, in that case, unlike in the
present case, the host State (Turkey) was changing the laws governing the investment

and the investor’s business.

385. In the present case, the Respondent denies that that there were any material changes to

the “regulatory framework governing the Claimants’ investment in Latvia.”605

386. The Respondent observes that the Claimants complain principally about changes in
policies, projections and SJSC Airport’s business development plans. However,
according to the Respondent, these were not “State plans,” were not binding on Rixport
and “could not have overridden Rixport’s contractual rights.”©6 For the Respondent,
moreover, there was “nothing wrong” with SJSC Airport, in the event of such changes,
seeking Rixport’s agreement to amend the Land Lease Agreements.°°7 In this regard,

the Respondent notes, in reliance on the evidence of Mr. Saveljevs: “It is perfectly

normal, and indeed necessary, for an airport to continuously assess the need of the
market and to consider possible changes, including extensions or expansions.”©8 It
further observes that the principal plans about which the Claimants complain (i.e., the
contemplated PPP project, the Hochtief masterplan and the separate airBaltic terminal)

were never adopted.

Although the Respondent accepts that the 2003 Detailed Plan was reopened by the
Marupe Municipality, it notes that it remains in force and that the subsequent 2013
Detailed Plan was in effect for only one month (10 July —- 9 August 2013) due to legal
proceedings initiated against it by the Claimants’ subsidiaries.6°9 Detailed Plans do
not, in any event, form part of the “regulatory framework,” according to the

Respondent.®!0

The Respondent further observes that there were only two changes to legislation or
regulations that “are even conceivably relevant to Rixport’s business park project”

during the period at issue.®!!

The first was a “change in legislation [in January 2008] with respect to permissible
building heights [40 metres] adjacent to airport runways,”®!2 although the Respondent
submits that this “could not have come as a surprise because the rule that buildings
could not exceed a height of 40 metres has always been clear, and did in fact not
change.”®!3 In fact, according to the Respondent, while “it was maybe interpreted a
bit loosely earlier, on which basis Rixport did obtain a building permit to build an office
building,” the “40-metre rule was already set out in that exact 2003 Detailed Plan” and

“also set out and confirmed in Annex 5 to the Land Lease Agreements.”6!4

The second was Cabinet Regulation No. 711 regarding Local Government Spatial

Development Planning Documents, which came into force on 16 October 2012.

According to the Respondent, this change did not adversely affect Rixport or have any

adverse impact on Rixport’s ability to develop the project.®!5

For the Respondent, this is “hardly a ‘rollercoaster of regulatory change.””6!6

Nor does the Respondent accept that Latvia ever created any “legitimate expectations”
that it would have frustrated. It is the Respondent’s position in this regard that
legitimate expectations can only be created by “specific representations made by State
officials,” and there were no such representations in this case.6!7 In particular, the
Respondent argues that there were no representations that the development of SJSC
Airport would effectively be frozen and that no development plans or changes to the

2003 Detailed Plan might subsequently be made.

According to the Respondent, the Claimants improperly attempt to “expand the concept
[of legitimate expectations] to include implicit representations, which would make the
concept . . . inadmissibly uncertain and broad.”©!8 The Respondent notes that the
Claimants rely on three types of representations: first, “political statements made
mainly during the tender phase;” second, “statements made during the negotiations of
the Land Lease Agreements;” and third, regulations.°!9 The Respondent observes that
the statements upon which the Claimants rely were of an aspirational nature (e.g.,
concerning Latvia’s intention to develop and internationalize its airport, which the
Respondent says that it has, in any event, done)®0 or constituted general pledges of
support, which were “too vague to give rise to any legitimate expectations.”62!
Moreover, the Respondent does not accept that the Claimants could have formed any
legitimate expectations based on Latvia’s regulatory framework, there being no
evidence that they carried out any related due diligence or placed any reliance on that
regulatory framework prior to making their investments. In particular, the Respondent
submits that there is no evidence that the Claimants or Rixport “consulted the existing
zoning plans or appropriate regulations” before Rixport submitted its tender application

and signed the Land Lease Agreements.622

For the Respondent, an investor has “a duty to undertake due diligence with respect to
the relevant circumstances that will affect its investment, including the regulatory and
political framework into which it invests” and that any “expectations formed in the

absence of such due diligence cannot be considered ‘legitimate.’”623

Moreover, in this case it is the Respondent’s position that “the only truly legitimate
expectation” that the Claimants could have had is that SISC Airport would comply with
the Land Lease Agreements and, if it did not, that Rixport would be able to seek relief

before the Latvian courts, as provided in those agreements.°24

Insofar as the Claimants found their claims upon contractual undertakings of SJSC
Airport, these, according to the Respondent, cannot be the subject of a BIT claim given
that the Land Lease Agreements constituted “a private, commercial deal between
Rixport and SJSC Airport,” which is not attributable to the Respondent.®25 Nothing in
those agreements, the Respondent notes, in any event “restricts SJSC Airport’s right to
develop and change its plans, as long as the contractual rights of Rixport are
respected.”626 In this regard, the Respondent emphasizes, in particular, that the
changes to various dates and deadlines in the Land Lease Agreements were by mutual
agreement of the contracting parties and that “[a]ll actions that may have given rise to

issues prior to November 2010 were settled by the 2010 Agreement.”627

It is the position of the Respondent, more generally, that neither the State nor SJSC
Airport prevented the Claimants from proceeding with the development of the leased
land.628 In the Respondent’s view, as already noted, the Claimants failed to proceed
with the development of the land because of the impact on the project of the global
financial crisis, which, the Respondent observes, “hit Latvia particularly hard” as from
2008 and as a result of which “at the latest by 2008, Rixport would have known that
the project was no longer realistic and would not be profitable in the foreseeable

future.”629

In the circumstances, according to the Respondent: “Rixport sought to buy time,
apparently hoping that the local economy would recover faster than expected. The
project was effectively left in a standstill: Rixport did not secure financing for the
project, did not apply for construction permits, and never began construction. Instead,
it sought to negotiate amendments to the Land Lease Agreements and the rent payments

and other obligations thereunder.”30

For the Respondent, the Claimants’ contention that Rixport was prevented by a
“rollercoaster” of regulatory change from proceeding with the project, contrary to the
Claimants’ legitimate expectations, is little more than a pretext intended to distract
attention from the real impediments to Rixport making any progress. As the

Respondent states: “The problem was rather with Rixport.”63!

With respect to the issue of transparency, the Respondent denies that it breached any
related obligation. Although it notes that the Claimants criticize SJSC Airport (but not
the State) for failing to communicate with Rixport regarding the Airport’s development
plans, it argues that SJSC Airport did inform Rixport “when development plans
actually affected Rixport’s leased lands” and that, in any event, the Claimants “have
not shown how they relied on the airport’s plans in making their investments, or
explained (a) what legitimate expectations arose from those plans; and (b) how those

were frustrated.”©32

As regards the environmental impact assessment process relating to SJSC Airport’s
development plan for 2012-2036, the Respondent denies that there is any basis to assert
that SJSC Airport, let alone the Respondent, failed to act sufficiently transparently. It
notes that the development plan had no impact on Rixport or its project and that, in any
event, Rixport was entitled to participate in public consultation meetings concerning
the environmental impact assessment. Although the Respondent acknowledges, as the
Claimants allege, that SJSC Airport was ordered by Latvia’s Environmental
Monitoring State Bureau on two occasions (2 August and 28 October 2013) to
reschedule a public meeting in respect of the development plan, the Respondent states
that SJSC Airport did so, that Rixport participated, as evidenced by the Report on the

Public Discussion of the Environmental Review Project,®3 and, accordingly, that

SJSC Airport was able to finalize the environmental impact assessment on 12 June

2014.934

The Respondent also notes that the Claimants contend that there was “an alleged
failure” to invite the Claimants to meetings to discuss the 2013 Detailed Plan while it
was being prepared, but refer the Tribunal to the Respondent’s account in its
submissions of the development of the 2013 Detailed Plan.®35 It is the Respondent’s
position that Rixport was given the opportunity to participate in meetings and comment

on the proposals relating to the 2013 Development Plan.°36

In the case of the confusion allegedly caused in respect of Rixport’s ability to obtain
construction permits following the opening of the 2003 Detailed Plan, the Respondent
disputes that Rixport could reasonably have been confused, given that it was “advised
—and should, in any event have known, had it carried out proper due diligence — that it
was perfectly possible to apply for and be granted construction permits pending the
establishment of a new detailed plan for the area in question” and “[i]ndeed, other

tenants of the airport” did so.°37

Lastly, the Respondent does not accept that the Claimants can validly maintain that

they have been denied either administrative or judicial due process.

As noted above, the Claimants’ administrative due process claim is based on the
Claimants’ contentions that: (i) the Claimants were not invited to meetings concerning
the 2013 Detailed Plan; (ii) SJSC Airport failed to ensure the holding of a public
meeting in respect of the environmental impact assessment relating to SJSC Airport’s
development plan for 2012-2036; and (iii) SISC Airport issued an insolvency notice to
Rixport on 3 March 2014 in respect of claims for outstanding rent and liquidated

damages contrary to Latvian law because the claims were disputed by Rixport.

As a factual matter, as just noted, the Respondent denies that SJSC Airport failed to
convene the public meeting that is the subject of the Claimants’ second complaint. The
Respondent has also contended, as to the first complaint, that the Claimants’ allegation

that Rixport was not informed of, nor involved in, the development of the 2013

Development Plan is wrong.®8 It further notes, with respect to the matter of the
insolvency notice, that: “We are talking about just a letter, sent in the context of a
contractual dispute. There was never any follow-up: SJSC Airport did not seek to place
Rixport into insolvency.”®39 In neither case, the Respondent submits, was there any
breach of a rule of law, let alone a breach sufficient to constitute a denial of justice,

based on the standard developed by the ICJ in the ELSI case.40

As regards the three prongs of the Claimants’ judicial due process claim, the

Respondent responds as follows:

First, notwithstanding that, in accordance with what the Respondent describes as “a
transitory provision in force during the reform of the judicial system,” the Kurzeme
Regional Court acted both as a court of first instance and as an appellate court in respect
of the action initiated by Rixport, it is the Respondent’s position that Rixport was
afforded due process “and there is no basis to question the impartiality of the panel of
three judges hearing Rixport’s appeal of the first-instance decision” rendered by a
single and different judge.©+! Moreover, the Respondent notes that the appellate
decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, thus curing any procedural

irregularity.©42

Second, the Respondent denies that there was any collusion between the Kurzeme
Regional Court and the Ministry of Justice. According to the Respondent, the
appearance of the name of Ms. Dace Kalnina, a Ministry of Justice official, in the
metadata of the Word version of the first instance judgment of the Kurzeme Regional
Court is the consequence of the judgment having been created based on a template
Word document created by Ms. Kalnina when she worked at the court before joining
the Ministry of Justice. The Respondent denies that Ms. Kalnina had any involvement
in the case after leaving the court and notes that, in any event, the first instance

judgment was subsequently appealed and reconsidered by different judges.%43

Third, the Respondent argues that no justice could have been denied to the Respondent

based on the level of Latvia’s court fees given, inter alia, that (i) Rixport was able to

pay the fees and (ii) would have been entitled to recover them had it been successful
before the courts because Latvia civil procedural law subscribes to the “costs follow
the event” rule.644 The Respondent argues, in any event, that the court fees prescribed
under Latvian law have been fixed “on the basis of clear public policy objectives
[including discouraging frivolous claims], well-grounded in practice and international
standards.”©45 The Respondent further notes that the court fees “are small in

comparison to the costs of an ICSID arbitration.”646

More generally, it is the Respondent’s position that the Claimants’ claim does not meet
the standard for denial of justice as it has been articulated in international jurisprudence.
The Respondent has referred in this regard, in addition to the ELS/ standard, inter alia,
to the following passage from the opinion of Judge Greenwood in the Loewen v. USA

case:647

International law understandably applies a very strict test of what
constitutes a denial of justice. The international tribunal is not a court of
appeal from the national court (. . .), nor is its task to review the findings
of the national court. In the absence of clear evidence of bad faith on the
part of the relevant court (. . .), the claimant must demonstrate either that
it was the victim of discrimination on account of its nationality or that the
administration of justice was scandalously irregular. Defects in
procedure or a judgment which is open to criticism on the basis of either
rulings of law or findings of fact are not enough.

The Respondent, thus, argues that the obligation of the State “is to provide an
internationally acceptable system of justice, not to guarantee that each and every
decision is perfect and complies with rules of procedural propriety” (emphasis in
original).®48 It further submits, on the basis of the recent Partial Award in the Lago
Agrio arbitration, that “a breach requires extreme measures, the whole system of justice

of the host State being in contradiction of international norms of justice.”©49

The Respondent continues: “A corollary of this principle is that unless and until the
aggrieved party has tested the entire system — and thus in effect exhausted domestic

remedies — it cannot bring its claim before an international tribunal. While exhaustion

of domestic remedies is usually not a procedural requirement for an investment treaty
case to be brought, it is a substantive constitutive element of denial of justice. Denial
of justice cannot exist, as a matter of substantive international law, if local remedies

have not been exhausted” (emphasis in original).°5°

While the Respondent accepts that the exhaustion of local remedies is not required
where this would be futile, it notes that the Claimants “are silent on what would make

the pursuit of further appeals ‘futile.’”65!

The Respondent further rejects the Claimants’ submission that, in deciding whether
there has been a denial of justice, the Tribunal should be informed by the provisions of
the ECHR. For the Respondent, the ECHR is irrelevant. Rather, the Tribunal should
be guided solely by “the high threshold for denial of justice claims under international

customary law.””652

3. The Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision
In considering the Claimants’ claim that Latvia has failed to accord their investments
equitable and reasonable treatment and protection in breach of Article III of the BIT,
the Tribunal starts from the position that, as agreed by the Parties and noted earlier, the
“equitable and reasonable treatment and protection” standard in Article III does not

differ materially from the FET standard referred to in other BITs.

As indicated above, the Claimants contend that Latvia has breached Article III by (i)
failing to provide a transparent, consistent and stable business framework; (ii) violating
the Claimants’ legitimate expectations; and (iii) denying the Claimants justice by

failing to provide them with administrative and judicial due process.

In addressing these contentions, the Tribunal will consider first the nature of the
Claimants’ legitimate expectations. Although the Claimants have advanced their claim
on the basis that the transparency, consistency and stability of the business framework
should be considered independently of the legitimacy of their expectations, the
Tribunal is not persuaded that these two elements of the Claimants’ claim can
meaningfully be dissociated in the circumstances of this case. To the contrary, given

that the Claimants themselves recognize that Article II] does not impose upon the host

421.

State an obligation to effect “some form of regulatory freeze,”®3 the nature and extent
of the regulatory change that may “equitably” and “fairly” be implemented cannot
reasonably be considered without reference to what the Claimants may legitimately
have been entitled to expect in this regard when making their investments. The
Claimants have effectively acknowledged this in their submissions by stating that “such

changes must be fair and equitable in light of the investor’ s legitimate expectations.”>4

After determining what the Claimants’ legitimate expectations were, the Tribunal will
proceed to consider: (i) what, if any, changes occurred that the Claimants could not
legitimately have expected; (ii) whether any such changes can properly be said to be
attributable to the State, having regard to the findings that the Tribunal has already
made on this subject in respect of SJSC Airport and Article 8 of the ILC Articles; and
(iii) whether any changes attributable to the State adversely affected the Claimants’
investments, in breach of the standard set forth in Article II. Lastly, the Tribunal will

address the Claimants’ denial of justice claim.

 

The Claimants’ legitimate expectations

In the absence of any specific undertakings of the State upon which the Claimants could
reasonably have been expected to rely, it is the Tribunal’s position that the Claimants’
legitimate expectations in this case could not have exceeded the terms of the Land
Lease Agreements that Rixport concluded with SJSC Airport and their subsequent
amendments, given that it was on the basis of those agreements that the Claimants,

through Rixport, made their investments.

The Parties differ as to whether the contractual undertakings of SJSC Airport, which
the Tribunal has found above to be distinct from the State, could properly give rise to
any legitimate expectations at all, other than, as the Respondent posits, that their breach
would be subject to resolution before the Latvian courts.®5 It is the Tribunal’s view
that, insofar as those undertakings could be said, as the Claimants argue, to have given
rise to any legitimate expectations, the Claimants could not legitimately have expected
the State to accord them any better treatment than was provided by the contracts

themselves. As Judge Crawford has written in respect of State contracts:656

653 fd. at p. 117.

654 Cl, Mem. 470.

655 Resp. Rejoinder $554.

656 J. Crawford, “Treaty and Contract in Investment Arbitration” (2008) 24(3) Arbitration International, Ex. RLA-26, p. 374

423.

424.

425.

[T]he investment contract is itself an allocation of risks and opportunities,
and (. . .) that allocation is relevant in determining, in particular, whether
there has been fair and equitable treatment under the BIT. In particular,
the doctrine of legitimate expectations should not be used as a substitute
for the actual arrangements agreed between the parties, or as a
supervening and overriding source of the applicable law.

This approach was followed by the tribunal in the case of Bayinder v. Pakistan, where

the tribunal found:657

[I]n the present context of a contractual relationship between Bayinder
and the NHA ... the expectations of the Claimant are largely shaped by
the contractual relationship between the Claimant and the NHA. In this
connection, there was no basis for the Claimant to expect that NHA would
not avail itself of its contractual rights. Although the Tribunal has no
jurisdiction to assess whether there has been a breach of the Contract
under the Contract’s proper law, the Tribunal must nevertheless take into
account the terms of the Contract as a factual element reflecting the
expectations of the Claimant.

Accordingly, insofar as any legitimate expectations can properly be said to arise from
a contract entered into by an investment vehicle such as Rixport with a non-State organ
such as SJSC Airport, it is the Tribunal’s position that those expectations, as in the
authorities cited above, cannot properly be divorced from the bargain that the

investment vehicle has made.

This is, moreover, consistent with the Claimants’ own contention that, in advancing
their claims in this arbitration, they “are not trying to improve their contractual bargain;
they are simply trying to see their contractual bargain honoured.”©58 Referring to the
Award in the case of Alpha v. Ukraine,®9 they have suggested that the gravamen of
their complaint in this proceeding, as in that arbitration, is that, by its actions, the State
has interfered with and effectively negated the agreements entered into between the

investors and their contractual counterpart.6©0

The Tribunal nevertheless notes that, in their closing submissions, the Claimants

argued that “insofar as the . . . terms of the 2007 and 2010 agreements . . . are concerned,

57 Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Award, 27 August

these are only relevant and should only be discussed” if it is accepted that the

“contractual obligations are obligations owed by the state directly.”66!

The Tribunal disagrees. Whether or not any of the agreements entered into by SJSC
Airport with Rixport are binding on the State directly or can validly serve as a basis for
a BIT claim by the Claimants in respect of any actions attributable to the State in respect
of those agreements, the expectations that the Claimants could legitimately have
entertained in respect of their investments, through Rixport, were, in the Tribunal’s
view, necessarily circumscribed by the terms of those agreements. This is so in the
absence of any other expectations that can properly be said to have been legitimately

created by separate conduct of the State.

With respect to the agreements that Rixport concluded with SJSC Airport, the Tribunal

notes the following:

First, as discussed in Sections III-B and III.C above, the Land Lease Agreements did
not contain any representations concerning SJSC Airport’s then business development
plans and, in particular, that its plans for the development of the Airport would not
change. Nor did the leases exclude possible amendments to the 2003 Detailed Plan (or
any other applicable laws or regulations). To the contrary, Clause 13.1 of the Tender
Regulation forming part of each of the Land Leases Agreements expressly
contemplates possible “amendments of the detailed planning” and obligates Rixport

“to coordinate its plan of development” with any such amendments.®62

Second, as also noted in Section III.C above, the leases did not provide for the
expansion of the Airport terminal in accordance with any particular technical plan or
timeline. Nor did they contain any representations concerning Airport passenger

forecasts.

Third, notwithstanding the Claimants’ contention that Rixport entered into the Land
Lease Agreements in the expectation that it would be in a position to proceed with the
construction and operation of an Airport hotel on Draw 1, with a connection to the
Airport terminal, before proceeding with the development of any of the other Draws,
the leases did not release Rixport from any of its other development obligations if the
land required for the construction of a hotel connected to the main Airport terminal was

not made available first. As stated in Section III.C above, each of the Land Lease

431.

432.

433.

Agreements was a stand-alone agreement, and Rixport’s obligations under the leases

for Draws 2-4 did not depend upon the progress of Draw 1’s development.

Fourth, although, as discussed in Section III.D above, different development plans for
the Airport were under consideration by SJSC Airport subsequent to the conclusion of
the Land Lease Agreements that affected the boundaries and locations of certain of the
Land Plots in Draw 1 where the Airport hotel(s) was (or were) intended to be
constructed, and that arguably delayed their development, the related changes were the
subject of the 2007 Amendments and the 2010 Agreement which, as already discussed,
amended the Land Lease Agreements. The 2010 Agreement, moreover, expressly
provided that it would operate to extinguish all past, present and future claims that
Rixport and SJSC Airport may have had against each other “in relation to fulfillment
of mutual obligations arising out of the Land Lease Agreements for the period before”

5 November 2010.

Fifth, the 2010 Agreement, as already stated, acknowledged that SJSC Airport was
considering whether to construct a new terminal for airBaltic and/or to expand the
existing terminal, but did not state when a decision might be made by SJSC Airport
concerning those options or when an expanded terminal could be expected to be
completed. Although the 2010 Agreement, thus, envisaged possible delays in the
development of parts of Draw 1, it did not acknowledge any possible impediments to
the development of Draws 2 or 3, while also providing, however, for the relinquishment
by Rixport of Draw 4. Rent holidays were granted in respect of land that could not be

utilized.

In their submissions, the Claimants have contended that the following terms of the Land

Lease Agreements gave rise to legitimate expectations that were later thwarted:©63

- The contractual provisions in the Land Lease Agreements Clause 3.1
stipulating to pay land lease created the legitimate expectation that the
land in question could be utilized;

- The contractual provision in the Land Lease Agreements Clause 2.1
stipulating the transfer of particular Draws created the legitimate
expectation that such transfer would actually take place (and would not
be unilaterally postponed);

- The contractual provision in the 2007 Amendment Clause 1.1.2 stipulating
that SJSC Airport should complete the technical project at the latest by 30

663 C1, Reply {759.

125

435.

436.

June 2008;

- The contractual provision in the 2007 Amendment Clause 1.1.2 stipulating
that Draw I Land 2 should be available for construction work at the latest
by 1 January 2009;

- The contractual provision in the 2007 Amendment Clause 4.10.4
stipulating that the completion of Airport terminal extension works should
be completed by 30 June 2011;

- The contractual provision in the 2007 A di Clause 3.16 stipul
that Rixport had exclusive rights to operate short-term parking for the
airport terminal;

- The contractual provision in the 2010 Agreement Clause 3.1 stipulating
that the Claimants would be included in the further development decision-
making process created the legitimate expectation that such inclusion
would actually take place.

There is, however, a difficulty with the above contentions, even assuming that the
contractual undertakings identified could be attributed to the State and/or that the State
had any obligation under Article III of the BIT to ensure their performance by SJSC
Airport.

The difficulty is that all but the last of the above contractual provisions were superseded
by the terms of the 2010 Agreement. Consistent with its findings above, the Tribunal
does not consider that the Claimants can properly claim under Article II of the BIT
that their legitimate expectations have been frustrated and, accordingly, that their
investments have been treated inequitably or unreasonably as a result of conduct that
was the subject of a settlement between their investment vehicle, Rixport, and SJSC

Airport under the terms of the 2010 Agreement.

In their submissions, the Claimants have undertaken to avoid such a result by arguing,
first, that they were “forced into accepting the 2010 Agreement”’®64 and that, as a result,
the 2010 Agreement did not have the effect of validly amending the Land Lease
Agreements or settling any claims.°65 The Tribunal has already found, however, in
Section III.D above, that there is no evidence that Rixport was coerced into concluding
the 2010 Agreement and that, during the Hearing, the Claimants’ Mr. @sthus accepted

that Rixport had the option of refusing to enter into that agreement.

439.

The Claimants have further argued that the 2010 Agreement did not validly settle any
claims because it was “premised on the condition” that SJSC Airport would “actually
comply with its obligations” thereunder, which the Claimants contend that SJSC
Airport did not do.666 However, beyond asserting that the validity of the waiver of
claims contained in the agreement was subject to such a condition, the Claimants have
not established that that follows from Latvian law, the law governing the 2010
Agreement. Moreover, as the Respondent has noted, Rixport received rent holidays
and compensation under the agreement, which it has not returned.6°7 The receipt of
such benefits by Rixport would appear to undermine the Claimants’ contention that its

own contractual undertakings should simply be disregarded.

In any event, based on the evidence before it, and in the absence of any submissions on
the relevant Latvian law, the Tribunal is not in a position to find that the 2010
Agreement did not validly settle the claims between Rixport and SJSC Airport as of
that time or that that settlement did not adequately address the matters that now form
the basis for the Claimants’ claims of inequitable or unreasonable treatment by Latvia

in respect of the Claimants’ investments prior to that time.

Thus, although the Claimants have relied heavily in their submissions on
representations claimed to have been made to Messrs. @sthus and Lundeby by then-
Minister Peters and Mr. Slesers (who was not at the time a member of the Government)
prior to the conclusion of the Land Lease Agreements in 2006,8 any such
representations (or related Government Action Plans or pronouncements), even if
sufficiently specific to have created any legitimate expectations of the Claimants,
which the Respondent disputes, were no longer of any relevance in November 2010+,
when the 2010 Agreement was concluded. By that time, the Claimants were obviously
aware of the events that had occurred since the fall of 2006 and about which they have
complained in this arbitration. The Claimants also knew that SJSC Airport was in the
process of considering different terminal expansion plans, including notably the
possible construction of a separate airBaltic terminal, and that the date by which a
decision would be made concerning the plan to be adopted (and its related
implementation) was uncertain. In addition, given the terms of the 2010 Agreement,
the Claimants knew that rent would be payable to SJSC Airport in respect of Draws 2

and 3, in advance of Rixport having access to the land on Draw | that was closest to

the Airport terminal. Indeed, the Claimants acknowledged Draws 2 and 3 were
available for immediate usage and development, notwithstanding the Claimants’
contention, as already noted, that the construction of an Airport hotel on Draw | was
the “pre-condition for their investment and the condition sine qua non for its

profitability.”670

Further, by November 2010, the Ordinance of the Cabinet of Ministers dated 6 July
2006 approving the Operational Strategy 2007-2009 of the Ministry of Transport, upon
which the Claimants have also relied, was no longer of any relevance. While the
Claimants have noted that, according to the Ordinance, the Operational Strategy
included among its “main tasks” the approval by 2007 and start of “further passenger
terminal extension projects,” 67! that had, of course, not occurred as of November

2010.

The Claimants therefore could no longer have expected, as of November 2010, that
Rixport’s development project would be able to proceed in the same manner as they
may have anticipated in the fall of 2006.67? Accordingly, the only alleged changes that
are relevant to the Claimants’ claim are those that occurred subsequent to the 2010

Agreement.

Alleged changes in the business framework

The events that occurred subsequent to the 2010 Agreement have already been

described in Section III.E above.

Of those events, the Claimants have argued that the following acts (in addition to those
forming part of their denial of justice claim, which is considered separately below)

placed the Respondent in violation of its obligations under Article III of the BIT:

(i) SJSC Airport’s application on 26 April 2011 to the Building Authority of the
Marupe Municipality to reopen the 2003 Detailed Plan for the purpose of

developing a new, amended Detailed Plan in order to permit SJSC Airport to

expansion of the Airport terminal until after 2020;674

444. According to the Claimants, “all of these actions meant . . . that they could not

commence construction of their investment project.”680 And, indeed, as discussed in

Section

and in May 2014 requested that the lease for Draw | be terminated as well. Central to
Rixport’s position was that, as a result of the above acts, SJSC Airport had effectively
failed to transfer the leased land to Rixport for its use. Moreover, Rixport contended
that, given that, according to its understanding, the completion of the terminal
expansion had been postponed until 2020, the project no longer had any interest for

jt,681

As already stated, in deciding whether the Claimants were denied equitable and
reasonable treatment under Article III of the BIT, the Tribunal needs to consider: (i)
whether any of the above acts can properly be said to have been contrary to the
Claimants’ legitimate expectations; (ii) if so, whether they can properly be said to be
attributable to the State, having regard to the findings that the Tribunal has already
made on this subject in respect of SJSC Airport and Article 8 of the ILC Articles; and
(iii) if so, whether any acts attributable to the State adversely affected the Claimants’

investments in breach of the standard set forth in Article III.

On the basis of the evidence before it, the Tribunal does not consider that any of the
acts identified by the Claimants satisfies all three of these criteria such as to place the

Respondent in breach of Article III.

Starting first with the Claimants’ complaint about SJSC Airport’s application for the
reopening of the 2003 Detailed Plan in April 2011 and the subsequent approval of the
2013 Detailed Plan by the Construction Board of the Marupe Municipality in July 2013,
it is the Tribunal’s view that, irrespective of whether these acts can be attributed to the
State, the Claimants have failed to establish that they breached any legitimate
expectation of the Claimants or had any adverse effect on the Claimants’ investments,
let alone an effect that could properly be said to breach the standard of protection set

forth in Article IIT of the BIT.

As already noted, the Land Lease Agreements expressly contemplated the possibility
that the Detailed Plan might be required to be amended, and the Claimants could not
legitimately expect that SJSC Airport would not undertake to have the 2003 Detailed
Plan reopened for the purpose of carrying out infrastructure projects that, in this case,
were to be financed by the EU Cohesion Fund. Moreover, as noted in Section III.E
above, those projects concerned the renovation, reconstruction and construction of

runways, aprons, taxiways and drainage systems, in addition to certain other facilities

681 see, e.g., Cl. Mem. $258; see also Rixport’s notices of cancellation of the leases for Draws 1, 2 and 3, dated 7 May 2013 (Ex.
C-120) and 21 March 2014 (Ex. C-134).

outside the boundaries of the land that was the subject of the Land Lease Agreements.
According to Mr. Saveljevs, the only aspect of those projects that would affect the
leased land was certain of the drainage system work, ®82 but the Claimants have failed
to show that the drainage work in question had any material adverse effect on their
planned development work. By letter dated 27 June 2011, SJSC Airport informed
Rixport that land leased by Rixport might be affected by the drainage work and invited
Rixport to appoint a representative with whom SJSC Airport could “discuss the most
suitable technical solution” that would “match” Rixport’s development plans.®83 It has
not been alleged, let alone demonstrated, that any related issues were not satisfactorily

resolved.

The Claimants have nevertheless contended that the work on the 2013 Detailed Plan

affected them adversely in two ways.

First, they assert, as noted above, that Rixport could not obtain construction permits
while the new plan was being prepared and therefore Rixport was effectively prevented
from carrying out any new construction as from SJSC’s application for a new plan on
26 April 2011.84 In support of their position, they rely on a letter dated 23 April 2012
that Rixport received from Aida Skalberga (formerly Lismane), the Head of the Marupe
Construction Board, in response to an inquiry from Rixport on this subject and a further

letter from the Ministry of Economy dated 17 July 2013.685

In her evidence, Ms. Skalberga explained, however, that, in sending her 23 April 2012
letter, she understood, based on a telephone conversation that she had the previous day
with a representative of Rixport, that Rixport wanted to know whether Rixport could
file a construction permit on the basis of the 2013 Detailed Plan prior to its approval,
and that was the question that she believed that she had answered in the negative in her
letter.686 She was, moreover, insistent in her testimony that it would have been
possible for the Claimants to apply for, and obtain, construction permits on the basis of
the 2003 Detailed Plan for as long as that plan was in effect, as many other companies
did during the period in question.©87 Although she was not the author of the 17 July

2013 letter from the Ministry of Economy, she further explained, based on her review

of that letter, that the “explanations provided by the Ministry of Economy ... are based
on the situation in which a detailed plan is in preparation or challenged before
administrative courts, but where no other detailed plan exists.”©88 That was not the
case in the present instance, given that, pending the approval and the subsequent
challenge in the courts (by Rixport and Staur Building) of the 2013 Detailed Plan, the
2003 Detailed Plan remained in effect, as it apparently still did as of the date of the

Hearing in this arbitration.

The Tribunal has no reason to doubt Ms. Skalberga’s evidence that Rixport could have
applied for, and obtained, construction permits on the basis of the 2003 Detailed Plan
during the entire period following the reopening of that plan (except during the one-
month period in July/August 2013 when the 2013 Detailed Plan was briefly in effect).
Moreover, the Tribunal has little sympathy for the Claimants’ contention that they and
Rixport were misinformed or confused by Ms. Skalberga’s April 2012 letter and the
letter subsequently received from the Ministry of Economics in circumstances where,
as is not disputed: Rixport did not, in fact, apply for any construction permits
subsequent to the conclusion of the 2010 Agreement; waited for nearly a year after the
2003 Detailed Plan was reopened to contact Ms. Skalberga; and then raised what
appears to have been a purely hypothetical question. The Claimants have not even
attempted to demonstrate that any specific building projects were blocked or required
to be deferred as a result of the advice contained in the letters upon which the Claimants

rely.

Nor does the Tribunal consider that there is any more merit in the Claimants’ additional
contention that the 2013 Detailed Plan, when issued in July 2013, adversely affected
Rixport’s development plans by: (i) imposing restrictions on building heights and
density that did not apply previously; (ii) providing for the possible division of a land
parcel (D5) upon which Rixport had intended to build the main Airport hotel; (iii)
indicating railway routes across the leased land; (iv) changing open ground level
parking facilities to a multilevel parking facility; and (v) moving the main Airport hotel

away from the terminal behind the parking facilities.©89

As the Respondent has correctly noted with respect to the restriction on building heights
adjacent to the Airport’s runways, this restriction was already described in the
explanatory memorandum forming part of the 2003 Detailed Plan, as set forth in Annex

5 to the Land Lease Agreements. In addition, the Claimants knew before entering into

 

ment 480.

457.

the 2010 Agreement that a possible railway linking Riga to the Airport was being
considered that might cross part of the leased land. As indicated in Section III.D above,
this was described in the 2009 Hochtief masterplan, of which the Claimants were aware
before entering into the 2010 Agreement, and was also the reason why Rixport was
granted certain rent holidays in the 2010 Agreement in respect of Land Plots B-2 and
B-4 of Draw | and in respect of Draw 3.699 The Respondent has noted, further, that
Rixport knew “or should have known” of the possibility of a rail connection since the
outset of the project as this was already public knowledge at the time of the tender and,
indeed, was shown on the cover page of the Griff sketches prepared for the tender.69!
The Respondent has also made the point, which has not been contradicted, that because
the railway route shown on both the 2013 Detailed Plan and 2013 Spatial Plan was only
a “potential conceptual location” and was not yet the subject of any registered
encumbrances, Rixport could not have been denied a construction permit, had it applied

for one, due to any potential railway.692

More importantly, however, the Claimants have failed to establish what specific plans
had been developed by Rixport, as of the date of the 2010 Agreement or thereafter, that
may have been frustrated or adversely affected by any of the alleged changes in the
2013 Detailed Plan about which they complain. The Claimants have asserted that they
had to “draft and redraft and redraft their plans.”6°3 However, they have not provided

any evidence of this.

In the Tribunal’s view, it does not suffice for the Claimants to complain that the 2013
Detailed Plan differed from the 2003 Detailed Plan. Nor does it follow from the mere
fact that there may have been changes to the Detailed Plan that Rixport’s ability to
proceed with its development project was affected in any material way. It is for the

Claimants to establish how they were adversely affected, and this they have not done.

The same considerations apply in respect of the Claimants’ complaints concerning
changes incorporated in the 2013 Spatial Plan (in particular, in respect of a possible
railway route, which at the time had yet to be finalized) and changes made subsequent
to the 2010 Agreement in respect of SJSC Airport’s business development plans,

including, in particular, SJSC Airport’s business plan dated 22 September 2011 which

the Claimants argue postponed the completion of the Airport’s terminal expansion until

after 2020.94

Although the Claimants have complained that delays in the expansion of the Airport
terminal, as recorded either in SJSC Airport’s business development plans or in
Government Action Plans, were not expected by them and effectively frustrated their
development project by postponing the construction of a hotel with a direct connection
to the terminal, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the development project was actually

blocked as a consequence.

First, from the evidence, and as acknowledged by Rixport itself when entering into the
2010 Agreement, there were many parts of the leased land that were available for
immediate development in November 2010. However, Rixport made what appears to
have been the commercial decision not to proceed with any development at all because,
as it has acknowledged, it wished to build an Airport hotel adjacent to the terminal first
and did not consider that it should be required to do so before the expansion of the
terminal was completed. Responsibility for that decision cannot properly be attributed

to any act of the Respondent.

Second, the Tribunal is not persuaded, in any event, that Rixport was prevented from
proceeding with the construction of an Airport hotel once the decision was made in
2011 that a separate airBaltic terminal would not be constructed and that SJSC Airport
would proceed with the 5" and 6" stages of the terminal expansion project, as
previously planned, even if on a delayed schedule. In this regard, the Tribunal accepts
Mr. Saveljevs’ evidence, as described above, that Rixport was not required to wait for
the terminal expansion project to be completed before commencing work on a hotel on
Land 2 of Draw 1. Although the Claimants have complained that that Land Plot was
never made available by SJSC Airport, as Mr. Saveljevs has noted, Rixport did not
request that it be placed at Rixport’s disposal before 1 April 2014, by which time
Rixport had already purported to cancel the lease for Draw 1.695 The Respondent has,
moreover, noted that SJSC Airport offered to transfer Land 2 of Draw | to Rixport as
early as April 2010, but Rixport was unwilling to take that land plot over at that time.°

Moreover, the Claimants have not established that the Respondent bears ibility

for the delays in the completion of the terminal’s expansion. This was a matter that

was being managed by SJSC Airport, and there is no evidence that SJSC Airport’s
business development plans during the period following the 2010 Agreement were the
product of any instructions from the State to SJSC Airport. To the contrary, both Mr.
Saveljevs and Ms. Innusa have testified that those plans were developed without the
State’s intervention, in which case they cannot properly be attributed to the Respondent

under Article 8 of the ILC Articles.

462. In this regard, Mr. Saveljevs has given the following unrebutted account of the reasons

for the delay in his evidence:697

As of the date of the November 2010 Agreement, SJSC Airport was
considering two alternative development scenarios — the expansion of the
existing terminal, or the construction of a new terminal — both of which are
addressed in the 2010 Agreement. After signing the 2010 Agreement,
however, passenger numbers dropped between 2011 and 2012 and then
stagnated until 2014. As such, there was no pressing need to drastically
increase terminal capacity.

Given that passenger numbers had levelled off, the 5" stage development,
the pier building, was separated into two parts to reduce the financial
burden on the Airport. The first stage (“5.1”) was the construction of a
connecting gallery between the existing terminal and the location where
the new pier building would be constructed. This connecting gallery was
then used for extra gates while the pier building was under construction.
The second stage, the pier building itself (“5.2”), was completed in
November 2016. SJSC Airport is now in the process of the next phase of
the development, which includes expansion and reconstruction of the
landside part of the terminal (see Section 3.7 below).

Mr Lundeby refers to an SJSC Airport business plan dated September
2011, which he says states that “the terminal expansion project was
postponed until after 2020”. This is not correct. The business plan
merely states that “[t]he most significant investment activity that the
Airport is planning to implement after 2020, is the 2™ stage of
expansion of the existing terminal”. This is a financial planning
document; it does not affect any technical development plans or any
decisions as to the Airport’s expansion planning. As stated above, part
of the terminal expansion, the pier building project, was in fact
completed in 2016 and the next phase of the project is already
underway.

 

SJSC Airport’s business plans are prepared by outside consultancies,
with input from Riga Airport’s financial team. These business plans
generally concern a lengthy period of time (the September 2011
business plan, for example, concerns the period of 2012 to 2036) and are
used as a framework for investment planning. Once a business plan is
accepted, SJSC Airport's financial department works from a financial

model based on the business plan, which is updated regularly. The
business plan itself is also updated periodically to reflect actual income
and costs, etc. On certain occasions, the Management Board might vote
to update an existing business plan or to issue a new business plan to
reflect changes in the company’s financial planning. Such changes
might be related to ongoing projects at the Airport, but the business plans
would address only the financial aspects, not the technical details... .

In addition, Ms. Innusa testified that “[t]he objectives set in [the various Government
Action Plans, to which the Claimants have referred, including the 2012 plan mentioned
above (purportedly postponing the expansion of the Airport terminal until 2014)] are
mid/long-term and mostly aspirational, without any administrative body in place to
evaluate whether they have been reached.”698 None of those Government Action Plans
that have been introduced into evidence, moreover, purport to impose any binding
obligations or deadlines on SJSC Airport or even mention the Land Lease Agreements

concluded with Rixport.

In their submissions, the Claimants attribute the delay in the terminal expansion project
to an alleged decision of the Latvian State to “prioritize” the infrastructure projects
financed by the EU Cohesion Fund.99 However, there is no evidence of this. The
Claimants contend, apparently on the basis of various media reports, press releases and
SJSC Airport’s 22 September 2011 Business Plan, that “[i]t seems clear that the
Respondent prioritized the major project funded by the EU, and consequently the
terminal expansion (6" stage) was postponed until after 2020.”790 However, this is not
stated in any of the press releases or media reports to which the Claimants have referred
the Tribunal.70! Nor is this stated in the 22 September 2011 Business Plan.702
Moreover, it appears from the subsequent 2012 Government Action Plan, upon which
the Claimants themselves rely, that the EU-funded works and the expansion of the
terminal were expected to be carried out concurrently.703 The Claimants have failed
to identify any decision or instruction of the State to the contrary. Nor have they
adduced any evidence contradicting Mr. Saveljevs’ account of the reasons for the

terminal expansion delay.

In any event, as already noted, the 2010 Agreement did not contain any terms providing

for the completion of the terminal expansion by a specified date.

The Tribunal also does not accept, based on the evidence before it, that, as the
Claimants have alleged, they were deprived of information by the Respondent (or by
SJSC Airport at the direction of the Respondent) concerning the Airport’s future
development that would have had an impact on the development of the land leased to
Rixport. Even if information was not timely provided by SJSC Airport, which the
Respondent disputes, this might at most have given rise to a claim by Rixport against
SJSC Airport under the Land Lease Agreements. However, in the absence of any

wrongful conduct by the State itself, a claim of breach under the BIT does not arise.

As noted above, the Claimants have also complained about certain statements made by
the MEPRD, in its letter of 16 September 2013,7% and the Riga Administrative District
Court? suggesting that the rights of SJSC Airport took precedence over the rights of
Rixport because the Airport was an “object of national interest.” However, the
Claimants have failed to show that Rixport’s ability to develop the leased land in
accordance with the terms of the Land Lease Agreements, as amended in 2007 and
2010, was adversely affected in any way or, as discussed further below, that it was

deprived of recourse in respect of any alleged interference with its contractual rights.

Furthermore, the Tribunal observes that by the time of the issuance of the 2013 Detailed
Plan (which, as stated above, was only briefly in effect in July/August 2013), the 2013
Spatial Plan and MEPRD’s letter, Rixport had already purported to terminate the leases
for Draws 2 and 3, and by the time of the Riga Administrative Court Decision, Rixport
had also purported to terminate the lease for Draw 1. Rixport had, in the meantime,
suspended the payment of rent under all of the leases and appears to have lost interest
in undertaking any of the development work for which it had originally contracted with

SJSC Airport in 2006, prior to the financial crisis.

In view of the above considerations, the Tribunal does not accept, as argued by the
Claimants, that the Respondent took any actions that made “the investment project

impossible to conduct” or that SJSC Airport’s behavior should be attributed to the

Respondent on the basis that it “went above and beyond the conduct which an ordinary

contracting party could adopt” such as to give rise to a breach of the BIT.706

Nor have the Claimants established that Latvia failed either to provide the Claimants
with a transparent, consistent and stable business framework or to respect their

legitimate expectations.

Denial of Justice

It remains to be considered whether the Claimants have a legitimate claim for denial of

justice, in breach of Article III of the BIT.

As the Respondent has argued, a very high threshold is required to be met in order for
an investor to prevail on a claim for denial of justice, whether in respect of an alleged

failure to provide administrative or judicial due process.

In this regard, the Parties appear to agree that the ELSI standard is applicable to a claim
for denial of administrative due process, thus requiring that the actions complained of
would “surprise a sense of judicial propriety.” In the case of a claim for denial of
judicial due process, it is uncontroversial, as stated by Judge Greenwood in the Loewen
v. USA case, that an international tribunal is not to act as a court of appeal or to review
the findings of a national court, but rather must find that the administration of justice
was “scandalously irregular” or, as has been stated by others, involves “a particularly
serious shortcoming” and “egregious conduct” that “shocks, or [as in ELSI] at least
surprises, a sense of judicial propriety.”7°7 It is also axiomatic, and undisputed, that
all local remedies must have been exhausted, absent a finding that recourse to such

remedies would be futile.

In the present case, the Claimants’ claim that the Respondent has violated
administrative due process rules is, as indicated above, founded on: (i) an alleged
failure to invite the Claimants to meetings concerning the 2013 Detailed Plan while it
was being developed; (ii) SJSC Airport’s alleged failure to cause a public meeting to
be held in respect of the environmental impact assessment relating to SJSC Airport’s
2013 development plan for 2012-2036; and (iii) an insolvency notice that SJSC Airport

sent to Rixport on 3 March 2014 in respect of claims for outstanding rent and liquidated

damages under the Land Lease Agreements, although the claims were disputed by
Rixport, which, according to the Claimants, precluded SJSC Airport from sending such

a notice under Latvian law.

The Claimants have failed to persuade the Tribunal, however, that there has been any

violation by the Respondent of any administrative due process.

The Tribunal notes, first of all, that the second and third acts about which the Claimants
complain were acts of SJSC Airport and not of the Respondent. The Tribunal has
already found that acts of SJSC Airport are not attributable to the Respondent under
Articles 4 and 5 of the ILC Articles, and the Claimants have not even attempted to
demonstrate that the second and third acts described above are attributable to the

Respondent under Article 8 of the ILC Articles.

As regards the alleged failure to invite the Claimants (in fact, Rixport) to meetings
concerning the 2013 Detailed Plan, the Claimants have nowhere identified, either in
their written or oral submissions: (i) the specific meeting or meetings to which they (or
Rixport) were supposedly not invited; (ii) who had the alleged obligation to invite them
(SJSC Airport or the Marupe Construction Board?); or (iii) the source of the obligation
that they claim was infringed. The Respondent has, for its part, adduced evidence
showing that Rixport was invited to participate in SJSC Airport’s working groups
regarding development plans while the 2013 Detailed Plan was being prepared and that
Rixport was represented at the public hearing held in respect of the draft Detailed Plan
on 11 April 2013, prior to its approval.7°8 The Claimants deny that Rixport was
involved in the preparation of the 2013 Detailed Plan, but accept that Rixport was given
an opportunity to comment on it before its finalization and participated in the public
consultation meeting held in April 2013.79 It is also undisputed that Rixport
subsequently had the opportunity to challenge the 2013 Detailed Plan before the Riga

Administrative District Court, as it did (together with Staur Building).

In these circumstances, the Tribunal can find no merit in the Claimants’ contention that

they were denied administrative due process, and the claim is required to be rejected.

Turning to the Claimants’ claim that Latvia has violated judicial due process, the
Tribunal has noted above that the claim has the following three components: (i) the

Kurzeme Regional Court acted as both a first instance and appellate court in the

708 Exs. C-91 and R-21; Skalberga witness statement 43-44.

483.

litigation between Rixport and SJSC Airport; (ii) the first judgment of the Kurzeme
Regional Court of 13 February 2015 was delivered in an electronic Word document
created by Ms. Dace Kalnina, who worked as a lawyer for the Ministry of Justice at the
time of the hearing on 13 February 2015 and when the judgment was emailed to the
parties on 1 April 2015, thus suggesting that the Ministry of Justice may have
“colluded” with the court in the preparation of the judgment; and (iii) the fees of the

courts to which the case was referred were excessive.

With respect to this claim, the Tribunal observes, first of all, that, notwithstanding the
amount of the court fees assessed, Rixport was not prevented from accessing the
Latvian courts or pursuing its litigation against SJSC Airport through several levels of
appeal. In addition, it has made the decision not to exhaust its judicial remedies in
Latvia by allowing the most recent judgment of 5 July 2019 of the Kurzeme Regional
Court to stand, without exercising its right to appeal that judgment to the Latvian
Supreme Court. The Claimants have not contended that Rixport was unable to pay the
court fees required for such an appeal, but have indicated that the appeal has not been

pursued because the Claimants have concluded that “this process is futile.”7!0

The Claimants have not undertaken to establish, however, why they consider the
process to be futile, and, given that Rixport has not exhausted the remedies available
to it under the Latvian judicial system, the Tribunal is not inclined to accept the

Claimants’ claim that they have been denied judicial due process.

This having been said, the Tribunal does not consider that any of the criticisms of the
judicial process that the Claimants have made satisfies the very high threshold that must

be met in order to sustain a claim for denial of justice under international law.

With regard to the first of the Claimants’ complaints (i.e., the fact that the Kurzeme
Regional Court has acted, through different judges, both as a court of first instance and
as a court of appeal), the Tribunal does not consider that this calls into question the
ability of the court to do justice. As the Respondent has argued, different judges were
involved in each instance, and the appellate judgment was itself subject to review by
the Supreme Court, which revoked the appellate ruling and remanded the case to the
Kurzeme Regional Court for further review. There has been no showing that, either

before the Kurzeme Regional Court or the Supreme Court, Rixport was denied due

710 Email, dated 19 August 2019.

487.

process or that the proceedings were tainted by bias, discriminatory behavior or any

other impropriety.

The Claimants have, moreover, failed to establish that, notwithstanding the metadata
found in the electronic version of the initial ruling of the Kurzeme Regional Court, Ms.
Kalnina had any involvement in the case after leaving the court to join the Ministry of
Justice; nor is there any evidence of “collusion” between the court and the Ministry of
Justice. The Respondent has provided a perfectly plausible explanation for the
metadata found and, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the Respondent’s
explanation is accepted by the Tribunal. Furthermore, there has been no suggestion by
the Claimants of “collusion” between the courts and the Ministry of Justice in respect

of any of the various court judgments that followed the judgment initially rendered.

In addition, the Tribunal does not consider that a claim for denial of justice can be
sustained based on the level of a jurisdiction’s court fees absent a showing that they are
so high as effectively to preclude recourse to the courts or are otherwise shocking. In
this case, as already stated, Rixport was not prevented from prosecuting its case before
the Latvian courts and, as the Respondent has noted, it would have been entitled to the

return of its court costs had it been successful.

As noted above, the Claimants have also criticized the process by which the case was
transferred from the Riga Regional Court, where it was initially filed by Rixport, to the
Kurzeme Regional Court. Without suggesting that Rixport was the subject of
discriminatory treatment, the Claimants have observed that the process by which such
transfers are effected, while provided for under the Civil Procedure Law, has been
criticized by the CEPEJ on the basis that such transfers are not transparent and cannot
be appealed, which therefore “might raise questions as regards the full respect of the
requirements of a ‘tribunal established by law’ and the principle of legal certainty.”7!!
The CEPEJ nevertheless also acknowledges that the transfer process is “broadly used
in order to tackle the overburdening problem of Riga’s courts.”7!2 It presumably was

used for this purpose in the present case.

Notwithstanding the concerns expressed by the CEPEJ, the Tribunal does not consider
that a process for the judicial assignment of cases in the interest of achieving judicial

efficiency can properly be said to call into question, to the extent required to support a

claim for denial of justice under international law, the ability of the Latvian judicial

system to do justice.

The Tribunal appreciates that the Claimants are disappointed that Rixport did not obtain
the relief that it was seeking before the Latvian courts, but this does not suffice for the

Tribunal to accept their claim, which is rejected.

The Claimants’ next claim is that, by its acts and omissions, the Respondent has
subjected the Claimants’ investments to “measures having a similar effect” to
expropriation, while not fulfilling any of the conditions for the expropriation to be

lawful, in breach of Article VI(1) of the BIT.7!3

The Claimants have advanced their claim on the basis that, by virtue of a series of acts
and omissions allegedly attributable to Latvia, there was a creeping de facto
expropriation that led to the “absolute loss” of the Claimants’ investments by 21 March
2014, which subsequently took the form of a de iure expropriation on 18 December
2017, when the Riga District Court declared in its judgment of that date that the Land

Lease Agreements had been cancelled (as of 16 December 2016).7!4

The assets expropriated are stated by the Claimants to include the Claimants’ shares in
Rixport and the economic value of its contractual rights, including “the physical
property of the land draws”; the “rights to construct and manage all projects set out in
the applications that the Claimants submitted in response to the Tender issued by the
Respondent (relating to the airport hotel, the office buildings, etc.)”; and the Claimants’

rights in respect of short-term parking.7!5

According to the Claimants, the series of acts and omissions comprising the creeping

de facto expropriation included:7!6

detailed plans for the airport, which the Claimants relied upon;”

- “the cost-increasing changes and reduction of allowable building heights for

non-commercial reasons, without warning and explanations;”

- “the announced plan that railway tracks will be built over the land leased by

Claimants;”

- “the Respondent’s failure to transfer the usage of the land to the Claimants;”

-  SJSC Airport’s failure to “honour Rixport’s parking rights;” and

- the “prioritis[ation]” of the “EU-funded infrastructure projects . . . over the
terminal expansion project,” with the effect that the terminal expansion was

postponed until after 2020.

With respect to the Respondent’s alleged failure to transfer the usage of land to the
Claimants (in fact, Rixport), the Claimants have placed particular emphasis on the
unavailability of Land 2 of Draw 1, “which was the land on which the hotel with direct
access to the Airport terminal was to be built.”7!7 They further insist, as in respect of
their Article III claim, that they were prevented from carrying out any construction by

the work on the 2013 Detailed Plan.

The Claimants contend that, while none of the above acts “independently transferred
the title to the property in question, . . . the cumulative result of these acts, over time,
has led to the virtual annihilation of the investment, through the neutralization of the
Claimants’ rights.”7!8 As indicated above, this is claimed by the Claimants to have
occurred by 21 March 2014 when, by letter of that date, Rixport purported to terminate
the lease for Draw 1,7!9 after Rixport had already purported to terminate the leases for

Draws 2 and 3 by letter dated 7 May 2013.720

As a formal matter, the Claimants note that the Riga District Court ruling of 18

December 2017 brought the Land Lease Agreements to an end, although the

“substance” of Rixport’s contractual rights had already been “destroyed” by the

Respondent.72!

496. The Claimants further “maintain that Latvia has not carried out [the] expropriation ...
in accordance with applicable domestic legal procedures and . . . has not paid prompt,

adequate and effective compensation to the Claimants.”722

2. Respondent’s Position

497. The Respondent denies that it expropriated the Claimants’ investments.

498. — It submits, first of all, that in order for a creeping expropriation to have occurred, as
alleged by the Claimants, the Claimants must prove a “substantial, radical, severe,
devastating or fundamental deprivation of [their] rights or the virtual annihilation,
effective neutralisation or factual destruction of [their] investment, its value or

enjoyment.”723

499. — Second, the Respondent argues that there can only be an expropriation if the allegedly
expropriatory acts were taken by (or are attributable) to the State and were committed
in the exercise of puissance publique, rather than pursuant to a contract.724 According
to the Respondent, therefore, the Tribunal “must, as a preliminary matter, consider
whether each of the acts complained of as constituting steps in the creeping
expropriation were taken by the government, rather than Rixport, and dismiss their
relevance wherever they were not.”725 The Respondent further argues, in this regard,
that the only acts of possible relevance must have post-dated the 2010 Agreement as

“all possible breaches predating November 2010 were settled.”726

500. More generally, it is the Respondent’s position that none of the acts of which the
Claimants complain, either separately or cumulatively, had the effect of destroying or
otherwise neutralizing the Claimants’ investments, prior to the “court-sanctioned
termination of the Land Lease Agreements as of 16 December 2016,” by the

contractually-agreed forum, for Rixport’s breaches of the Land Lease Agreements (and

which therefore was not itself expropriatory).’2”7_ To the contrary, the Respondent

argues that the Claimants were at all times in a position to proceed with the

development of the leased land, but chose, for their own reasons, not to do so and

decided instead to purport to terminate the Land Lease Agreements themselves in May

2013 (Draws 2 and 3) and March 2014 (Draw 1).728

501. | With respect to the specific acts about which the Claimants complain, the Respondent

argues (as in response to the Claimants’ Article III claim considered above) that:729

727 ta. at (667.

“regardless of the status of SJSC Airport’s development and business plans,”
Rixport was always in a position to proceed with its development and

construction work;

“nothing in the process of developing the 2013 Detailed Plan . . . would have

impacted Rixport’s existing rights”;

in particular, the permissible building height was not reduced, but “always
stayed the same” and the possible railway track was also not new, had only
been indicated “temporarily,” was subject to “clarification” and “did not

constitute an obstacle to obtaining construction permits”;

there was “no ‘refusal’ to release the leased lands”: Draws No. 2 and 3 “were
always available for Rixport to develop” and, in the case of Land 2 of Draw 1,
on which the hotel connected to the terminal was going to be built, “under the
2010 Agreement it was for Rixport to give notice of its intention to take over

the land, which it never genuinely did”;

SJSC Airport did not fail to “honour Rixport’s parking rights”;

rather, “Rixport was ... seeking to renege on their promises to build additional
parking and seeking simply to take over the Airport’s terminal parking to make
easy money without any investment, which SJSC Airport disagreed with, as
not being within the terms of the Land Lease Agreements, the 2007

Amendments or the 2010 Agreement”;

- the “EU-funded infrastructure projects” only “impacted the land leased to
Rixport in necessitating the installation of some drainage systems on the land,

of which Rixport was informed”; and

- the terminal expansion project was not postponed until after 2020: the
“terminal expansion is currently ongoing, the 5" stage having been completed

in 2016.”

The Respondent argues further that, in any event, none of the acts of which the
Claimants complain were “major in character” or were capable, either separately or
together, of destroying the Claimants’ ownership rights over Rixport or the Land Lease
Agreements.730 Ultimately, the Respondent submits, “the Claimants lost the rights
under the Land Lease Agreements [only] when the Riga District Court granted SJSC
Airport’s application to cancel them.”73! As indicated, this judgment could not, in the
Respondent’s view, have constituted an expropriation, given that it merely gave effect
to the agreement of SJSC Airport and Rixport that disputes concerning their respective

rights under the Land Lease Agreements should be decided by the Latvian courts.

3. The Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision
The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that there has neither been a creeping de facto

expropriation of the Claimants’ investments nor a de iure expropriation.

Underlying the Claimants’ expropriation claim are the propositions that: (i) “Latvia has
repeatedly acted in its public capacity by altering the conditions within which the [Land
Lease Agreements were] to be executed, through acts of its Ministry of Transport, its
local city council and several judgments of its domestic judiciary;’732 and (ii) the
“cumulative result of Latvia’s acts has gradually caused the actual investment to be

entirely lost.”733
The Tribunal has the following difficulties with the Claimants’ position, however:
First, most of the acts of which the Claimants complain were acts of SJSC Airport and

not Latvia, and the Claimants have failed to establish they were attributable to Latvia,

as found in the preceding sections of this Award. Thus, as the Tribunal has already

509.

found (see {{[461-464 above), there is no evidence that the changes of SJSC Airport’s
business plans, including the postponement of SJSC Airport’s terminal expansion
plans, were instructed, directed or otherwise attributable to any decisions of the State.
Nor is there any evidence that the State, as distinct from SJSC Airport, had any
involvement in the making of individual Land Plots available to Rixport under the Land
Lease Agreements or Rixport’s supposed failure to “honour Rixport’s parking rights.”
The related disputes between Rixport and Latvia were referred by Rixport (and later
SJSC Airport) to the Latvian courts for resolution, in accordance with the Land Lease
Agreements, and were the subject of binding decisions of the Latvian courts, which this
Tribunal is not in a position to question, in the absence of any showing, as already

found above, that Rixport was denied justice by the Latvian judicial system.

Second, insofar as any of the acts of which the Claimants complain might be considered
to be attributable to Latvia, such as changes claimed to have been incorporated in the
2013 Detailed Plan approved by the Marupe Construction Board or the 2013 Spatial
Plan issued by the Marupe Municipality, the Claimants have failed to establish that
their contractual rights were adversely affected, let alone that any such changes had the
effect of leading to the “absolute loss” of the Claimants’ investments (see [{[447-457

above).

In this regard, the Tribunal notes that Rixport itself purported to terminate the leases
for Draws 2 and 3 by letter dated 7 May 2013, before the 2013 Detailed Plan had even
been approved (in July 2013) and before the 2013 Spatial Plan had been issued. In its
7 May 2013 letter, Rixport stated that it was taking this step for two reasons: (i) it
planned to develop Draws 2 and 3 after developing Draw 1, and the Draw 1 works were
delayed due to the postponement of the terminal expansion works and the Draw | land
allegedly not being available; and (ii) development and construction works on Draws
2 and 3 were, in any event, “prohibited” pending the issuance of the new Detailed

Plan.734

The Tribunal has already found, however, that construction on Draws 2 and 3 was not
prohibited pending the issuance of a new Detailed Plan (see 452 above). It appears,
moreover, to have been Rixport’s intention, as it acknowledged in its 7 May 2013 letter,
to delay the development of Draws 2 and 3 until after it had constructed an Airport
hotel on Draw 1. This, as already stated, was a commercial choice made by the

Claimants and for which the Respondent cannot be said to have any responsibility. The

512.

Claimants have failed to provide any evidence, moreover, of the development plans for
Draws 2 and 3, as of May 2013, that they claim were frustrated by the preparation and
subsequent issuance of either the 2013 Detailed Plan or the 2013 Spatial Plan. Nor
have they undertaken to show how any of the alleged changes in those plans would
have affected adversely the value of their investments, let alone caused their “absolute
loss.” In addition, as already found above, the Respondent bears no responsibility for
the postponement of the terminal expansion works, which, in the Tribunal’s view, did
not, in any event, require that the development of Draw | be delayed for the reasons
already provided above (see 460 above). There is, in particular, no evidence, as
already found (see [464 above), that the terminal expansion works were delayed
because of a decision of the State to “prioritise” the “EU-funded infrastructure projects

. . over the terminal expansion project.”735

The Tribunal further notes that when Rixport subsequently purported, by letter dated
21 March 2014, to terminate the lease for Draw 1, it did so principally on the basis that,
as of that date allegedly: (i) Rixport had no information concerning the possible

location of the Airport hotel, “its connection with the terminal, foreseen
commencement of construction works, project of extension of the terminal, further
development of the airport;” (ii) SJSC Airport had failed to transfer to Rixport “rights
to operate the short term parking;” and (iii) SJSC Airport had “not yet transferred for
usage to Rixport the Land 2 and Land 3 of Draw 1, neither has it informed Rixport

about the perspective [sic] dates of transfer.”736

All of these acts or omissions were alleged to constitute contractual defaults of SISC
Airport, which SJSC Airport, in turn, disputed. The Latvian courts subsequently found
that it was Rixport, rather than SJSC Airport, that was in default of its contractual
obligations (and, in particular, its failure to make lease payments) and, accordingly,
declared the Land Lease Agreements cancelled as of 16 December 2016 as a

consequence.

Even had the Latvian courts not so found, the Claimants have not established that
Latvia was responsible for any of SJSC Airport’s alleged defaults or that Latvia
otherwise took any actions such as to cause the “absolute loss” of the Claimants’

investments prior to Rixport itself purporting to terminate the Land Lease Agreements

518.

and thereafter refusing to perform any of its own obligations under those agreements,

in particular, continuing to make lease payments.

Nor does the decision of the Riga District Court declaring the termination of the Land
Lease Agreements for default by Rixport constitute an expropriation. To the contrary,

the decision was issued in accordance with the terms of those agreements.

The Claimants’ expropriation claim is therefore required to be rejected.

D. Umbrella Clause Claim

The Tribunal is finally left to consider the Claimants’ umbrella clause claim. As noted
above, it is the Claimants’ position that Latvia has breached the umbrella clause
contained in Article 2(2) of the UK-Latvia BIT (and/or other BITs), which they say
should be considered to have been imported into the BIT by virtue of the BIT’s MFN

clause (Article IV).737 As indicated above, Article IV(1) provides:

Investments made by investors of one contracting party in the territory of
the other contracting party shall be accorded treatment no less favourable
than that accorded to investments made by investors of any third state.

Article 2(2) of the UK-Latvia BIT, in turn provides that (emphasis added):738

Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered
into with regard to investments of nationals or companies of the other
Contracting Party.

By virtue of this provision, the Claimants submit that the Respondent is liable to the
Claimants under the BIT for SJSC Airport’s alleged breaches of the Land Lease
Agreements. As already discussed, it is the Claimants’ position that, although the Land
Lease Agreements were entered into by Rixport and SJSC Airport, the contractual
obligations “are those of the Respondent by attribution, and the contractual rights are

those of the Claimants and not just Rixport.”739

During the Hearing, the Claimants acknowledged that, in order for a claim to arise
under the umbrella clause, the Tribunal must find not only that the clause has been

imported into the BIT by the BIT’s MEN provision, but that a relevant contract has

been entered into by Latvia, which the Tribunal could only find, in the present
circumstances, if SJSC Airport were found to be “part of the Ministry of Transport.”740
The Claimants, thus, conceded at the Hearing that: “If the Article 4 argument is not
accepted by the Tribunal, then the umbrella clause argument will fail,” the reference to

Article 4 being to Article 4 of the ILC Articles.74!

The Tribunal has already decided, in Section VLA above, that SJSC Airport is separate
and distinct from the Latvian State and that it is not a State organ under Article 4. It
therefore follows that no claim under the umbrella clause arises and that the Claimants’

claim is required to be rejected.

COSTS

Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the
parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in
connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those
expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the
charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such
decision shall form part of the award.

Article 47 of the Arbitration Rules further provides that the award shall contain, inter

alia, “any decision of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding.”

It is uncontroversial that, under these provisions, the Tribunal has broad discretion to

decide how the costs incurred by the Parties for the arbitration should be allocated.

Each of the Claimants and the Respondent also submit that, consistent with a practice
that is commonly (although not universally) applied in international arbitration, the
costs should “follow the event” if they respectively succeed.742 It is nevertheless also
the Claimants’ position, which the Respondent disputes, that if the Respondent is
successful, the Parties should bear their own costs, with the Tribunal’s fees and
expenses and ICSID’s administrative costs equally shared, given that the Claimants’
claim was not “frivolous” and the Claimants were “justified” in bringing this

arbitration.743 In addition, the Claimants have argued that “the repeated interventions

of the Respondent’s counsel on various points of order has inflated the expenditure
significantly” and “this litigation tactic” should not be “transformed into a burden to
be put on the shoulders of the Claimants, who have chosen to pursue a more financially

sound and constructive strategy.”744

In urging the Tribunal to allocate the costs to the successful Party, the Respondent has
referred the Tribunal to the following passage in the case of Libananco Holdings Co.

Limited y. Republic of Turkey:74>

[A] rule under which costs follow the event serves the purposes of
compensating the successful party for its necessary legal fees and
expenses, of discouraging unmeritorious actions and also of providing a
disincentive to over-litigation. It also allows a tribunal sufficient leeway
to take due account of specific issues on which the overall losing party has
nevertheless succeeded, and to take account as well of the costs
implications of procedural motions raised by one or another party.

The Tribunal considers this to be a reasonable approach and sees no reason why it

should deviate from it in the present case.

From the above, it is evident that the Respondent has been the successful party. All of
the Claimants’ claims have been rejected. It therefore follows that the Claimants
should bear the costs reasonably incurred by the Respondent for the arbitration, in the
absence of any circumstances that might militate against all or certain of those costs

being awarded in the particular circumstances of this arbitration.

In this regard, as noted above, the Claimants have argued that they should not be
required to bear the Respondent’s costs because their claims were not “frivolous.”
However, the Tribunal does not consider that, even if it were accepted that the claims
were not “frivolous,” this would suffice to deny the Respondent an award of its costs
in circumstances where the claims were all found to be lacking in merit, and without

the case presenting any novel issues or otherwise being of unusual difficulty.

The Claimants have argued that the Respondent has, by its “litigation tactics,” inflated
the cost of the arbitration and that the Claimants should not bear the burden of this.
However, they have failed, in making this argument, to identify any specific “litigation
tactics” that they consider were unreasonable. In the Tribunal’s view, the Claimants

and the Respondent both conducted the proceedings in a professional and efficient

531.

manner. The Tribunal does not consider that there was any procedurally abusive
conduct that would warrant reducing the Respondent’s cost entitlement. Nor have the
Claimants indicated that any of the specific fees or expenses described by the

Respondent in its Submission on Costs were excessive or unreasonably incurred.

According to the Respondent’s Submission on Costs, it incurred legal fees in an amount
of EUR 2,386,868.75 and expenses in an amount of EUR 464,755.67, in addition to
making payments to ICSID in an amount of USD 325,000 as advances in respect of the
fees and expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID.746 Although the fees and expenses of
the Claimants were lower, it does not appear to the Tribunal that the fees and expenses

incurred by the Respondent were unreasonable for an arbitration of this nature.

The Tribunal nevertheless notes that, while rejecting all of the Claimants’ claims, the
Tribunal did not accept that the Respondent’s jurisdictional and admissibility
objections deprived the Tribunal of jurisdiction. Given that time was required to be
devoted to the issue of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, which could have been avoided, the
Tribunal considers it appropriate to make an adjustment to the Respondent's cost claim.
Although the Respondent has not separately identified the amount of its legal fees that
are attributable to its jurisdictional and admissibility objections, the Tribunal has
determined, having regard to all of the submissions before it and in the exercise of its
discretion, that the Respondent’s recoverable legal fees should be reduced by 10%, i.e.,
by EUR 238,687 to EUR 2,148,181.75, which amount should be reimbursed to the
Respondent by the Claimants together with the Respondent’s claimed expenses of EUR
464,755.67.

The Respondent has, in addition, requested that it be awarded interest on its costs at a
rate of 6% per year as from the date of the Award.747 The Respondent has adopted
this rate because it is the rate proposed by the Claimants for interest on their claimed
damages, based on the Latvian Civil Law.748 For their part, the Claimants have neither
objected to this rate nor proposed another rate. In the absence of any other proposed
rate, the Tribunal adopts the rate proposed by the Respondent, which, in the exercise

of its discretion, the Tribunal finds to be reasonable.

532. As regards the costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal,

ICSID’s administrative fees and direct expenses, these amount to (in USD):

Eric Schwartz USD 175,286.94

ICSID’s administrative fees USD 158,000.00
Direct expenses USD 63,535.13
Total USD 658,994.42

533. The above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in nearly equal
parts. 4° The Claimants paid USD 324,950; the Respondent paid USD 325,000. During
the course of the proceeding, the funds advanced by the Parties accrued interest in the
amount of USD 10,648.38. Accordingly, the Tribunal decides that the Claimants
should reimburse to the Respondent the amount of USD 329,497.21 for the expended

portion of its advances to ICSID.

VII. AWARD
