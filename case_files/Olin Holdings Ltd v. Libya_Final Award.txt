6. RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE BIT AND THE APPLICABLE LAW

75.

77.

78.

The following paragraphs reproduce the main provisions of the BIT that are relevant to

the present dispute.

Article 2.2 of the BIT contains three different standards of protection, namely the “Fair
and Equitable Treatment” (“FET”) standard, the “Full Protection and Security”
(“FPS”) standard as well as a non-impairment clause, which are together defined as

follows:

Investments made by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the
other Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable
treatment and shall enjoy full protection and security according to the law.
Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or
discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment,
expansion or disposal of such investments.

Articles 3.1 and 3.2 of the BIT define the “Most Favourable Nation” and “National

Treatment” standards as follows:

1. Once a Contracting Party has admitted an investment in its territory in

accordance with its laws and regulations, it shall accord to such investment

made by investors of the other Contracting Party treatment not less favourable
ded

than that accorded to ii of its own ii or of ii of any
third State, whichever is more favourable to the investor concerned.

2. Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to investors of the other
Contracting Party, as regards to their management, maintenance, use,
enjoyment, expansion or disposal of their investment, treatment not less
favourable than that accorded to its own investors or to investors of any third
State, whichever is more favourable to the investors concerned.

Article 7 of the BIT sets out the conditions for a legal nationalization or expropriation

in the following terms:

1. Investments of investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the
other Contracting Party shall not be nationalized, expropriated or subjected to
measures having equivalent effect to nationalization or expropriation, except

1 Respondent's Rejoinder, page 73.

-25-

79.

for public interest, in accordance with due process of law, on a non-
discriminatory basis and against the payment of prompt, adequate and effective
compensation.

2. Such compensation shall amount to the fair market value of the investment
expropriated immediately before the expropriation or impending expropriation
became publicly known, whichever is the earlier (hereinafter referred to as the
“valuation date”).

3. Such market value shall be calculated in a freely convertible currency at the
market rate of exchange prevailing for that currency on the valuation date.
Compensation shall include interest calculated on the basis of the 6-month
LIBOR rate applicable on the date of expropriation, from the date of
expropriation until the date of payment. Compensation shall be paid without
delay, be effectively realizable and freely transferable.

4. The investor affected shall have the right, under the law of the Contracting
Party making the expropriation, to prompt review, by a judicial authority or
other competent and independent authority of that Contracting Party, of its
case, including the valuation of its investment and the payment of compensation,
in accordance with the principles set out in this Article.

5. Where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is
incorporated or constituted under the law in force in any part of its own
territory, and in which investors of the other Contracting Party own shares, it
shall ensure that the provisions of this Article are applied so as to guarantee
prompt, adequate and effective compensation in respect of their investment to
such investors of the other Contracting Party who are owners of those shares.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

The Arbitral Tribunal provides below a factual background concerning the Parties’
dispute in this arbitration. This overview is not intended to be a comprehensive account
of all the issues debated during the course of the proceedings, but rather an outline
containing some significant events and undisputed facts. As such, it should be read in
conjunction with the other sections of this Final Award, which contain further details
in relation to the disputed matters (as well as the Arbitral Tribunal’s findings in relation

thereto).

In the 1990s, Libya initiated a series of legislative and economic reforms and
stabilization measures designed to attract foreign investment. In addition to changing
the international legal landscape through the conclusion of BITs, Libya also modified

its domestic legislation to foster foreign investments.

-26-

81. On 9 March 1997, the Libyan Government enacted Law No. 5 for the Promotion of
Investment of Foreign Capital, (subsequently amended with Law No. 7 in 2003) (the

“Libyan Investment Law”).'!

82. In this context, Olin decided to invest in a dairy and juice factory in Libya and sought
to obtain governmental approvals to build and operate its factory in the vicinity of
Tripoli. Olin subsequently obtained all necessary licenses and authorizations from the

relevant governmental authorities, in accordance with local laws.

83. On 12 November 2002, the Ministry of Economy and Trade issued Decision No 365
for 2002, authorising Olin to establish a local branch and to proceed with its investment
in Libya.'?

84. On3 March 2003, the LFIB issued its Investment Project License No 44 (for 2003),
granting Olin an “investment project license” that allowed it to proceed with the

implementation of a dairy products factory project in Tripoli.'>

85. On this basis, Olin selected in 2005 a site (Plot No. 11) for its factory in Tripoli’s
industrial area, Al-Fallah.'* In this arbitration, while the Claimant asserts that Mr Said
Abughamja (father of Mr Akram Abughamja) purchased this land,'> Libya for its part
considers that Mr Said Abughamja had in fact obtained this land through a donation on
24 April 2005."° It is not contested, however, that the land on which Olin’s factory has
been erected belonged to Mr Said Abughamja and not to Olin at the time.'7

into a contract of usufruct with Olin on 10 May 2006 in respect of the same plot.'?

87. On 25 June 2005, Olin received a building permit from the Tripoli People’s Committee,
giving it the green light to commence the construction of its factory on Plot No. 11 in
the industrial zone of Al Fallah.2° At that time, Olin had partnered with PROLAC, a
major French milk powder producer and exporter and a subsidiary of the French
conglomerate SOUFFLET GROUP,” as well as with ACTINI, a French manufacturer

of sterilizing equipment, to assist Olin in designing and building the factory and

purchasing the necessary machines.??

88. On21 November 2005, the LFIB issued a new investment license adding the production
of juices to the scope of Olin’s investment project.?> From that point onwards, the
license was regularly renewed by decisions of the LFIB, until April 2017 (see

paragraph 128 below).4

Investment Project License No. 020 for 2006 dated 26 November 2006), which was then renewed in 2008, for
two years (Exhibit C-60, LFIB’s Renewal of Investment Project License No. 020 for 2006 dated November 18,
2008) and then in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 for successive periods of one year (see Exhibit C-105, LFIB’s
Renewal of Investment Project License No. 020 for 2006 dated December 19, 2010; Exhibit C-106, LFIB’s

Olin’s investment project license for a period of two months (Exhibit C-108, LFIB’s Renewal of Investment
Project License No. 020 for 2006 dated November 26, 2014); in January 2015, for a period of six months (Exhibit

In late 2005, Olin actively prepared for the launch of its products and hired an
advertising company called“Memac-Ogilvy” to plana USD I million launch marketing

campaign.?>

During the construction of the factory, Olin was introduced to Candia which was
looking at the time to establish a franchise in Libya, and on 30 January 2006, Olin and
Candia entered into a Manufacturing and Distribution Franchise Agreement (the

“Candia Franchise Agreement”).?°

By the end of 2006, Olin had completed the construction of its factory and was ready

to start production.

On 12 November 2006, Olin received an eviction order from the Tripoli’s People
Committee for Housing & Utilities informing it that its factory had been “dispossessed”

and requesting it to vacate the premises within 3 days.?”

According to the Claimant, it is only then that Olin became aware of Decision No. 241
of 2006, 8 issued by the General People’s Committee (“GPCO”) on 19 October 2006
(the “Expropriation Order”), which expropriated a parcel of land along the Tripoli
Airport Road, including Olin’s factory (the “Expropriated Area”).”* In its Article 1,
the Expropriation Order stipulates that:

The property on aerial map No. 13-52 located between the employee housing
project and [Al-Sawani] Road, People’s Congress of Bab [Akkara]
Municipality, Tripoli district, shall be expropriated for the public interest to
establish a housing project pursuant to the Secretary of the Public Property
Authority Management Committee letter and the design plan attached to this
resolution.

94. Within three days of Olin’s receipt of the eviction notice, the Libyan army had
destroyed several buildings around Olin’s factory and expelled thousands of occupants

in the process. *°

95, On 25 November 2006, the GPCO issued Decision No. 266 of 2006 .(the “Revised
Expropriation Order”), expanding the Expropriated Area to cover a surface of 340
hectares, “for the public interest” and “for the execution of the urban development in
the area located to the west and east of the airport road in Tripoli"!

96. The next day, on 26 November 2006, the LFIB issued a renewal of Olin’s license to

operate.

97. Within three months of receipt of the Expropriation Order in November 2006, Libya
had demolished the quasi totality of the Expropriated Area, leaving Olin’s factory as

one of the few buildings standing.*°

98. Between November 2006 and June 2009, Olin sent several letters to the LFIB and to
the Minister of Economy, Trade and Investment in Libya, seeking a formal exemption

from the Expropriation Order.*4

99. The LFIB supported Olin’s request for an exemption through a series of letters in 2006,
addressed to different Libyan public authorities, namely the People’s Committee for
Housing and Infrastructure; the Tripoli Authority for Public Property;>° the Ministry
of Housing;?” the Public Electricity Company;>8 and to the Minister of Economy, Trade

exemption from the Expropriation Order by addressing letters to the Secretary of the
GPCco.*°

101. On 9 December 2006, Olin initiated judicial proceedings before the Tripoli Court of
Appeal, First Administrative Circuit (the “Tripoli Court of Appeal”) challenging the
legality of the Expropriation Order.*!

102. On 13 May 2007, the Secretary of the Administration Committee of the LFIB wrote to
Olin, referring to a letter dated 28 April 2007, sent to the assistant secretary of the Public
Establishment of Housing and Utilities, granting Olin “a deadline of at least six months

to move the equipment, machines on another site, with the obligation to provide [Olin]

with a suitable alternative”.

103, On 30 May 2007, the Administrative Committee for Public Property, in application of

On 8 November 2007 and 10 December 2007, Olin wrote to the LFIB, stating that the
uncertainty as to the future of its factory as well as the lack of a suitable alternative site

and the lack of compensation, caused Olin to incur financial losses on a daily basis.4*

On 10 January 2008, Olin sent a similar letter to the General Organization for Housing
& Utilities.“

On 15 February 2008, the GPCO decided to create a committee, “for the purpose of
discussing with Olin the terms of its eviction”, including the identification of a

replacement location and the payment of adequate compensation.”

While the Parties disagree as to whether the GPCO ultimately exempted Olin from
expropriation, they do agree that the Libyan authorities accepted to expressly exempt
two of Olin’s competitors from any destruction or relocation: Al-Aseel Juice Plant, a
privately-owned Libyan company,'* as well as the State-owned OKBA Dairy Factory
in 2008.49

On 13 April 2010, the Tripoli Court of Appeal cancelled the 2006 Expropriation Order
on the ground that it was unlawful under Libyan law, since it did not adopt the
appropriate process for the expropriation of foreign investors under the Libyan

Investment Law.*°

On 31 August 2010, notwithstanding the decision of the Tripoli Court of Appeal, the
General Authority for Public Property sent Olin a letter, asking it to “evacuate the site
on top urgent basis and deliver it free of all obstacles and people within a week of today
to the Libyan Company for Development and Investment”! When Olin notified the
LFIB on the same day that the Expropriation Order had been cancelled,” the LFIB

had found a replacement location for Olin.>?

As from October 2010, a number of Libyan governmental departments endorsed the

Tripoli Court of Appeal’s decision.*+

On 7 December 2010, Olin initiated judicial proceedings before the South Tripoli Court
of First Instance (the “South Tripoli Court”) against the President of the Transitional
Government, the Minister of Housing and Infrastructure, the Minister of Planning, and
the Minister of Finance, seeking compensation for the harm it had suffered as a result

of the Expropriation Order.>°

A first hearing was held on 11 January 2011, rescheduled for 1 March 2011, and then
to 26 April 2011, at which point the South Tripoli Court decided to close the
proceedings and informed Olin that it would render its decision on 20 September
2011.56

On 17 February 2011, the period of revolution and civil unrest started in Libya.>”

On 15 June 2011, the Libyan authorities transferred back to Mr Said Abughamja the
property title of Plot No.11 on which the Olin factory was erected.**

On 20 September 2011, the South Tripoli Court decided to reopen the proceedings on
the basis that the judges responsible for the case had changed after the 2011

revolution.°?

A hearing was subsequently held on 17 January 2012, when Olin was told that it had to

re-file its case as the respondents’ official titles had changed since the revolution. Olin

2013.5!

was finally held on 4 February 2014.

Has Libya breached Article 7 of the BIT relating to expropriation as a result of the
unlawful and discriminatory interim legal and economic dispossession of Olin’s
foreign investment from November 2006 through June 2011 without due process of
law and without prompt, adequate and effective compensation?

b) Has Libya failed to grant Olin’s investment the national treatment that was afforded
to Libyan investors as well as the MFN treatment under Article 3 of the Cyprus-
Libya BIT?

Has Libya breached Article 2.2 of the Cyprus-Libya BIT, by failing to accord FET,

FPS and/or by impairing the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, and
expansion of the Olin investment in Libya with unreasonable and discriminatory

measures?

&

How should the Tribunal compensate Olin for its losses, if any?
e) Did Olin breach any of its obligations under the Cyprus-Libya BIT or during this
arbitration? Should the Tribunal compensate Libya for any losses as a result of

Olin’s behavior?

5

Should the Tribunal order the payment of pre-award and post-award interest on the
amount of compensation granted to Olin, if any?

How should the Tribunal allocate the legal and arbitration costs incurred in these

e@

proceedings?

130. In discussing in this Final Award the Parties’ respective contentions and the issues
arising therefrom, the Arbitral Tribunal will refer to various parts of the submissions of
the Parties. However, the fact that the Arbitral Tribunal has not reflected a specific part
of such submissions does not mean that it has not considered such part in rendering its
conclusions in this final award. Indeed, the Arbitral Tribunal has carefully considered
all of the Parties’ oral and written submissions as well as all of the evidence both oral
and documentary, in its consideration of the issues to be determined and the Parties’

requests for relief, including those which are not expressly referred to below.

9, ISSUE NO. 1: HAS LIBYA BREACHED ARTICLE 7 OF THE BIT RELATING TO
EXPROPRIATION?

A) Summary of the Parties’ Positions

i, The Claimant

131, The Claimant asserts that the issuance of the Expropriation Order in 2006 violates
Article 7 of the Cyprus-Libya BIT, which prohibits the expropriation of investments
“except for public interest, in accordance with due process of law, on a non-
discriminatory basis and against the payment of prompt, adequate and effective

compensation. 7”?

132. The Claimant contends first that the Expropriation Order was not for public interest.
The Claimant cites the decision in ADC v. Hungary” according to which “a treaty
requirement for ‘public interest’ requires some genuine interest of the public. If mere
reference to ‘public interest’ can magically put such interest into existence and
therefore satisfy this requirement, then this requirement would be rendered
meaningless since the Tribunal can imagine no situation where this requirement would
not have been met.” ’’ According to the Claimant, the State’s alleged justification for
the Expropriation Order, i.e. the construction of a housing project for public interest,
“vas only a pretext to conceal Libya’s true motive to give the land to LIDCO to develop .

high-yield luxury apartments”.

133. Second, the Claimant argues that the Expropriation Order was not in accordance with
due process of law, as Olin was neither provided with a “notice nor an opportunity to
be heard before its investment was declared dispossessed”. Moreover, according to the
Claimant, “Libya flouted the ‘due process’ safeguards contained in its Libyan
Investment Law when it issued the Expropriation Order in the form of an order from

the GPCO, rather than a law or judicial decision”.”°

134. Third, the Claimant asserts that Olin’s treatment stands in contrast to the permanent
exemptions granted by Libya to the government-owned OKBA factory and the
privately-owned, Libyan Al-Aseel factory which were located in the vicinities of Olin’s

factory.””

138,

Finally, the Claimant considers that Libya’s expropriation was not taken against
prompt, adequate, and effective compensation, which renders any expropriation

unlawful and gives rise to international liability.”*

Based on the above assertions, the Claimant concludes that Libya’s expropriation of
Olin’s investment was an unlawful act under the Cyprus-Libya BIT and the Libyan

Investment Law.”

ii, The Respondent

In its submissions, the Respondent refers to both the Expropriation Order of October
2006 and the Revised Expropriation Order of November 2006 expanding the
Expropriation Area, as the 2006 Expropriation Orders.° The Respondent advances
first that the 2006 Expropriation Orders did not affect the Claimant, since Olin was not
the owner of the plot on which the plant was erected. Instead, according to the
Respondent, the land belongs to Said Abughamja, as shown by the Lease contract of
May 2005 between Said Abughamja and Olin, which was followed by the usufruct
contract between the same parties in May 2006 (see paragraph 86 of the Factual

Background).*!

The Respondent further argues that “the transfer of the land owned by Mr Said

Abughamja to the Libyan State had no effect for the investor and its investment” since:

The plot has never been occupied by anyone except from Olin’s staff,

The buildings have not been demolished;

The materials and equipment have never been requisitioned;

The investor has never been formally deprived of its investment;

- The investor kept all its rights on its investment.*?

78 Claimant's SoC at para 95.
7 Id. at para 98.
80 As mentioned in the factual background (Section 7 above), the GPCO issued Decision No. 241 of 2006 on 19

October 2006 (the Expropri

 

ion Order), which expropriated a parcel of land along the Tripoli Airport Road,

including Olin’s factory (the Expropriated Area) and on 25 November 2006, the GPCO issued Decision No, 266
of 2006 (the Revised Expropriation Order), expanding the Expropriated Area to cover a surface of 340 hectares.
81 Respondent’s SoD at para 168.

2 Id, at para 169.

139. The Respondent also contests the Claimant’s allegations as to the purported illegality
of the 2006 Expropriation Orders.

140. The Respondent argues in this regard that the urban project of the Al-Fallah zone was
driven by public interest with the urban development of the zone and the modernization
of the associated utilities (water, electricity, sewage).*> The Respondent explains that
Tripoli has been affected by a quick urbanization especially between 1969 and 2005
and that “the Government decided to modernize different sectors in favor of the
population.” Thus, “the object of these great projects was to solve the problems of
unhealthy housing environment, to boost the economy and create jobs, and to reduce
social tensions. Such projects are decided by the Government in favor of the general
and public interest, in view to develop: the condition of life of the population, the
employment, public utilities. ”*4 The Respondent adds that “the Claimant cannot allege
that the decision of expropriation had not been issued for public interest and was illicit
because it does not bring any evidence that the urban plan constituted an obvious
misuse of private and foreign interests to the only personal interest of governmental
authorities and in breach of the law”.85

141. The Respondent further maintains that “the [Expropriation Orders] comply with the
requirement of due process of law” since they were motivated, published, and that the

possibility of a legal action was likewise offered.®°

142, The Respondent also denies that there was a discrimination to Olin’s detriment.
According to the Respondent, “the [Expropriation Orders] concerned the whole Al
Fallah zone”, and “all the people and plants located in this area were concerned by
the urban planning”. The Respondent adds that if discrimination had existed, “it would
have been positive and in favor of Olin’s interest and its two direct Libyan
competitors”, since “Olin, thanks to its Cyprus nationality and its capacity as foreign
investor, has been protected and exempted from any kind of expropriation” 7

143. With regard to the absence of financial compensation, the Respondent considers that

“since Olin has never been forced to move and since it has never interrupted its activity

there was no room for any financial compensation." The Respondent adds that in case
Olin had not been exempted from expropriation and had been forced to move, the
competent authorities in Libya have considered an alternative site to locate Olin’s plant
and “have mentioned their intention to compensate [Olin] of all the costs linked to such

a transfer from Al Fallah to another industrial zone”. **

On this basis, the Respondent concluded in its SoD that there was no unlawful

expropriation in breach of Article 7 of the BIT.
iii, The Parties’ Rebuttal Arguments

In reply to Respondent’s argument that the plot did not belong to Olin, the Claimant
maintains that it has lawfully acquired the land but that the Libyan authorities had
delayed the registration process until June 2011. Prior to this date, Olin was not allowed
to start the process of registering its property title over the land on which the factory

was built.®

In reply to Respondent’s argument that Olin was not the addressee of the Expropriation
Order, but instead Mr Said Abughamja who is a Libyan national and the land’s owner,
the Claimant contended that “both Article 23 of the Libyan Investment Law and Article
7 of the Treaty protected Olin from any measure having the same effect as or
tantamount to an expropriation, subject to certain specific requirements”. The
Claimant concluded that “fe/ven if Olin was not the addressee, the Expropriation
Order was clearly tantamount to an expropriation of Olin, as multiple Libyan agencies

immediately recognized”.°

Finally, in reply to Respondent’s argument that there was no expropriation at all, since
Olin’s factory was not destroyed, did not have to relocate and therefore that Mr Said
Abughamja’s land was in fact exempted from the Expropriation Order, the Claimant
reiterated that despite the support of several Libyan governmental agencies, the GPCO
never formally exempted Olin from the Expropriation Order*! but maintained Olin ina

state of uncertainty as to its expropriation,” and failed to provide Olin with any suitable

alternative location.?? The Claimant further contended that the impact of Libya’s illegal
expropriation of Olin was at least threefold: (a) it resulted in the demolition of the area
immediately surrounding Olin’s factory, which led to in electricity and water cuts as
well as in a loss of access to the sewage system; (b) it had an immediate chilling effect,
placing Olin in a state of paralysis and forcing it to downscale its operations
dramatically; and (c) it significantly impacted Olin’s relationships with both its

commercial partners and competitors.”4

148. — In its Rejoinder, the Respondent reiterated its arguments in relation to the absence of a
direct expropriation, stressing that the Libyan authorities intended to expropriate the
land on which Olin was built, belonging to Mr Said Abughamja, and not Olin itself,

underlying the fact that such land was not a component of Olin’s investment.?>

149. The Respondent further developed its view that the transfer of the land owned by Mr
Said Abughamja to the Libyan State between 2007 and 2011 had no effect on Olin and
its investment, and therefore could not amount to an indirect expropriation. According
to the Respondent, when an investor has “free choice of the economic strategy”,
pursues its “daily management of the operations”, has “access to the benefits generated
by the operations” and is granted “freedom of movement for the managers and the
employees in the absence of occupation, requisition, eviction from the site”, it cannot
avail itself from an indirect expropriation. In particular, Libya argued that the Claimant
failed to prove that it had suffered a “substantial”, “serious” and “severe”
infringement, and failed to prove that it had lost the entire control over its investment,

concluding that there can be no indirect expropriation in the circumstances.°°

150. The Respondent finally reiterated its position that the Expropriation Order was not
illegal since it had a public purpose,” was not discriminatory,’* and was in compliance
with due process of law.°? The Respondent confirmed that Olin was neither forced to
cease its activities, nor was it obliged to destroy its factory, to remove its materials and
equipment, or ultimately to reorganise its activity on another site, and therefore that no

compensation had to be paid by the host State in the circumstances.'°°
B) The Arbitral Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision

151, Asastarting point for its analysis, the Tribunal sets out below Article 7.1 of the Cyprus-

153. In the following paragraphs, the Tribunal will first proceed to determine whether Libya
has expropriated Olin’s foreign investment, or imposed on Olin’s foreign investment

measures having an effect equivalent to expropriation.

154, The Tribunal refers to Article 1 of the Expropriation Order, issued by the GPCO in
October 2006 that defined the expropriated land on which Olin’s factory was built as
“the property on aerial map No. 13-52 located between the employee housing project
and [Al-Sawani] Road, People’s Congress of Bab [Akkara] Municipality, Tripoli
district”.'°' This Order was notified to Olin by way of an evacuation order dated 12

November 2006 (see paragraph 157 below).

155, The evidence on record shows that steps were in fact taken to formally execute the 2006
Expropriation Order when the property title of the land on which Olin’s factory was
built was transferred to the LIDCO on 30 May 2007'™ and Libya took active measures

to expel Olin from the premises, as further discussed below.'°

156. At the time, the land which was chosen for the location of the factory belonged to Mr
Said Abughamja and not to Olin, a fact admitted both by the Claimant and the
Respondent.'*4 However, in fine, the Tribunal considers that the Expropriation Order
necessarily entailed an expropriation of all buildings on the land in question. In
particular, the Tribunal notes the operative part of the Expropriation Order which
provided that the land was being expropriated “for the public interest to establish a

housing project”.'°

157. As such, the legal consequence of the 2006 Expropriation Order followed by the
transfer of the land to the LIDCO, necessarily implied the ultimate demolition and
relocation of Olin’s factory, as demonstrated by a number of eviction notices and letters
addressed to Olin directly between 2006 and 2011, and not to Mr Said Abughamja. In

particular, the Tribunal refers to the following exhibits:

 

101 Exhibit C-14, Decision No. 241 for 2006 of the GPCO dated 19 October 2006.

‘62 Exhibit C-118, Decision no. 157 for year 1375 from the Secretary of the Administrative Committee for Public
Property dated 30 May 2007.

the date of the notification.”

Olin dated 6 April 2010, stating the following:

“We hope that you would yacate the site as soon as possible and turn it over free of
persons within one week of this date and thereafter consult the Libyan Corporation

for Development and Investment to settle your financial status”.

Exhibit C-31, Eviction Notice from the General Authority for Public Property to
Olin dated 31 August 2010, reading as follows:

“We do hope from you that you evacuate the site on top urgent basis and deliver it
free of all obstacles and people within a week of today to the Libya Company for
Development and Investment with the financial settlement to your affairs with them

in case there is a compensation to be paid.”

- Exhibit C-127, Letter from the LFIB to Olin dated 2 September 2010, asking Olin
to contact the LFIB’s real estate department, stating that it had found a replacement
location for Olin, despite Olin’s notification on 31 August 2010 that the
Expropriation Order had been cancelled by a decision of the Tripoli Court of Appeal
dated 13 April 2010.16

158. During the period which followed the issuance of the 2006 Expropriation Order, and

the successive eviction notices sent to Olin as outlined above, Olin was effectively

-44-

deprived of the guarantee of an unfettered ownership of its investment. Olin further

substantially lost control of its ability to properly conduct and plan its business.

159.  Olin’s ability to conduct its business under normal conditions was impeded by Libya in
multiple aspects, as further outlined in the Tribunal’s analysis on FET in Section 11
below. The Tribunal specifically refers to the following evidence from November 2006

and onwards:

- Evidence showing the demolitions around Olin’s factory and the impact that such
demolitions had on Olin’s operations, notably in terms of electricity and water cuts
and temporary loss of access to the sewage system (as documented in Olin’s letter
to the LFIB dated 6 December 2006;!°’ LFIB’s letter to the Tripoli Branch of the
Libyan General Electric Corporation dated 10 December 2006; and the
compilation of Olin's Internal Destruction Reports for 2008 due to Electricity
Cuts).!0°

- Decision of the Libyan authorities in mid-February 2008 to create a committee
(composed of the Ministry of Industry and Mines, the Ministry of Economy and
Trade and the General Authority For Housing & Utilities), “for the purpose of
discussing with [Olin] the terms of [its] eviction”, including the identification of a
replacement location and the payment of adequate compensation, neither of which

ultimately led to any concrete result.'!°

160. Thus, while Olin managed to avoid the destruction of its factory and did not totally
interrupt its activities, it is undeniable that the repeated requests for relocation and
demolition, combined with other Libyan measures listed at paragraph 159,
significantly impacted Olin’s business, undermined its ability to plan for the future and

paralysed its activities.'!!

transparency created by the Expropriation Order and Libya's conflicting, inconsistent statements and positions

161. The Tribunal therefore considers that the issuance of the Expropriation Order combined
with the events that followed severely impaired the use and enjoyment of Olin’s

investment.

162. The Tripoli Court of Appeal in its decision of 13 April 2010 recognized that Olin, as a
foreign investor, was directly concerned by the 2006 Expropriation Order and
proceeded to invalidate it on the basis that it violated the Libyan Investment Law, in

the following terms:!!?

Since the Appellant project falls within the area included in the appealed resolution

No. 266 of 2006, the body that expropriated the property should have conducted an on-

site survey to determine the facts of the property where structures were ished,

including the appellant's project. Also, this body should have referred to the provisions

of Law No. 5 of 1426 on promoting foreign capital investments, particularly Article 23

which stipulates specific restrictions for a specific case. Therefore, it becomes clear
led resol;

that the two r ions are in violation of the law, rendering it imperative to.

first, halt their ion and, second. cancel their content. (emphasis added)

163. Notwithstanding that the Tripoli Court of Appeal decision had cancelled the 2006
Expropriation Order, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant continued to receive eviction
notices after the decision was rendered. The Tribunal refers to the eviction notice of 31
August 2010 (Exhibit C-31) and the LFIB’s letter of 2 September 2010 requesting Olin
to relocate its factory (Exhibit C-127) despite Olin’s prior notification to the LFIB on
31 August 2010 that the Expropriation Order had been cancelled (Exhibit C-126). The
Tribunal therefore concludes that the Tripoli Court of Appeal’s decision issued in April
2010 cannot be deemed to have put an immediate end to the effects of the 2006

Expropriation Order.'!>

in the years following the order prevented Olin from committing to production levels over the long term, resulting
in abandonment of new investments, the underutilization of Olin’s machines, and stoppages in production.”

Juices and Candy Juice; Exhibit C-166, Presentation from Memac Ogilvy “Olin status 2006-2007" dated 22 May

Olin on 5 December 2016, showing that Libya initiated court proceedings against Olin to challenge the 2010

-46-

164, The Tribunal instead considers that the /egal effects of the Expropriation Order ceased
on 15 June 2011, when the Libyan authorities transferred back title to the land to Said
Abughamja, thus enabling Olin to give effect to the Land Sales Contract concluded
earlier on 31 October 2007 between Mr Said Abughamja and Olin (see paragraph 104
in the Factual Background). ''4 Accordingly, Libya’s measures that followed the
registration of the land on 15 June 2011 are analysed in more detail under Section 11

below.

165. In assessing the overall impact of the Expropriation Order on Olin’s investment, the
Tribunal is of the view that State measures, even if temporary, can have an effect
equivalent to expropriation if their length and impact on the investment are sufficiently
important.'!> In the present case, the foregoing Libyan measures considerably impaired
Olin’s investment between November 2006 and June 2011, which is a significant period
of time for a business that had just started its operations. These measures coincided with
Olin accumulating a negative cash flow of LYD 18,8 million during the period between

2006 and 2010 (Olin’s losses are discussed in more detail in Section 12 below).

166. Indeed, the Tribunal is convinced that owing to the.delays in the launch of Olin’s
products and its inability to realise the benefits of its investment during the four years
and a half of uncertainty that followed the application of the 2006 Expropriation Order,
Olin was overtaken by its competitors on the Libyan market and had lost the advantage
of being one of the first entrants as a local private producer.''® Therefore, Olin bore the

economic consequences of Libyan’s expropriation measures beyond 2011.

Libyan Court decision cancelling the Expropriation Order. Given that the challenge was initiated after Olin’s
cessation of activities in 2015, and given that the Tribunal has no information about the outcome of such challenge,
the Tribunal has decided not to draw any conclusion from this decision while analyzing the issue of the breach of
Article 7. The 2016 Appeal will be dealt with under Section 11 below, dealing with the issue of the alleged breach
of Article 2.2 of the Cyprus-Libya BIT, describing the State’s obligation to ensure FET of foreign investors’
investments.

"4 Exhibit C-55, Land Sale Contract between Said Abughamja and Olin Holdings dated 31 October 2007. See
also explanations in Hearing Transcript, Volume III, pages 611 to 624.

"5 See e.g., SD Myers v. Canada, Partial Award (13 November 2000), paras 283-284: “An expropriation usually
amounts to a lasting removal of the ability of an owner to make use of its economic rights although it may be that,

in some contexts and cil it would be appropriate to view a depi as fo.an
expropriation, even if it were partial or temporary”.

16 In FTI's First Expert Report, para 3.24, in which the Experts describe the following: “After just afew years of
local production, three local producers (Al Mazraa, Judi and Al Rayhan) together controlled approximately 65%
of the Libyan juice market. Two of these market leaders, Judi and Al Mazraa, started producing locally in 2006-
2007, when Olin had intended to. Al Rayhan started only one or two years earlier. In contrast, Olin, which had
to delay the launch of its products, limit its marketing expenses and was confronted with distribution difficulties

170.

Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that the issuance of the 2006
Expropriation Order combined with Libya’s measures that followed had an effect
equivalent to an expropriation of Olin’s foreign investment. Following this
determination, the second step is for the Tribunal to determine whether the Respondent
complied with the conditions for a lawful expropriation, imposed by the Cyprus-Libya

BIT and the Libyan Investment Law.

¢ Claimant’s contention that the 2006 Expropriation Order was not for the
public interest
The Tribunal has noted the Respondent’s contention that the 2006 Expropriation Order
was issued for the purpose of proceeding with the urban development of the Al Fallah
zone and the modernization of its public utilities, including water supply, electric
power, sewage and roads.'!’ The Tribunal has further reviewed the evidence submitted
by the Claimant in support of its allegation that the 2006 Expropriation Order was not
driven by a public purpose and that Libya’s true motive was “to give the land to LIDCO
to develop high-yield luxury apartments”, “designed for Tripoli’s wealthiest

residents”.''*

The Tribunal considers, however, that the Parties failed to adduce sufficiently
compelling evidence allowing it to make a conclusive finding regarding the public
purpose nature of Libya’s project in the Al Fallah zone. The Tribunal will accordingly
determine whether Libya’s expropriatory measures were illegal by reference to the

remaining criteria provided for under Article 7 of the BIT.

© Claimant’s contention that the expropriation was not in accordance with due

process of law

Evidence shows that on 12 November 2006, Mr Akram Abughamja received an
eviction order from the Tripoli’s People Committee for Housing & Utilities informing

him that his factory had been “dispossessed” and requesting Olin to vacate the premises

within 3 days.!!? The Claimant argues that it is only then that Olin became aware of the
Expropriation Order, '?° issued by the GPCO on 19 October 2006, which expropriated
a parcel of land along the Tripoli Airport Road, including Olin’s factory.'?! The

Respondent did not challenge these facts nor submit evidence to the contrary.

171. The Tribunal refers in this regard to Article 23 of the Libyan Investment Law (cited at
paragraph 152),'”? which provides that a foreign investment cannot be expropriated
without a law or judicial decision, The Tribunal, having examined the 2006
Expropriation Order, concurs with the Tripoli Court of Appeal’s observations in its

2010 decision that:

“The ion under appeal [i.e. the Expropriation Order] is neither a law nor a

I I

judicial ruling. Rather, it is an ‘ative issued by the General People’s
Cc ittee and does not have jurisdiction in the matter according to Article 23 of Law
No. 5 of 1426 regarding the promotion of foreign capital ii The ap d
resolution is therefore not valid for lack of jurisdiction: the function of legislative power
to issue a law as stated in Article 23 mentioned above, which is the function of the
General People’s Congress; and the function of judicial power to issue judicial ruling
as stated in Article 23 mentioned above, which is the function of the courts. The entity
that issued the resolution under appeal did not only usurp one power, but also usurped
the functions of two powers through just one administrative resolution. It is a given
according to jurisprudence and justice that the lack of jurisdiction in the form of
usurpation of power is a virtual attack of one authority against another” (emphasis

added), !23

172. The Tribunal concludes that by failing to comply with the provisions of its Investment
Law with regard to the procedural requirements in Article 23 of the Libyan Investment
Law, Libya did not comply with its obligation to ensure that the 2006 Expropriation

Order was issued in accordance with due process of law.

© Claimant’s contention that the expropriation was discriminatory

173. The Tribunal notes that both the Cyprus-Libya BIT and the Libyan Investment Law of
1997 provide that an expropriation decision should not discriminate against the foreign

investor.

174. For reasons developed in more detail in Section 10 below, the Tribunal considers that

the Expropriation Order is discriminatory.

© Claimant’s contention that the expropriation was not taken against prompt,

adequate, and effective compensation

175, The Tribunal refers to Article 7.2 of the Cyprus-Libya BIT according to which the
amount of compensation for expropriation “shall amount to the fair market value of the
investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation or impending
expropriation became publicly known, whichever is the earlier (hereinafter referred to

as the ‘valuation date’).”

176. The Tribunal has noted the Claimant’s contention that the Libyan authorities did not
find an alternative location nor compensate Olin for expropriatory measures, evidenced
notably by a series of letters sent by Olin to the LFIB and the General Organization for

Housing and Utilities.'*4

177. The Tribunal has also noted the judgment of the South Tripoli Court dated 14 February
2014, ruling that Olin failed to prove the harm it had suffered as a result of the cancelled

Expropriation Order, and consequently, that no indemnification was due.!?5

Ss

The Tribunal considers that by allowing Olin to register title over the land on which it
was built in 2011, Libya has put an end to the legal effects of the Expropriation Order,
which obviates the need to compensate Olin for the fair market value of the land

expropriated as per Article 7.2 of the Cyprus-Libya BIT.

It remains however that there was no prompt nor effective compensation in compliance
with Article 7 of the BIT, since the Claimant’s investment was affected by measures
equivalent to expropriation without any compensation for more than four years.
Furthermore, the Expropriation Order was issued in breach of due process!?6 and on a
discriminatory basis,'?7 as underlined above, thereby causing harm to the Claimant’s

investment that has not been compensated.

Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal therefore finds that Libya’s expropriatory
measures were not in compliance with the conditions for a lawful expropriation listed
in Article 7 of the Cyprus-Libya BIT.

The Tribunal accordingly concludes that the expropriatory measures implemented by
Libya between November 2006 and June 2011 were in breach of Article 7 of the
Cyprus-Libya BIT.

. ISSUE NO, 2: HAS LIBYA FAILED TO GRANT OLIN’S INVESTMENT THE NATIONAL.

TREATMENT THAT WAS AFFORDED TO LIBYAN INVESTORS UNDER ARTICLE 3 OF THE
CYPRUS-LIBYA BIT?

A)

182.

Summary of the Parties’ Positions

i, The Claimant

The Claimant relies on Article 3 of the Cyprus-Libya BIT to “National Treatment and
Most Favoured Nation Treatment” and maintains that Libya was required to accord
Olin and its investment a “treatment no less favourable than that which Libya accords
to domestic investors and investments in accordance with its bilateral investment

treaties with third States. "'8

 

'26 See above paragraphs 170 to 172.
'27 See above paragraphs 173-174,
28 Claimant's SoC at para 101.

-SI-

183. The Claimant supports its position by referring to Libya’s alleged discriminatory
expropriatory measures when compared with the treatment accorded to Olin’s local
competitors. It argues that discrimination is generally understood by tribunals to mean
“not based on justifiable distinctions or arbitrary”,'”° and that “tribunals generally

analyze whether a‘claimant is “similarly situated” to its comparators.”'*° ”

184. In the present case, the Claimant asserts that “there can be no doubt that Olin was
similarly situated to OKBA and Al-Aseel such that Libya's differential treatment of Olin
had no rational justification whatsoever”.'>! The Claimant explains that “OKBA and
Al-Aseel are competitors operating in the same business and economic sector as Olin,
namely the dairy and juice market in Libya.” The Claimant adds that “not only OKBA
and Al-Aseel are in the same business sector as Olin, but also they are physically
located in the same Fallah industrial area—the OKBA factory adjoins Olin’s own,
while the Al-Aseel factory is only a few hundred meters away”.'3?

185. Having argued that the Claimant, OKBA and Al-Aseel are all similarly situated, the
Claimant goes on to say that Libya treated Olin less favourably than OKBA and Al-
Aseel by exempting the local factories from the Expropriation Order but refusing to
extend the same treatment to Olin.!*? The Claimant states that Libya’s own factual
exhibits show that the GPCO granted OKBA and Al-Aseel factories “unequivocal,
permanent exemptions from the Expropriation Order”.'*4 In response to Libya’s
argument that Olin’s factory was not demolished and remains onsite today, the
Claimant stresses that Olin remained in a state of uncertainty regarding its fate and that
“[t]here is no factual basis for Libya's assertion that Olin was either officially or de

facto exempted from the expropriation, ">> The Claimant adds that “Libya's inability to

submit such evidence stands in stark contrast to the exhibits that Libya in fact submitted in
this arbitration, namely unequivocal, permanent exemptions granted by Libya to the

government-owned OKBA factory and the privately-owned, Libyan Al-Aseel factory”.6

The Claimant finally sates that “Libya cannot show that it had legitimate reasons that
justified the difference in treatment or that the disparate treatment of exempting OKBA
and Al-Aseel but not Olin from the Expropriation Order bears a reasonable
relationship to rational policies not motivated by preference of domestic over foreign

owned investments ”.!7

For these reasons, the Claimant considers that Libya’s treatment of Olin violated Article

3 of the BIT, entitled “National Treatment and Most Favoured Nation Treatment”.!35

ii, The Respondent

The Respondent contests the Claimant’s assertion that it was treated differently from
Al-Aseel or OKBA. The Respondent maintains that the Claimant was exempted from
the Expropriation Order, and that it was accorded a treatment which is, on the contrary,

more favourable than that which Libya accorded to its domestic investors.

The Respondent quotes the Claimant which admitted that “/w/ithin three days of Olin’s
receipt of the eviction notice, the Libyan army had destroyed several buildings and
homes next to the Olin factory and expelled thousands of occupants in the process, and
that [w]ithin three months, Libya had demolished the quasi totality of the Expropriated
area, leaving Olin’s factory as one of the few buildings standing. "°° The Respondent
relies on this statement to reaffirm that Olin’s factory was not demolished contrary to
most buildings in the expropriated area, which shows (according to the Respondent)

that the Olin was accorded a favourable treatment.

The Respondent further refers to several correspondence showing that the Libyan
public authorities officially supported Olin’s exemption from the Expropriation

Order. 4°

The Respondent also refers to a letter sent by Olin on 16 June 2009 to prove that the
factory was still on site. It argues that Olin “speaks only about future and hypothetic
damages in case it should move on another industrial zone”, quoting the following

passage from the aforementioned letter:

“As the expropriation of the company will cause us great material and moral
damages...the investor will support huge amounts for the implementation of the project
and its future extension...and the losses in terms of profits and costs of creation will

amount to the sum of LYD 23 million in case of evacuation and demolition.

The GPC agreed to exempt similar companies; we hope to benefit from an identical

treatment..."\4!

The Respondent adds that Olin itself admits in its SoC that it remained on the site, that
no reference is made to any transfer of its activity to another industrial site, that Olin
was not forced to stop its activity, nor dismantle its materials and equipment, nor re-

install such materials and equipment somewhere else.'4?

The Respondent thus considers that Olin’s plant has been exempted de facto from
expropriation contrary to most other plants that were demolished, and therefore that it
received FET similarly to OKBA and AI- Aseel.'*3

iii, The Parties’ Rebuttal Arguments

The Claimant considers that there is no factual basis for Libya’s assertion that it was

either officially or de facto exempted from the expropriation.

Regarding the existence of an official exemption, the Claimant states that Libya cannot
point to “an exemption that would have reassured Olin that its investment was safe

from expropriation and demolition, because none was ever issued."

The Claimant further rejected Libya’s argument regarding a de facto exemption,
underlining that “Libya’s argument implies that a State may expropriate the title to the
property upon which an investment sits, openly and repeatedly threaten a foreign
investor with dismantling and dislocation, paralyze its production, cause it to sustain
significant losses, and yet remain shielded from liability under the guise that it ‘de
facto’ exempted the investor from ultimate dispossession or permitted it to carry on a

minimum level of operations to simply survive.”

The Claimant finally referred to the decision of the Tripoli Court of Appeal decision of
2010, cancelling the Expropriation Order, which acknowledged that the GPCO took
“no action at all” to exempt Olin from the illegal Expropriation Order.'45 The Claimant
further refer to Libya’s initiation of legal proceedings before the Libyan Supreme Court
to appeal the Tripoli Court of Appeal’s judgment that had cancelled the Expropriation
Order in 2010, more than six years after its issuance.'#° This in itself, according to the

Claimant, clearly belies the Respondent’s exemption claims.'4”

The Claimant concluded in its Reply that the GPCO’s implementation of the

expropriation was patently discriminatory."

In its Rejoinder, the Respondent reiterated its position as set out in its SoD, stating that
Olin had never been forced to relocate and therefore that it was protected by the Libyan

authorities, similarly to Al Aseel and OKBA factories.!"°

B) The Arbitral Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision

Jaimant’s Reply at para 85. According to the Claimant, Libya’s inability to submit such evidence “stands in

stark contrast to the exhibits that Libya in fact submitted in this arbitration, namely unequivocal, permanent
exemptions granted by Libya to the government-owned OKBA factory and the privately-owned, Libyan Al-Aseel
factory”.

The Tribunal cites, for ease of reference, Articles 3.1 and 3.2 of the Cyprus-Libya BIT:

1. Once a Contracting Party has admitted an investment in its territory in accordance
with its laws and i it shall accord to such investment made by ii of
the other Contracting Party treatment not less favourable than that accorded to
of its own investors or of investors of any third State, whichever is more
favourable to the investor concerned.
2. Each Contracting Party shall _in_its territory accord to_investors_of the other
Contracting Party, as regards to their use,
xpansion_or disposal of their i treatment not less favourable than that

accorded to its own investors or to investors of any third State, whichever is more

favourable to the investors concerned (emphasis added).

 

In its analysis of whether Libya has breached Article 3 of the Cyprus-Libya BIT, the
Tribunal will thus address the issue of whether Libya accorded to Olin a treatment less
favourable than that which it accorded to its domestic investors, namely OKBA and AI-

Aseel.

In Total S.A. v. Argentine Republic, the tribunal considered that a discriminatory
treatment can be demonstrated if the investor proves that the State has been treating

differently persons who are similarly situated. In essence, the tribunal found that:

“In order to determine whether treatment is discriminatory, it is necessary to compare
the treatment challenged with the treatment of persons or things in_a comparable
situation, In economic matters the criterion of “like situation” or “similarly-situated”
is widely followed because it requires the existence of some competitive relation
between those situations compared that should not be distorted by the State's
intervention against the protected foreigner. This is inherent in the very definition of
the term “discrimination” under general international law that: “Mere differences of
treatment do not necessarily itute discrimination...discrimination may in general
be said to arise where those who are in all material respects the same are treated
differently, or where those who are in material respects different are treated in the same
way.” [R. Jennings, A. Watts (eds.), Oppenheim’s International Law, 9th ed. (Longman,
1992), Vol. I, p. 378]. (emphasis added). The elements that are at the basis of likeness

-56-

vary depending on the legal context in which the notion has to be applied and the

specific circumstances of any individual case. ”'>°

203. Accordingly, if the Claimant can prove that it was treated less favourably than a person
similarly situated, then there would be discriminatory treatment, unless the Respondent

can prove that such different treatment was justified.'*!

204. In its assessment of the alleged breach of Article 3 of the Cyprus-Libya BIT in the

present case, the Tribunal has therefore to answer three questions:
(1) Has the Claimant proved that Olin, OKBA and Al-Aseel are similarly situated?

(2) Has the Claimant proved that Libya treated Olin less favourably than OKBA and
Al-Aseel?

(3) If the answer to these two questions is yes, has the Respondent proved that the

difference in treatment is justified?

e Has the Claimant proved that Olin, OKBA and Al-Aseel are similarly

situated?

205. The Tribunal notes that Olin, OKBA and Al-Aseel operate in the same business sector,
namely the dairy and juice market in Libya. This fact which was put forward by the

Claimant,'52 was not contested by the Respondent.'*

206. Olin, OKBA and Al-Aseel are also very closely situated on the map of Tripoli, in the

same industrial zone.!*4

207. The fact that these factories operated in the same business sector is, in the Tribunal’s

view an appropriate comparator,'®> reinforced by the existence of a similar location.

In response to the first question identified at paragraph 204 above, the Tribunal
therefore determines that Olin, OKBA and Al-Aseel are similarly situated.

¢ Has the Claimant proved that Libya treated Olin less favourably than OKBA
and Al-Aseel?

The Claimant considers that Olin was never formally exempted from expropriation,
contrary to OKBA and Al-Aseel, and therefore that Olin was treated differently and

less favourably than its national competitors.

It is uncontested by both Parties that OKBA and Al-Aseel were formally exempted
from any demolition and were allowed to remain on-site permanently.'°° The Parties

however differ on whether Olin’s factory was likewise exempted from expropriation. '%7

As explained above, the Tribunal finds that Olin did not receive a formal and official
expropriation exemption from the GPCO, similar to the ones accorded to its two
national competitors. Such exemption would have given Olin the assurance that the
land on which its factory was erected would not be expropriated, nor would its building
risk destruction. In the Tribunal’s assessment, the fact that Olin’s factory was not
ultimately demolished or relocated does not justify a departure from the treatment
accorded to OKBA and Al-Aseel.

Notwithstanding that Olin’s operational license was continuously renewed until April
2017, and that some evidence on record suggests that the Libyan authorities did support
Olin’s requests for a formal exemption, the fact remains that such actions co-existed
with other State measures which clearly demonstrated that Libya was adamant to
execute the 2006 Expropriation Order until June 2011. The Tribunal notably refers to
the various eviction notices and letters addressed to Olin by the Libyan authorities as

quoted in Section 9 above,'** together with the uncontested evidence that title to the

186 See Claimant’s SoC at para 104 and Respondent’s SoD at paras 95-97. In support of this argument. the
Claimant submitted a letter from the GPCO dated 22 July 2008, enabling Al-Aseel to “instruct the competent
officials in the Corporation to keep the site of the project of Aseel Company for manufacturing food stuffs [...]
and not take any actions regarding the expropriation and exempt it from process of elimination for development,”

land on which Olin’s factory was built was transferred to the LIDCO from May 2007
to June 2011.

The Tribunal further acknowledges that the Libyan courts ultimately cancelled the
Expropriation Order in April 2010, and that the Claimant was able to register the land
on which Olin was erected under its name in June 2011. However, this was following
four years and half of uncertainty, during which a number of correspondence with the
Libyan authorities were exchanged, notices of evacuation were received, and court
proceedings had to be engaged. The evidence on record further shows that Libya
revived the threat of the Expropriation Order, by opening court proceedings against
Olin on 5 December 2016 to challenge the Libyan Court’s decision cancelling the

Expropriation Order.'*°

Against this background, the Tribunal finds that Olin was clearly operating in less
favourable circumstances than its competitor Al-Aseel, which received a formal and

definitive expropriation exemption from the Libyan Government as early as July 2008.

As regards OKBA, although the precise date on which the company was formally
exempted from expropriation is unknown to this Tribunal, both the Claimant and the
Respondent agree that the Libyan government exempted Al-Aseel and OKBA in similar
circumstances. The Tribunal, noting that Olin did not receive a formal and definitive
exemption from demolition and interference, similar to the ones accorded to OKBA
and to Al-Aseel, concludes that the Claimant was treated less favourably than its two

national competitors.
© Did the Respondent prove that the difference in treatment was justified?

In relation to this question, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent simply denied that
Olin was treated less favourably than the national investors OKBA and Al-Aseel. It did
not address, on an alternative basis, the issue of whether the different treatment
accorded to Olin was justified. Likewise, the Respondent did not submit any evidence

in this regard.

218.

The Tribunal therefore considers that the Respondent has failed to prove that the
difference between the treatment accorded to Olin and the treatment accorded to its
national competitors was justified. The Respondent has accordingly failed to discharge

its burden of proof in this regard.
* Conclusion

In light of the above, the Tribunal determines that Libya accorded to Olin’s investment
a treatment less favourable than that accorded to the investments of its own investors,
namely OKBA and Al-Aseel, and therefore breached Article 3 of the Cyprus-Libya
BIT.

TO ACCORD FET, FPS AND/OR BY IMPAIRING THE MANAGEMENT, MAINTENANCE, USE,
ENJOYMENT, AND EXPANSION OF OLIN’S INVESTMENT IN LIBYA WITH
UNREASONABLE AND DISCRIMINATORY MEASURES?

219.

In this section the Tribunal will contemplate the alleged breaches addressed by the
Claimant under Article 2.2 of the Cyprus-Libya BIT, namely: (1) Libya’s failure to
accord Olin FET, (2) Libya’s failure to accord Olin FPS and (3) Libya’s impairment of

 

the . use, enj and ion of Olin’s investment in

Libya with unreasonable and discriminatory measures.

(1) Has Libya failed to accord Olin FET?

A) Summary of the Parties’ Positions

220.

221.

i, The Claimant

The Claimant argues that Libya’s conduct, through the issuance of the Expropriation
Order in October 2006 and the events which followed, breached its obligation to accord
Olin FET by (1) frustrating Olin’s legitimate expectations, (2) inflicting a constant
climate of uncertainty upon Olin, (3) failing to act in a transparent manner, (4) harassing
Olin, (5) failing to treat Olin in accordance with due process and denying justice to

Olin, and (6) discriminating against Olin.

1. Frustration of Olin’s legitimate expectations

The Claimant argues that the Expropriation Order issued in 2006 by the Libyan

authorities in and of itself constituted a breach of the FET standard.

-60-

222. The Claimant contends that since the Tecmed v. Mexico decision which was “the first
decision to spell out that FET treatment encompasses protections of expectations 7,160
tribunals have consistently found that protection of an investor’s legitimate

expectations is part of the FET standard.'®!

223. The Claimant further relied on the Thunderbird v. Mexico award, arguing that the
following questions are relevant for determining whether a host State breached the FET

standard by frustrating an investor’s legitimate expectations:
(i) Did the host State’s conduct create legitimate expectations on the part of the
investor?
(ii) Did the investor rely on the State’s conduct at the time it invested?
(iii) Did the host State subsequently fail to honor the expectations it created?!
224. In the present case, the Claimant contends that Libya frustrated its legitimate
expectations by issuing an expropriation order despite the enactment of Investment Law

of 1997, which gives sufficient assurances to foreign investors that reliable investments

can be made in Libya. The Claimant accordingly argues that:

However, the legitimate expectations of the investors have generally been considered central in the definition of
FET, whatever its scope. There is an overwhelming trend to consider the touchstone of fair and equitable
treatment to be found in the legitimate and reasonable expectations of the Parties, which derive from the
obligation of good faith”).

‘62 Claimant's SoC at para 89, citing CL-65. International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. The United
Mexican States, UNCITRAL, Final Award, Jan. 26, 2006, at para 147 (“the concept of ‘legitimate expectations’

relates, within the context of the NAFTA framework, to a situation where a Contracting Party’s conduct creates
reasonable and justifiable expectations on the part of an investor (or investment) to act in reliance on said conduct,
such that a failure by the NAFTA Party to honour those expectations could cause the investor (or investment) to
suffer damages”).

 

-61-

(i) By liberalizing its economy, enacting the Libyan Investment Law in 1997 and
making numerous public statements in subsequent years, Libya created a
legitimate expectation on Olin’s part that it would not be expropriated without

a valid cause and without a law or judicial decision.

(ii) The legal rights granted under the investment framework and various assurances
made by top governmental officials in Libya regarding the treatment of foreign

investments were fundamental to Olin’s decision to invest in Libya.

(iii) | Libya failed to honor the expectations it created by enacting an Expropriation
Order which did not comply with the provisions of the Libyan Investment

Law. '83

225. Overall, the Claimant therefore considers that Libya’s issuance of the Expropriation

Order frustrated Olin’s legitimate expectation and thus breached the FET standard.!**

2. Infliction of a climate of uncertainty

226. According to the Claimant, it is well established that the stability of an investment and
its business framework are important components of the FET standard, as they
are “directly linked to the investor’s legitimate expectations”!

227. The Claimant argues that before the 2006 Expropriation Order, Olin invested over LYD
12 million (over USD 9 million at the historical exchange rate) to build its production
plant in Libya. It also hired qualified personnel, to help with the finalization of the
factory’s construction and then with its operation. Several employees were thereafter

sent by Olin to train with Candia in France,!® and contacted various distributors with

the goal of creating an exclusive distributor network throughout the country.'®

228. The Claimant alleges that after the issuance of the Expropriation Order in November

2006, “the legal uncertainty that plagued Olin’s investment for years severely affected

its relationship with all of its commercial partners or competitors”.'% It states that the
Expropriation Order “ushered a five-year era of doubt, anxiety, confusion, and
paralysis for Olin and its management, which was largely due to the Libyan authorities’
erratic and inconsistent behavior”.'® Notably, the Claimant contends that while some
Libyan authorities supported Olin’s request for an expropriation exemption,!”° and
regularly renewed Olin’s operational license until April 2017,'7! Libya dragged Olin
into protracted and fruitless discussions of a possible relocation and compensation;!7*
transferred legal title to the land to the LIDCO in 2007;!” and repeatedly attempted to
evict Olin from the land in question even after the cancellation of the Expropriation
Order by the Tripoli Court of Appeal.'4

229. The Claimant further argues that the demolitions around the plant had a significant
impact on the Claimant’s activities because they resulted in power cuts as well as loss
of access to water and sewage leading to several production stoppages during 2007 and
2008,!75

230. As examples of impaired management, Olin puts forward the following:

- Olin was unable to secure exclusive distribution agreements with capable partners,

who were deterred from doing business with Olin due to a lack of assurance

176

regarding Olin’s stability and the abundance of its supply.

 

- Because Olin did not know from one day to the next whether it would survive the
Expropriation Order, it could not extend a credit line to its customers which
frustrated them and made them less inclined to purchase Olin’s products.'77 Olin’s

ability to secure payment instruments from its bank was also affected.'”8

Olin lost access to preferential terms from its suppliers, which felt that Olin’s long-

term survival was uncertain due to the illegal expropriation and its aftermath.'”?

-  Olin’s competitors took advantage of the situation. Olin’s direct competitors in
Libya perpetuated the belief in the marketplace that Olin was going to be out of
business soon. As of late, Candia’s Tunisian franchisee even commenced importing
Candia UHT milk illegally to meet the demand that Olin was forced to leave
unfulfilled.'®°

- In addition to these difficulties, Olin also struggled to retain its best-qualified
employees, including employees that Olin had sent to train with Candia, because of
the doubts as to Olin’s fate.'8! The Expropriation Order also made it very difficult

for Olin to convince new employees to join.!*?

231. Consequently, the Claimant maintains that Libya breached the FET standard through

the infliction of a climate of uncertainty on Olin.!®>

3. Lack of transparency

232. The Claimant asserts that transparency requires that investors are informed of decisions
before they are imposed on investors.!** The Claimant relied on a number of arbitral
decisis d ing that the obligation to act in a P manner towards

foreign investors is part of the FET standard.'*>

233. The crux of the Claimant’s argument regarding lack of transparency is that the GPCO
never notified Olin of its decision to issue an Expropriation Order on 19 October
2006.'8

234. The Claimant contends that Olin’s general manager, Mr Akram Abughamja, first
discovered military officers painting the word “removal’'’’ on the walls of Olin’s

factory and all adjacent buildings in early November 2006.

235. The Claimant contents that it only became aware of the Expropriation Order on 12
November 2006, a month after its issuance, when the Tripoli’s People Committee for
Housing and Utilities informed Olin that its factory had already been “dispossessed”
and that Olin had three days to vacate the premises.'8*

236. Likewise, the Claimant’s asserts that the GPCO revised the Expropriation Order in
November 2006, without informing Olin of the changes in complete disregard of due

process of law.'8°

237. The Claimant concludes that this conduct, combined with other acts of mistreatment of
Olin,'”° together constitute a breach of Libya’s obligation to act in a transparent manner

and therefore of its obligation to afford it FET.

4. Harassment

238. According to the Claimant, “the LFIB appears to have embarked on a personal crusade
against Olin since 2013”,'°' and in a “harassment campaign against Olin in retaliation

for the commencement of this arbitration”.'°?

() ‘The LFIB refused to allow Olin to import a new production line

239. According to the Claimant, the LFIB first refused to issue a customs clearance that
would have allowed Olin to import a new production line that it had purchased from
Combibloc. Olin contends that such production line would have enabled it to “maximize
and develop the productivity of the company”. The LFIB, however, failed to formally
authorize the importation of this new production line'®> and Olin was ultimately left

with no choice but to cancel its contract with Combibloc in early 2015.!%

240. The'Claimant contends that as a consequence, the equipment never cleared customs,

and Olin was ultimately forced to return the Combibloc equipment to the seller.!5

241. The Claimant alleges that the LFIB consistently prevented Olin from managing its

 

investment by “repeatedly refusing to allow Olin to repatriate its profits to Cyprus

242. Olin asserts that it wrote to the LFIB several times asking it to communicate with Sahara
bank, so that Olin could repatriate the profits it generated in 2010, 2012, and 2013, but
the LFIB failed to do so,'%’ although it used to cooperate with Olin for the repatriation

of its profits in the previous years.'°8

243. The Claimant further explains that following its adoption of a resolution to repatriate a
total of LYD 1.38 million on 18 September 2014,'%? Olin asked the LFIB to write to
Sahara Bank (BNP Paribas’s Libyan correspondent) on 11 January 2015, and then again
on 29 June 2015, so that Olin could repatriate its profits.?°° According to the Claimant,

however, Olin has not received any response from the LFIB to date.?°!

(iii) The LFIB refused to assist Olin in accessing foreign currency

244. The Claimant further contends that for more than a year, the LFIB “prevented Olin
from accessing foreign currency, an essential element of its operation since it allows it

to import raw materials and/or machines and equipment" 2°

245, The Claimant argues in this regard that it needed in 2015 a letter from the LFIB
certifying that Olin’s project was subject to the Libyan Investment Law and that Olin
was accordingly to be treated like a national company for the purpose of banking
transactions. Olin argues that this letter was necessary for it to obtain foreign currency
to import raw materials, machines and equipment, and the LFIB failed to issue such

certificate and did not coordinate with Olin’s bank.?

The LFIB sought Olin’s liquidation

According to the Claimant, Libya undertook several actions which were aimed towards

Olin’s liquidation:

(i) On 13 July 2016, the LFIB informed Olin that it would renew its operational

license for only four months;?04

(ii) The LFIB sent a separate letter to Olin informing it that its project had to be
liquidated in accordance with the Libyan Investment Law because Olin’s

cumulative losses since 2007 had been greater than 84% of its capital;?°°

(iii) | The LFIB then agreed to a short-time renewal of Olin’s license to operate until
April 2017, contingent on Olin’s participation in the specific committee tasked
with inspecting Olin’s records. The LFIB thereafter refused to renew Olin’s

operational license in the absence of evidence of additional capital injected;?°

(iv) _ Libya’s authorities’ determination to destroy Olin’s investment is confirmed by
recent proceedings which Libya has commenced against Olin before the Libyan

Supreme Court.?°”

The Claimant therefore concludes that “Libya’s continued mistreatment of Olin without
any explanation constitutes a clear case of harassment which the FET standard

prohibits. °°

5. Lack of due process and denial of justice
The Claimant has also raised the issue of denial of justice and lack of due process before
the Libyan national courts, a protection which it contends falls within the scope of the
FET standard set out at Article 2(2) of the Cyprus-Libya BIT.”

In advancing such argument, the Claimant relied on the definition of denial of justice

as an “improper administration of civil and criminal justice as regards an alien,

including denial of access to courts, inadequate procedures, and unjust decisions”2?'°
The Claimant further refers to Professor Alwyn Freeman, the author of the first
comprehensive study on denial of justice, who considers that denial of justice occurs
“whenever proceedings are permeated with judicial fraud, venality, and
corruption”?!

The Claimant argues that the South Tripoli Court (before which the Claimant has sought
compensation for the harm it had suffered as a result of the Expropriation Order
previously cancelled by the Tripoli Court of Appeal) conducted its proceedings without

any regard to due process of law and denied Olin justice, for a number of reasons.

First, the Claimant contends that it suffered undue delays before the South Tripoli Court
which systematically granted postponements, a situation which repeated itself at least

a dozen times over a period of nearly three years.?!

Second, according to the Claimant, during the last hearing before the Court held on 4
February 2014, the judge asked Olin’s legal representative “what good it would do him
to award Olin the substantial compensation that it had requested", thus making a

“barely-veiled solicitation of a bribe” to which Olin refused to answer2!>

Third, the Claimant contends that the content of the South Tripoli Court decision of 14
February 2014, which followed the hearing of 4 February 2014, constitutes an abusive
refusal to indemnify Olin for the harm it suffered because of the cancelled
Expropriation Order.?!* According to the Claimant, the South Tripoli Court “wholly
and unjustifiably ignored the impact of Libya's actions on Olin's ability to operate its
plant” and “based its shocking conclusion on the mere fact that Olin had obtained an
operational license from the LFIB in 2008 and allegedly was operating during the time
that the Expropriation Order was in place”.?'* Mr Akram Abughamja stated that it was

clear that “the judge issued this decision because [Olin] had refused his request for a

bribe” 2'6
254. According to the Claimant, contrary to Libya’s assertions:

- Free access to the courts is necessary but not sufficient to defend against a denial of

justice claim;

- Olin is not asking the Tribunal to sit as a court of appeal, but rather to consider the

procedural irregularities which led to an unfair decision; and

- The changes in political regime had no impact on the court’s functioning.?!”

255. The Claimant concludes that the aforementioned conduct constitutes a clear violation

of due process and therefore of the FET standard under the BIT.

6. Discrimination

256. The Claimant also considers that the FET standard encompasses an obligation not to
discriminate against a foreign investor, which it also alleges has been breached by the
Respondent.?!§ The issue of the discriminatory treatment of Olin is developed in more

detail in Section 8.D. below.

ii, The Respondent

257. The Respondent considers that it fulfilled its obligation to accord FET to Olin and

denies all the allegations advanced by the Claimant.

1. The alleged frustration of Olin’s legitimate expectations

258. The Respondent relies on the fact that Mr Abughamja is a Libyan national who engaged

in commercial activities in Libya prior to the period of nationalizations. For this reason,

216 CWS-1, First Witness Statement of Mr Akram Abughamja at para 49.

218 Claimant’s SoC at para 101: “This conduct also violated Libya's obligation to treat Olin and its investment
fairly and equitably, which is recognized to encompass the obligation not to discriminate”. The Claimant cites
the following legal authorities in support of this argument: CL-37, Rudolf Dolzer and Christoph H. Schreuer,
Principles Of International Investment Law (2° ed. 2012) at 144 (“[dJiscrimination against foreigners has been
regarded as an important indicator of failure to grant fair and equitable treatment"; see also CL-43, Biwater

the Respondent contends that Mr Abughamja must have had full knowledge of the
situation in Libya including the functioning of the Libyan institutions and the provisions
governing the sector of urbanization.?'? On this basis, the Respondent argues that Mr
Abughamja could not ignore the enactment of Law No. 3/2001 relating to the
urbanization and the conditions for obtaining parcels of lands for the implementation
of an industrial activity.?2°

Further, as stated earlier, the Respondent maintains that the Libyan authorities
exempted Olin from the Expropriation Order,?*! thereby defeating the Claimant’s
argument according to which Libya’s issuance of the Expropriation Order frustrated

Olin’s legitimate expectation and thus further breached the FET standard.

 

2. The alleged infliction ofa climate of inty and

The Respondent denies-that it inflicted a climate of uncertainty and ambiguity upon
Olin. It maintains that the Claimant’s operational licenses were continuously renewed
and that the map reproducing the demolitions in the Al-Fallah zone shows that Olin is
one of the few factories still standing to date. In summary, the Respondent raised the

following points in support of its position.

First, the Respondent argues that the fact that Olin was unable to secure exclusive
distribution agreements with capable partners is grounded on the Witness Statement of
Mr Abughamja and on a letter from Mr Al Majd (Olin’s distributor).?? The Respondent
doubts the validity of Mr Al Majd’s letter and contends that, in any case, such letter
does not show that the Expropriation Order had an impact on the Contract of
Distribution. 73

Second, the Respondent contests the Claimant’s affirmation that “Olin’s ability to
secure credit lines and payment instruments from its bank also was affected”.

According to the Respondent, this assertion is based on the same witness statement

219 Respondent’s SoD at para 34.
220 Id, at para 35.

221 Id. at para 92

 

“with the support of the LFIB, of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Investment, and of the

General Organization for Housing and Utilities, as reminded by the Claimant in its SoC, Olin as a foreign
company has immediately benefited from the expected exemption”.

mentioned above and on a letter from Sahara Bank BNP Paribas Group which “does
not underline any link with the Expropriation Order”. The document, as the
Respondent views it, simply requests Olin to provide a number of explanations
regarding certain sums that it had lost and other documents for a loan, including Olin’s

financial projections. All requests which the Respondent considers “quite normal”. >?

Third, the Respondent contests the fact that Olin lost access to preferential terms from
suppliers because of the Libyan government’s actions. Libya argues that the Witness
Statement of Mr Deher confirms the lack of experience of Olin in the field of dairy and
fruit juice products through strategic errors, notably the purchase of inadequate
equipment. The Respondent refers to paragraphs 16 and 17 of Mr Deher’s Witness
Statement, where he explains that the Candia team told Olin that it would have to
upgrade its equipment to Tetra Pak machines, and that “while Olin was not pleased to
learn it had to replace machines it had just purchased”, Olin agreed to “purchase a
demonstration model” 7?

Fourth, regarding Olin’s allegation that it “did not know from one day to the next
whether it would survive the Expropriation Order” and “could not extend a credit line
to its customers which upset them and made them less willing to purchase from Olin”,
the Respondent considers that the Claimant provides no evidence of this apart from the

Witness Statement of Mr Akram Abughamja.??

 

Fifth, regarding Olin’s allegation that “Olin’s itors took ads of the
situation” and that “Candia’s Tunisian franchisee has been importing Candia UHT
milk illegally to meet demand that Olin has been forced to leave unfulfilled”, the
Respondent argues that the Claimant attempts to integrate events which occurred
between April 2011 and April 2013 and which could potentially be the result of the
2011 Libyan Revolution rather than the result of an Expropriation Order of 2006, many
years before the facts.?27

Finally, regarding the adverse effect on Olin’s employees, the Respondent considers

that “the Claimant refrain[ed] fiom producing the personnel register including all

details about the number of employees, their nationality, their professional
qualification, the salary, and the period of employment”.**> Furthermore, the
Respondent considers that the Claimant’s assertion that it hired qualified personnel and
sent several employees to train with Candia in France is not supported by accounting
documents, airplane tickets, or by the required declaration to the competent Libyan

services, thereby rendering such assertions untrustworthy.?”°

3. The alleged lack of transparency

The Respondent, citing the decision in Middle East Cement Shipping & Handling Co
S.A (Greece) v. Egypt, admits that administrative decisions have to be notified to the

investor in order to be considered valid by an arbitral tribunal.?>!

The Respondent however contends that, in the present case, and contrary to the
Claimant’s assertions, the competent authorities notified Mr Abughamja of the
232

Expropriation Order “immediately after the issuance of the decision”,”*” therefore

upholding their obligations towards Olin.?>>

4. The alleged harassment

In its defense, Libya draws a line between the pre-Revolution period (i.e. pre-February
2011) and the post-Revolution period (i.e. post-February 2011), underlying the fact that
a number of actions or omissions imputed to Libya by the Claimant, are not the result
of Libya’s fault but rather from the chaos and trouble which was prevailing in the

country at the time.24

Moreover, Libya considers that it did not interfere with the management of Olin,
highlighting that Olin’s managers have kept their positions, have not been deprived of

the the company’s full management and have not been replaced by local managers.”*°

(i)

275.

The Respondent quotes Mr Akram Abughamja who states in his witness statement,
after describing his decision to purchase a new production line from Combibloc in
2012, that “/t/his line which costs EUR 1.5 million (with a down payment of 300,000
and the remainder payable over three years), was intended to expand our production
capacity...”.23° According to the Respondent, this declaration shows first that “six
years, after alleged great difficulties, harassment and pressure, the investor was still
running its investment and was able to decide to make new investment”. It accordingly
demonstrates that “/o/bviously, the investor was free to manage its investment, to make
decision and that he was confident” 257

Regarding the alleged refusal to allow Olin to import a new production line (i), the
alleged refusal to allow Olin to repatriate profits (ii), the alleged refusal to assist Olin

with accessing foreign currency (iii) and the alleged wilful provocation of Olin’s

 

liquidation (iv), the R dent raises the followit which are summarised

below.

The alleged refusal to allow Olin to import a new production line

In its SoD, Libya questions the veracity of the Claimant’s assertion that it was forced

to return the equipment and to cancel the contract with Combibloc in 2015.

The Respondent mainly argues that the cancellation agreement concluded between Olin
and Combibloc in January 2015 mentions that “Combibloc shall de-install the line and
retrieve all delivered equipment”. According to Libya, this sentence shows that the
Combibloc equipment was not retained by customs but in fact installed in Olin’s factory

and subsequently “de-installed”.?3*

The alleged refusal to allow Olin to repatriate profits

The Respondent accepts that it refused to allow Olin to repatriate profits but contends

that this was because such repatriation would have been illegal under Libyan law.

According to Libya, foreign investors may repatriate profits and capital invested in a

project only in the following cases:

(a) If the project comes to its end, or is under liquidation or assignment, or,

(b) If within the six months after the date of the investment, the investor has not

carried out the project because of external reasons not imputable to it.*°

As none of these conditions were satisfied, the Respondent argues that Olin could not

have been authorized to repatriate its profits and capital invested.

The alleged refusal to assist Olin with accessing foreign currency

While the Respondent did not answer the Claimant’s argument with regard to access to
foreign currency in its SoD or in its Rejoinder, it ultimately addressed this issue in its

Answers to the Tribunal’s Post-Hearing Questions.

In essence, Libya advanced that Olin had all of the necessary documentation and did
not need any additional documents from the LFIB. Libya further argued that “/t/he
Claimant does not refer to documents and letters which would have previously been
delivered by the LFIB for similar requests.’""'

Libya finally argued that Olin could have accessed foreign currency through its Cyprus

242

headquarters.

Olin’s liquidation

The Respondent considers that “nothing allows the Claimant to conclude, as it does,
that the LFIB is seeking Olin’s liquidation.”, and that “such an allegation is

groundless”.

According to the Respondent, such declaration is fully contradicted by the facts and if

Libya intended to “intimidate” or “punish” Olin, it could have done it earlier.

The Respondent adds that “the non-interrupted renewal of the license n° 020/2006
since November 2006” is the better proof that the Libyan authorities have provided FET

to Olin’s investment.24

In these circumstances, the Respondent considers that Olin’s liquidation was rather
caused by “Olin’s lack of diligence and prudence in the management of its project”.
The Claimant would have “incurred costs related to its business judgement irrespective
of an alleged breach of the fair and equitable treatment under the Cyprus-Libya BIT”,
and as such, Olin has “made decisions that increased the situation for which it bears
responsibility regardless of the treat given by the Libyan authorities to the

investment” 245

5. The alleged lack of due process and denial of justice
Regarding judicial due process, the Respondent finds surprising that the Claimant did
not directly initiate arbitral proceedings to obtain an immediate and efficient
decision.“” According to the Respondent, the investor, by bringing a claim before
Libyan courts, “decided to act as a Libyan national”, and in doing so, the Claimant
have renounced to the benefits deriving from its status of foreign investor. As any
Libyan investor, the Claimant had to go through the Libyan court system which implies
long proceedings.*"” In light of the fact that neither Olin’s managers nor its French
partners could have ignored the relief provided under the BIT, the Respondent
concludes that the Claimant should not take advantage of its own errors and/or
deliberate choices to claim now that it was mistreated by the Libyan courts and

especially by the judgment rendered in 2014.74

The Respondent further notes that the Claimant never initiated emergency proceedings
to put an end to the alleged harm and never claimed any compensation before the
administrative authorities, neither prior to the decision of the Tripoli Court of Appeal
of April 2010, nor after it.4

On the merits, Libya argues that the national judges rendered a reasoned decision based
on all the documents submitted by the Claimant and rightly concluded that there was
no damage resulting from the Expropriation Order, which is why Olin’s claim was
ultimately dismissed. Furthermore, according to the Respondent, the fact that the
Claimant waited eight years to file an arbitration claim in itself shows the lack of

damage.?©°

The Respondent adds that the recent accusations made by the Claimant against the
Libyan judge regarding bribery solicitation are groundless**! and not supported by valid
evidence.**? The Respondent therefore concludes that these accusations have the
obvious object to “take undue advantage of a denial of justice and of a breach of the

254

BIT”? in addition to being defamatory.

6. The alleged discriminatory treatment
As explained in more detail above, the Respondent considers that Olin beneficiated
from an exemption from the Expropriation Order, just like Al-Aseel and OKBA, thus

denying any discriminatory treatment of Olin (see Section 10 above).
iii, Parties’ Rebuttal Arguments

The Tribunal provides below additional important points raised by the Parties in

relation to the alleged harassment campaign against Olin from 2013 onwards.

Regarding the LFIB’s alleged refusal to allow Olin to import a new production line in
2013, the Respondent in its Answers to the Tribunal’s Post-Hearing Questions, further
questioned whether the Combibloc line was truly purchased by Olin and shipped to
Libya, arguing that the Claimant has not submitted any evidence in support of this

fact.255

In its Reply Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimant responded to this argument by submitting

the following documents relating to the purchase and shipment of the packaging line:?°°

a) a quote from Combibloc for a packaging line dated 14 June 2012;
b) amendment No. 2 to the Combibloc Contract dated 29 August 2012;

c) a commercial invoice of EUR 1,5 million from Combibloc for a packaging
line dated 1 April 2013 (indicating a down payment of USD 300 000);

d) a packing list for the Combibloc packaging line dated 1 April 2013;

e) a certificate of origin for the Combibloc packaging line (Germany) dated 10
April 2013 issued by the German Chamber of Commerce and legalized by
the Libyan Ministry of Foreign Affairs;

f) a certificate of marine insurance for the Combibloc packaging line dated 14
April 2013;

g) a bill of lading for the Combibloc packaging line dated 16 April 2013; and

h) a certificate stating that the vessel carrying the packaging line is allowed to

enter Libyan ports dated 16 April 2013.257

293. The Claimant further rejected Libya’s argument that Olin was not entitled to repatriate
its profits because the alleged legal conditions for such repatriation were not satisfied.
It maintained that “Libya knows that these conditions do not apply to the repatriation
of profits or revenues but only to the ‘re-export’ of the ‘invested foreign capital’ as is
clear from Article 12 of the 2010 Libyan Investment Law”.?>8 The Claimant further
asserted that Olin’s right to freely repatriate its profits is enshrined under Article 6 of
the Cyprus-Libya BIT which requires Libya to “guarantee” Olin “the free transfer of
all payments related to [Olin’s] investments abroad”, including “(a) the initial capital
and additional amounts of profits and any other related amounts, (b) investments

returns including the income gained from the investment”?

294. In its Rejoinder, the Respondent further argued that all foreign investors had an

profits. In support of this argument, the Respondent submitted a letter dated 27 June

2013, which reads as follows:

“In reference to the GCP of Economy and Trade’ decision n° 530/2007 related to the
taxes and fees [...] and of the general budget and final account closing on October 31,

2010 which has been communicated to us, we thank you to:

1-transfer the amount of LYD 1,840.500 by certified check in favor of the LFIB

2-communicate the general account closing on December 31, 2012.'?%

Olin for its part denies that it failed to pay the amounts requested by the LFIB. Olin
maintained that it had promptly paid such sums as evidenced by the check submitted as
Exhibit C-195.76!

On the same issue, the Respondent further argued that Olin (1) had to request the
repatriation of its profits annually (and not for three years at a time) and (2) directed its

request to the wrong entity.7°

In its Reply Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimant rejected such contentions.?® It argued
that in 2013, the LFIB requested Olin to pay a 0.5% tax on “distributable profits,” and
accepted Olin’s corresponding payment. This, according to the Claimant, is a clear
indication that Olin had not corresponded with the wrong entity.“ The Claimant added
that “in any event, if Olin’s request to repatriate its profits had truly failed to comply
with Libya’s regulations or had truly been addressed to the wrong Libyan entity, then
the LFIB should have said so”, and that “Libya's Treaty obligation to treat foreign
investors transparently (as required by the fair and equitable standard) required Libya
to inform Olin as to why its request was being rejected or to communicate the correct
procedure to follow”, concluding that “Libya’s failure to do so in this case, at the time,

falls severely short of Libya’s Treaty obligations. ”?®

298. Finally, with regard to Libya’s alleged refusal to assist Olin in accessing foreign

currency, the Claimant replied as follows:

a) First, Libya’s argument that no certification from the LFIB was required for
Olin to access foreign currency is belied by past certifications that the LFIB

has issued.?6

b) Second, purchasing raw material through Olin Cyprus was not a viable option.

The Claimant’s argument in this regard is that:

Having Olin Cyprus purchase raw materials in foreign currency to then resell
them to its Libyan branch would not have resolved the issue in any event. This
is because these raw materials are ultimately used by Olin’s Libyan branch to
manufacture products that are sold locally, i.e., in Libyan dinars. But Olin’s
Libyan branch would still face the same difficulties in converting those revenues
into foreign currency in order to repay Olin Cyprus. Not to mention that, since
late 2014, the LFIB has been consistently refusing to allow Olin to repatriate
freely the very modest profits that it generated in 2010, 2012, and 2013.

B) The Arbitral Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision

299, Having taken note of the Parties’ contentions in relation to the alleged breach of Article
2.2 of the Cyprus-Libya BIT, the Tribunal sets out below its determinations in relation

thereto.
300. The Tribunal cites, for ease of reference, Article 2.2 of the Cyprus-Libya BIT:

Investments made by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other
Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall

enjoy full protection and security according to the law. Neither Contracting Party shall

 

266 See Claimant's Reply Post-Hearing Brief, para 22: “For instance, on June 20, 2005, the LFIB issued a letter
to the National Commercial Bank asking it to proceed with the opening of a bank account for Olin in both Libyan
dinars and foreign currency. The LFIB specifically stated that Olin “should be treated as national companies for
the purpose of opening letters of credits in order import raw materials as well as for money deposits.” Likewise,

on November 26, 2007, the LFIB did not hesitate to issue a letter to the Ministry of Trade and Economy requesting
it to afford Olin “the treatment granted to Libyan companies for the opening of Letter of credit for importation of
raw material, and for the financial deposits.” Clearly, the LFIB’s own past conduct (ie., past certifications)

confirms Olin’s position (not Libya's) that certifications from the LFIB were required for Olin to access foreign
currency.”

in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management,

maintenance, use, enjoyment, expansion or disposal of such investments.
This Article thus requires the host State:

(1) To ensure that investors in its territory are accorded FET at all times;
(2) To ensure that investors in its territory enjoy FPS according to the law; and
(3) Not to impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management,

maintenance, use, enjoyment, expansion or disposal of investments.

The Tribunal will assess each of the foregoing points in turn below to assess whether
Libya has breached Article 2.2 of the BIT.

(1) Has Libya failed to accord Olin FET?

In this part, the Tribunal will consider whether the 2006 Expropriation Order and
Libya’s subsequent measures constitute a breach of the FET standard set out in the
Cyprus-Libya BIT.

i, FET and the frustration of the investor’s legitimate expectations
As previously observed, the Tribunal having examined the decision in Tecmed v.
Mexico,2’ as well as other legal authorities submitted by the Claimant regarding the
protection of an investor legitimate expectations in investor-State arbitration, finds that
respect for an investor’s legitimate expectations is widely acknowledged as being part
of the FET standard?

In the Thunderbird v. Mexico award, cited by the Claimant, the arbitral tribunal,
approaching the concept of legitimate expectations within the NAFTA framework,

stated as follows:

“Having considered recent investment case law and the good faith principle of
international customary law, the concept of “legitimate expectations” relates, within
the context of the NAFTA framework, to a situation where a Contracting Party's

conduct creates reasonable and justifiable expectations on the part of an investor (or

investment) to act in reliance on said conduct, such that a failure by the NAFTA Party
to honour those expectations could cause the investor (or investment) to suffer

damages.’

In Gold Reserve v. Venezuela, the arbitral tribunal further stated:

The investor's legitimate expectations are based on undertakings and representations
made explicitly or implicitly by the host State. As authoritatively held, “specific
representations play a central role in the creation of legitimate expectations.
Undertakings and representations made explicitly or implicitly by the host State are the
stronger basis for legitimate expectations. A reversal of assurances by the host State
that have led to legitimate expectations will violate the principle of fair and equitable

treatment.’770

Based on these findings, the Tribunal considers that the legitimate expectations of a

foreign investor would be frustrated if:

(1) The host State’s conduct created reasonable and justifiable expectations on the part

of the investor;
(2) The investor acted in reliance on the said conduct;
(3) The host State failed to honour those expectations.
Having reviewed the evidence submitted by both Parties, the Tribunal considers that:

(1) The changes in Libya’s national and international legislative frameworks in the
1990s, and in particular the enactment of the Libyan Investment Law of 1997,
combined with public declarations and various assurances by the Libyan
authorities, created legitimate expectations that Libya was willing to establish an
environment favourable to foreign investments. While the Tribunal acknowledges
that these expectations should be analyzed in light of the risks inherent to a country
newly opening its doors to foreign investors, the Tribunal considers that it was
reasonable and legitimate for Olin to expect that Libya would not act in breach of
its newly enacted Investment Law. The Tribunal considers that the issuance by the

Libyan State of all necessary permits and licenses to build and operate Olin’s

 

%9 This approach has been adopted by other tribunals and notably in Total S.A. v. Argentina, See Exhibit CL-21,

factory also reinforced the Claimant’s expectations that Libya would abide by its

laws and respect Olin’s fundamental rights as an investor.

(2) Itis fair to consider that the changes in the public discourse and the legal framework
undertaken by Libya in the 1990s, as well as the issuance of permits and licenses

by Libya, were fundamental to Olin’s decision to invest in Libya.

(3) By issuing a decision expropriating the land on which Olin’s factory was erected,
in breach of its Investment Law, without ultimately finding an alternative location
for Olin’s factory and without payment of any compensation, Libya did not honour

the legitimate expectations it had created.

As aconsequence, the Tribunal determines that the issuance of the Expropriation Order
in 2006, and the measures following the Expropriation Order including those which
were tantamount to an expropriation of Olin’s investment, constituted a frustration of
the investor’s legitimate expectations and therefore a breach of the FET standard set
out in Article 2.2 of the Cyprus-Libya BIT.

ii. FET and the infliction of a climate of uncertainty
The Tribunal has noted the decision in Occidental v. Ecuador, where the arbitral

tribunal held that the “stability of the legal and business framework is ... an essential

 

29 2

element of fair and equitable treatment”27' The Tribunal has also taken note of the
decision in Duke Energy v. Ecuador, where the tribunal considered that “/t/he stability
of the legal and business environment is directly linked to the investor's justified

x ions. The Tribunal ack ledges that such

 

are an important

272

element of fair and equitable treatment.

The Tribunal considers that the FET provision contained in the Cyprus-Libya BIT
entails respect for the investor’s ability to operate its investment with a minimum level
of certainty as to its fate and as to the ability to implement basic business decisions in

an unfettered manner.

Having examined the evidence provided by both Parties in relation to the expropriatory

measures, the Tribunal considers that, on the one hand, as put forward by both the

Claimant and the Respondent, a number of Libyan authorities supported Olin’s
exemption requests,” and regularly renewed Olin’s operational license until April
201727

313. On the other hand, however, it is not contested that the Libyan authorities transferred
legal title of the land to the LIDCO between May 2007 and June 2011.77 It is also not
contested that the authorities attempted to evict Olin from its premises on several
occasions, including following the cancellation of the Expropriation Order by the
Tripoli Court of Appeal in 2010.7” Furthermore, it is not contested that Libya’s
discussions regarding a potential relocation or compensation did not lead to any

concrete result.?77

314. The evidence on record further shows that, within three days of the notification of the
Expropriation Order, several buildings and structures next to Olin’s factory were
destroyed and the factory was surrounded by the army. On this point, the Tribunal notes
Mr Abughamja’s testimony, according to which the army’s bulldozers were parked in
Olin’s yard and military officers would come and have lunch inside the factory, a fact
which has not been d by the R dent.2”8 Under ination, Mr

 

Abughamja further testified that following the three-day eviction notice issued in
November 2006, a six-month period ensued during which the army was mingling with
Olin’s employees in the factory, and almost telling them every day: “this is our job, we

have to destroy the area.’?”? The Respondent did not contest these allegations either.

The Tribunal notes the unusual psychological circumstances and context in which the
Claimant had to operate with the logical adverse consequences of such circumstances

on its business.?°°

315. During his cross-examination, Mr Deher explained how the climate of uncertainty
impacted Olin’s partners as well: “We learned that there was an expropriation order
which had been issued. We moved from being in a mode of competition to survival
mode”,?8' concluding that “Olin had the sword of Damocles of expropriation hanging

over its head which meant it couldn’t plan for the future” ?®

316. The Tribunal has further examined the evidence on record which unambiguously shows
that diverse measures taken by the Libyan State rendered the fate of Olin’s factory
uncertain and undermined Olin’s ability to plan and to gain the confidence of its
business partners, even after the Expropriation Order ceased from being effective in

2011. The Tribunal most notably refers to the following evidence:

- Exhibit C-158: The letter from Olin’s distributor (Al Majd) dated 11 November
2006 in which it was stated that Al Majd “tried many times to contact the
Administration to ask about updates regarding the Company products, and plant
ability to cover the amounts agreed upon it during the current condition of your

plant.”

notably its inability to import a new production line in 2013;28 its inability to

currency in 2015. 78

The report filed by Libya’s Litigation Department against Olin on 5 December 2016
also shows that Libya initiated court proceedings against Olin to challenge the 2010
Libyan Court decision cancelling the Expropriation Order.?*° The Tribunal considers,
however, that such action ought to be assessed in the context of Olin having ceased

operations in 2015.

While the Respondent has proved that the Claimant’s operating license had been
renewed until April 2017, that some Libyan authorities supported Olin’s exemption
from expropriation, and that the factory had never been actually destroyed, the
Respondent has submitted no evidence which would contradict the fact that Olin
remained - for a number of years - in a state of uncertainty as to its fate after the issuance

of the 2006 Expropriation Order.

Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that while Olin’s factory was ultimately
spared from physical destruction, Libya’s aforementioned measures prevented Olin
from operating its plant under normal business conditions and maintained it in a
situation of heightened uncertainty following the issuance of the Expropriation Order
in 2006. In doing so, Libya further breached the FET standard.

iii, FET and. the lack of transparency
The fact that an obligation to act in a transparent manner derives from the FET standard

is largely admitted in investor-State arbitration, and endorsed by this Tribunal.?8”

The Tribunal accepts that the threshold applicable to this obligation of transparency
may vary depending on the specific requirements of the clause containing the FET

standard. In Waste Management v. Mexico, for example, the tribunal interpreting the

 

FET clause in the NAFTA Agreement and commenting on the minimum standard of

treatment, stated as follows:

“the minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is infringed

by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to Claimant if the conduct is

28 As mentioned above at paragraph 126, the Tribunal has not been informed of the outcome of this decision.

287 The Claimant cites a number of cases in support of this allegation: Exhibit CL-9, Gold Reserve Award, para

arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes
Claimant ‘to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process
leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety — as might be the case
with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete
lack of iransparency and candour in an administrative process. In applying this
standard it is relevant that the treatment is in breach of representations made

by the host State which were reasonably relied on by Claimant. "88

In the Tribunal’s view (without entering into a discussion as to whether a minimum or
higher threshold is applicable in this case, a point which was not discussed by the Parties
and is not material to the outcome of the case), a minimum requirement of fairness and
equity would entail that investors are informed in advance that a decision to expropriate
their investment is contemplated, and are given a reasonable opportunity to engage in

a dialogue with the government to find an adapted solution.”

In this case, the Tribunal has considered the evidence showing that the word “removal”

has been painted on the walls of Olin’s factory.?°°

The Tribunal has also examined the evidence on record showing that Olin was only
notified of the Expropriation Order on 12 November 2006, although the GPCO had
decided to issue an Expropriation Order on 19 October 2006. Olin therefore learned
one month later that the factory had been already “dispossessed” and that it had three
days to vacate the premises.”?' The Respondent did not provide any evidence showing
that it notified the Claimant of the Expropriation Order before 12 November 2017, nor

that it made a clear proposal for an alternative site.

The Tribunal concludes that the Respondent further breached the FET standard by
failing to engage in a transparent administrative process while expropriating the land

on which Olin’s plant had been erected.

330.

The Tribunal has considered Claimant’s allegation according to which the LFIB would
have embarked on a personal crusade against Olin since 2013, and a harassment

campaign against Olin.

The Tribunal has first examined the evidence submitted by the Claimant in support of
its assertion that the LFIB failed to issue a customs clearance and never formally
authorised the importation of a new production line that Olin had purchased from
Combibloc. Such evidence includes notably a series of letters from Olin to the LFIB
repeatedly asking for a customs clearance,” as well as the witness testimony of Mr

293

Akram Abughamja.

The Tribunal further refers to the termination letter addressed by Combibloc to Olin

which reads as follows:

“In order to terminate our contract, we propose the following terms:

- Both parties have incurred expenses and losses as a result of the ongoing conflict.

- SIG Combibloc Obeikan shall de-install the line and retrieve all delivered Ec

spare parts, manuals, instructions etc.

- SIG Combibloc Obeikan shall return the down-payment in full which is Euro 300,000

prior to loading the line for retrieval.”?** (emphasis added).

The Tribunal has considered Libya’s argument according to which the letter provides
for a “de-installment” which would demonstrate that the Combibloc equipment was
not held up at the customs but was in fact installed in Olin’s factory and later on de-
installed. The Tribunal however finds this argument inconclusive and insufficient to
rebut the evidence submitted by the Claimant.

Furthermore, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Claimant has sufficiently evidenced that
it purchased this new production line and imported the same into Libya.?> The

Respondent has failed to prove otherwise.

The Tribunal accordingly concludes that the evidence on record supports the Claimant’s
assertion that it was unable to install a new line from Combibloc, due to the LFIB’s

failure to issue a customs clearance.

Second, the Tribunal has examined the evidence submitted by the Claimant in support
of its allegation that the LFIB persistently refused to allow Olin to repatriate profits (i.e.
Olin’s Minutes of Board Meeting evidencing the decision to repatriate profits, followed
by letters to the LFIB asking for an authorization to repatriate profits), a fact which is

uncontested by Libya.?%°

The Tribunal has noted Libya’s argument that Olin did not fulfil the conditions allowing

it to repatriate profits under Libyan law.

The Tribunal considers, however, that Libya failed to refer to specific legal provisions
which set out the conditions that Olin had to contemplate with. Libya further failed to
prove that it had explained to Olin the reasons for which its profits could not be

repatriated.

Further, the argument advanced by Libya in its Rejoinder, according to which Olin did
not pay the sums due to the administration on the net profits before repatriating its

profits was not supported by evidence.?*”

Finally, the Respondent’s allegation in its Answers to the Tribunal’s Post-Hearing
Questions that Olin did not comply with Libya’s local regulations governing the

repatriation of dividends remains unsubstantiated.

On balance, the Tribunal concludes that the evidence on record (as referred to in
paragraph 332) supports the Claimant’s allegation that Libya unjustifiably refused to
allow Olin to repatriate the profits it had generated in 2010, 2012 and 2013.

Third, the Tribunal has examined Olin’s allegation that the LFIB did not assist Olin in
accessing foreign currency. In particular, the Tribunal has considered Claimant’s

arguments that:

to the LFIB dated 11 January 2015, Exhibit C-131, Letter from Olin to the LFIB dated 29 June 2015. See also
Respondent's SoD at para 151.

297 Exhibit C-195, Letter from Olin to the LFIB, 25 July 2013 and enclosed check.

-89-

- Olin needed a certificate from the LFIB certifying that its project was subject to the
Libyan Investment Law and that Olin was to be treated like a national company for
the purpose of banking transactions, in order to obtain foreign currency to import

raw materials, machines and equipment,?%* and
- The LFIB failed to issue such certificate.

339. The Respondent responded to this allegation in its Answers to the Tribunal’s Post-

Hearing Questions for the first time, arguing that:

- Olin did not need any additional documents from the LFIB to access foreign

currency;
- Olin could have accessed foreign currency through its Cyprus headquarters.

340. While the first argument has been proved wrong with the evidence submitted by the

Claimant,?”? the Tribunal finds that the second one deserves more attention.

341. The Tribunal has carefully reviewed the Claimant’s allegations and accepts that raw
materials are ultimately used by Olin’s Libyan branch to manufacture products that are
sold locally. That said, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has not adequately
particularized this aspect of its claim, as further explained at paragraphs 465 et seq.

below.

342. The Tribunal concludes that the evidence on record, as referenced in paragraphs 338
and 340 above) supports the Claimant’s allegation that Libya did not assist Olin in

accessing foreign currency in 2015. The Tribunal, however, cannot rule out the

possibility that Olin could have accessed foreign currency through alternative channels,

a fact which the Claimant did not expressly deny.

Finally, the Tribunal has examined Claimant’s evidence in support of its allegation that

Libya sought its liquidation in 2017.3

Although the evidence on record shows that Libya acted towards the liquidation of Olin
almost two years after Olin had effectively ceased its operations, the Tribunal remains
unconvinced that sufficient proof was adduced by the Claimant to support the allegation

that Libya’s motive was to do so hostilely.

To conclude, the Tribunal finds that the diverse measures of Libya relating to its failure
to authorize the importation of a new production line from Combibloc, its refusal to
allow the repatriation of Olin’s profits and to assist Olin in accessing foreign currency,
were in breach of its obligation to accord FET to Olin, although the Tribunal would be

reluctant to go as far as saying that they amounted to harassment.
vi. FET, due process and denial of justice

The Tribunal refers to the Claimant’s contention according to which Libya’s “abrupt
and opaque” decision to issue the Expropriation Order failed to afford Olin procedural
fairness and due process as required by the FET provision,*”' and that the lack of

coordination among the various Libyan governmental authorities was “glaring”.°°

The Tribunal considers that its findings regarding the lack of transparency of the Libyan
authorities’ decisi king process, bined with the dictory app hes of
different Libyan governmental entities as demonstrated by the Claimant,> and the
failure to issue the Expropriation Order in compliance with the Libyan Investment Law,
led the Tribunal to reach the conclusion that the Respondent did not meet the

requirements of administrative due process.

With regard to lack of due process before the Libyan courts and denial of justice, the
Tribunal has reviewed the legal authorities submitted by the Claimant and notably A.V.
Freeman’s approach according to which denial of justice is an “improper
administration of civil and criminal justice as regards an alien, including denial of

access to courts, inadequate procedures, and unjust decisions” °°

The Tribunal is of the view that the standard to establish a denial of justice is high. A
Party claiming that denial of justice has occurred should be able to prove that court
proceedings were in breach of due process, and that the way in which the court

proceedings were conducted was so unfair that they amount to justice being denied.

Regarding the undue postponements and delays before the South Tripoli Court, the
Tribunal, upon examination of the facts in the context of the Libyan Revolution which
started in 2011, considers that the Claimant has failed to prove that a three-year delay
in court proceedings, combined with repeated postponements, amounted to a denial of

justice in the present case.

The Tribunal further notes that the alleged bribery solicitation made by the Libyan
judge is only supported by Mr Abughamja and Mrs Abughofa’s witness statements.°°>
The Tribunal is not convinced, however, that these testimonies constitute sufficient

evidence that a bribery solicitation occurred before Libyan Courts.°°°

Furthermore, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that it cannot act as a court of
appeal for decisions of Libyan courts and as such, cannot review the merits of the South
Tripoli court’s decision on damages. The Tribunal would only consider that an unfair
decision constitutes a denial of justice if its shocking nature implies a breach of due

process. The fact that the Libyan Court refused to indemnify Olin does not allow this

34 Exhibit CL-88, A.V. Freeman, The International Responsibility Of States For Denial Of Justice 268 (Kraus
Reprint Co, 1970) (1938).

395 At the Evidentiary Hearing, the Counsel for Claimant, in its Opening Statement explained that: “The judge
asked Olin’s legal representative, Mrs Abughofa, what good it would do him to award Olin the compensation it
requested”, thereafter asking “What is in it for me?”. As put forward by Claimant's Counsel, “Olin understood
this message as a barely veiled bribe solicitation, an accusation that Olin does not make lightly. Olin was stunned,
refused to answer, and became definitively convinced that these court proceedings were nothing more than a
charade and that Olin would never receive justice or fair treatment for what it had endured. When the Tribunal
asked “Who heard the judge saying that?”, Counsel for Claimant answered: “/t was Ms Abughofa, it's in her
witness statement. And then she reported it to Mr Abughamja right away. It's also mentioned in his witness

statement.

Tribunal to conclude, on the basis of this decision only, that there was a denial of justice

under international law.

The Tribunal is therefore of the view that the Claimant did not satisfy the burden and

relatively high threshold of proving a denial of justice under international law.

vy. FET and discrimination
Having reviewed the legal authorities submitted by the Claimant, the Tribunal agrees

that the FET standard encompasses an obligation not to discriminate.*°”

The Tribunal refers to its determinations in Section 9 above and concludes that the

Respondent breached the FET standard by treating Olin in a discriminatory manner.

vi. Conclusions on the breach of the FET provision
In summary, the Tribunal considers that the FET provision has been breached both as
a result of the effects of the Expropriation Order between November 2006 and June

2011, and as a result of Libya’s measures after June 2011.
Libya breached the FET provision between November 2006 and June 2011:

a) By issuing an Expropriation Order in breach of Libya’s Investment Law and

thereby frustrating Olin’s legitimate expectations;

b) By inflicting a climate of uncertainty upon Olin, regarding the fate of its
investment and regarding whether it would have to relocate and demolish the

factory it had only recently built;

c) By failing to act in a transparent manner by timely informing Olin of the
Expropriation Order in 2006 and the status of the expropriation decision

afterwards;

d) By treating Olin less favourably than its national investors OKBA and Al-

Aseel.
358. Further, Libya breached the FET provision after June 2011:
a) By not allowing Olin to import a new production line from Combibloc in 2013;

b) By not allowing Olin to repatriate the profits it had generated in 2010, 2012
and 2013;

c) By not assisting Olin in accessing foreign currency in 2015; and

d) By filing a Report of Appeal by Cassation on 5 December 2016, opening court
proceedings against Olin to challenge the 2010 Libyan Court decision

cancelling the Expropriation Order.
(2) Has Libya failed to ensure FPS of Olin’s investment?
A) Summary of the Parties’ Positions

i, The Claimant

359. The Claimant contends that the FPS standard contained in Article 2(2) of the Cyprus-
Libya BIT, protects investors from “unjustified administrative and legal actions taken
by a government, or its subdivisions, that injure the rights of the investor or its
investment, irrespective of the State’s intent.”*°8 The Claimant cites the decision in
CME y. Czech Republic? where the Tribunal held that the host State “is obligated to
ensure that neither by amendment of its laws nor by actions of its administrative bodies
is the agreed and approved security and protection of the foreign investor's investment

withdrawn or devalued” 3'°

360. According to the Claimant, “the deplorable manner in which Libya has been

mistreating Olin and its investment since 20063! as well as the GPCO’s refusal to

exempt Olin from the Expropriation Order constitutes a breach of the FPS standard
contained in Article 2(2) of the Cyprus-Libya BIT?

ii, The Respondent

The Respondent denies that it treated Olin in a deplorable manner and on the contrary,
considers that “Olin received a full protection from the Libyan authorities”, in
accordance with Libya’s national and international undertakings towards investors.
According to the Respondent, the renewal of Olin’s license to operate is the best proof
of the protection granted to Olin and its investment by the Libyan authorities as per the
law and the BIT.2!3

B) The Arbitral Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision

362.

363.

364.

365.

The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that a host State under the Cyprus-Libya BIT is
obligated to ensure a climate of protection and security and has noted Olin’s position

that Libya failed to comply with this obligation.

The Tribunal has also noted the position of the Respondent which denies any breach of

the FPS provision.

Having reviewed the legal authorities submitted by the Parties in this arbitration, the
Tribunal refers to the decision in Saluka Investments BV y. The Czech Republic," in

which the tribunal found:

“The ‘full protection and security’ standard applies essentially when the foreign
investment has been affected by civil strife and physical violence.... the ‘full security
and protection’ clause is not meant to cover just any kind of impairment ofan investor's
investment, but to protect more specifically the physical integrity of an investment

against interference by use of force. ">!

The Tribunal concurs with the approach of the tribunal in Saluka Investments BV vy. The

Czech Republic and notes that in the context of Olin’s investment, the physical integrity

and the use of force were not directly at stake here. Olin’s factory continued to function

albeit at a slower pace.

366. The Tribunal therefore considers that the evidence on record does not allow it to
conclude that there was a violation of the FPS standard.
(3) Has Libya impaired the i use, enj and ion of Olin’s

 

investment in Libya with unreasonable and/or discriminatory measures?

A) Summary of the Parties’ Positions

367.

368.

369.

i, The Claimant

The Claimant submits that a breach of the impairment clause in Article 2.2 of the
Cyprus-Libya BIT can be established if the Tribunal is convinced that two elements are
demonstrated. First, the Respondent must have impaired the management,
maintenance, use, enjoyment, and expansion of the Claimant’s investment. Second, the
Respondent must have done so through unreasonable and/or discriminatory

measures.>!

Regarding the first element, the Claimant cited the Saluka v. Czech Republic?!” partial
award in which the tribunal explained that “/iJ/mpairment means, according to its
ordinary meaning (Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties), any
negative impact or effect caused by the ‘measures’ taken by the Czech Republic. The

term ‘measures’ covers any action or omission of the Czech Republic. ">"

According to the Claimant, “ijt is unquestionable that the issuance of the
Expropriation Order impaired Olin’s management, maintenance, use, enjoyment,

expansion, or disposal of its investment”, since it “significantly impacted all aspects of

* Olin’’s operations”.>!° Furthermore, the Claimant considers that Libya’s infliction of a

climate of uncertainty regarding Olin’s future, its subsequent disregard for the decision
of the Tripoli Court of Appeal cancelling the Expropriation Order, and its harassment

campaign against Olin in retaliation for the commencement of these arbitration

proceedings further impaired Olin’s investments.?° More generally, the Claimant
considers that it has put forward “overwhelming factual evidence”, “to demonstrate
the myriad ways in which Libya's misconduct severely impaired Olin's ability to

manage its investments and curtailed its growth and development. ">?!

Regarding the second element, the Claimant submits that a State’s measure, in addition

to causing an impairment, have to be either unreasonable or discriminatory.

The Claimant argues that the Expropriation Order was unreasonable because (1) it was
taken in wilful disregard to due process and proper procedure,>”? “providing Olin with
neither notice nor an opportunity to be heard before its investment was declared
dispossessed,?73 and (2) it bore no rational to its stated purpose,’ since it was taken

“for reasons that are different from those put forward by the decision-maker”. >>

Furthermore, the Claimant considers that the measures taken by Libya were
discriminatory, since the evidence in this case shows that the other two milk and juice
producers, OKBA and Al-Aseel - both local companies situated in the same
expropriated area - were given express exemptions*”® (see Section 9 above for a more

developed analysis of the Claimant’s position on discrimination).

ii, The Respondent

The Respondent denies that the Expropriation Order or any measure adopted by Libya
impacted Olin’s activity. According to the Respondent, the fact that the Claimant’s
licenses have constantly been renewed and that the investor has always been able to

carry out its business show that its investment was not impaired.*?7

The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant’s contention that a breach of the impairment
clause in Article 2.2 of the Cyprus-Libya BIT can be established if two elements are

demonstrated:

a) First, the Respondent must have impaired the management, maintenance, use,

enjoyment, and expansion of the Claimant's investment.

b) Second, the Respondent must have done so through unreasonable or

discriminatory measures.>°8

The Tribunal refers to its analysis and determinations developed in Sections 8 and 9
above, and finds that the Claimant has established the first element of the impairment
clause, identified in the preceding paragraph. The Tribunal thus concludes that Libya’s
measures negatively impacted Olin and that the management, maintenance, use,

enjoyment or expansion of the Claimant’s investment have accordingly been impaired.

Second, the Tribunal refers to its analysis and determinations developed in Sections 8
and 9 above, and concludes that Libya’s measures proved to be in violation of the
Libyan Investment Law, and the Cyprus-Libya BIT. Such measures were both

unreasonable and discriminatory.

The Tribunal is therefore satisfied that Libya has violated the impairment clause set out
in Article 2.2 of the Cyprus-Libya BIT.

328 Claimant's Closing Statement,

i, The Claimant

The Claimant contends that Libya’s conduct in breach of the Cyprus-Libya BIT caused
severe damage to Olin and its investment. Indeed, after the issuance of the
Expropriation Order, the Claimant argue that “Olin’s sole focus shifted to preserving a
minimum level of activity in order to prevent the authorities from raiding the factory,
to safeguard its relationship with Candia, and to avoid losing the raw materials that it

had purchased”.

379. According to the Claimant, Libya’s misconduct caused Olin a negative cash flow of
LYD 7.3 million in 2016, and a cumulative negative cash flow of LYD 17.5 million for
2006-2016.77°

380. . The Claimant states that under international law, it is entitled to full compensation for
the losses that it has suffered as a result of Libya’s measures. The Claimant cites the
Chorzow case;3! widely considered to provide the international law standard for
damages, which are intended to “wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and
re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had
not been committed”? The Claimant adds that the International Law Commission
(ILC”) Articles on State Responsibility? also require a State “to make a full
reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act” and that reparation
must “cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is

established” 3*4

381. The Claimant further asserts that investment tribunals have consistently acknowledged
the importance of awarding “fill compensation” >* and cited the Tribunal’s decision
in AALP y, Sri Lanka which determined that “the amount of the compensation due has

to be calculated in a manner that adequately reflects the full value of the investment

lost as a result of said destruction and the damages incurred as a result thereof”. °°

382. The valuation of Olin’s damages is based on the Expert Reports of Messrs. James

Nicholson and Matthias Cazier-Darmois of FTI Consulting.

compensation” or “wiping out the consequences of the breach” required that Olin

receive damages in an amount between EUR 50.8 million and EUR 81.4 million,

which comprises past and future losses. 337

In a Second Expert Report dated 2 March 2017,°°8 the experts updated their initial
estimates of Olin’s losses based on additional financial information that had become
available. This additional financial information included (i) Olin’s sales reports for
2016 and 2017, (ii) Olin’s invoices for 2016 and 2017, and (iii) Olin’s draft financial
statements for 2016.°° The Second Expert Report also updated the damages based on
the fact that the assumption taken in the First Expert Report that Olin would continue
operations in 2017 is no longer correct. As such, the experts considered in the Second
Expert Report that Olin’s losses are between EUR 57.0 million and EUR 104.9

million.

Using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method, FTI compared (a) the value to Olin “of
the cash flows that it has generated and will in fact generate given the breaches” (the
“actual scenario”) and (b) the value to Olin “of the cash flows that it would have

generated but for Libya's breaches” (the “but-for scenario”)>"°
1, Olin’s Past Losses (between November 2006 and December 2016)

The Claimant considers that “Past Losses” correspond to the difference between Olin’s

cash flows in the but-for scenario and Olin’s actual cash flows.*4!

But-for scenario: For FTI, the benchmark for assessing Olin’s cash flows in the but-
for scenario “is the performance of Candia franchises in several markets similar to
Libya’. According to FTI, in markets where the Candia franchisee entered the market
first, “Candia generally became the leading brand with a market share greater than
50%. In Algeria, a market closely comparable to Libya, Candia’s franchisee gained

342

more than 80%” of the domestic UHT milk market in a few years,*4? which suggests

that “a competent first entrant to the Libyan UHT market could have achieved a very

substantial share of that market” 3°

According to FTI, the Algerian franchise was the most similar to the Libyan franchise
because both markets had (i) little domestic production of UHT milk, (ii) very similar
distribution networks, and (iii) a relatively comparable market size>"4 Further, the
Libyan market “had the additional advantage over its Algerian counterpart of already
having a significant imported UHT milk market—a new entrant did not need to create

a UHT milk market since it existed already”. *4

As explained by the Claimant in its SoC, in a first but-for scenario, the FTI experts
considered that Olin would have been able to emulate the success of Candia’s Algerian
franchisee and thus to capture most of the UHT milk market, i.e. an 80% market share
(the “Algerian Market Share Scenario”).’¥° In a second but-for scenario, the FTI
experts considered that Olin would have captured “only” 50% of the market (the
minimum that Candia’s franchisees have achieved in other markets) (the “50% Market

Share Scenario”).>*”

With respect to juices, the FTI experts considered that Olin “would have realized a
growth in sales volumes as in the milk market.">"* Between 2008 and 2015, Olin sold
0.8 liters of juice for every liter of milk.4? Applying this ratio, the experts estimated
that Olin would have reached a share of 13.8% of the total estimated juice market in
the 50% Market Share Scenario, and a share of approximately 22.2% in the Algerian

Market Share Scenario?

The FTI experts estimate that Olin would have achieved these market shares over a

period of 7 years.

Actual scenario: Because of Libya’s measures, the FTI experts observe that Olin’s
share in the milk market remained at approximately 15%.°>! With respect to juices, the

experts comment that Olin was never able to gain more than 3.2% of the market.>

Olin’s past losses of cash flows: In their First Expert Report, the FTI experts estimated
Olin’s past losses at between EUR 24.3 million (50% Market Share) and EUR 41.7
million (Algerian Market Share).>° In their Second Expert Report, with the updated
information described above, the FTI experts estimated Olin’s past losses at between
EUR 27.8 million (50% Market Share Scenario) and EUR 44.8 million (Algerian

Market Share Scenario).

2. Olin’s Future Losses (2017-2026)

But-for scenario: Similarly to the approach taken with regard to past losses, the FTI
experts assumed that Olin would have been able to maintain a 50% market share in the
50% Market Share Scenario and 80% in the Algerian Market Share Scenario. The FTI
experts then forecasted the size of the fruit juice and milk market “based on the

assumption that these markets grow in line with Libyan GDP forecasts”.>>4

Actual scenario: Olin was not operating at the date of the FTI Report. However, on
the assumption that Olin would resume operations in the near future, the experts
estimated that Olin would recover a substantial share of the market “after a few years
of sufficient investment”.>>> However, the FT] experts assumed that Olin’s market share
“sill grow at a slower pace in the Actual Scenario” than it would have in the but-for
scenario To “account for the added difficulty of gaining market shares in an already
mature and competitive market with established players”, the FTI experts assumed that

Olin will “reach a level equivalent to the But For Scenario after a period of ten

Scenario and in reality, the experts concluded that Olin’s Past losses are between LYD 35.1 million (in the 50%
Market Share Scenario) and LYD 60.7 million (in the Algerian Market Share Scenario) or between EUR 22.7
million and EUR 39.3 million (converted at the average of the official EUR LYD exchange rate in 2016). After
adding interest at a Libyan deposit rate, the experts estimated Olin Holdings” past losses at between LYD 37.4
million and LYD 64.3 million, or between EUR 24.3 million and EUR 41.7 million.

years’ —rather than seven years from 2006—“at which point Olin’'s losses would

cease”. 357

Olin’s future losses of cash flows: The experts discounted Olin’s estimated future cash
flows at Olin Holdings’ weighted average costs of capital (““WACC”), which they have
assessed by reference to the risks of similar listed juice and milk producing companies,

adjusting for the specific risks associated with doing business in Libya.

The WACC of 14.7% that the FTI experts applied reflects the very high country risk

premium currently applicable to Libya.>*

According to FTI, Olin’s cessation of business activities also affected their initial

damages calculations in two principal ways.>°°

First, the FTI experts initially assumed that, in the absence of the measures, Olin would
have been able to gain progressively over the next ten years a normal market share in
the actual scenario. FTI have assumed in their second report that no operations will be
taking place and therefore no cash flows over the next ten years in the actual scenario.
In doing so, the experts have considered that Olin will be able to recover the full
accounting value of its assets upon closing of its factory.*6° According to the Claimant,
this latter “very conservative” assumption seems unlikely “given the costs associated

with moving all or parts of the equipment. "°°!

Second, in their First Expert Report, the FTI experts had previously assumed no loss of
cash flows after 2026, on the basis that Olin would have gained a normal market share
after ten years of operations unaffected by the measures. However, considering that
Olin is now definitively out of the market, the FTI experts calculated Olin’s losses based
on the assumption that they will extend beyond 2026 in the Second Expert Report. The
experts thus incorporated this additional loss by adding in its assessment the present

value of the cash flows that Olin would have generated after 2026 but for the measures.

404,

In doing so, the experts assumed that Olin cash flows would have remained constant at

their estimated 2026 level.>

FTI therefore estimated Olin’s discounted future loss at between EUR 26.5 million and
EUR 39.7 million*® in the First Expert Report and at between EUR 29.1 million and
EUR 60.1 million in the Second Expert Report.

3. The causal link between Libya’s misconduct and Olin’s damages

The Claimant challenges Libya’s main line of defense in relation to damages whereby
Libya contents that there is no causal link between Olin’s damages as described above

and its alleged misconduct.

In responding to this point, the Claimant first cites the Inmaris v. Ukraine*® case which
analyzed the notion of causation under international law. In this case, the tribunal
considered that Ukraine’s wrongful ban of ships led to the claimant’s insolvency, which
led the tribunal to award the claimant lost profits for the additional ten years of

operation that would have followed had the claimant not gone into bankruptcy.>%

The Claimant further cites the decision in Lemire v. Ukraine>*’ In addressing causality,
the tribunal in this case noted that “ifit can be proven that in the normal cause of events
acertain cause will produce a certain effect, it can be safely assumed that a (rebuttable)
presumption of causality between both events exists, and that the first is the proximate
cause of the other”. The Lemire tribunal found that causation was established and went

on to compensate the claimant by assessing damages as the difference in value between

 

the worth of Lemire’s had it ded in obtaining the radio

 

pursued and the actual worth of the company as a result of Ukraine’s measures.>*

According to the Claimant, in the present case, causation is more direct and obvious

than it was in the Jnmaris or Lemire cases.

The Claimant further notes that the vast majority of this evidence has not been rebutted
or challenged by Libya and that Libya’s attempt to blame other factors unrelated to its
conduct are almost entirely unsupported by evidence. The Claimant also contends that
Libya’s defense ignores the fact that in calculating Olin’s losses, FTI isolated the effects
of Libya’s measures by excluding the impact of extrinsic factors from its damages

model. 378

4. Summary of Olin’s Total Losses

The Claimant submits that in order to “wipe out all the consequences” of Libya’s
unlawful conduct, the Tribunal should award Olin the damages calculated in the
Algerian Market Share Scenario, namely EUR 104.9 million.2”? The Claimant refers
to Mr Deher’s Witness Statement, in which he states that the Algerian market is the
most comparable to the Libyan market, and that Olin “had everything to succeed” to

achieve the same 80% market share as Candia’s Algerian franchisee: a state-of-the-art

factory; sufficient financial resources; the “winning combination” of a locally-produced
product with the name of an international brand; a first-mover advantage; and
competitors that could not compete “with the Olin-Candia combination, in terms of
quality, marketing, brand recognition and loyalty”>®° The Claimant therefore
concludes that the principle of full reparation militates in favour of awarding Olin the

damages calculated in the Algerian Market Share Scenario.>*!

In the alternative, and at a very minimum, Olin should be awarded the damages
calculated in the 50% Market Share, namely EUR 57 mil

 

5. The Expert’s answers to the Tribunal’s post-hearing questions

On 14 July 2017, following the Evidentiary Hearing, the Tribunal put the following

questions to the experts:

“1. The experts are invited to assess Olin’s losses on the basis of phase 1 of the initial
feasibility study by Candia (FTI-8) (the “Initial Feasibility Study”) considered as a
benchmark, and taking into consideration the fact that Olin would be selling Candia

products.

2. With reference to page 15 of the Expert Presentation submitted during the Hearing,
the experts are requested to explain how the net profit was determined with reference
to Olin’s actual costs from 2007 to 2016.”

The experts submitted their reply to the Tribunal’s questions on 11 August 2017.

In response to the Tribunal’s first question, the experts considered that “the Initial
Feasibility Study assumes both higher sales volumes and higher profits than we have
assumed in our own assessment of Olin’s losses. As a result, using the Initial Feasibility
Study as a benchmark increases Olin’s losses.” Having conducted their analysis, the
experts estimated that “Olin Holdings’ losses, after interest, range from EUR 117.0
million to EUR 267.3 million.” >*°

In answer to the Tribunal’s second question, the experts determined that in Section 5 of
their First Report, they had estimated Olin’s revenues in the “but-for” scenario based

on the market shares that they consider Olin would have achieved absent Libya’s

measures. For this purpose, the experts have divided Olin’s costs into two broad
categories: (1) Olin’s operating costs, which are determined by reference to Olin’s
actual operating costs; and (2) additional expenses that Olin would have incurred.>%
Having conducted their analysis, the experts concluded that “when all costs are
considered [...], our estimate of Olin’s net profit margin in the But For Scenario (net
profit divided by revenue) ranges from negative 2.9% in 2007 to 11.3% in 2011. On
average, Olin’s net profit margin in the Algerian Market Share Scenario between 2007
and 2016 is 4.9%. "34

ii, The Respondent

The Respondent considers that Olin did not incur any damages as a result of a direct or
indirect expropriation and therefore cannot claim any compensation for expropriation,
since there was no expropriation in the first place**> and the procedure applied to Olin’s

investment was lawful and in accordance with due process of law.°8°

The Respondent underlines first that Olin’s right of “wsus” of the investment has never

been restricted.**”

Second, the Respondent challenges the causal link between Libyan’s measures and the

losses sustained by Olin.

The Respondent argues that Olin’s losses were due to its own incapacity to make profits

and inexperience in the field of dairy products rather than to Libya’s misconduct.>%

According to the Respondent, Olin’s incapacity to generate profits because of the
Expropriation Order is not proved. The Respondent argues that Olin’s managers lacked
the ‘know-how’ of the field of activity, and for this reason, entered into contact with
Prolac, the Soufflet Group and Candia. It is therefore because of Olin’s inexperience
that errors were made in terms of efficiency and costs, which in turn caused the loss of

profits.>8°

Further, according to the Respondent, a distinction should be made between two

periods:

- 2006-2011 period: in this period the Respondent contends that he Claimant did not
submit any document proving without any doubt that it could not generate profits
as a result of the Expropriation Order of 2006. The Respondent asserts as stated in
Maffezini v. Spain, that ‘bilateral investment treaties are not insurance policies

against bad business judgments '>°°

- Post-2011 period: the Respondent relies on the situation in Libya after the 2011
Revolution to argue that the Claimant cannot place any liability on the Libyan State

because of alleged losses it encountered during this period.>?!

The Respondent further considers that the FTI Expert Report is based on wrong
assumptions of facts, starting with the expropriation of Olin’s investment which did not

oceur,39?

The Respondent considers that the experts have been instructed to assess losses
concerning two periods, the second of which being outside the scope of the RFA and
the TOR since it does not refer to the Expropriation Order but to the “non-renewal of

Olin's license” 3°

The Respondent adds that the experts (at paragraphs 2.6 and 2.7 of FTI’s First Expert
Report) base their analysis on a wrong factual background when they say that the
Tripoli land registrar transferred the legal ownership of Olin’s land to the State of Libya
and subsequently to the LIDCO. The Respondent takes the view that Olin has never
been the owner of the land and that the land register transferred the legal ownership of

Mr Abughamja’s land to the State2™*

Regarding the analysis of the Libyan market by reference to the different scenarios, the

Respondent comments as follows:

- Algeria is the biggest dairy consumer in the Maghreb region and the country
consumes 6 billion liters of dairy per year including 3 billion liters of imported milk

powder.3°5

= Moreover, Algeria was not affected by the Arab Spring. Contrary to Algeria and

Lebanon, Libya is “currently divided between two governments, two parliaments

and the army, all pretending to impose their power” 5%

The Respondent gives some figures from the World Bank showing the deterioration

of the Libyan situation.2%”

- The figures presented by the Claimant show that Libya has a lower consumption of

milk than Algeria.>%

The Respondent further refers to paragraph 3.24 of FTI’s First Expert Report according
to which after a few years of local production, three local producers together controlled
approximately 65% of the Libyan juice market. According to the Respondent, this
information proves that Olin was not the first one to implement a juice activity in Libya
and was preceded by local producers, which means that Olin had to compete with local

and potentially cheaper producers.*”°

The Respondent adds that the fact that “distributors, which had previously reached
verbal agreements with Mr Abughamja, now refused to do business with Olin” (at
paragraph 4.7 of FTI’s First Expert Report), is not evidenced by any document except
the witness statements of Mr Abughamja and Mr Deher. According to the Respondent,
the exhibit put forward by the Claimant concerns only two letters from Al Majd as
distributor, dated June and November 2006. The Respondent argues that neither letter
mention Al Majd’s reluctance to do business with Olin from the end of 2006 because

of alleged uncertainties.4°

428.

429.

Another part of Respondent’s argumentation challenges the fact that Olin incurred

losses, at least in the period between 2006 and 2011.

The Respondent refers to FTI’s First Expert Report in which it is stated at paragraph
4.18 that according to the article by the Irish food Board, Olin became the third biggest
local milk producer in Libya in 2011 behind Judi and Al Rayha. The Respondent argues
that “this remark is of great interest” because it shows that despite the existence of
local competitors Olin was immediately behind them in terms of competition“?! The
Respondent draws the same conclusions from the comment in Table 4-1 that Olin’s
share of Libyan UHT milk market is significant and from the comment at para 4.21 that
“In the period 2006 to 2016, Olin generated a cumulative EBITDA gain of LYD 7.5
million” 4°?

Regarding the comments under “Olin Holdings’ losses due to the Measures’, the
Respondent considers that despite the reference to adverse measures the current
shareholders of Olin have decided to go on with the operation and resume it in 2017,
concluding that “obviously they trust in the Libyan economy and market and they are
convinced of the profitability of the project”.4°

Regarding the Claimant’s statements of financial position, the Respondent contends the

following:

- The value accounted for the land corresponds to the Property sale contract dated 31
October 2007 which could not enter into effect since the ownership of the land was
transferred on 20 March 2007 to the LIDCO (the Claimant could not have sold a
land which was already owned by a third party).

As the land was expropriated, following the Claimant’s reasoning, Olin had no right

to put this land as an asset in its accounts,

434,

The accounts show that Olin has a debt towards Mr Abughamja amounting to LYD
11,655,600 whilst the land was not owned by him but by the Libyan State.4°>

- The Respondent concludes that “all these contradictions between law and accounts
lead the [Claimant] to a total contradiction which enables the Respondent to
suspect the claim to hide a fraudulent manoeuver to the detriment of the Libyan

state” 46

Consequently, the Respondent requests from the arbitral tribunal the dismissal of all

financial claims advanced by the Claimant.

The Arbitral Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision

Having established a breach of Articles 2, 3 and 7 of the Cyprus-Libya BIT, the
Tribunal will start by addressing (i) the issue of the causation between these breaches
and the damages allegedly sustained by Olin, before (ii) determining the methodology
followed by the Tribunal to evaluate the damages sustained by Olin and (iii) applying
the methodology followed by the Tribunal to the facts of the case). The Tribunal will

finally draw its conclusions regarding the damages due to Olin (iv).
i, Causation

The Claimant contends that, as a result of Libya’s breaches of the Cyprus-Libya BIT,
it has suffered harm—which it defines as a “clear underperformance "—and ultimately

had to cease its activities in 2015.47

The Tribunal will analyse successively (1) the causal link between the Respondent’s
wrongful conduct and the Claimant’s underperformance followed by (2) the causal link
between the Respondent’s wrongful conduct and Olin’s cessation of activities in 2015

through to the non-renewal of its operational license past-April 2017.

1. Libya’s wrongful conduct and Olin’s underperformance

The Tribunal has examined the legal authorities submitted by the Claimant, which
highlight the criteria applied by investor-State arbitration tribunals when establishing a

causal link between the wrongful acts of a State and the harm suffered by an investor.

495 Jd. at para 222,
46 fd at para 223.
+97 Claimant’s Answers to the Tribunals Post-Hearing Questions at para 31.

-112-

435. The Tribunal considers that in order to prove that Libya’s measures caused an
underperformance on the part of Olin, the Claimant had to establish (1) the causality
between Libya’s breaches of the BIT and Olin’s underperformance and (2) that Libya’s
breaches are the proximate cause of Olin’s underperformance, or in other words, that the

underperformance was a foreseeable consequence of Livya’s breaches.

436. The Tribunal has considered Olin’s arguments that Libya “imposed years of mixed
signals, confusion, paralysis, and uncertainty on Olin and its management”, which

caused “much poorer performance than otherwise would have been the case”.*8

437. The Tribunal will first proceed with defining the harm suffered by Olin and then

consider the causal link between such harm and Libya’s measures.
¢ The harm suffered by Olin

438. The Tribunal will approach the harm suffered by Olin by distinguishing two time

periods during which Libya’s measures affected Olin’s activities:

- first, the period running from November 2006 (when Olin’s managers learnt about
the Expropriation Order) to June 201 1 (when Olin was able to register title over the
land on which its factory was built); and

- second, the period following June 2011, during which Libya implemented a number

of measures in breach of the FET standard as demonstrated in Section 9 above.

439. The Tribunal considers that the Claimant has proved that it has suffered the following
harm between November 2006 and June 2011:

- An uncertainty as to whether its factory was going to be demolished and relocated

resulting, notably in abandonment of new investments in Olin’s business,‘?

stoppages in production and postponement of marketing campaigns which had a

paralysing effect on Olin’s activities;4!°

- a fundamental inability by Olin to plan and manage its investments;4!!

- loss of its “first-mover” advantage in the market;*!? and
- strained relations with stakeholders such as lenders, suppliers, and distributors.4">

The Tribunal is unconvinced by Respondent’s argument that Olin’s relationship with
its suppliers, and notably with its distributors, was not impacted by the measures. The
Tribunal refers inter alia to the letter by Al Majd (Olin’s distributor) which was sent
contemporaneously to Olin, in which it was stated that they: “tried many times to
contact the Administration to ask about updates regarding the Company products, and
plant ability to cover the amounts agreed upon it during the current condition of your

plant,”*\4

The Tribunal further considers that Olin suffered the following harm after June 2011:

- Inability to obtain a customs clearance to import its new production line from

Combibloc resulting in another decrease of its planned investment;

- Inability to repatriate in 2014 the profits Olin had generated in 2010, 2012, and

2013; and inability to access foreign currency in 2015.

The Tribunal finnaly considers that Libya’s argument according to which the facts from
mid-2011 onwards fall outside the scope of this arbitration and that the TOR’s scope
encompasses only the effects of the Expropriation Order is groundless. The Tribunal
refers to paragraph 26 (a) of the TOR and to pages 2 et seq. of the RFA in this regard,
which confirm that the scope of this arbitration is not limited to the facts occurring until

mid-2011 only.
¢ Causal link between Libya’s measures and the harm suffered by Olin

The Tribunal has reviewed the evidence submitted by the Claimant in support of the

existence of such causal link, and particularly, has considered the following documents:

412 Hearing Transcript, Day 2, Testimony of Mr Deher: “IVe had really wasted our chance by leaving the market

8) Evidence of Libya’s refusal to allow Olin to repatriate profits;??

9) Evidence that Libya did not assist Olin in accessing foreign currency;*?

10) Evidence that Libya reopened court proceedings in 2016 to challenge the
decision of the Tripoli Court of Appeal cancelling the Expropriation Order in
2010.44

444, The Tribunal is convinced, based on the evidence on record, that Libya’s measures
contravened the Claimant’s full enjoyment of its investment, and foreseeably

undermined its ability to perform as well as it could.

445. The Tribunal concludes that the Claimant did establish that Libya’s measures have
caused an underperformance by Olin, and that the measures are the proximate cause of

its underperformance.

446. The Tribunal shall accordingly assess whether the Respondent has proved that the chain
of causation established by the Claimant was broken by an external event, by an act of

a third party or an act of the Claimant itself.

447. In this regard, the Tribunal has noted the Respondent’s argument that Olin never had to
relocate its factory and had its license renewed until 2017, meaning that the
Expropriation Order had no practical effect on Olin’s investment. For the reasons

destruction or relocation, Olin was clearly prevented from operating its plant under
normal business conditions following the issuance of the Expropriation Order in
November 2006 until 15 June 2011 when Olin was able to regain title to the land.

Additionally, adverse unlawful measures affected Olin’s operations after 2011.

The Tribunal has further considered the Respondent’s view that the chaos resulting
from the Revolution in Libya did have an impact on the investment climate and
investors after 2011. The Tribunal considers however that if the Libyan crisis and civil
war may have subsequently contributed in affecting the Claimant’s business, these
events do not solely justify Olin’s clear underperformance prior to 2011 when
compared to other competitors in Libya which entered the market at around the same

time with similar levels of investment.

The Tribunal refers for example to the performance of Judi, a local competitor to Olin,
which sells UHT milk and juice and has also started its operations in 2006 with similar
initial investments than Olin. Between 2006 and 2010, Judi realised EUR 40 million in
profits in only five years,*?> and maintained its position until today as a market leader

in Libya.4?6

As such, the Arbitral Tribunal is of the view that the Libyan crisis cannot be considered
as an event that breaks the causal link between Libya’s breaches of the BIT and Olin’s
underperformance after 2011. The Tribunal finds nonetheless that the occurrence of
such crisis and its impacts should be taken into account when assessing the damages

due to Olin.

The Tribunal finally considered Libya’s contentions according to which Olin’s losses
and unsuccessful venture was the result of its inexperience as well as of its own
mistakes. According to Libya, this lack of experience was reflected in Olin’s strategic
errors, notably the purchase of inadequate equipment at the beginning of the
investment. The Respondent referred to Mr Deher’s Witness Statement where he
explains that after the signature of the Franchise Agreement, Candia asked Olin to

upgrade its equipment to Tetra Pak machines, and that “while Olin was not pleased to

learn it had to replace machines it had just purchased”, Olin agreed to “purchase a

demonstration model” “7

The Tribunal however considers that the Claimant’s purported inexperience in the

. field*?8 does not justify an inability to maintain a sustainable business, given that Olin

had collaborated notably with SOUFFLET GROUP and Candia, which both provided
guidance and support to Olin and identified Olin as a company having the potential to

successfully conduct its business.*?°

Nevertheless, the Tribunal accepts that Olin had a limited production capacity resulting

from its too limited ii in inery and i at the beginning of its

operations in 2006.

In its written Witness Statement, Mr Deher explained how Candia asked Olin to replace
two machines it had already bought, as illustrated in the following abstracts:

“In 2005, Olin had decided to build its factory with machines from French Actini (for
the sterilization part) and from the Italian IPI (for the kaging part), I understand
that Actini was acting as an engineer/technical advisor and was supervising the

construction of the factory.”**° (emphasis added).

“As soon as the Franchise Agreement was signed, we stepped in to redesign the entire
factory plan. We were not convinced by the Actini and IPI machines (as we generally
prefer to use machines from Tetra Pak or eventually from Combi-Bloc), and we rapidly
told Olin that it would have to upgrade its equi to Tetra Pak hines to sustain

a high quality production in the long run, "**' (emphasis added)

“While Olin was not pleased to learn that it had to replace machines it had just

purchased, it nevertheless confirmed its willingness to build a state-of-the-art factory

458.

Although Olin originally planned to buy two Tetra Pak machines, as a replacement of
the Actini and IPI machines, the Tribunal notes that Olin’s book accounts show that it
ultimately bought only one Tetra Pak machine in 2006, following Candia’s redesign of

the factory.45

Yet, one machine alone could not allow Olin to meet its production expectations in the

long run. During the Evidentiary Hearing, Mr Deher explained that:

“[...] with only one Tetra Pak machine, Olin could not contend with market demand.

What was originally planned when we started working with Olin was to invest quickly
in two Tetra Pak machines and, after that, to start to program investments after that. If
you like, in a franchise which is starting up, we could look at the curve relating to the
startup. Once you start, you have to invest one production line, one machine per year
to keep up with production demand.’**4 (emphasis added).

In its first Witness Statement, Mr Abughamja explained that Olin had only one machine
(used for the production of milk and juice) and ultimately bought the second Tetra Pak

machine only at the end of 2008:

“Because UHT milk cannot be stored more than two months (as it expires after six
months), you need to have extra production capacity to face this peak season and take
advantage of it. However, once again, we were not able to make these investments ina
context where our factory could be destroyed the next day (and our machines
completely lost). At the end of 2008, we gave in to Candia’s insistence and accepted to
purchase a second Tetra Pak machine and a sterilizer,"

Furthermore, the Tribunal notes that the second Tetra Pak machine bought at the end
of 2008 was a second-hand machine, which did not perform as expected. During the

Evidentiary Hearing, Mr Cazier-Darmois from FTI testified that:

“Perhaps one thing to bear in mind is that we understand that the second machine that

they eventually acquired was a second-hand machine that apparently didn't perform in
the way that was expected.” (emphasis added).

463.

The Tribunal has considered the experts’ view that the Claimant’s delay in acquiring a
second Tetra Pak machine and its decision to purchase a second-hand machine were
due to the state of uncertainty in which Olin was operating and its impact on the fate of

Olin’s investment. At the Evidentiary Hearing, Mr Cazier-Darmois, testified that:

[...] the counterfactual scenario is one where we assume the additional investments
would have been made. And so the second Tetra Pak machine would have been bought

earlier than it actually was, and so that capacity would have been available. And the

 

reason for it, we think, is that, absent the measures, Olin would have invested in these
hines, because it wouldn't have been worried of ially being out of business

after that.*

The Tribunal understands that the Libyan measures have influenced the business
decisions of the Claimant following the Expropriation Order, including its decision to
invest in new equipment. As such, the Tribunal believes that it is fair and reasonable to
assume that Olin would probably not have bought a second-hand machine but for the

constant threat of eviction and difficult conditions in which it had to operate.

The Tribunal considers, however, that the Claimant cannot impute entire responsibility
to Libya for a limited production resulting from its own decision not to buy the required
second machine before the end of 2008. This is particularly the case since Candia’s
redesign of the factory and requirement that two Tetra Pak machines be bought took

place before the issuance of the Expropriation Order in 2006.97

In light of the above, the Tribunal considers Olin’s business decision to invest in a
sufficient number of machines of adequate quality, did not break the causal link
established by the Claimant, but did contribute to cause Olin’s underperformance, a
factor which will be taken into consideration by the Tribunal when assessing the amount

of damages owed to Olin.
2. Libya’s wrongful conduct and Olin’s cessation of activity in October 2015

The Tribunal has carefully considered the Claimant’s Answers to the Tribunal’s Post-
Hearing Questions (submitted on 15 September 2017) as well as its Reply Post-Hearing

Brief (submitted on 13 October) in which it has expanded its answer to the Tribunal’s

first post-hearing question submitted on 14 July 2017, which read as follows: “The
Parties are invited to further explain and to put into context what triggered Olin’s

cessation of operations in October 2015.”

In response to this question, the Tribunal has noted the Claimant’s argument that.
“[w]hile Olin was able to continue operating with limited production capacity in 2014
and during the first half of 2015, the definitive coup de grace to Olin’s operations came
during the summer of 2015, when the LFIB refused to issue the necessary certificate to
allow Olin to obtain foreign currency to import raw materials and equipment.’ The
Tribunal has further noted Claimant’s assertion that “/wJithout foreign currency or
letters of credit, Olin’s Libyan branch could not purchase or import raw materials, and
without raw materials, Olin could no longer operate, which led Olin to stop production

in October 2015.9

The Tribunal, however, remains unconvinced that Olin has identified and proved with
sufficient detail (1) the raw materials it needed in order to operate its factory, (2) that it
had attempted to acquire such raw materials but could not procure the same due to its
lack of access to foreign funds, and (3) that it has exhausted all alternative avenues of

sourcing the requisite funds or materials.

The Tribunal accepts that Olin’s cessation of activities in 2015, originally thought to be
temporary, may have been in part due to its inability to access foreign currency in 2015,
resulting from Libya’s lack of assistance. The Tribunal, however, is not able to
conclude with certainty that the lack of access to foreign currency and other measures

implemented by Libya are the only cause of Olin’s cessation of activities in 2015.

The Tribunal acknowledges that Libya’s refusal to allow Olin access foreign currency
was followed by the LFIB’s attempt to liquidate Olin, based on the losses accumulated

by Olin since 2007.44

473,

The Tribunal further took into consideration Libya’s decision not to renew Olin’s
operational license past April 2017, and its decision to challenge the 2010 decision of

the Tripoli Court of Appeal cancelling the Expropriation Order in 2016.4"!

The majority of the Tribunal, however, remains unsure of the reason why Olin has
stopped operations already in 2015 before the liquidation process and is not satisfied
that Libya’s post facto non-renewal of the operational license was the root cause of

Olin’s cessation of activities.

The Tribunal concludes that the Claimant has established that Libya’s breaches of the
Cyprus-Libya BIT at the very least contributed to cause its cessation of activities in

2015, but is not convinced that Libya is responsible alone for this cessation of activities.

ii, The methodology followed by the Tribunal

The Tribunal has noted the Claimant’s argument that under international law, it is
entitled to full compensation for the losses that it has suffered as a result of Libya’s
measures. Further, the Tribunal has noted Claimant’s argument that the Cyprus-Libya

BIT establishes a clear hierarchy between international law and domestic law.*”?

The Tribunal has reviewed the legal authorities submitted by the Claimant, and refers
to the Chorzow case,“ according to which damages shall “wipe out all the
consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all

probability, have existed if that act had not been committed”.***

The Tribunal has also reviewed the ILC Articles on State Responsibility*#> which

require a State “to make a full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally

between Libya and Cyprus which provides:

agreements in force benween the Contracting Parties, the applicable rules and principles of international law and

wrongful act”, covering “any financially assessable damage including loss of profits

insofar as it is established” “6

474, The Tribunal has finally noted the decision in AALP y. Sri Lanka which determined that
“the amount of the compensation due has to be calculated in a manner that adequately
reflects the full value of the investment lost as a result of said destruction and the

damages incurred as a result thereof”. “7

475. The Tribunal considers that the DCF method, adopted by the FTI experts in their report,
comparing (a) the value to Olin “of the cash flows that it has generated and will in fact
generate given the breaches” (the “actual scenario”) and (b) the value to Olin “of the
cash flows that it would have generated but for Libya's breaches” (the “but-for
scenario”),448 is the most appropriate method to quantify the amount of damages, since
it is the only method which would put Olin “in the financial position in which it would

have found itself in the absence of breach or breaches."

476. The Tribunal recognises that the application of this method will require some
approximations and confirms that it will retain a certain amount of discretion or a
‘margin of appreciation’ when assessing the damages incurred by Olin.** In doing so,
the majority of the Tribunal has elected to adopt a conservative approach to the

evaluation of damages.

opinions, which does not of itself mean that the burden of proof has not been satisfied. Because of this element of
imprecision, it is accepted that tribunals retain a certain amount of discretion or a ‘margin of appreciation’ when
assessing damages, which will necessarily involve some approximation . . . the tribunal exercises its judgment in

DCF method for the quantification of damages, the Tribunal turns to its analysis on

quantum,

The Tribunal will start by assessing the existence of past and future losses (1) before
drawing its conclusions regarding the evaluation of the losses sustained by Olin (2) and

on the compensation due (3).
1, Past and future losses

As underlined in the recital above, the FTI experts calculated Olin’s damages by adding
Olin’s past and future losses. Applying a lost profits approach, the experts calculated
Olin’s damages as but-for profits less actual profits before and after Olin’s definitive

cessation of activities in 2017.
The experts define past losses as follows:

We refer to losses incurred by Olin Holdings between November 2006 and 31
December 2016 as Olin Holdings’ “Past Losses”. Olin Holdings’ Past Losses
correspond to the difference between Olin’s cash flows in the But For Scenario (i.e.
without the Measures) and Olin’s actual cash flows (i.e. the cash flows actually

generated by Olin).’*! (emphasis added).

The experts explain the reason for which future losses are comparable in addition to

past losses as follows:

Although title to the land was eventually transferred back to Olin on 15 June 2011, Olin
was unable to retrieve by 2016 the market share that it would have had but for the
Measures. Furthermore, we understand that additional adverse unlawful measures
(namely the non-renewal of Olin’s operating licences and a refusal to grant Olin access
to foreign currency) affected Olin's operations in 2015 and 2016. We understand that
these _further_measures prevented Olin from operating at all from October 2015
onwards.

The Measures therefore not only affected Olin's performance until today, they will have
effects in the future, the (‘Future Losses”), which we also quantify."*°* (empt

added).

482.

483.

484,

485.

486.

The experts have further assumed in their first report “chat Olin’s actual performance
will converge with that of the But For Scenario within 10 years, such that Olin will not
incur any damages past year 2026". This assumption was modified in FTI’s second
report, drafted under the alternative assumption that Olin will cease its operations at the

end of the first quarter of 2017 and therefore that Olin’s losses extend after 2026.4

The Tribunal acknowledges the fact that the value of Olin’s losses cannot be determined
with absolute certainty and that a certain degree of discretion as well as the use of
assumptions will be necessary to reach a result that is as close as possible to a full
reparation of Olin’s harm. The Tribunal is however not prepared to award damages

whose amount cannot be established with a reasonable degree of certainty.

The Tribunal notes that the Expropriation Order was issued when Olin was just starting
its operations. Therefore, the Tribunal has no means of reliably assessing Olin’s actual

performance in the absence of measures affecting its activities.

Nevertheless, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant has proved that it was operating
based on a Franchise Agreement with Candia, which contributed to the design of its
factory and that the Olin factory was built and was ready to operate by the end of
2006.44 As such, the Tribunal finds that the damages sustained by Olin during the
period running from November 2006 to December 2016 (or past losses) can be assessed
with a reasonable degree of certainty by comparing Olin’s performance to the
performance of other Candia franchisees in similar markets, as well as those of

competitors during the same period in Libya.

The majority of the Tribunal, however, approaches the experts’ conclusions on future
losses with much more reluctance. Indeed, not only are such damages aimed at
compensating the Claimant for a work it has never undertaken, but they also assume
that Olin would have worked for at least ten additional years and would need to be
compensated accordingly. While the Claimant’s witnesses stated during the Evidentiary

Hearing that the Franchise Agreement with Candia was renewed,** the majority of the

491.

Tribunal notes that Claimant has not submitted any document confirming said renewal

under the same terms.

Moreover, the FTI experts note that one “difficulty that arises in estimating Olin
Holdings’ Future Losses is how to estimate the future size of the Libyan milk and juice
markets’*°6 and that “the future size of the milk and juice market will therefore largely
depend on the pace and extent of the recovery of the Libyan economy”. *7 In this
context, the experts accepted that “there is considerable uncertainty over future
developments in Libya’ and have accordingly “relied on the latest forecasts from the
International Monetary Fund (“IMF”) to predict these developments”.“°° The experts
have then discounted Olin’s estimated future losses at a rate of approximately 15% to
account for the risks associated with the future development of the Libyan economy.
The majority of the Tribunal is however not persuaded that such discounting will
adequately remove or eliminate the uncertainty that is inherent with such assessment of

future damages.

Finally, the majority of the Tribunal further believes that the Claimant has not proved

  

with reasonable certainty the extent of Libya’s responsibility for its cessation of

activities in 2015.

The majority of the Tribunal is therefore not convinced that the Claimant has satisfied
its burden of proof with regard to the amount of its future losses with a reasonable

degree of certainty.

The Tribunal therefore determines that the Claimant shall be awarded compensation for

past losses and not for future losses.
2. Evaluation of Olin’s losses

The Tribunal has noted the FTI experts’ view that where a Candia franchisee entered a
market first, “Candia generally became the leading brand with a market share greater

than 50%” and that “[iJn Algeria, a market closely comparable to Libya, Candia's

franchisee gained more than 80%” of the domestic UHT milk market in a few years,‘

which suggests that “a competent first entrant to the Libyan UHT market could have
achieved a very substantial share of that market”.°' The Tribunal has examined the
past losses incurred by Olin in the 50% Market Share Scenario and in the Algerian

Market Share Scenario.

Having examined the expert evidence on record, the Tribunal is not convinced that the

Algerian franchise should be used as a benchmark.

The Tribunal believes not only that Libya and Algeria are originally very different
markets, but also that the 2011 Libyan revolution additionally influenced the market in
Libya. The Tribunal acknowledges the fact that the experts took into consideration the
consequences of the crisis in Libya on the Libyan economy while evaluating Olin’s
losses, mainly by adjusting the patterns of growth of the milk and juice markets.‘
However, the experts do not appear to have taken into consideration the impact of the
revolution on Olin’s position in the market. The Tribunal is of the view that there is
uncertainty as to whether an international brand such as Candia would have reached an

80% market share given the context of revolution in Libya.

The Tribunal has also reviewed Olin’s 2003 Feasibility Study for a milk factory in
Libya (the “Initial Feasibility Study”). The Tribunal has noted that the margin estimate
in the Initial Feasibility Study (approximately 16% on average between 2003 and
2008*%) is significantly higher than in the 50% Market Share Scenario and in the
Algerian Market Share Scenario, in which the estimate is on average 4.1% in the 50%
Market Share Scenario over the first ten years of operation and 4.9% in the Algerian
Market Share Scenario. The Tribunal has also reviewed the 2007 Candia Business
Plan, submitted to the Tribunal on 18 August 2017, whose estimates also are more
ambitious than the FTI experts’ estimates. The Tribunal considers that these studies,
although useful to understanding Olin’s original business plans, cannot be used as a
reliable benchmark, given that they do not take into consideration the context in which

Olin was subsequently operating.

Moreover, as mentioned above, knowing that the 2006 Expropriation Order was
notified to Olin in November 2006, when Olin was just starting its operations, there is
no evidence of Olin’s actual performance in the absence of State measures affecting its
activities. This means that the experts’ determinations with regard to the production of
milk in the “but for” scenario are mere projections as to the performance of Olin based

on that of other franchisees in comparable markets.

The Tribunal considers that the bar against speculative damages prompts the adoption

 

of a conservative approach to the calculation of d: in these ci

Based on the foregoing and considering that in none of the countries where a Candia
franchisee entered the market first did the local franchisee gain less than a 50% market
share, the Tribunal accepts that the 50% Market Share approach be considered in the
sections below as a benchmark for the Tribunal’s assessment of Olin’s performance but

for Libya’s breaches of the BIT.

In its First Expert Report, FTI estimated that Olin suffered past losses of LYD 35.1
million in total over the period 2006-2016, in the 50% Market Share Scenario. After
interest is added at the Libyan deposit rate, the experts estimated Olin’s past losses at
LYD 37.4 million, which equates to EUR 24. 3 million (converted at the average of
the official EUR LYD exchange rate in 2016). In its Second Expert Report, FTI
estimated that Olin suffered past losses of LYD 43 million, which equates to EUR 27.
8 million (converted at the average of the official EUR LYD exchange rate in 2016).
The experts justify this increase mainly by the fact that Olin repaid its suppliers at a
faster pace than anticipated in earlier projections, concluding that they have updated
their analysis to reflect this point. This in turn resulted in lower cash flows in the Actual
Scenario in 2016 than originally predicted, and therefore slightly higher losses. The
experts draw these conclusions from a draft financial statement provided under Exhibit
FTI-43, which does not appear to have been audited.*°> The Tribunal does not consider
that the draft financial statement submitted by the Claimant is sufficiently reliable

evidence to justify an increase of EUR 3.5 million in the claimed amount. The Tribunal

465 The Claimant has submitted one sheet of paper entitled “Draft Balance Sheet as of 31 December 2016” as
opposed to Financial Statements with Accountant Report for previous periods of time.

-128-

499.

will therefore retain the amount of EUR 24.3 million as a basis for the compensation of

Olin’s past losses.

The majority of the Tribunal however is not prepared to accept such an assessment of

past losses to face value given the assumptions contained in the experts’ reports and the

variables between the actual investment conditions and the reference scenarios adoped

by the experts. Indeed, the majority considers that the experts have not fully considered

the risk factor associated notably with the Libyan Revolution and with the Claimant’s

specific situation. The majority of the Tribunal thus believes that the experts’ valuation

should be subject to abatement for the reasons developed below:

a)

»)

As stated above at paragraph 493, the experts’ reports purported to take into
consideration the consequences of the crisis in Libya on the Libyan economy
when evaluating Olin’s losses, mainly by adjusting the patterns of growth of
the milk and juice markets.4® The experts however proceeded as such without
considering the effect of such crisis on Olin’s position in the Libyan market.
The Tribunal is not convinced that Olin’s increase in market share would have

continued to follow the same pattern following the Libyan revolution.

The 50 % Market Share Scenario assumes that the second machine bought by
Olin late in 2008 would have come on line at an earlier point in time but for
Libya’s measures, thereby increasing Olin’s production and sales capabilities.
The evidence on record does not support however, the assumption that such
delay in buying appropriate machinery is solely due to the adverse effect of
Libya’s measures.** Indeed, for the reasons outlined in its analysis on causality
above, the Tribunal is not convinced that but for Libyan’s measures, Olin
would have bought all the appropriate equipment on time, which means that
the difference between its profits in the “but for” scenario and its profits in the
actual scenario would be necessarily lower than what the experts accounted for

in their reports (see above paragraph 498).

Regarding the production of juice, the 50 % Market Share Scenario does not

rely on comparable data in other markets but rather assumes that a linear

qd)

correlation exists between the sales of milk and juice in the Libyan market. The
experts noted that between 2008 and 2015, Olin sold approximately 0.8 liters
of juice for every liter of milk. The experts then applied this percentage to the
estimated yearly sales of milk to derive the estimated volume of juice sales. In
doing so, the experts assumed that there would be a correlation between the
increase in Olin’s milk market share over the years with the increase of its juice
market share. The Tribunal is not persuaded however that Olin’s revenues from
juice would have grown as fast as its revenues from milk if Olin had managed

to gain a greater market share.

Finally, having examined the evidence on record, and notably the Minutes of
the Meeting organised between Candia and Olin on 18 July 2007, the Tribunal
understands that Olin expected to reach a capacity of 80,000 million liters per
year in the “medium term”. “8 Given that the Franchise Agreement between
Olin and Candia was originally of a duration of ten (10) years, the Tribunal
considers that the “medium term” would logically refer to around five (5) years
of operations, or to between four (4) and six (6) years of operation in a broader
sense. In spite of this fact, the experts estimate that in the 50% Market Share
Scenario, Olin would have reached a capacity of 80,000,000 liters in 2011 after
four (4) years of activity; a capacity of 100,000,000 liters in 2012 after five (5)
years of activity and a capacity of 100,000,000 liters in 2013 after six (6) years
of activity. Therefore, considering that the “medium term” would be reached
between four and six years of activity, the experts estimated that Olin would
have a capacity of 93,333,333 liters on average during those years, a capacity
which is higher than Olin’s own expectations in 2007, although Olin was

operating without the specter of the Libyan civil war at the time.

For the reasons outlined in paragraph 499 above, the majority of the Tribunal

concludes that, on balance, the amount of past losses as assessed in the 50% Market

Share Scenario, exceeds the amount of losses actually suffered.

Hearing Questions on 11 August 2017.

501.

In particular, the majority of the Tribunal has given due regard to the following data

when ising its to the level of at

a) Olin’s revenues in the But For Scenario as set out in Table 5-1 of FTI’s report
of 7 October 2016.47°

b) Olin’s net profit margin in the 50 % Market Share Scenario as set out in Table
2 of FTI’s letter of 11 August 2017.47!

c) Olin’s milk market share projections in the 50 % Market Share Scenario as set
out in the excel file titled “Appendix | — Assessment of Olin Holdings losses”,

sheet “But For Production”.4”

d) Olin’s actual milk and juice sales, cash flows and production capacity as set
out in the excel file titled “Appendix 1 — Assessment of Olin Holdings losses”,

sheets “Act_cash flows” and “Act_Sales”.473

e) Actual currency exchange rates as set out in the excel file titled “Appendix | —

Assessment of Olin Holdings losses”, sheets “Exchange Rates”.4”4

As a consequence, the majority of the Tribunal, considers that the experts’ assessment
of Olin’s past losses (as set out at paragraph 498 above) should be subject to an
abatement. The majority of the Tribunal has weighted the impact of Libyan’s measures
against the contributing factors listed in paragraphs 499 and 501 and applying its
discretion in the evaluation of damages, *”° considers that a 25 % abatement (equivalent
to 6.075 million euros) is an adequate, appropriate and reasonable level of abatement

that would negate the impact of the foregoing issues.

A) Summary of the Parties’ Positions

505.

506.

i. The Respondent

The Respondent submitted a counterclaim in its SoD and in its Rejoinder.
According to the Respondent, the Claimant abusively:

-  “[Claims a] direct/indirect expropriation and more generally mistreatment from

the Libyan authorities;

- Alleges that its financial difficulties encountered from 2006 are imputable to the

host State;

Tries to assimilate two different periods in order to prevail from the alleged

negative effect of the Expropriation Orders of 2006 until now;

- Prevails from a “solicitation of bribe”, and the latter is not supported by any valid

proof;

Presents questionable accounts to support its claim of condemnation of the host

State. #7

The Respondent expressed its suspicion that Olin is trying to “obtain an unduly huge
amount of money for alleged violation of its obligations, and that it would then take
advantage of this payment to resume its operation as soon as the situation in Libya will

be back to normal”’.#”7

The Respondent concluded that the condemnation of the Claimant to pay a sum of USD
10,000,000 in compensation for Olin’s behavior and for the reputational damage caused
to the Libyan State’s institutions is well grounded.*’® In its Rejoinder, the R d

reduced the amount of its claim to USD 2,000,000.479
ii, The Claimant

According to the Claimant, Libya’s counterclaim is frivolous and should be summarily
dismissed by the Tribunal,*®° underlining that the “Jack of seriousness of Libya’s vague

allegations is evident” 48!

The Claimant contends first that there is no legal basis for Libya’s counterclaim. To
Claimant’s knowledge, no State has ever succeeded in asserting a counterclaim in an

investor-State treaty arbitration.*%?

Second, the Claimant says that the counterclaim is substantially the same counterclaim

that the Tribunal has rejected during the jurisdictional phase.**

Third, the Claimant views Libya’s counterclaim as a mere denial of liability and as

constituting a repetition of its defense rather than a real counterclaim.

Fourth, Libya’s assertion that Olin’s claim is “abusive and unfounded” and defamatory
has no merits whatsoever. According to the Claimant, the facts it alleges are thoroughly
demonstrated and supported by evidence.“** In addition, the Claimant considers that the

Respondent “fails to rebut any these facts”.'%

Finally, according to the Claimant, Libya in its counterclaim (i) asserts no specific or
clear claim, (ii) points to no international obligation violated by Olin and provides no
facts to substantiate a breach, (iii) fails to prove that Libya has suffered any type of

injury and (iv) fails to particularize the claim.4*”

B) The Arbitral Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision

514. The Tribunal has carefully considered the arguments put forward by the Respondent in

support of its counterclaim, as well as the Claimant’s position.

515. The Tribunal however considers that the Respondent’s allegations are not substantiated

by evidence.

516. The Tribunal further refers to its assessment of Libya’s breaches of Articles 2.2, 3 and
7 of the Cyprus-Libya BIT and concludes that the Respondent’s counterclaim is not

justified, thereby warranting its dismissal.
14. INTEREST

A) Summary of the Parties’ Positions

i. The Claimant

517. In its SoC, the Claimant sought post-award interest on all of the amounts claimed “ar

the commercial rate of interest applicable in Cyprus, compounded quarterly, until

Libya pays in full.’*88

518. In its Reply, Olin maintained its “request for post-award interest on all amounts
awarded, at the commercial rate of interest applicable in Cyprus, compounded
quarterly, until Libya pays the award in full.” The Claimant added that Olin’s request
is consistent with international law and investment treaty practice, which recognizes

that compound interest is the generally-accepted standard in treaty arbitrations.

ARB/99/6, Award, 12 April 2002 at para 174

In its Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimant further discussed the law governing the award
of interest and the basis for its interest request at the commercial rate applicable in

Cyprus.

The Claimant noted, for instance, that the Cyprus-Libya BIT was silent on the question

of interest and therefore that international law should apply.

The Claimant went on to underline the arbitral tribunal’s “discretion to grant interest
on any amount of money they award” 4°

The Claimant cited the decision in Santa Elena v. Costa Rica, according to which “the
determination of interest is a product of the exercise of judgment, taking into account
all of the circumstances of the case at hand and especially considerations of fairness
which must form part of the law to be applied by this Tribunal”. *°! The Claimant
concluded that “the guiding principle for the Tribunal, therefore, is to impose an
interest rate that takes into account all circumstances and achieves the result of full

reparation, "4°?

The Claimant further explained that in Olin’s case, “the commercial rate of interest
applicable in Cyprus is the interest rate that will make Olin whole”, since it “represents
Olin’s cost of borrowing this same sum from Cypriot banks”, underlining that this

interest rate is currently of 5%.*>

ii, The Respondent
In its Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondent contested the use of the interest rate
applicable in Cyprus. According to the Respondent, Olin invested in Libya based on

the Libyan Investment Law, the investor’s project is located in Libya and Olin was

 

‘interest is an integral part of the compensation due [...] and [...]

compound (as opposed to simple) interest is at present deemed appropriate as the standard of international law
in such expropriation cases."); Exhibit CL-105, LG&E v. Argentine Republic, \CSID Case No. ARB/02/1,
Award, 25 July 2007, para 103 (“In addition, the Tribunal is of the opinion that compound interest would better
compensate the Claimants for the actual damages suffered since it better reflects contemporary financial
practice”); Exhibit CL-8, ADC Award at para 522 (“As to post-Award interest, contrary to Respondent's
submission, the current trend in investor-State arbitration is to award compound interest.”).

subject to Libyan laws and regulations. The Respondent therefore concluded that the

law applicable to interest was indisputably Libyan law.‘

The Respondent also argued in its Post-Hearing Brief that Article 235 of the Libyan

Civil Code expressly excludes compound interest in the following terms:

Subject to any commercial rules or practice to the contrary, interest does not run on
outstanding interest and in no case shall the total interest that the creditor may collect

exceed the amount of the capital.
iii. Parties’ Rebuttal Arguments

In its Reply Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimant noted the Parties’ disagreement on the
law applicable to the question of post-award interest.4°> The Claimant argued that Libya
did not cite any supporting authority or put forward any analysis in support of its
assertion that the applicable law to interests is the Libyan law. The Claimant concluded
that “/wJhile Olin wholly rejects the application of Libyan law, it notes, however, that
the commercial interest rate in Libya is also 5%”,* and therefore that “while the
Parties disagree on the law applicable to post-award interest, they are nevertheless in

agreement regarding the applicable rate of post-award interest”.?”

The Claimant further addressed in its Reply Post-Hearing Brief the Respondent’s
position on whether any interest awarded should be compounded."”* The Claimant
argues that the Respondent’s assertion that Libyan law forbids the award of
compounded interest is incorrect. It maintained that Libyan law allows the award of

compounded interest whenever there is a commercial practice to that effect.

The Claimant concluded on this issue that Olin’s request for post-award interest at 5%,
compounded quarterly, is wholly consistent both with Libyan law and with investment

treaty practice.

The Respondent did not deal with the question of interest in its Reply Post-Hearing
Brief dated 15 September 2017.

B) Arbitral Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision

530.

531.

532.

The Tribunal refers to Article 9.4 of the Cyprus-Libya BIT (See Article 9 of the Cyprus-
Libya BIT on the “Settlement of Disputes between one of the Contracting Parties and

Investors of the Other Party”) according to which:

The arbitral tribunal shall issue its decision in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement, other relevant agreements in force between the Contracting Parties, the
applicable rules and principles of international law and the domestic law of the

Contracting Party provided that it does not conflict with the rules of international law.

The Tribunal further refers to Article 38.1 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility,
formulating the basic rules of international law concerning the responsibility of States

for their internationally wrongful acts, according to which:

Interest on any principal sum due under this chapter shall be payable when necessary
in order to ensure full reparation. The interest rate and mode of calculation shall be

set so as to achieve that result.

The Tribunal has noted the Parties’ positions in relation to the rate of interest, and
considers that the five percent (5%) commercial rate of interest applicable in Cyprus
would achieve the result of ensuring full compensation pursuant to the ILC Articles on

State Responsibility for the following reasons:

(1) The Tribunal acknowledges that neither the Cyprus-Libya BIT nor international
law more generally prompts the Tribunal to award interest based on the

commercial rate of interest applicable in Libya;

(2) The Tribunal recognizes that Olin is a Cypriot company and the interest rate
applicable in Cyprus represents Olin’s cost of borrowing this same sum from
Cypriot banks and that as such, awarding interests at the commercial rate
applicable in Cyprus would enable the Claimant to achieve the result of full

reparation.

-137-

533.

534,

Regarding the Claimant’s request for compound interest, the Tribunal further
determines that in this specific instance, where interests have already been accounted
in the amount of compensation calculated by the Claimant’s experts and awarded by
the Tribunal for the past losses incurred by the Claimant, simple interest would enable

the Claimant to achieve the result of fuil compensation.

For the reasons stated above, the Tribunal hereby decides that simple interest at the rate
of 5%, shall be paid by the Respondent on the amount of EUR 18.225 million awarded
by the Tribunal, starting from the date at which this Award is signed, until full and final

payment.

15. COSTS, ATTORNEY’S FEES AND EXPENSES

A) Summary of the Parties’ Positions

535.

536.

The Claimant

1. Legal costs

In its Costs Submission of 23 October 2017 (“Claimant’s Costs Submission”), the
Claimant claimed EUR 1,317,106.20 in fees and EUR 94,345.71 in expenses incurred

by Olin up to the date of its submission, on an aggregate basis.

The Claimant submitted a table detailing its fees and expenses which is reproduced

below:

On 5 December 2017, the Claimant requested the Tribunal to take into account that the
total amount of fees paid by Olin to FTI is of EUR 206 904.55 instead of EUR
192,106.20, bringing the total amount of fees paid by Olin in relation to these
proceedings to EUR 1,331,904.55 instead of EUR 1,317,106.20.

2. Arbitration costs

In its Costs Submission, the Claimant confirmed that it had paid entirely the ICC’s
administrative fees and the fees and expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal which amount to
USD 735,000, subject to readjustment at a later stage.5° In an email correspondence
dated 5 December 2017, the Claimant requested the Tribunal to take into account an
additional payment of USD 85,000 made to the ICC, resulting in a total amount of USD
820,000 paid by the Claimant for the ICC administrative fees and the fees and expenses

of the Tribunal.>°!

3. Relief sought

The Claimant sought “an award to Olin for all costs associated with these proceeding,

including attorneys’ fees and the fees of the ICC, Tribunal, and experts” °°?
ii, The Respondent

1. Legal costs
In its Costs Submission of 13 October 2017 (Respondent’s Costs Submission), the
Respondent argues that “because of the current circumstances in Libya, the
Respondent’s Counsels “have decided to calculate their fees and costs on a fixed basis
for all their diligences since the beginning of the arbitral proceeding initiated by Olin
Holdings Ltd against the Libyan State on July 3, 2014”.
The Respondent therefore claimed the sum of EUR 200,000 for its legal costs and
expenses, covering the following:

1, Respondent’s counsel participation in the Preliminary Meeting held in Paris on 29

June 2015, during which the Arbitral Tribunal and the Parties discussed, reviewed

and agreed on the Procedural Rules and procedural timetable and signed the TOR;

509 See Claimant’s Costs Submission at footnote 4.

2017, acknowledging receipt of USD 85,000 from the Claimant and confirming that the advance on costs
readjusted and fixed by the Court at USD 825,000 had been entirely paid by the Claimant.

542. The Respondent further requested “the condemnation of the Claimant to support all the

costs and fees incurred by the parties because of the proceedings. "°°

B) Arbitral Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision

i, The ICC Rules
543. This arbitration is conducted in accordance with the ICC Rules. The matter of the

determination and the allocation of costs is addressed in Article 37 of the ICC Rules:

1. The costs of the arbitration shall include the fees and expenses of the arbitrators
and the ICC administrative expenses fixed by the Court, in accordance with the
scale in force at the time of the commencement of the arbitration, as well as the fees
and expenses of any experts appointed by the arbitral tribunal and the reasonable
legal and other costs incurred by the parties for the arbitration.

2. The Court may fix the fees of the arbitrators at a figure higher or lower than that
which would result from the application of the relevant scale should this be deemed

necessary due to the exceptional circumstances of the case.

3, Al any time during the arbitral proceedings, the arbitral tribunal may make
decisions on costs, other than those to be fixed by the Court, and order payment.

4. The final award shall fix the costs of the arbitration and decide which of the parties
shall bear them or in what proportion they shall be borne by the parties.
5. In making decisions as to costs, the arbitral tribunal may take into account such

circumstances as it considers relevant, including the extent to which each party has
conducted the arbitration in an expeditious and cost-effective manner.

549.

550.

Accordingly, pursuant to Article 37(4) of the ICC Rules the allocation of arbitration
costs and legal fees is a matter which falls fully within the discretion of the Arbitral
Tribunal.

Based on Article 37 of the ICC Rules, the arbitration costs stricto sensu (which
correspond to category (1) above) are fixed by the ICC Court. In contrast, the ICC Rules
do not provide detailed rules or guidelines with regard to the Parties’ legal fees and

rather provide that such legal fees must be “reasonable”.

With regard to the allocation of these costs, the ICC Rules do not provide for any
specific allocation test but rather leave matters of allocation to the broad discretion of
the Arbitral Tribunal, which may take into account all the relevant circumstances of the

case.

ii, ICC Costs

The Arbitral Tribunal finds it equitable that the Respondent be ordered to pay the
Claimant the total costs of the arbitration fixed by the ICC, including the amounts
awarded to the Claimant in the Partial Award on Costs, in view of the fact that the
Claimant was left with no alternative but to initiate the present arbitration proceedings
in order to recover the damages suffered as a result of the Respondent’s breaches of the
BIT.

Ina letter dated 15 May 2018, the ICC Secretariat informed the Parties and the Tribunal
that the total costs of arbitration fixed by the ICC Court on 14 May 2018 amounted to
USD 773,000, with a reimbursement of USD 47,000 made to the Claimant.
Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent shall pay the Claimant the
amount of USD 773,000.

iii. Legal Costs and Expenses

The Tribunal has reviewed the Parties’ legal costs and expenses which it finds

reasonable.

In light of the fact that the Claimant was successful on the merits but only partially
successful on quantum, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant should be awarded
75% of its legal costs and expenses (amounting to EUR 1,426,250.26), ic. EUR
1,069,687.7, with the Respondent bearing its own legal costs.

16. OPERATIVE PART/THE DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL

551. Based on the foregoing, having carefully reviewed all the written and oral submissions
made by the Parties in respect of the dispute between them as detailed in this Final
Award, the Arbitral Tribunal hereby declares that:

a) The Respondent has breached:

1, Its obligations under Article 2(2) of the Cyprus-Libya BIT not to
impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the
management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, expansion, or sale of
Olin’s investments; and to extend fair and equitable treatment to
Olin’s investments;

2. Its obligation under Article 3 of the Cyprus-Libya BIT to treat
Olin’s investments no less favourably than it treats the
investments of Libyan nationals; and

3. Its obligations under Article 7 of the Cyprus-Libya BIT not to
expropriate Olin’s investments, directly or indirectly, except for
a public interest, in accordance with due process of law, on a
non-discriminatory basis, and against payment of prompt,
adequate, and effective compensation.

b) The Respondent’s Counterclaim is dismissed.
552. Based on the above, the Arbitral Tribunal orders that the Respondent pay the Claimant:

a) The amount of EUR 18,225,000 as compensation for the losses suffered by
Olin as a result of Libya’s breaches of the Cyprus-Libya BIT;

b) The amount of USD 773,000 in respect of the ICC costs of arbitration,
including the amount awarded to the Claimant in the Partial Award on Costs;

ce) The amount of EUR 1,069,687.7 representing seventy-five percent (75 %) of
the Claimant’s legal costs and expenses;

d) Simple interests on all of the foregoing amounts at the commercial rate of five
percent (5%) per annum as applicable in Cyprus, from the date of signature of
this Final Award until full payment.

553. The Arbitral Tribunal rejects all other requests, claims or counterclaims submitted by
the Parties.
