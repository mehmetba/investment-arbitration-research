Tribunal

 

Arbitral Tribunal constituted on 12 November 2015

 

 

PART 1 - OVERVIEW

1. This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID”) arising out of a mining project at Mrima Hill in Kenya, said
by the Claimants to be home to one of the world's largest undeveloped niobium and rare earth

deposits.

2. The Claimants contend that their investment in this project was “nationalized” in August
2013, after they had expended six years and millions of dollars in exploration and development.
Their key asset, Special Mining Licence 351 (“SML 351”), was granted (they say) upon
completion of the conditions of their Special Prospecting Licence (“SPL 256”) but was “revoked”
after the 2013 Kenyan election by way of a Government announcement on Kenyan national
television, followed up with a Twitter post by a Cabinet Secretary of the newly elected
Government. There was no prior (or subsequent) formal notification.! The Claimants
characterize the “revocation” of SML 351 as a direct expropriation contrary to The Agreement
between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the
Government of the Republic of Kenya for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, dated 13
September 1999 (the “BIT”? or “Treaty”) and bring the present dispute under the BIT and the
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States,

which entered into force on October 14, 1966 (the “ICSID Convention’).

3. The Claimants obtained SPL 256 on 4 April 2008. It was renewed twice. Subsequent

events were closely bound up with Kenyan politics. A Kenyan general election was held on 4

Claimants’ Memorial on the Merits dated 5 May 2016, para. 4.
2 BIT, 13 September 1999, Exhibit C-17.

March 2013. SML 351 was signed three days later, on 7 March 2013, before the new President
was sworn in on 9 April 2013. SML 351 was notified in the Kenya Gazette on 22 March 2013.
However, on 5 August 2013, as part of a general review of mining licences issued between 15
January 2013 and 15 May 2013, a period referred to as the “Transition Period”, SML 351 was
“revoked” (according to the Claimants) or “suspended” (according to the Government). The need
for such a review was attributed by the Government to irregularities in the conduct of his office by

the Mining Commissioner, Moses Masibo.

4. The Kenyan Government’s position is that “there was no expropriation of the “purported
licence [SML 351]” by the Government because the licence was void ab initio for illegality and
did not exist as a matter of law, as held by the Courts in Kenya. As a result, the Government
argues, “where there is no protected investment, there can be no expropriation.”* In the alternative,

the Government says SML 351 was never revoked but merely suspended.

5. The Claimants are alleged by the Government to have known that, as a matter of statute
law, a number of key approvals and consents were required and conditions were to be satisfied
before they could be allowed to obtain a valid mining licence, including requirements arising out
of the special protected status of Mrima Hill as a forest reserve, nature reserve and national
monument. The Claimants were also required to produce a mining feasibility and an approved
Environmental Impact Assessment licence, which, according to the Government, they never did.

The Claimants’ project proposed removal of 100 million tonnes of the metal niobium and 30 million

> Respondent’s Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction dated 5 October 2016,
para. 5.

tonnes of rare earths from the reserve area. Section 4(2) of the Environmental (Impact Assessment
and Audit) Regulations, 2003, provided:

No licensing authority under any law in force in Kenya shall issue a

licence for any project for which an environmental impact

assessment is required under the Act unless the applicant produces to

the licensing authority a licence of environmental impact assessment

issued by the Authority [NEMA] under these Regulations.* (emphasis
added)

6. Instead, apparently losing patience with Kenya’s “bureaucratic process”,> the Claimants

sought political intervention from the administration of President Mwai Kibaki and engaged the
services of an intermediary (said by the Government to be unsavoury), Mr. Jacob Juma. The
Claimants’ intent, according to the Government, was to circumvent the legal obstacles and procure

a mining licence illegally.®

7. The Claimants challenged the “revocation” before the Kenyan High Court, which, on 20
March 2015, ruled that SML 351 was void ab initio on the basis, inter alia, that the mining of
Mrima Hill was by statute prohibited, and that in any event the Claimants had not satisfied the
prerequisites to comply with Kenyan law.’ The Claimants then commenced this arbitration.
Subsequently, the decision of the Kenyan High Court was upheld (on narrower grounds) by the

Kenyan Court of Appeal, which at the time was the highest court in the country.

eKLR, Judgment, 20 March 2015, RL-089.

8. The Tribunal recognizes that resource allocation was to a significant extent intertwined
with politics in Kenya in 2013, but nevertheless the regulatory system, including statutory

conditions precedent to the issuance of the mining licence, required compliance.

9. For the reasons that follow, the Tribunal concludes that the BIT protects only lawful
investments, and that the Claimants have failed to establish any compensable investment that was

lawfully issued in accordance with the laws of Kenya.

10. The prospecting licence, SPL 256, expired (after two renewals) according to its own terms

on 1 December 2014, without Government intervention.

11. SML 351 purported to confer on the Claimants an exclusive right to mine valuable minerals
for 21 years in an area that included Mrima Hill and to exclude all others from exploitation of these
public resources. The Claimants’ own evidence establishes that SML 351 was procured by their
successful political lobbying of officials of the outgoing Kibaki Government. In the Tribunal’s
view, the freshly elected Government was not bound either under domestic law or international
law by a “purported” mining licence issued under political direction in disregard of the explicit
requirements of the Kenya Mining Act and other relevant Kenyan legislation.’ The Tribunal is not
bound by the decision of the Kenyan courts but has reached the independent conclusion that SML
351 was void. It was a scrap of paper issued by an irresponsible bureaucrat contrary to specific

legislative requirements. In the circumstances, the Claimants have failed to establish the existence

8 Respondent’s Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction dated 5 October 2016,
para. 5.

of an investment that qualified for treaty protection. Accordingly, ICSID and the Tribunal lack

jurisdiction and the claim is dismissed.

12. In the alternative, if SML 351 could be said to have been issued at all, it was voidable if
not void. On that basis, accepting that the onus would then shift to the Respondent to establish
illegality, the Tribunal finds that the Government has established that SML 351 was issued
contrary to the laws of Kenya and international law and does not qualify as an investment protected

by the Treaty or the ICSID Convention.

13. In either event, the Claims are dismissed with costs.

PART 2 - THE PARTIES

14. The three Claimants in this dispute are:

(a) Cortec Mining Kenya Limited (““CMK”), a company incorporated in Kenya

with registration numberC141313;

(b) Cortec (Pty) Ltd (“Cortee UK’), a company incorporated in England and

‘Wales with company number 6156667; and

(c) Stirling Capital Limited (“Stirling”), a company incorporated in England and

Wales with company number 6224835.

CMK is majority (70%) owned by Cortec UK and Stirling. Cortec UK and Stirling were
eventually wholly owned by Pacific Wildcat (“PAW”), a Canadian company listed on the

Venture Exchange Market of the Toronto Stock Exchange.

15. The Respondent is the Republic of Kenya (the “Respondent” or the “State’’).

5

PART 3 - THE PROCEDURAL HISTORY

16. On 18 June 2018, ICSID received a request for arbitration of the same date from CMK,
Cortec and Stirling against Kenya (the “Request”). At that time, as stated, SPL 256 had already

expired in accordance with its own terms when the second renewal lapsed on 1 December 2014.

17. On 7 July 2018, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with
Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice
of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral
tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID’s Rules of Procedure for the
Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.? The Tribunal is composed of former
Judge Ian Binnie, C.C. Q.C., a national of Canada, President, appointed by agreement of his co-
arbitrators; Mr. Kanaga Dharmananda S.C., a national of Australia, appointed by the Claimants;

and Professor Brigitte Stern, a national of France, appointed by the Respondent.

18. On 12 November 2015, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID
Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “Arbitration Rules’’), notified the Parties that
all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed
to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Aissatou Diop, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated

to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

° The parties agreed to constitute a Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention consisting
of three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party and the third, presiding arbitrator, to be appointed by agreement
of the parties, failing which, by agreement of the two co-arbitrators.

6

19. In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the
Parties by teleconference on 5 February 2016, following the Parties’ agreement to extend the

period of time provided under Rule 13 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.

20. Following the first session, on 29 March 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No.
1 (“PO No. 1”) recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters and the decisions of
the Tribunal on disputed issues. PO No. 1 provides, inter alia, that the applicable Arbitration
Rules are those in effect from 10 April 2006, that the procedural language is English, and that the

place of proceeding is Dubai, the United Arab Emirates. !°

21. On 5 May 2016, the Claimants filed their Memorial on the Merits along with supporting
Witness Statements!! Exhibits C-1 to C-185, and Legal Authorities CLA-1 to CLA-44, in

accordance with PO No. 1.

22. On 5 April 2016, the Respondent filed an application requesting the Tribunal to reconsider
the procedural calendar which, the Respondent argued, would be unfairly prejudicial to it by reason
of complications arising out of the 2017 Kenyan general election. The Claimants opposed the
Respondent’s request. On 6 May 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 (“PO No.
2”) deciding, on balance, to adjust the procedural calendar of PO No. 1 to accommodate the

Kenyan elections as well as the Claimants’ interest in moving forward the arbitration process

expeditiously.

  

ets out the agreed schedule which consisted of two scenarios. Scenario One contemplated a

bifurcated process whereby jurisdiction would be dealt with as a preliminary step and merits as the next step if

jurisdiction was upheld. Scenario Two contemplated a procedure combining jurisdiction and merits in case the
did not request bi ion or its request for bift ion was not granted.

'! The Claimants filed the First Witness Statement of David Anderson dated 5 May 2016, the First Witness Statement

of Donald O’Sullivan dated 5 May 2016, and the First Witness Statement of Darren Townsend dated 5 May 2016.

7

 

23. On 23 May 2016, the Respondent submitted to the Tribunal that the Claimants had not filed
any expert evidence with respect to the quantum along with the Memorial pleading. As a result,
the Respondent requested the Tribunal to consider quantum in a separate phase of the proceeding,
after a merits phase. On 26 May 2016, the Claimants indicated that while they were open to
quantum being considered in a separate phase of the proceeding, they requested the Tribunal to
defer its decision on the issue of quantum until a decision was made on possible bifurcation of
jurisdiction from merits. The Tribunal agreed, and, on 6 June 2016, issued Procedural Order

No. 3 (“PO No. 3”) modifying the procedural calendar accordingly.

24. On 18 August 2016, the Respondent filed an application requesting the Tribunal to order
the Claimants to produce certain documents that, according to the Respondent, the Claimants had
relied on in their Memorial and accompanying witness statements but had not produced as exhibits.
The Claimants indicated that they had produced some documents to the Respondent, but declined
to produce the documents at issue in the Respondent’s application. On 9 September 2016, the
Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 (“PO No. 4”), agreeing with the Respondent that “for
the most part, in making reference to particular documents in their Memorial, the Claimants put
forward such documents as ‘evidence on which it [sic] wishes to rely’ within the meaning of
paragraph 14.2 and ‘documentary evidence relied upon by the Parties’ within the meaning of
paragraph 16.1 of PO No 1.”!? Thus, the Tribunal ordered that such documents be produced by

the Claimants, but that the rest of the documents did not need to be produced at that time.

25. In accordance with PO No. 3, the document production phase started on 9 February 2017,

when the Parties exchanged their respective requests for documents. On 5 May 2017, the Tribunal

"2 PO No. 4, para. 7.

issued Procedural Order No. 5 (“PO No. 5”), ruling on each Party’s objections to the production

of contentious document requests.

26. On 5 July 2016, the Respondent filed its notice of grounds for preliminary objections to
jurisdiction in accordance with PO No. 3. In the notice, the Respondent confirmed that it would

not be seeking a bifurcation of the procedure with respect to jurisdiction.

27. On 5 October 2016, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the Merits and
Memorial on Jurisdiction along with supporting Witness Statements,'? Exhibits R-1 to R-157,

and Legal Authorities RLA-1 to RLA-122, in accordance with PO No. 3.

28. On 25 January 2017, the Claimants filed their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction along
with supporting Witness Statements, '+ Exhibits C-186 to C-288, and Legal Authorities CLA-45 to

CLA-77, in accordance with PO No. 3.

29. The Claimants filed an application requesting the Tribunal to order the Respondent to
produce certain categories of documents in compliance with the Tribunal’s PO No. 5 on document
production, otherwise the Tribunal should disregard aspects of the Respondent’s case. The
Respondent indicated that, having made all reasonable and proper searches, it was unable to locate

PART 4 - THE MRIMA HILL PROJECT

42. Mrima Hill is located approximately 70 kilometres to the south of Mombasa in the south-
east corner of Kenya, in Kwale County. Mrima Hill covers an area of approximately 376.8
hectares and is home to a natural forest, part of a chain of coastal dry forests found in the region

which are said to be rich in biodiversity and rare species. Mrima Hill also contains sacred

areas (called “kaya’”) for the Digo, an indigenous community found in the coastal region of

Kenya.'*
43. The Government has, over the years, taken legal steps to preserve and protect Mrima
Hill:

(a) on 26 May 1961, Mrima Hill was gazetted as a forest reserve.'? The effect of
this gazettement was to restrict any activities that would adversely affect the
flora and fauna, without the express permission of the Kenya Forest Service

(“KES”);

(b) on 9 May 1989, Mrima Hill was designated as a nature reserve by the Minister
of Environment and Natural Resources.2° Under the Forests Act, nature reserves
provide an additional level of protection. All proposals for disruptive activities
within a nature reserve are subject to the consent of a forest conservation

committee;?!

(c) on 17 January 1992, in recognition of its cultural importance, the Mrima Hill

Sacred Grove was designated as a national monument under the Antiquities

18 On 8 July 2008, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation added kayas in Kwale County
to its World Heritage List as “an ing example of traditional human Which is ofa
unique interaction with the environment.” See UNESCO Decisions Adopted at the 32nd Session of the World Heritage
Committee (Quebec City, 2008) (Extract), Exhibit R-003. See also Miriam Gathigah, “On Kenya’s Coast, a Struggle
for the Sacred”, Inter Press Service News Agency, 23 June 2015, Exhibit R-064.

This classification as a national monument was confirmed by further notice in

1994;>4

(d) on 21 February 1997, the Mining Commissioner issued a Gazette notice under
the Mining Act prohibiting all prospecting and mining in the Kwale District which

includes Mrima Hill.?>
(a) The Claimants Initiate Their Project

44. One of the Claimants’ principal promoters of the Mrima Hill project, Mr. David Anderson,
the eventual Managing Director of CMK, testified that he first became aware of Mrima Hill from
the CEO of a South African mining company, Robbie Louw,”° who described it as a potentially
rich niobium and rare earths deposit. Acting on this tip, Mr. Anderson and a colleague, Mr. Don
O’Sullivan, also an eventual Director of CMK, decided to incorporate a company in Kenya (now
CMK) and apply for prospecting permission to carry out the exploration activities needed to
gain a better understanding of the mineralisation at Mrima Hill.?” “Rare Earths Elements”

(“REEs’’) is a phrase used to describe the group of 15 chemical elements in the “lanthanide

group”?* for which demand has grown dramatically in the past two decades, in large part

due to their expanding use in advanced technologies.

45. Many of the devices that contain REEs are manufactured in China — a country that at
that time (2007) was supplying the vast majority of the global REE market and whose REE

export quotas and duties were causing prices of rare earth products to spike.”?

46. Niobium is a rare metal, rather than a rare earth. Although niobium has many uses,
most of it (as much as 90% of global niobium production) is used in the manufacture of

specialized steel products.

(b) The Kenyan Mining Legislation

47. At all relevant times, mining activity in Kenya was regulated under the Mining Act,
Chapter 306 (the “Mining Act’)*® and subsidiary regulations. Mining was also subject to
compliance with other Kenyan statutes. The Mining Act allowed for a hierarchy of mining

rights and _ licences which were summarized by the Claimants as follows:

 

Right/Licencetype | Description

 

Prospecting right The holder is entitled to search or “‘prospect”*! for mineralised
areas. The right is usually granted in relation to a particular area
specified in the application subject to various exclusions and
limitations included within the Mining Act (e.g. no prospecting
on burial grounds).

 

 

8 The 15 ides are cerium, praseodymium, ium, ium, samarium, .
gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium and lutetium. The elements yttrium and
scandium are usually added to the “rare earth” group, to bring it to a total of 17 elements.

2° BMGS Report, 1 September 2013, Exhibit C-124, p. 41.

30 Mining Act, Exhibit CL-002.

31 The expression “to prospect” is defined in Section 2 of the Mining Act as “to search for minerals and includes
such working as is reasonably necessary to enable the prospector to test the mineral-bearing qualities of the
land.” (Mining Act, Exhibit CL-002).

16

 

Prospecting licence

The holder of a prospecting licence (as distinguished from a
prospecting right) is entitled to conduct detailed geological
investigations over all or part of the area for which the
applicant has a prospecting right.

 

 

 

Mining licence The holder is entitled to carry out mining activities in areas
covered by the licence.
(Source: Claimants’ Memorial, para. 20)
48. The Claimants were able to obtain enough research data for Mrima Hill from earlier

explorations to warrant further preliminary geological investigations, principally from Anglo

American in the 1950s and then by Pechiney Saint-Gobain in the late 1960s**. The Claimants’

consultant, Sound Mining Solutions (Pty.) Ltd. (“SMS”) in its report of September 201179 (“SMS

First Report”) summarized the earlier data as follows:

(c) The Special Prospecting Right

Prospecting rights (preliminary to a prospecting licence) are granted under Section

of the Mining Act™ and confer the privileges set out at Section 14 thereof.**

“Mining Act, Exhibit RL-104. Section 13 of the Mining Act provides as follows:

(1) The Commissioner or an officer duly authorized by him in that behalf may issue to any person a
prospecting right in the prescribed form upon the payment of the prescribed fee:
Provided that a prospecting right shall not be granted —
(i) to any person who is under eighteen years of age;
(ii) to any person who, in the opinion of the Commissioner, is unable to understand the provisions of this
Act and the regulations;
(iii) to any person to whom there has previously been issued either in his own name or as agent for any
individual, company, body of persons or partnership a prospecting right which has not been surrendered
or cancelled and which is in all other respects still valid.
(2) A prospecting right may be granted to an individual as agent for another individual if such agent is
the lawfully constituted attorney of such individual.
(a) A prospecting right shall not be granted to a company, body of persons or partnership as such, but may
be granted to an individual as agent of the company, body of persons or partnership. (emphasis added)
(b) In such case, the application for the prospecting right must be made by the individual in person, who
must either be the lawfully constituted attorney of the company, body of persons or partnership or produce
an application in writing for the grant of the prospecting right to the individual as agent for the company,
body of persons or partnership, signed by a director or responsible manager of the company, or by all
the members of the body of persons or by every member of the partnership.
(c) Such application shall contain an undertaking by the company or by every member comprising the
body of persons or by every member of the partnership with the Government to be responsible for the
acts and omissions of the individual, who shall also be responsible for his own acts and omissions.
(4) A prospecting right shall not be transferable, and shall be in force for a period of one year from the date
of issue, but may be renewed for a period of one year from the date of expiration thereof or from the
expiration of any renewal thereof upon application being made in the prescribed form and upon payment of
the prescribed fee.
(5) A prospecting right shall be produced whenever demanded by the owner or occupier of private land on
which the holder thereof is prospecting, or by any administrative officer, officer of the Mines and Geological
Department or police officer.
(6) Deleted by Act No. 18 of 1986, Sch.
(7) The Commissioner may at any time require the holder of a prospecting right to give security in such sum
as he may consider necessary, and to deposit such sum with the Provincial Commissioner of such province
as the Commissioner may specify. (emphasis added).

 

  

      

38 Mining Act, RL-104. Section 14 of the Mining Act (“Prospecting right privileges”) provides as follows:

 

Subject to the exceptions contained in section 7 and to the regulations and to the provisions of any law as to
forests or as to the regulation of natural water supplies, the holder of a prospecting right may —
(a) by himself, his agents and his servants —

S51. On 10 April 2007, the Claimants reserved the name “Cortec Mining Kenya Ltd.” with

the Kenyan Registrar of Companies.*°

(i) The Claimants’ Position on the Holder of the Prospecting Right

52. On 5 May 2007, the Claimants formally engaged Harie Ndung’u, an individual

recommended by the then Mining Commissioner Lojomon K. Biwott, as CMK’s agent to apply

(i) prospect on any land in Kenya for any minerals, except diamonds, unless the Commissioner endorses
on the prospecting right authority to prospect for diamonds; any such authority may be refused by
the Commissioner without assigning any reason and, in any case in which such authority is granted, the
Commissioner may —
(a) limit such authority to any specified area of land or to the time during which it shall remain in force,
or both;
(b) make such authority subject to any terms and conditions which he, in his absolute discretion,
deems fit:
Provided that the holder of a prospecting right shall not prospect in a forest area or game
reserve unless he has first given notice to the officer in charge of such area or reserve and complies
with the conditions lawfully imposed by such officer;
(ii) whilst engaged in bona fide prospecting, erect on any unoccupied land his camp and such buildings
or machinery as may be necessary for the purpose of prospecting, on payment or tender of a reasonable
sum in payment therefor;
(iii) make excavations, sink shafts or wells, drive adits or levels or dig trenches;
(iv) on any land not excluded from prospecting take for the purposes of bona fide prospecting or for
his domestic use water from any lake, river or stream, and, with the consent of the owner or occupier
of private land or on tendering to the owner or occupier a reasonable sum in payment therefor, any fuel
other than standing timber:
Provided that he shall not divert water from any river, stream or watercourse without the consent of the
authority having control thereof;
(v) graze upon lands not excluded from prospecting such horses or other animals as may be necessary
for his subsistence or for the carrying on of prospecting or mining, on payment or tender of a reasonable
sum in payment therefor;
(vi) build installations and other devices for protecting and, where the prospecting is done within the
exclusive economic zone, create safety areas around such installations or devices;
(b) by himself —
(i) create a protection area;
(ii) apply for an exclusive prospecting licence; and
(iii) peg locations. (emphasis added).

for CMK’s prospecting right and, in due course, a prospecting licence, as well as to use his

geological expertise to assist in prospecting activities on Mrima Hill.*”

53. The Claimants contend that on 15 May 2007, Mr. Ndung’u applied for the prospecting
right as agent for CMK, a company to be incorporated and the required fees were paid.** The

Prospecting Right (No. 8258) was granted on the same day by Commissioner Biwott.*”

54. CMK was not formally incorporated as a Kenyan company until almost two months later,
on 4 July 2007.*° Nevertheless, the Claimants contend that the beneficial interest in No. 8258 was

always held by Mr. Ndung’u for a company “to be incorporated” and, after 4 July 2007, for CMK.

(ii) The Government’s Position

55. The Government argues that Mr. Ndung’u acquired the prospecting right in his own right
and conferred no entitlement on the Claimants or their future corporate vehicle. While s. 13(2) of
the Mining Act contemplates application by individuals as agents of “a company, body of persons
or partnership”, this expression does not include a non-existent company “to be incorporated” in

the future such as CMK.

56. Moreover, according to the Government, the Claimant’ reliance on Prospecting Right No.

8258 in this arbitration contradicts the position advanced by CMK to the Nairobi High Court in

37 David Anderson First Witness Statement, paras. 33-36; email from Mr. David Anderson, CMK, to M. Njiri, et al, 4
May 2007, Exhibit C-29.

the Mrima Hill judicial review proceedings in which Mr. Juma stated in his affidavit (provided

in his capacity as a director of CMK):

a. The prospecting right number 8258...was applied for and issued to
Mr. Ndung’u. It was not applied for or issued to [CMK];

b. [CMK] needed not have applied for the statutory consents in respect of
the prospecting right issued to Mr. Ndung’u as it was not the applicant
of that right and had not been incorporated...; and

c. The prospecting right issued to Mr. Ndung’u has never been transferred
or assigned to [CMK] nor does [CMK] claim any right thereunder.*!

57. In short, the Government notes that pursuant to section 13(4) of the Mining Act, the

prospecting right was not transferable by Mr. Ndung’u to CMK.

(iti) The Tribunal’s Ruling on Ownership of the Prospecting Right

58. It is clear that whatever was done by Mr. Ndung’u was done pursuant to his agreement
with, and on the instructions of, the promoters Mr. Anderson and Mr. O’ Sullivan, on behalf of a

company to be incorporated. Mr. Ndung’u was never intended to be the beneficial owner.

59. The point is in any event largely irrelevant as the subsequent disputes focused on the special
prospecting licence SPL 256 and the special mining licence SML 351 which were not dependant

on the prospecting right No. 8258. The licences at issue were clearly in the name of CMK.

(d) The Claimants Solicit Political Support

60. CMK sought political assistance. As the Claimants state in their Memorial:

...the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources issued a letter
to the Provincial Commissioner for Coast Province asking him to

August 2013, Exhibit R-065, para. 7.

21

assist the holder of the prospecting right in obtaining “mining consent”
from Kwale County Council (Letter from Ministry of Environment and
Natural Resources to the Provincial Commissioner for Coast Province,
Exhibit C-131). Concurrently, the Office of the President of Kenya
wrote to the Clerk of the County Council of Kwale, directing that the
County Council grant CMK's agent Mr Ndung’u “consent to prospect
right away.”?

61. The Claimants were clearly effective at the political level. However, this case ultimately

turns on their success (or lack of it) in respect of compliance with the law.

 

PART 5 - THE CLAIMANT:
256

” ACQUISITION OF SPECIAL PROSPECTING LICENCE

62. Prospecting licences are granted under Section 17 of the Mining Act* which provides

that:

(4) Any special licence granted under this section shall be subject to all the
terms and conditions contained therein and to all the provisions of this Act

* Letter from Office of the President of Kenya to the Clerk of the County Council of Kwale, 15 May 2007, Exhibit C-
132.
43 Section 17 of the Mining Act (“Authority to prospect or mine on land reopened after exclusion under section 7(1)(j)”).
RL-104, provides as follows:
(1) When any land has been excluded by the Commissioner from prospecting and mining under paragraph (j)
of subsection (1) of section 7, the Commissioner may, by notice in the Gazette, declare the whole or any part of
such land to be reopened to prospecting or mining or both.
(2) Upon such reopening, the Commissioner may, by notice in the Gazette, declare that the whole or such part
of the land as is reopened may be prospected or mined, or both, in accordance with—
(a) the provisions of this Act and the regulations; or
(b) a special licence which, notwithstanding the provisions of this Act and the regulations, may contain
such terms and conditions as the Commissioner in his discretion may determine.
(3) Without in any way restricting or fettering the discretion of the Commissioner granted by paragraph (b) of
subsection (2), a special licence may contain terms and conditions in respect of the following matters—
(a) area:
(b) the minerals which may be prospected for, or mined, and the methods of prospecting, or mining, to be
adopted;
(c) rents, royalties and fees;
(d) labour;
(e) form and period of such licence.
(4) Any special licence granted under this section shall be subject to all the terms and conditions contained therein
and to all the provisions of this Act and the regulations, except in so far as the terms and conditions contained in
such licence expressly provide for non-compliance with any provisions of this Act and the regulations.
(emphasis added.)

 

 

22

and the regulations, except in so far as the terms and conditions
contained in such licence expressly provide for non-compliance with
any provisions of this Act and the regulations. (emphasis added)

63. Mrima Hill had been closed in 1997 to mining by a previous Mining Commissioner, but it

was within the power of Mining Commissioner Biwott to reverse a Mining Act closure.

64. The position of the Government, denied by the Claimants, is that as Mrima Hill had
been excluded from prospecting or mining activities not only by the Mining Commissioner
but as well as by legislation protective of nature reserves, forestry and national monuments,
all of these exclusions had to be addressed by authorities other than the Mining Commissioner

before a prospecting licence could be issued.

65. On 22 May 2007, Mr. Ndung’u applied for an exclusive prospecting licence over
the same area as covered by the prospecting right.** In the application form, Mr. Ndung’u is
identified as agent of CMK, and CMK is identified as the company (“‘miner’’) on whose behalf
the application was made (although it was not formally incorporated until 4 July 2007).*°
A work programme was submitted with the application, setting out the prospecting activities
that CMK intended to conduct. Oddly enough, despite the Claimants’ focus on Mrima Hill,
Commissioner Biwott notified CMK on 2 November 2007 that “you are going to be considered

for a free area of approximately 1180km?, excluding the Mrima Hill Nature Reserve.”*° The

Claimants were therefore aware at least by November 2007 that the status of Mrima Hill as a

nature reserve presented a statutory obstacle. The evidence is that the nature reserve included the

full extent of the area of Mrima Hill of interest to the Claimants.

66. In addition, the Claimants were required, as a condition of obtaining a prospecting licence,

to obtain the support of the local Kwale people through the Kwale County Council.

67. The Claimants argue, that on 16 May 2007, Mr. Ndung’u obtained from the Kwale
County Council consent to prospect in the area covered by Prospecting Right No. 8258.*7
However, the form of consent indicates that it was issued to “‘HARIE KINOSTHE NDUNG’U
HEREINAFTER called the Miner”;** and Mr. Ndung’u testified that the “consent by Kwale

County Council was again issued in my name.”*? As stated above, however, the Tribunal proceeds

on the basis that what was being done by Mr. Ndung’u was done for the benefit of the Claimants.

(a) The Authority of the Mining Commissioner Over “Excluded Lands”

68. The Government argues that “excluded lands” can only be reopened by a formal gazetting
procedure by the Ministry responsible for the original exclusion. A “nature reserve” and forestry
reserve can only be re-opened by the Ministry of Forestry. A “national monument” can only be
opened to prospecting or mining by the National Museums of Kenya (“NMK”). The Mining

Commissioner has no such authority in respect of the closures effected by these other ministries.

69. The Claimants argue that any such “excluded lands” could be dealt with by the

Commissioner of Mines and Geology. The Commissioner may declare that formerly

24

excluded land may be prospected and/or mined in accordance with a “special licence” under
Section 17(2)(b) of the Mining Act. The re-opening procedure set out in Section 17(2)(b)°
was sufficient in their view to clear any bar to the issuance of a prospecting licence or a

mining licence posed by “exclusions” against prospecting on Mrima Hill.

70. The Claimants’ legal expert, (former) Justice Edward Torgbor, indicated that in such
circumstances, the Mining Commissioner should take a “prudent approach” and “act
consistently with the consent requirements of other relevant laws and regulations in

the exercise of this unfettered discretion.”>!

As will be seen, the Tribunal’s view is that the
Commissioner would only act “consistently with the consent requirements of other relevant laws
and regulations” (to repeat the language of Justice Torgbor) by insisting on the required approvals
prior to issuing licences.

(b) The Claimants Proceeded (with the Permission of the Mining Commissioner) with
Prospecting Work while its Application for a Prospecting Licence was still Pending

71. While CMK's application for a prospecting licence was pending, CMK with the
agreement of Commissioner Biwott, conducted “preliminary prospecting/reconnaissance
surveys.”°* This reconnaissance was limited to areas alongside the existing roads and

forestry tracks on Mrima Hill which had largely been opened up during the earlier prospecting

efforts of Anglo American in the 1950s.

72. The Claimants’ geologist, Mr. Mike Saner, noted that, although Anglo American had
earlier identified the niobium potential of the area, “Anglo did not examine or report on
the rare earth potential there.””>* (As mentioned earlier, however, Mr. Anderson knew from
his South African contact, Mr. Robbie Louw, of the rare earth potential which had been
identified by a firm called Binge as early as 1955.)°4 Mr. Saner provided his Report on 7

July 2008.55

73. On 30 November 2007 (in Gazette Notice 11829), notice was given of CMK’s
application for a special prospecting licence. On the same day, Commissioner Biwott issued
a notice of the re-opening of Mrima Hill for prospecting and mining under Section
17(2)(b) of the Mining Act (Gazette Notice 11830).°° As previously noted, the
Government’s position is that Commissioner Biwott’s authority to “reopen” lands was
limited to lands previously “excluded” under the Mining Act. He could not remove the
protection granted to Mrima Hill as a forest and nature reserve nor circumvent the Mrima Hill kaya

status as a national monument.

(c) The Special Prospecting Licence 256 (SPL 256) was Issued to CMK on 4 April
2008

74. On 4 April 2008, Commissioner Biwott issued a Special Prospecting Licence (“SPL
256”)°*” to CMK. (The licence was classified as “special” because it covered an area that

included land which had been re-opened in accordance with Section 17 of the Mining Act.)

75. The Government does not now allege any irregularities in the issuance of SPL 256°* which
required CMK to “prepare a mine feasibility report” and an Environmental Impact Assessment

Study before applying for a mining licence.”?

76. Although, as noted, section 17(4) of the Mining Act allows the Mining Commissioner in
the prospecting licence itself “to provide for non-compliance with any provision of this Act and

the regulations”, SPL 256 did not provide for any such non-compliance.

57 SPL 256, Exhibit C-6.
58 Mr. Sanderson, Tr. Day 1, p. 131, Il. 14-15, (“We have no evidence of irregular conduct [affecting SPL 256], we
are not making that submission.”) See also Claimants’ Rejoinder, paras. 68-75. The issue of the Prospecting Right
has now fallen away (see Claimants’ Rejoinder, paras. 63-69) — the Kenyan law experts agree that the grant of a
Special Prospecting Licence did not require a valid prospecting right and, in any event, Mr. Ndung’u confirmed that
descriptions of him as CMK’s “agent” were accurate (Tr. Day 4, p. 136, 1. 20).
°° SPL 256 required CMK to comply with the mandatory conditions of the Mining Investment Road Map including:
Special Licence No. 256
Messrs Cortec Mining Kenya Limited
Phase I
Carry out systemic trenching and pitting in the licence area to establish target areas.
Phase II
Based on the results from phase I, undertake detailed geological investigations on the target areas to establish
mineable deposits.
Phase III
Prepare a mine feasibility report and undertake an Environmental Impact Assessment Study before
apply for a mining lease. (emphasis added)
(Claimants’ Memorial on the Merits dated 5 May 2016, para. 35).

 

27

77. The Claimants assert, and the Government denies, that fulfilment of the conditions to SPL
256 would give CMK a future entitlement to a mining licence over the same area. Clause 22 of

SPL 256 provided that:

The Licensee having observed all its obligations hereunder shall be
entitled to such further or other rights over the Area or any part or
parts of the Area or to the grant of a Special Mining Lease or
Leases for a period not exceeding twenty-one (21) years as provided
by the [Mining] Act.® (emphasis added)

78. The Government contends that CMK did not observe “all its obligations” under SPL 256
and therefore never became entitled to “a special mining lease or leases.” As will be seen, the

Tribunal agrees with the Government that CMK was never entitled to a Special Mining Licence.

79. In the months that followed the issuance of SPL 256, CMK did make some progress in its
assessment of potential mineralization. Mr. Anderson sent Commissioner Biwott a copy of
the earlier Anglo American report. CMK hired Mr. Said Hussein, a Kenyan geologist who
had previously held a senior position at the Department of Mines and Geology (“DMG”)°!

to conduct further prospecting activities.

80. The Claimants planned to raise finance through a company called African Strategic
Minerals Limited (“ASMINB”), in which Mr. O’Sullivan had an interest.” Terra Search, an

Australian firm based in Perth, was then instructed to carry out initial modelling of the ore body.

© SPL 256, Exhibit C-006, Clause 22. The Government notes that Clause 22 refers to “Special Mining Lease or
Leases” and does not refer to licences.

28

81. Terra Search studied the set of exploration data provided by CMK, including the data
in the Anglo American report, and produced its own report in December 2009° which
estimated that “the in ground value of the resource would be between US $2.8 and US $6 billion.”
64 Terra Search also produced a three-dimensional graphic of the niobium ore body at Mrima
Hill and recommended that CMK conduct further drilling at a depth of at least 30 meters (and
up to 100 meters), including some diamond drilling. Terra Search also noted that drilling 50
holes in the areas of the best pit results would allow a comparison to be made with the

previous pit results and potentially confirm the earlier results.

82. The significance of the 2009 Terra Search Report is much disputed. The Claimants
portray it as the turning point for the project which “turned Mrima Hill from a ‘maybe’ into a
certainty.”°° The Respondent’s expert, Dr. Neal Rigby, however states “the work that Terra Search
undertook did nothing of the sort.”© The Terra Search Report itself concludes that “[t]he
preliminary modelling is rudimentary and needs further work on the ground and with the model
to be conclusive or accurate.”®* In Dr. Rigby’s view, the report “did little more than indicate
the potential of substantial niobium resources with rare earth upside, which would need to be

subject to substantially more exploration.”©

83. The Claimants did not call any equivalent expert evidence to respond to Dr. Rigby’s

dismissive assessment of the 2009 Terra Search Report.

PART 6 - THE CLAIMANTS ALLEGE BUREAUCRATIC OBSTRUCTION

84. The Claimants say that they were delayed in the progress of CMK's exploration work
at Mrima Hill by an emerging pattern of bureaucratic obstruction (or simply foot-dragging)

which necessitated an application for a one year-extension of SPL 256.”

(a) The Claimants Alleged Problems

85. Mr. Anderson testified that by 2009 CMK's relationship with certain Government
agencies began to deteriorate.”! In one instance, armed Kenya Forest Service (KFS)
officers denied Mr. Anderson and a potential investor access to part of the area covered by
SPL 256.7? (The Government points out that Mrima Hill was a forest reserve which as of that
date had not been “reopened” by the Ministry of Forestry, and was therefore off limits to
yr

prospecting.)’~ Mr. Anderson was later to write to KFS to acknowledge that CMK was not “aware

7 On 6 November 2009, Mr. Anderson wrote to Commissioner Rop to request a one-year extension of SPL
256, explaining:
As detailed in our report and si

 

ated in our Chairman, Don O'Sullivan's, letter to you, we have
encountered considerable delays and obstructions in our exploration of our Mrima Hill SPL 256
and from discussions we have had together you will understand that these delays have cost us not only
financially, but also in time and effort. For this reason we would like to request of your office that
our licence is extended for 1 year in order for us to make up for the time lost with the delays imposed
upon us. This will give us the opportunity to prove up the niobium and rare earth resources. As
Don O'Sullivan pointed out we could be creating a major mining resource for Kenya and enormous
benefits forthe community. (emphasis added)

 

 

(See letter from Mr. David Anderson, CMK, to Dr. Bernard Rop, Commissioner of Mining and Geology, 6 November
2009, Exhibit C-41; David Anderson First Witness Statement, para. 58.)

7! David Anderson First Witness Statement, para. 54.

” David Anderson First Witness Statement, paras. 54-56.

73 The Government says the reason why CMK was denied access to Mrima Hill by KFS officials was that CMK
had no right to conduct any prospecting activities in the area. As Mr. Esau Omollo (Senior Deputy Director of
KFS) testified, “[t]he reason CMK was not allowed into Mrima Hill at this time is that it was excluded from

 

30

of the procedures of the Forests Act that we overlooked...being in the exploration phases of
our project and not having extensive personnel on the coastal project we were placed in positions

where we were pressured into hasty and possibly injudicious decisions.””

86. Progress was slower than expected. Mr. Anderson and Mr. O’Sullivan were concerned
that SPL 256,”> might not be renewed. They addressed their concerns to the new Mining
Commissioner, Dr. Bernard Rop but Dr. Rop did not reply. However, on 18 November 2009, Mr.
Anderson received an email from A.K. Chumba, on behalf of Commissioner Rop, stating that
“after the expiry of [SPL 256] you will be required to relinquish half of the licence area including
Mrima Hills [sic].””° Mr. Anderson testified that on 30 November 2009, he learned that Andrew
Kimani, a “well-connected Kenyan businessman”, had been making visits to Mrima Hill since
June/July 20097’ and one of his associates, Sammy Mwanyas, reportedly took five tonnes of
samples from the site.”*> This was contrary to the exclusive rights purportedly granted to CMK

under SPL 256.

87. The Claimants contend that there was a clear connection between the interest an influential
local businessman was showing in the Mrima Hill project and the increasingly unhelpful treatment

that CMK was receiving from the Government (including the disputed actions of the KFS).

SPL 256. The KFS officers were correct to deny access to this protected area.” It seems that no consent from KFS
was sought by CMK until 2010 in the context of CMK’s application to renew SPL 256. (Esau O. Omollo Witness
Statement, para. 18)

88. KFS subsequently agreed to some prospecting on stated conditions, but (as will be seen)

never agreed to mining activities within the forest reserve or nature reserve.

(b) The Creation of the Mrima Technical Committee

89. In December 2010, the Mrima Technical Committee (“MTC”) was established including

members of KFS, NMK and National Environment Management Authority (“NEMA”).

90. In March 2011, the MTC produced a situation report on CMK’s prospecting activities.”

The report summarized “[c]oncerns over uncontrolled prospecting for mineral and forest

destruction at Mrima Hill.”*°

91. The report stated that CMK had been conducting prospecting works without seeking the
prior authority of KFS and NMK, as required under the terms of SPL 256. The report states that

“Ti]t was clear that work had been going on without reference to NMK. It was also observed that

81

some pits were in a sensitive ritual area. In other words, CMK was being warned that its

activities were encroaching on lands protected as a national [cultural] monument.

92. Moreover, the report concluded that:

Cortec...chose to ignore the legal requirements that the proponent is
required to submit an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
report to the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA)
and obtain the authority's approval of the report prior to commencing
exploration works...The license that was issued to [CMK]...was

explicit on this requirement. However, this was not done.*? (emphasis
added)

93. On 7 October 2010, the Kenyan newspaper, the Daily Nation, reported comments from a

local Kwale group, the Kaya Mrima Self Help Group (“KMSHG”) that:

“Huge trees have been felled, and according to kaya elder and chairman
of Kaya Mrima Self-Help group Omari Alale, the exploration for
minerals is worrying because the company is not doing what it
promised to do.

As we see the situation now, the work is going against the conditions
set. They have brought in big earth movers in the forest to open up the
roads and the machines have caused untold damage.

If the trend continues, we will have no forest to talk of, let alone the
sacred forest where the secrets of the Digo community have been
safeguarded,” Mr. Alawe said in a letter dated August 28, and
addressed to Dr. Bernard Rop, the commissioner of Mines and Geology.**
(emphasis added)

 

94. On 10 August 2011, KMSHG commenced legal proceedings seeking a halt to CMK’s

prospecting activities and obtained a temporary injunction restraining the Commissioner from any

further renewal of CMK’s prospecting licence.**

Reserve and Gazetted National Monument, Coast Province, March 2011,, Exhibit R-071 pp. 13-14.
83 The Government also quotes an October 2010, the Daily Nation article alleging that “[h]uman activity and the
quest for precious metals are once again piling pressure on heritage sites.” (Mazera Ndurya, “Experts raise the
red flag over forest loss”, Daily Nation, 7 October 2010, Exhibit R-072.)

support of the application, a local elder stated that:
...Severe acts of destruction have been occasioned on the Kaya Mrima, such as the felling of sacred
trees and the digging of deep shafts...the sacred shrine of the Digo community that is protected by
several gazette notices has been and continues to be destroyed.

33

95. On 12 August 2011, the Mombasa High Court issued a further injunction ordering a stay

of CMK’s activities under prospecting licence SPL 256.*°

96. In or around August 2011, Mr. Michuki, the Minister of Environment and Mineral
Resources, directed CMK to stop prospecting for minerals until the dispute with the local
community was resolved. Mr. Michuki stated that “[n]o prospecting will continue until the
community’s concerns over the project have been addressed.”*° On 17 August 2011, Pacific
Wildcat (the parent company of the Claimants) entered into a memorandum of understanding®”

with the Chairman of the KMSHG, Mr. Juma Dari Omari, intended to resolve outstanding issues.

(i) The Claimants’ Position on Bureaucratic Obstruction

97. The Claimants sought political relief from what they regarded as lack of
cooperation in the bureaucracy. As early as 2009, Mr. Anderson had sought intervention

from Minister Michuki to resolve the problems encountered by CMK.** In the same period, the

R-076.
88 In this letter, Mr. Anderson stated that:
It would now appear obvious as to why Mines and Geological Department do not wish us to have
Mrima Hill as part of our licence. It is a fact that certain Kenyan parties are sampling Mrima Hill,
have been doing some form of exploration work and have access to Cortec Mining Kenya's
confidential documents. A Mr. Andrew Mwangi Kimani and Mr. Sammy Mwanyas have visited
Mrima Hill on 3 occasions, the latest where they took about 5 tons of samples from Mrima Hill and
our SPL area for testing and, according to these persons, to be forwarded to clients or partners in
Germany.

 

 
   

(Letter from Mr. David Anderson to Hon. John Michuki, Minister of Environment and Mineral Resources, 14
December 2009, Exhibit C-43).

34

Claimants also sought political assistance from the Honourable Omar Zonga, Member of

Parliament for the Lunga Lunga Constituency (in which Mrima Hill is located).*°

98. A meeting was arranged with the then Prime Minister of Kenya, Mr. Raila Odinga”
on 7 January 2010.°! According to Mr. Anderson’s testimony, Prime Minister Odinga
summoned the Mining Commissioner Rop who agreed in principle to grant the extension of

SPL 256 that CMK had sought the previous November.””

99. Having obtained high-level political support, CMK then submitted its application

for the renewal of SPL 256 on 25 February 2010.%*

100. The geographic limits of the renewed licence were enlarged to include Mrima Hill. It is
not clear what prompted Commissioner Rop’s abandonment of his predecessor’s opposition dated

2 November 2007 to the grant of a prospecting licence in the Mrima Hill “nature reserve”.
(ii) The Government's Response to Allegations of Bureaucratic Obstruction

101. |The Government denies that CMK’s lack of progress at Mrima Hill was a consequence of
the bureaucracy.”* In its view, the lack of progress was due to CMK’s lack of compliance with

the regulatory rules. Thus:

(a) opposition from the Kenya Forestry Service as a result of CMK conducting
illegal activities in the Mrima Hill area where CMK had no KFS authorisation to

prospect;?>

(b) opposition from local Kwale community leaders who had not been properly

consulted on CMK's activities and who were “mistreated” by CMK;

(c) CMK was attempting to move ahead without complying with the terms of SPL 256
which required consents from both KFS (as Mrima Hill was a forest reserve and
a nature reserve) and from the National Museums of Kenya (as Mrima Hill

was a gazetted national monument); and

(d) CMK was not taking seriously its obligation to obtain an Environmental Impact

Assessment licence.

102. Eventually, on 25 January 2010, the Ministry of Forestry and Wildlife (the Ministry with
oversight of KFS) issued CMK with a consent to prospect within Mrima Hill.°° The consent was
valid for one year and was subject to a number of conditions, notably that CMK was “to
restrict its sampling to the existing pits.”°” Mr. Esau Omollo, Senior Deputy Director of KFS,
testified that “[n]o consent was ever issued by KFS allowing CMK to create new track or to

excavate new pits.” As mentioned, CMK admitted in correspondence dated 15 January 2012 that

it had “overlooked” procedures of the Forests Act and that CMK had made “hasty and possibly

injudicious decisions.”

103. On 9 February 2010, NMK issued a letter of no objection in response to CMK's
application for an extension of SPL 256 to continue some prospecting activities in Mrima Hill.”
However, NMK insisted on a number of conditions in order to minimize the risk of interference
with the national monument site. According to the Government, these conditions, too, were

“overlooked” by CMK.
(iii) | The Tribunal’s View on Bureaucratic Obstruction Versus Political Intervention

104. The fact that CMK sought political intervention to try to speed things up is understandable.
However, the Tribunal’s focus is on the legal requirements not the politics of the situation. By its
express terms, SPL 256 required CMK to conduct a “mine feasibility report” and an
“Environmental Impact Assessment Study” before applying for a mining licence. These

conditions were imposed on SPL 256 by authority of s. 17 of the Mining Act and s. 4(2) of the

 

Envi 1 Impact (A ent and Audit) Regul

105. No amount of frustration with the bureaucracy excused CMK from non-performance of

these legal conditions, nor could non-performance be waived by the politicians.

°8 See letter from Mr. David Anderson, CMK to Mr. David Mbugua of KFS dated 15 January 2012, Exhibit R-045;
Esau O. Omollo Witness Statement, para. 21. The Government says that the suggestion at para. 47 of the Memorial
on the Merits that the renewal of SPL 256 gave CMK “the ability to open new pits for prospecting” is misleading.
This could only be done if, as both the text of SPL 256 and the evidence of Mr. Omollo make clear, an Environmental
Impact Assessment was conducted and approved by the relevant authorities. See also Esau O. Omollo Witness
Statement, paras. 26-27.

PART 7 - CMK OBTAINS A FIRST RENEWAL OF SPL 256

106. On 16 April 2010, Commissioner Rop issued CMK with [the first] renewal of SPL 256
valid for a further term of two years.'°° The renewal now purported to permit CMK for the first
time to conduct exploration and sampling within what was (accurately) described as the Mrima
Hill nature reserve subject to the seven conditions set out therein which were designed to

minimize the environmental impact of prospecting on Mrima Hill as follows:!°!

(i) Observe the cultural and biodiversity values of the reserve

(ii) Restrict sampling to the existing pits. Opening of new pits will be
subject to undertaking an Environmental Impact Assessment

(iii) Cover any open prospecting pits when not in use and have them sealed
at the at the end of the exploration programme

(iv) Ensure no waste is dumped within the forest reserve

(v) Not to fell trees or construct any structures within the forest without
seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals.

(vi) Undertake tree planting in the open areas within the prospecting sites
after completion of the exercise

(vii) Together with meeting licence condition number 10, undertake
regular updates of the prospecting activities to the Kenya Forest Service,
the National Museums of Kenya, and the Kenya wildlife Service.
(emphasis added)

107. This [first] renewal of SPL 256 would expire in accordance with its terms on 16 April 2012

unless further renewed.

PART 8 - CORPORATE REORGANIZATION

PART 9 - CMK OBTAINS A SECOND EXTENSION OF SPL 256

111. In November 2011, CMK applied for a further renewal of SPL 256.!°7 On 25 November
2011, this second renewal was approved by the then Acting Commissioner of Mines and Geology,
Mr. Moses Masibo, with the result that SPL 256 was extended for a further three years (effective

from 1 December 2011 to 1 December 2014). !°°

112. At this point, CMK was still not in a position to satisfy the conditions of its “obligations

hereunder”! of SPL 256 which included:

(a) compliance with all relevant environmental regulations (Clauses 14, 15 and 16

of SPL 256);
(b) preparation of a compliant “mine feasibility report” (Phase III of SPL 256);

(c) “fulfilment of all the Conditions of this Licence and the provisions of the Act
and [not “or”] to the satisfaction of the Commissioner” (Clause 21 of SPL 256);

and

(d) payment of compensation to affected landowners (Clause 23 of SPL 256).

113. By 2011, the Claimants were working out a more comprehensive plan to exploit the
resources of Mrima Hill. For niobium, they proposed to construct a recovery and
processing plant on land adjacent to Mrima Hill, the first phase of which was to be a pilot
plant.''° The plan was then to construct a ferroniobium (“FeNb”) plant near the port in

Mombasa.!!!

114. CMK engaged various technical and financial experts and consultants. As
mentioned, the South African firm, Sound Mining Solutions (“SMS”), was engaged as lead
consultant for this process.'!* SMS prepared a three-dimensional model of the ore body at
Mrima Hill.'!? The model showed a larger niobium resource than that presented in the

earlier three-dimensional model prepared by Terra Search.

115. For REEs, the plan was ultimately to construct three facilities: a concentrate plant, a
carbonate plant and a final products plant.!' These facilities were not peripheral “add-ons” to
the mining project. The SMS Report devoted several sections to the economics of the proposed

mine. Cost-efficient processing formed an important aspect of feasibility. !!>

PART 10 - MR. MASIBO SETS OUT IN A “ROADMAP” HIS UNDERSTANDING OF
THE PREREQUISITES FOR A SPECIAL MINING LICENCE

116. CMK required a mining licence to exploit the resources of Mrima Hill.!!© The new Mining
Commissioner, Mr. Masibo,'!? gave Mr. Anderson a copy of a document titled the “Mining
Investment Roadmap.”!'® The Roadmap had no statutory basis independent of the provisions
therein referred to, but it set out Mr. Masibo’s statement of the steps which in his view had to be
satisfied before obtaining a mining licence. As will be seen, Mr. Masibo issued SML 351 contrary

to his own stated policy, as set out in the Roadmap, of what was required.
117. The Roadmap set out Mr. Masibo’s instructions as follows:

1. Undertake mining feasibility study on the established mineral
deposit.

2. Undertake cadastral survey of the deposit area by a registered
surveyor and have it approved by the Director of Surveys.

3. Undertake an Environmental Impact Assessment Study (“EIA”)
for the Mining Project, Environmental Action Plans, etc approved by
NEMA. EIA reports are published in the media for public comments
before approval at the applicants’ cost.

4. Undertake compensation survey Estimates, negotiating rates with
the land owners in case of private land. Come up with compensation
Agreements.

5. Apply for the mining lease/special mining lease enclosing
mining feasibility study report, approved cadastral survey by the
Director of Surveys, EIA and Environmental Action Plans (EMPs)
approved by NEMA, compensation agreements with land
owners, company’s registration documents, financial capability,
etc.

116 Claimants’ Memorial on the Merits dated 5 May 2016, para. 62.

117 In August 2010, Mr. Moses Masibo became the Acting Commissioner (replacing Commissioner Rop). Mr.
Masibo formally became Commissioner in late 2012. Mr. Masibo is at the centre of the Government's allegations
of misconduct in the grant SML 351 and at the time of the Merits Hearing (January 2018) was under investigation by
the Government for abuse of office.

118 Mining Investment Roadmap, Exhibit C-61; David Anderson First Witness Statement, para. 84.

6. The application is checked before being recommended to the
Interministerial Prospecting and Mining Licensing Committee
which sits every three months.

7. Application is published once in the Kenya Gazette and three (3)
times in a local newspaper at intervals of not less than a week to
invite any objections within 90 days from the date of last publication,
at the cost of the applicant.

8. Carry out compensation exercise to the land owners for private
land parcels.

9. Issuance of the mining/special mining lease followed by stamp
duty at Land’s office.'!? (emphasis added)

It is to be emphasized that issuance of a mining licence is the last step in Mr. Masibo’s “road map”

process.

118. Item 6 refers to the Prospecting and Mining Licensing Committee (“PMLC”). The
PMLLC, according to the Government, provided “appropriate checks and balances to ensure that
the delegated powers of the Commissioner are being carried out correctly, impartially and without
undue influence from third parties.”!?° The Claimants were aware of the role of the PMLC as early
as 2007. On 3 February 2007, Mr. Anderson had sent an email to Mr. O'Sullivan summarising a
meeting with the then Mining Commissioner, Mr. Biwott. During this meeting, Mr. Biwott had

informed Mr. Anderson that:

[a]ll applications, mining, exploration, etc are submitted to an approval
committee that sits every quarter. '7!

119. On 19 February 2007, Mr. Anderson responded to Commissioner Biwott seeking

clarification on “when the next sitting of the Mining Committee that approves licences will be

held.”!??. The Government says the Claimants were well aware that as a matter of government
policy, endorsed by Mining Commissioner Masibo, PMLC approval was required before any
licence could be issued.'?* As will be seen, the CMK application for a mining licence was never
approved by the PMLC. On the contrary, as will be discussed, the PMLC eventually recommended
that SPL 256 be revoked.

PART 11 - CMK MAKES A PREMATURE APPLICATION FOR A MINING LICENCE
IN RESPECT OF MRIMA HILL

120. On 11 January 2012, CMK made an application for a Special Mining Lease over an area

of approximately 614.3 km? in the Kwale District for 21 years. !*+

121. On 27 January 2012, Mr. Kimeto from the Ministry of Mines advised CMK by letter
that the application was incomplete as it did not have documents that the Mining Commissioner

required to process the application namely:

(a) an Environmental Impact Assessment report;

(b) a feasibility study of the project;

(c) a project financing plan and action plan;

(d) a tax compliance certificate; and

22 | etter from Mr. David Anderson, CMK, to Mr. Lojomon Biwott, Commissioner of Mines and Geology, 19 February
2007, Exhibit C-24.

'23 This was later confirmed to Mr. Anderson in the document entitled “Mining Investment Road Map” provided to
him by Commissioner Masibo, Exhibit C-61. See para. 116 above. Claimants’ Memorial on the Merits dated 5 May
2016, para.
24 Stamped application for mining licence, Exhibit C-67. [NTD: And this included processing plants?]

(e) details of compensation and resettlement of the affected landowners. '?>

122. The communication further notified CMK that if the application for a mining licence

remained incomplete for 6 months it “will be considered abandoned.” !°

(a) The Lack of a “Mining Feasibility Study”

123. In Item 1 of the Mining Investment Roadmap, Mtr. Masibo called for a “mining feasibility

study”.

124. In the opinion of Justice Torgbor, the Claimants’ legal expert, the requirement for a
feasibility study arises “only because the Commissioner has included it” in Schedule B to the
original SPL 256.'°’ Justice Torgbor says “there is no further detail given as to the content or
standard of such report” and “if the study was completed in good faith and Commissioner Masibo
accepted it in good faith, he would have done so within his general discretion as Commissioner of
Mines and Geology.” In other words, Commissioner Masibo created the requirement and he can

interpret it as he sees fit.!?8

125. The Respondent’s mining expert, Dr. Neal Rigby, on the other hand, testified that a
feasibility study is a well understood term in the mining industry. When asked if there was a

“particular template for the preparation of a mine feasibility report”, Dr. Rigby responded:

There isn’t a template per se, there are many sort of learned papers which
cover, going from conceptual through scoping studies through pre-

feasibility studies and feasibility studies and there is industry accepted
content that one covers, and to a certain extent the detail that one goes into
those contents, as you progress through the levels of accuracy, from
conceptual through scoping through pre-feasibility and feasibility. It is
industry accepted standard.'” (emphasis added)

126. The Claimants’ own consultant, Sound Mining Solutions (Pty) Ltd. (“SMS”) appeared to
agree with Dr. Rigby. SMS stated at p. 6 of its September 20111 Feasibility Study that its mandate
was to write a report “in accordance with standard industry practices” and that it purported to

do so.

127. With respect to “industry accepted standards”, Dr. Rigby states:

All of the work was based upon inferred resources which are too
speculative geologically to include in models for feasibility work.'*°
(emphasis added)

128. Reference has already been made to the SMS First Report dated September 2011 entitled
“Stage 1 Feasibility Study for the Mrima Hill Niobium and Associated Rare Earths Project

Kenya”.!*! Dr. Rigby was dismissive of this report, commenting:

...the title given to this report appears to be designed to appear to
comply with the requirements of the Kenyan mining law. I suggest that
all involved in the commissioning and preparation of the SMS report
were fully aware that the SMS report was not a Feasibility Study
and should not have been titled as such. The report seems to have been
created as a ‘tick box exercise’, with the insertion of the work ‘feasibility’
in its title to give the impression to the relevant authorities that this was
a Feasibility Study.'*?

..-perhaps the most worrying aspect of the SMS report is found in the
Conclusions and Recommendations section of the report. Put simply,
there are no conclusions or recommendations, simply the word
'CORTEC' highlighted in yellow:

ia

   

This strongly suggests that Cortec would be supplying the conclusions
and recommendations, which seriously undermines the entire
credibility and independence of the SMS report.'** (emphasis added)

The Tribunal shares Dr. Rigby’s concerns about the apparent willingness of SMS to defer to CMK
to formulate what were supposed to be independent conclusions of an independent consultant. In

any event, Dr. Rigby testified that the report fell:

...far short of industry standards for a Feasibility Study. The status of
the SMS report appears to be a work in progress draft with many
typographical errors, grammatical issues, errors and omissions, it is
unsigned and the conclusions were to be supplied by Cortec.'™

129. The evening before the commencement of the Hearing on the merits in Dubai in January
2018, the Claimants produced an updated and purportedly final SMS Mining Feasability Study!*>
dated 20 September 2012 which remedied some of the deficiencies of the SMS September 2011
document. However, no expert witness was produced by the Claimants in support of the

argument that the new document could be considered, rationally, to constitute a mining

feasibility study “in accordance with standard industry practices”.

130. Dr. Rigby, the Government’s expert, was no less scathing in his analysis of the “updated

report”. He testified that:

33 Dr, Neal Rigby First Expert Report, 28 September 2016, p. 24, para. 45. (internal citations omitted).
'84 Dr, Neal Rigby First Expert Report, 28 September 2016, p. 24, para. 46.

...the updates, the changes are largely editorial in nature, a number of the
sections are let’s call it reorganized, some of the previous typos and
grammatical issues have been addressed and likewise a “conclusion”
section has been completed, which wasn’t the case in C-57... [there is] no
material data and information that would give me and others much more
confidence in the certainty of the project.'*°

131. According to Dr. Rigby:

As at August 2013, the Mrima Hill project remained at the early
exploration stage of evaluation and a development decision had not been
made. I have placed the Mrima Hill project at the Preliminary Economic
Assessment (PEA) stage, a view which is shared by Mr Townsend
(per his statement of 29 July 2013).'%’ (emphasis added)

Hk a ak a

..-my point is it is not a feasibility study, and I think in my first report, I
said at the time that really the project was somewhere between conceptual
and scoping, a scoping study is also referred to as a preliminary economic

and Mr. T d in a press d that
they were looking forward to advancing the project to a PEA in, I believe,
2013. So if it is not at PEA, how it can be at feasibility?'** (emphasis
added)

 

132. In the above passage, Dr. Rigby was referring to the statement made by Mr. Townsend

(CEO of PAW) on 29 July 2013: “We look forward to rapidly advancing the metallurgical work

and completing the Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Project by the end of 2013.”!*

Mr. Townsend’s statement was made four months after issuance of CMK’s Special Mining Licence
on 7 March 2013. As Dr. Rigby explains, a preliminary economic assessment “is normally

conducted well before a Feasibility Study and of course before any application for a mining

licence.” 4°

48

133. Mr. Townsend’s statement of 29 July 2013 demonstrates, in the Tribunal’s view, that not
only had CMK failed to satisfy the conditions precedent to the issuance of SML 351 as of 7 March
2013, but that Mr. Townsend of PAW as the most knowledgeable of the promoters, knew the

Mrima Hill project would require “rapid advance” even to enable a “preliminary” assessment of

 

its economic viability by the end of 2013, i.e. 10 months after Mr. Masibo rushed out SML 351.

134. Dr. Rigby (whose conclusions were not contradicted by any expert called by the Claimants)
testified that he has “worked probably in 60 countries around the world” and “I have been
undertaking all of these studies, including feasibility studies for about 40 years” and “in any
jurisdiction in the world that I have worked, does not allow feasibility level work...based upon
inferred mineral resources because they are geologically too speculative and they don’t meet the

minimum requirements of certainty.”'*!

135. The reason, according to Dr. Rigby, is that “the design assumptions may change
substantially and with further exploration which may be successful and upgrades the inferred, may
be unsuccessful and downgrades the inferred and excludes them. But because that work hasn’t
been done, the project scope possibilities are far too wide to tie down — you know, to support

even moving the project forward”! (emphasis added). In the result, according to Dr. Rigby:

..-Consequently EIAs are typically undertaken only after the project
scope, scale and design have been sufficiently developed for them all to
be “frozen”. This is entirely logical since it would be pointless to undertake
an EIA project different to that which will ultimately be implemented.

This presented significant challenges for the Mrima Hill project since the
SMS study was Conceptual only, was based purely on Inferred resources
and did not address REE resources. Even with the later BMGS report
(see below) which upgraded part of the Niobium resource to Indicated
status and declared a maiden REE resource, no reserves were ever

41 Tr, Day 6, p.286, Il. 8-22 (emphasis added).
2 Tr, Day 6, p. 287, Il. 1-12.

49

declared which could have formed the basis for a proper mine and
processing plan. Only bench scale metallurgical testwork had been
undertaken so the process flowsheet and plant design, reagent use and
tailings characterization could not be defined. No mine or processing plan
was developed for the REE resource and only a relatively small proportion
of the Niobium resource was scheduled to be mined in the SMS report.
Consequently, the final footprint of the project, the scale and size of
the waste rock dump and likewise the tailings dam could not be
defined nor could tailings characterization be undertaken. With all
these uncertainties and scope for change, it would be impossible, in
my view, to produce a meaningful EIA."

136. The fact is that Mr. Masibo himself laid it down as a condition of SPL 256 that he required
a “mining feasibility study” before moving ahead to consider issuance of a mining licence. The
Tribunal accepts Dr. Rigby’s expert evidence (while noting, again, that the Claimants did not

produce any expert to contradict Dr. Rigby’s view) that the Claimants failed to do so.

137. In the absence of any independent expert to contradict Dr. Rigby, the Claimants are left
with the argument that Mr. Masibo is the sole judge of what is required in a mining feasibility
study, and his discretion to accept the SMS work cannot be impeached. Be that as it may, the fatal
blow to SML 351 is not the lack of a mining feasibility study but the presence of the forest and
nature reserve lands exclusion, and the absence of prior EIA approval. Accordingly, the lack of a
proper feasibility study illustrates the cavalier attitude of the Claimants towards Kenya’s
requirements and Commissioner Masibo’s willingness to cut corners, but the lack of a proper

feasibility study does not itself form a ground for the Tribunal’s decision to dismiss the claims.

443 Dr, Neal Rigby First Expert Report, 28 September 2016, p. 25, paras. 50-51.
50

(b) The Lack of an Approved Environmental Impact Assessment Study (“EIA”)

138. CMK initiated the process of compiling input to an EIA study which appears as item
three in the Mining Investment Road Map. The EIA study report would be evaluated by NEMA
which, if the study were considered satisfactory, would then issue an EIA licence. Mr. Geoffrey

Wahungu, the Director-General of NEMA, testified that:

...In order for any company to be granted a mining licence, it is a pre-
requisite that the company obtains an EIA licence before any mining
licence is issued.

9. This requirement is set out in the Environmental (Impact Assessment
and Audit) Regulations, 2003 ("the Regulations") which read:

No licensing authority under any law in force in Kenya shall
issue a licence for any project for which an environmental
impact assessment is required under the Act unless the applicant
produces to the licensing authority a licence of environmental
impact assessment issued by the Authority [NEMA] under these
Regulations.'** (emphasis added)

  

 

139. Mr. Kenneth Wade of the environmental consultants, 5 Capitals, testified as to the
extensive work undertaken and strenuous efforts made to satisfy the environmental concerns
expressed by NEMA including an expert Government Technical Advisory Committee. However,

Mr. Wade left the project before any NEMA approval was obtained. '*°

140. Mr. Wade testified:

Q. So there was still in your mind a process of assessment and review that
NEMA was undertaking?

A. Well, yes, certainly, in terms of providing this final information, these
were clarifications that had been requested. We respond to each of those

4 Geoffrey Wahungu First Witness Statement, paras. 8-9. (internal citations omitted; emphasis in original).

'45 His parting submission to Nema ended, “We trust that the detailed technical response to your clarifications and
the supporting information/ no objection letters will provide sufficient information to enable you to complete your
technical review with the aim of issuing a conditional mining licence for Mrima Hill.” (Tr. Day 3, p. 110, Il. 19-24).

51

points, put them in writing, so it’s a formal response to NEMA, and at that
point, I believe certainly at that point that we have completed everything,
that there isn’t anything outstanding. '“°

141. The Tribunal was favourably impressed with Mr. Wade’s testimony. But, as he
acknowledged, NEMA still had points of controversy under consideration and while he considered
CMK’s submission to be satisfactory, he agrees CMK had no EIA approval when his engagement

ended and NEMA took a very different view.

(i) The Claimants’ Argument

142. The Claimants dismiss as unfounded the controversy over their lack of an EIA licence.
They point out that they engaged three environmental assessment companies — 5 Capitals of Dubai,
CRO of South Africa and Sigtuna of Kenya. When NEMA raised a number of issues including
water and radiation,'*”7 CMK engaged a further three environmental consultancy firms to assist
CMK to respond to NEMA's queries: SMS (which prepared the mining feasibility study), an

Australian firm called Caltrix Consulting (“Caltrix’’) and a Kenyan firm called Canon."**

143. NEMA advised CMK that EIA approval would be required not only in relation to Mrima
Hill but in relation to the area adjacent to Mrima Hill where CMK was planning to locate additional

processing facilities. '4°

144. In or around October 2011, CMK submitted to NEMA for approval the proposed terms of

reference which provided an outline of the scope of the proposed EIA report. The terms of

reference approval stage precedes the submission for approval of the full EIA report.!°° The terms

of reference were approved by NEMA on 16 November 2011.'*!

145. | The Claimants note that on July 2013 (four months after issuance of SML 351) two letters
were issued to CMK by Mr. Benjamin Langwen, the Director of Compliance and Enforcement at
NEMA at that time.!°? The Claimants rely on these letters as evidence of NEMA's approval of

what Mr. Anderson calls the “Second EIA”.!3
146. In summary, the Claimants contend:

(a) the necessary EIA approval was given by Mr. Langwen, an authorized NEMA

Official; '!*4

(b) Commissioner Masibo had the discretion to convert the EIA condition precedent
(set out in the conditions to SPL 256) into a condition subsequent that could be

fulfilled after SML 351 had issued; and

151 Receipt of lodgement of EIA study report at NEMA, 17 November 2011, Exhibit C-065; and Approval from
NEMA, Exhibit C-66. Mr. Anderson alleges that this 16 November 2011 approval evidences NEMA’s approval of
“CMK’s EIA” (see David Anderson First Witness Statement, para. 89). NEMA’s Mr. Wahungu testified that Mr.
Anderson's assertion “is incorrect and rather misleading considering that Cortec continued in correspondence
with NEMA to try to seek approval well into 2013” (Geoffrey Wahungu First Witness Statement, para. 23).

'S? Letter from Mr. Benjamin Langwen, Director General NEMA to CMK in respect of the processing plant, 8 July
2013, Exhibit C-91; and Letter from Mr. Benjamin Langwen, Director General NEMA, to CMK in respect of

'S3 David Anderson First Witness Statement, para. 137. However, Mr. Langwen’s letters purport to be the belated
approval of NEMA of both the Mrima Hill project (see Exhibit R-056) and the processing plant (see Exhibit C-91).
'4 Justice Torgbor ventured into the facts and opined that EIA approval was given, and points to the letter from
Benjamin Langwen dated 8 July 2013, Exhibit C-91, and an EIA review report signed by Mr. Jeremiah Wahomel
According to Justice Torgbor, “having reviewed this document, it seems clear that NEMA had reviewed Cortec’s EIA
and communicated approval.” (Tr. Day 6, p. 12, Il. 7-18). At that point, Justice Torgbor was no longer providing
evidence of Kenyan law and had become an advocate of the facts.

53

(c) in any event, the Claimants’ EIA submission satisfied Mining Commissioner
Moses Masbio, and it was within his discretion to find the CMK had met the EIA

condition.

(ii) The Government’s Position

147. | When CMK provided NEMA with environmental information, NEMA wrote to CMK on
19 July 2012 setting out eight fundamental deficiencies.'*° Mr. Wahungu, the Director General of

NEMA, testified that the Claimants were dismissive of NEMA’s concerns:

It became the norm that whenever NEMA wrote a letter to Cortec, Cortec
would show up at NEMA's offices a day or two later, accompanied by
lawyers and environmental consultants. This was most unusual and
unnerving. I recall being very uncomfortable with this trend where
Cortec hardly replied to our letters in writing and instead made in
person visits to assert their views and positions. What was most
disconcerting with Cortec was that, whenever we requested that Cortec
address particular issues, Cortec would show up at our offices with
huge bundles of documents which did not address the specific issues
we had raised. I felt that Cortec was bombarding us with information to
try to intimidate my officers and me.'** (emphasis added)

148. In 2013, EIA planning was difficult if not impossible because, as Dr. Rigby noted, “the

project parameters had not been fixed”.'>7

'S5 Letter from Ms. Marrian Kioko, for Director General of NEMA, to CMK, 19 July 2012, Exhibit R-053. Mr.
Wahungu testified that:
...the report was not a good submission and that large sections of the documents appeared to be still in
draft and there were significant gaps and glaring omissions...My officials were very concerned that
Cortec was simply going through the motions and not addressing the significant legal and environmental
obstacles to establish a mine at Mrima Hill.

 

(Geoffrey Wahungu First Witness Statement, para. 25).

'56 Geoffrey Wahungu First Witness Statement, para. 20.

'57 Insufficient progress had been made to create and produce a meaningful Environmental Impact Assessment
(EIA) as the project parameters had not been fixed [by an appropriate mining feasibility study]. (emphasis

54

149. Not only had no EIA licence been issued by 7 March 2013 when Mr. Masibo purported to
issue SML 351, but two weeks later, on 22 March 2013, NEMA confirmed that it would not be

issuing an EIA licence for the Mrima Hill project. The NEMA letter stated in part:

1. The proposed project will be implemented within Mrima Forest which
is Gazetted as a Nature Reserve, Forest Reserve and a Natural
Monument.

The Forest Act, 2005 section 31(3) prohibits extractive uses of natural
reserves other than for research...Mrima Hill has so far not been
degazetted by the respective minister to pave way for the proposed
project. The Forest Act, 2005 condemns mining in such areas in section
41(1).

2. The proponent has failed to identify an appropriate site for the
Processing Plant and undertake a consequent Environmental Impact
Assessment for the same...

4. The project will lead to massive destruction of Forest followed by
Loss of Biodiversity.

5. The Project will interfere with sites of cultural significance within
the proposed project site.

ok ok ok ok

In view of the above grounds and in light of the provisions of the
Environmental Management and Coordination Act, 1999, the Authority
is of the view that the proposed project will not enhance sustainable
and sound environmental management. Consequently, the Authority
is unable to issue an Environmental Impact Assessment Licence
under the Act. You are hereby advised to explore alternative sites.'**
(emphasis added)

150. Mr. Wahungu, the Director General of NEMA, testified that:

[t]he [NEMA] letter dated 22 March 2016 constitutes what is known as a
“Record of Decision” issued by the office of Director General. The
letter was clear that NEMA had declined to issue an EIA licence,
principally because of the protected status of Mrima Hill. The
decision set out in the Record of Decision issued by the Director
General is final and can only be reviewed by the National Environment
Tribunal. Even as Director General, I do not have power to review
any Record of Decision I have issued. It follows that any NEMA

55

officer subordinate to me also has no authority to revisit the Record of
Decision.'*’ (emphasis added)

151. Notwithstanding the Director General’s statement that no “NEMA subordinates” had
authority to revisit the “Record of Decision” rejecting the Claimants’ EIA application, Mr.
Langwen purported to do so by letters of 8 July 2013. Mr. Langwen’s letters of approval were

unauthorized, the Government says, and without effect.

152. According to Mr. Wahungu, no EIA licence has ever been issued to CMK.!© Further, Mr.
‘Wahungu testified that Mr. Langwen’s two letters were issued “in unusual and irregular

circumstances” !®!

and that in December 2013 Mr. Langwen was summarily dismissed for gross
misconduct in a different matter.'® (It seems that subsequently Mr. Langwen’s claim of wrongful

dismissal was ultimately successful.)
(iti) The Tribunal’s Ruling in Respect of EIA Approval

153. Mr. Langwen wrote two letters on 8 July 2013. In the first letter (Exhibit R-056), he
purported to approve the EIA Study Report for “the proposed Mrima Hill Niobium and Associated
Rare Earths Mining Project” (“the mining project approval”). The second letter of the same date
(Exhibit C-091) purports to approve the related “processing plant in Mrima Hill, Kwale County”
(“the processing plant approval”). The two letters confirm that CMK had no EIA approval at the
time SML 351 was issued. If Mr. Langwen believed the “mining project” had received EIA

approval prior to 7 March 2013, he would not have purported to give “the mining project” NEMA

approval on 8 July 2013. He would only have written Exhibit C-091 in respect of processing plant

approval.

154. For reasons to be elaborated below, the Tribunal:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

concludes that it is clear that Environmental (Impact Assessment and Audit)
Regulation 2003 s. 4(2) requires an EIA licence as a condition precedent to the
issuance of a special mining licence as stated by Professor Albert Mumma at p. 123

of his expert report.'®? There is ample evidence that an EIA licence was not issued;

accepts the evidence of the Director General of NEMA, Mr. Wahungu, that only he

had authority to issue the requisite EIA licence to CMK;

Mr. Langwen’s letters of 8 July 2013 do not address the prior NEMA “Record of
Decision” dated 22 March 2013 rejecting CMK’s submission, nor address the

deficiencies of CMK’s environmental submissions therein indicated;

the EIA requirement was attached to SPL 256 as a condition precedent to CMK’s
application for a special mining licence. Mr. Masibo had no authority to waive
compliance or, after issuance of SML 351 to (belatedly) try to convert the condition

precedent into a condition subsequent;

even if Mr. Langwen’s unauthorized letters of 8 July 2013 could be given the effect

contended for by the Claimants, they were four months too late; and

‘68 Tr, Day 6, p. 132, Il. 13-25.

s7

(f) in any event, the Tribunal does not accept Mr. Langwen’s letters of 8 July 2013 as

authorized NEMA approvals.

155. The Claimants argue that CMK would have held off removing what it claimed was
estimated to be about 130 million tonnes of mineral resources until after it had prepared
satisfactory EIA studies, but this “wait and see” approach contradicts regulation 4(2). The
purported gift by Mr. Masibo to the Claimants of exclusive rights would keep out other potentially
better prepared and more compliance minded mining operations off Mrima Hill for 21 years. Mr.
Masibo was not legally entitled to make such a gift. The gift of SML 351 was invalid from the

outset.

PART 12 - THE COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION

156. Some of the meetings arranged by CMK’s solicitors, Mr. Robson Harris, concerned
participation of the local Kwale community in the Mrima Hill project.'® The Claimants point
out that in March 2013, the corporate structure and financing of the project were not yet at the
stage when the community’s equity participation was ripe for determination. CMK nevertheless
proposed a 5% free-carried interest for the State and an additional 1% additional royalty to
be held on trust for the benefit of the local community.'° Mr. O’ Sullivan testified that the
Kwale people appeared uninterested in this proposal and it never came to fruition.'” The

Government agrees that the issue of local Kwale participation was never resolved.

PART 13 - THE UNFULFILLED REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM NATIONAL
MUSEUMS OF KENYA

157. On 5 February 2013, the Director General of NMK wrote to Mr. Anderson as follows:

...NMK is ready to grant a letter of no objection to the project once these
recommendations have been fully addressed:

1. Mapping the cultural sites within the area (e.g. early settlements,
burials and community ritual sites).

2. Identify areas void of archaeological and cultural sites for exploratory
drilling and commercial mining.

3. Hold a consultative discussion between stakeholders (the community,
developer, archaeologists, Coastal Forests Conservation Unit of the
National Museums of Kenya and Kenya Forestry Service) on the way
forward should the mining impact on some of these cultural sites.

 

4. Finally an archaeologist should be on site during the mining operations.
I propose a meeting in order to discuss further.'** (emphasis added)
158. The Claimants had not provided the information requested by 7 March 2013 when Mr.

Masibo issued SML 351 without NMK’s approval.

PART 14 - THE CLAIMANTS’ POLITICAL EFFORTS CULMINATE IN HIRING MR.
JACOB JUMA

159. CMK filed its application for a mining licence on 11 January 2012.! By September 2012,
no approval had been given and the Claimants engaged their law firm, Robson Harris, to advance

their cause. Ms. Jane Mwangi, Managing Partner of Robson Harris, was familiar with many

Kenyan political figures and coordinated the meetings'’° amongst others with PS Mohammed and

Minister Mwakwere.'7!

(a) The Hiring of Jacob Juma

160. Mr. Anderson testified that in February 2013, he received a telephone call from Jacob

Juma, a Kenyan businessman. Mr. Juma informed him that CMK's licence application was being

v172

“blocked somewhere in the State's bureaucratic system. The Claimants reached an

agreement!’> with Mr. Juma under which he would assist CMK in discussions with the

 

Government. Mr. Juma would also buy shares in PAW and another CMK affiliate, First Western
Limited.'7* The Claimants emphasize that Mr. Juma was not just an outside consultant. He was

to be a significant investor.

161. On 6 March 2013 (two days after the general election), Mr. Juma was able to arrange

meetings with representatives from the outgoing Kenyan Government at the offices of the

President of Kenya and the Cabinet Secretary.175 According to Mr. Anderson, this meeting was

attended by:
(a) Mr. Francis Kimemia, the Cabinet Secretary;

(b) Mr. Ali Mohammed, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Environment and

Mineral Resources;

(c) Mining Commissioner Mr. Moses Masibo;

(d) Mr. Isiah Kabinia, the newly-appointed Kenyan Ambassador to Australia;

(e) Mr. David Anderson;

(f) Mr. Donald O’ Sullivan; and

(g) Mr. Jacob Juma.
162. Neither NMK nor the Ministry of Home Affairs and National Heritage was represented.
163. Mr. O’Sullivan and Mr. Anderson testified!’°that at this meeting:

Mr Kimemia [the Secretary of Cabinet] asked Mr Masibo what
the legal position was regarding his office issuing a Special Mining
Licence, and whether there was any impediment to him issuing the
licence. Commissioner Masibo responded by reading out sections
of the Kenyan Mining Act and confirmed that he was within power
and had full authority to issue CMK a Special Mining Licence,
including for a period of 21 years...Mr Kimemia then informed
Commissioner Masibo that if he was satisfied, he could issue CMK
a Special Mining Licence. Commissioner Masibo indicated that he

 

"5 David Anderson First Witness Statement, para. 107.
"6 David Anderson First Witness Statement, paras. 107-113; Donald O’ Sullivan First Witness Statement, para. 43.

61

was satisfied and that he would proceed accordingly.'””_ (emphasis
added)

164. Note that Mr. Masibo spoke of a special mining licence. He did not mention “amended”

conditions to a “re-grant” of SPL 256 as he later alleged.

165. The following day, on 7 March 2013, a formal “launch” took place at the Fairview Hotel
in Nairobi. At this meeting, Commissioner Masibo quoted from Section 17 of the Mining Act as
the provision giving him authority to grant CMK its special mining licence,'’* which he then

issued.
166. SML 351 was subsequently notified in the Kenya Gazette on 22 March 2013.!7

(b) The Tribunal’s Finding in Respect of SML 351

167. The meeting of 6 March 2013 was based on demonstrable misconceptions reflected in a
subsequent letter dated 26 March 2013 from PS Mohammed to NEMA purporting to countermand
NEMA’s “Record of Decision” dated 22 March 2013 rejecting CMK’s application and ordering
NEMA to issue an EIA licence (thereby again confirming incidentally, that the requisite EIA
approval was not in place prior to issuance of SML 351):

The mineral resource riches of Mrima Hill have been confirmed

through extensive historical work and prospecting spanning several

years. The initial results from the drilling works by Cortec Mining

company has inferred niobium resource estimate of over 100 million

tonnes and additional 30 million tonnes of rare earth minerals that
could sustain the project for 20-30 years. In fact the rare earth

"8 David Anderson First Witness Statement, para. 114.
179 Gazette Notice 3899, 22 March 2013, Exhibit C-10.

62

mineral deposits of Mrima are estimated to be the third largest in
the world... '*°

168. According to Dr. Rigby, whose expert evidence the Tribunal accepts, such resources had
not been confirmed. Indeed, in a press release on 2 August 2013, PAW was obliged to

acknowledge:

There is no certainty that all or any part of the estimated mineral resource
of the Mrima Hill Project will be converted into mineral reserves. '*!

169. PS Mohammed continued in his letter of 26 March 2013:

The company has submitted feasibility study report and management
plan which include social and environmental considerations... .'*?

170. Dr. Rigby’s criticism of the “feasibility study” submitted by the Claimants (whether the
report initially marked Exhibit C-252 and Exhibit C-57 or the later version Exhibit C-252A) has
earlier been referred to, and his criticisms are accepted as both relevant and correct by the Tribunal.
The reference to a management plan which includes social and environmental considerations”

is no substitute for an approved EIA licence.

171. PS Mohammed continues:

'89 Letter from PS Ali Mohammed, Ministry of Environment and Mineral Resources, to Prof. Geoffrey Wahungu,
Director General NEMA, 26 March 2013, Exhibit C-135.

'8! Pacific Wildcat News Release 2013-16, Pacific Wildcat Clarifies Technical Disclosure, 2 August 2013, Exhibit

Director General NEMA, 26 March 2013, Exhibit C-135.

63

...the Lead Agencies including the Ministry of Forestry and
Wildlife, the Radiation Protection Board, the Kwale County Council,
as well as the local community have all consented to the project.'*

172. This statement is incorrect. As discussed, the KFS agreed to a prospecting licence on
existing paths and pits, not a mining licence. PS Mohammed does not even refer explicitly to the
“national monument” issue. Moreover, the alleged support of the Kwale County Council was

contested by Kwale representatives.

173. Finally, PS Mohammed in effect gives NEMA a political direction:

The position of the Authority therefore, needs to be immediately
reviewed and the company facilitated to contribute to national growth
and poverty eradication. '**

174. | Mr. Wahungu, the Director General of NEMA, was offended by PS Mohammed’s letter:

Q. ... You received a letter on 26'" March 2013 from PS Ali Mohammed,
copied to the Honourable Ali Mwakwere and other officials and ministers
including Mr Kimemia; you confirmed you received that letter?

A. Yes, but I found it very offensive, because the Permanent Secretary
knows the procedures and the law, and there is no provision for the
Permanent Secretary in the Environmental Management and Co-
ordination Act to advise or even instruct the Director General. It was
wrong for him to do this. He is not allowed in law. The Environmental
Management and Co-ordination Act states it very clearly.'*°

184 T etter from PS Ali Mohammed, Ministry of Environment and Mineral Resources, to Prof. Geoffrey Wahungu,
Director General NEMA, 26 March 2013, Exhibit C-135. Reference has already been made to the two letters to CMK
subsequent to the issuance of SML 351 by Mr. Benjamin Langwen, the Director of Compliance and Enforcement at
NEMA dated 8 July 2013. The Claimants rely on one of these letters as evidence of NEMA’s approval of what
Mr. Anderson calls the “Second EIA” (David Anderson First Witness Statement, para. 137). According to Mr.
Wahungu’s evidence this is not correct and no EIA licence has ever been issued to CMK (either with respect to
mining on Mrima Hill or the adjacent proposed processing plants) (Geoffrey Wahungu First Witness Statement, paras.
36-43).

185 Ty, Day 5, p. 86, Il. 10-22.

64

175. As will be seen, PS Mohammed’s political directive was eventually overridden by the
political directive of the subsequent Kenyatta Government. The political actors came and went

but the Kenyan regulatory laws remained throughout and unfulfilled.

176. PS Mohammed’s posture is all the more curious in light of the fact that a few weeks before
the events of March 2013, to be precise, on 31 January 2013, the PMLC (of which PS Mohammed
was chair) held one of its quarterly meetings to discuss various mining applications.
Commissioner Masibo himself tabled an agenda item recommending revocation of CMK’s

prospecting licence SPL 256 for “fraud”. The minutes of that meeting note:

The Special licence was also supposed to exclude Mrima Hill Nature
Reserve. '*° (emphasis added)

177. The Claimants contend that the Tribunal should accept Mr. Masibo’s explanation that

after further examination he concluded:

...that the “decision [by the PMLC] to revoke SPL 256 was made hastily
based on inaccurate information”, and “then consulted with PS Mr. Ali
[Mohammed] and Hon. Minister Charua Ali Mwakwere and both decided
that the revocation be discontinued.”!*”

In other words, the PMLC recommendation was not reversed by the PMLC itself, which never

approved CMK’s mining licence.

178. In summary, the Tribunal has not been provided with any document that could be said to

constitute the EIA “licence” required by s. 4(2) of the regulations in respect of Mrima Hill. Nor

65

is there any persuasive evidence that KFS or NMK ever consented to the issuance of a mining

licence in respect of the Mrima Hill forestry and nature reserve and national monument areas.

PART 15 - THE CLAIMANTS’ WORK PLAN

179. In operational terms, SML 351 purported to authorize CMK to implement the work

programme annexed as Schedule B, the text of which is copied below:

SCHEDULE “B”
WORK PROGRAMME

SPECIAL (MINING) LICENCE NO.

 

MESSRS CORTEC MINING KENYA LIMITED

PHASE
‘* Construction of the project infrastructure
‘* Commissioning of the project infrastructure
‘* Continuously explore the property area to re-assess and update the total
‘ore reserves in view of changing economic and technological conditions
and access possibilities for expansion of production capacities

PHASE III
* Undertaking of mining and processing operations
* Commissioning of the project infrastructure
‘* Implementation of social programmes
* Rehabilitation of mined out areas

180. It seems Schedule B to SPL 351 was prepared in such haste that it skips from Phase I to
Phase III without there being a Phase II. In the absence of an approved EIA, the Claimants would
not know where it would be appropriate to construct “infrastructure” or begin to “undertake mining
processing operations” to remove what PS Mohammed referred to as 100 million tonnes of

niobium and 30 million tonnes of rare earth minerals?

181. From the Claimants’ perspective, CMK believed SML 351 gave it freedom to explore away

from the existing roads and tracks in the forest. This meant CMK would be able to conduct more

66

extensive drilling. '** On the other hand, such off-track exploration violated the terms imposed by
the KFS in “opening” up for prospecting purposes the forest reserve beyond areas previously

disrupted, as well as creating potential confrontation with the local Kwale people.

182. The Claimants point out that KFS officials were aware of CMK’s activities on Mrima Hill
but, as Justice Torgbor testified “to the extent that the Ministry official is acting officially in
attending site, et cetera., that is an act of cooperation by the Ministry [as opposed to approval] and

I don’t wish to take it any further.”!*

PART 16- THE GOVERNMENT’S ALLEGATIONS OF CORRUPTION AGAINST
JACOB JUMA AND MOSES MASIBO

183. |The Government alleges that Jacob Juma and Moses Masibo worked together corruptly to
issue SML 351. For example, at paragraph 16 of the Counter-Memorial, the Government alleges
that “there is evidence to show that Mr. Juma had a history of paying bribes to Commissioner
Masibo.”!*° Moreover, Mr. Ndung’u’s evidence is that he attended four or five meetings with Mr.
Juma and Mr. Masibo at which (according to Mr. Ndung’u) Mr. Juma gave “pocket money” to
both him and Mr. Masibo, “on each occasion...usually around KSH 150,000 (about US

$1,500).”!!

184. Mr. Juma is dead and cannot defend himself. Mr. Masibo provided a detailed witness
statement which denied any wrongdoing. The Government did not put to Mr. Masibo while in the

witness box the so-called “incriminating” evidence. Fairness required, if the Government wished

to pursue its allegations of corruption, that Mr. Masibo be given the opportunity to explain his
conduct. This opportunity was not given. The Tribunal does not accept the Government’s
explanation that it did not wish by cross-examination to further complicate Mr. Masibo’s existing

192

legal jeopardy in Kenya.'’~ Mr. Masibo’s lawyer, not the Government, was present to protect Mr.

Masibo. Nevertheless, the Government seeks to persuade the Tribunal to draw the conclusion that
“this arrangement involved corruption. On that basis alone, the Government says, the claim should
be dismissed, as investment treaty protection does not extend to investments procured by

corruption and/or made in bad faith.”!°

185. The Tribunal rejects the allegations of corruption against Mr. Masibo as unproven.

PART 17-SUMMARY OF THE GOVERNMENT’S ARGUMENT ON THE
CLAIMANTS’ NON-COMPLIANCE

186. |The Government argues that putting to one side the corruption allegations, the Claimants
knew, or ought to have known, that SML 351 had not been issued in accordance with Kenyan

law. In particular:

(a) CMK had not complied with the Mining Investment Road Map, a document

which does not have the force of a statute but which references requirements that

The Public Service Commission is currently investigating the Ministry of Mining's findings that “Mr

Masibo had abused the powers conferred to him” and had “contravened Mining Act Cap. 360 by issuing Cortec
Mining Kenya Limited with a special licence which was not in compliance with the law.” (Letter from Dr.
Ibrahim M. Mohamed, CBS, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Mining, to Mrs. Alice A. Otwala, CBS, Public
Service Commission of Kenya, 11 April 2013, attaching minutes of the Ministerial Human Resource
Management Advisory Committee meetings held on 26 and 27 March 2015, Exhibit R-155, p. 11.) In parallel, the
Directorate of Criminal Investigations has recommended to the Director of Public Prosecution that Mr. Masibo
be charged with “[a]buse of office contrary to section 101 of the penal code.” (Letter from Mr. Richard Koywer, for
the Director of Criminal Investigations, to the Director of Public Prosecutions, 18 January 2016, Exhibit R-115.)

PART 18 - THE KENYAN ELECTIONS OF 4 MARCH 2013
187. On 4 March 2013, general and presidential elections were held in Kenya.

188. On 9 April 2013, Mr. Uhuru Kenyatta was inaugurated as the new President of Kenya and

anew Government was formed.

189. By letter dated 12 April 2013,'°° Mr. Anderson requested an audience with the new
President and shortly afterwards, he was able to meet at State House in Mombasa with President
Kenyatta, a number of Government officials, including Commissioner Masibo, Mutea Iringo
(Permanent Secretary for Internal Security), Jomo Gecaga (President Kenyatta's nephew and
personal assistant) and Isaiah Kabira (Ambassador-Designate to Australia).'°? Present for the
Claimants were Mr. Anderson, Mr. O’Sullivan, Jacqueline O’Sullivan and Mr. Townsend.
According to Mr. Anderson, the newly installed President Kenyatta expressed his support for
CMK's Mrima Hill project. Following this meeting, PAW announced that President Kenyatta

had commented:

We will support the development of the Mrima Hill Niobium and

keen to ensure that exploitation of the minerals benefits the Country.

community, the Kwale County and the Country as a whole.”

190. On the other hand, the Ambassador-designate to Australia, Mr. Kabira, who was also
present at the meeting, describes it as a “sales pitch” by CMK, at which “[t]he Cortec team
repeatedly mentioned the purported scale of the project and the claim that that the project will
earn Kenya a lot of money.””? The Government denies that the President gave any specific
assurances to CMK. According to Mr. Kabira, “His comments were of a general nature and

expressed his Government's policy towards the mining sector.”?°

PART 19 - AFTER ISSUANCE OF SML 351, CMK CONTINUED TO GATHER DATA
RELEVANT TO A “FEASIBILITY STUDY”

191. In the Spring of 2013, PAW raised an additional US $1.5 million in capital to fund further
resource definition and exploratory work." In parallel, CMK commenced assaying work on the

first holes of 3,482 metres of reverse circulation drilling (which had been undertaken in 2012).7°5

192. On 26 June 2013, PAW announced results regarding the extent of rare earths resources
within the area covered by SML 351.2 On 15 July 2013, PAW’s announcement included its
niobium discoveries, stating that these results “continue to demonstrate the presence of wide and

high-grade zones of mineralization and remain open laterally and at depth. In addition elevated

193. Around this time, PAW hired BMGS Perth (“BMGS”) as an independent consultant to
prepare a Technical Report on the Mrima Hill project.?°* The purpose of the report was to review
the current status of the Mrima Hill project, focusing on the niobium and REE resources. In its
Technical Report of 1 September 2013 (the “BMGS Report”), BMGS concluded that “the
exploration activities completed and on which this Mineral Resource have been generated were

successful in achieving their objective.”

194. As explained earlier, the Tribunal accepts the evidence of Dr. Rigby, the Government’s
expert, that the then existing data including the data analyzed by BMGS did not support these

conclusions.

195. The Claimants did not call a witness from BMGS.

PART 20 - THE TURNING OF THE TIDE: THE NEW KENYATTA GOVERNMENT
ORDERS A REVIEW AND SUSPENDS SEVERAL HUNDRED “TRANSITION PERIOD”
MINING LICENCES DUE TO “COMPLAINTS REGARDING THE PROCESS”

196. A few weeks after President Kenyatta was elected, a new Cabinet Secretary for the Ministry

of Mining was appointed: Najib Balala (“CS Balala”).

attend. However, just as the press conference was about to begin, Mr. Anderson says he was
intercepted by Commissioner Masibo who told him (privately) that unless CMK agreed to
“renegotiate” the terms of SML 351, he and CS Balala would not attend the press conference.”!*

as an alternate venue, to which the Anti-Corruption Commission agreed. To date, Mr. Anderson

has not been interviewed by the Anti-Corruption Commission.?”°

200. On5 August 2013, CS Balala went on national television and stated:

despite receipt of written advice from the Attorney General that, under the Mining Act, a “show
cause” notice had to be issued before a mining licence could be revoked.*** (The Government’s
position as eventually confirmed by the Kenyan Courts, is that no revocation was necessary
because SML 351 was void ab initio as having been issued contrary to Kenyan law.) CS Balala’s

purported basis for these revocations was that the licences were issued during a “transition[al]

was not called to testify by the Government and the Tribunal declined to make an order that he be
brought to Dubai to be examined). The Tribunal makes no comment on the Claimants’ bribery

allegations against CS Balala.

PART 21 - THE TASK FORCE INQUIRY

204. On 23 August 2013, the Task Force issued a press statement restating its mandate and
invited all affected parties to make representations to it, and to produce documents in their
possession that would prove that the licences issued to them were in compliance with Kenyan law.

Affected parties were also invited to make submissions in person if they so desired.?”?

205. The licences under review were treated as suspended during the review period.

206. Instead of making representations to the Task Force, CMK's response was two-fold:

(a) Review all the agreement and licences relating to prospecting, exploration and mining issued between
January, 2013 and May, 2013 with a view to ascertaining their legality and establishing whether due
procedure was followed in their issuance and prepare a short report on the same;
(b) Review all the agreement and licences relating to prospecting, exploration and mining issued between
January, 2003 and December, 2012 with a view to ascertaining their legality and establishing whether due
procedure was followed in their issuance:
(c) Review the status of all licences issued between January, 2013 and May, 2013 with a view of
determining whether they are dormant, operational or expired;
(d) Make recommendations on the basis or the findings on (a) and (b) above to the Cabinet Secretary for
Mining on the way forward with regard to any licence(s) that is found to be dormant, operational or
expired;
(e)Recommend measures for developing processes and institutional capacity to effectively comply with
licensing procedui
(f) Recommend clear modalities and processes of licensing which will ensuree [sic] transparency and
spell out clear timelines.
29 Ministry of Mining, Press Statement, 23 August 2013, Exhibit R-018. In all, the Task Force reviewed 43
potentially irregular applications made and licences issued between 15 January 2013 and 15 May 2013, and the
majority of licence holders made representations to the Task Force to confirm the legitimacy of their licences.
(See Appendix 45 of the Interim Report of the Task Force on Review of Prospecting, Exploration and Mining
Licences and Agreements, 4 October 2013, Exhibit R-019, pp. 109-111. CMK’s name is not included in this list.)

 

76

(a) on 22 August 2013, it initiated discussions with Deputy President Ruto aimed at a

political resolution of the dispute over SML 351;2°° and

(b) CMK commenced judicial review proceedings in the Nairobi High Court, seeking
to quash Cabinet Secretary Balala's purported revocation of its licence and

appointment of the Task Force.?*!

207. In addition, CMK, through its lawyers Havi & Co Advocates, wrote to the Task Force on
27 August 2013,” informing the Chairman that CMK was not going to participate in the Task
Force process, and indicated that it considered the issues regarding the legitimacy of SML 351 to
be sub judice. The Claimants requested that the Task Force not consider or make any findings

regarding SML 351 pending the determination of the court proceedings. The Task Force obliged.

208. With respect to those licensees who did participate in the Task Force and whose licences

were found deficient, the evidence is that:

(a) where the defects were minor and the licensees remedied the irregularities thus

identified, their licences were reinstated;***

(b) where the defects were more serious, the Ministry of Mining notified the relevant

licensees in writing that their licences had been revoked, and the requisite Gazette

Notice published.”*+ It was open to those licensees to re-apply for a licence, in a

manner compliant with the applicable requirements.

209. The Tribunal notes that the Claimants requested the presence at the Hearing of Mr.
Mohammed Nyaoga, the Chairman of the Task Force. Mr. Nyaoga duly presented himself in
Dubai as requested. Justice Torgbor, the Claimants’ legal expert, praised Mr. Nyaoga as “a good
friend of mine, and I believe he is here, and he knows what he is saying — he is a reputable

lawyer.” Justice Torgbor later referred to Mr. Nyaoga as “a distinguished lawyer.””°°

210. Despite his requested appearance in Dubai, Mr. Nyaoga was not cross-examined by the
Claimants. His evidence that the Task Force was independent and respected due process is

uncontradicted and is therefore accepted as reliable by the Tribunal.

211. There is no evidence that the Task Force was a sham, and the outcome of its deliberations
do not suggest on their face a lack of independence. The decision by the Claimants not to submit
SML 351 for review bypassed what would have been, if the Task Force had accepted the
Claimants’ evidence of their compliance, an effective remedy to restore SML 351 to operational

status.

PART 22 - THE KENYAN COURT PROCEEDINGS

212. On 15 August 2013, CMK filed its application before the High Court of Kenya seeking
leave to commence judicial review proceedings against Cabinet Secretary Balala and the Attorney
General to quash CS Balala’s purported revocation of its licence and quash the appointment of the

Task Force to review its legality.°”

(a) The Court Decision and its Interpretation by the Parties’ Experts

213. The decision of the Environmental and Land Court Division of the High Court was handed

down on 20 March 2015 (Exhibit RL-089). The Court declared that:?**

The acquisition by [CMK] of the Mining Licence was not in compliance
with the law and the licence was void ab initio and liable to be
revoked.”

214. In particular, the court found that:

(a) a mining licence could not be validly issued before an EIA approval had been issued

by NEMA;

(b) a mining licence could not be validly issued absent consents from KFS and NMK;

and

237 CMK’s application for judicial review of the revocation of SML 351 (proceedings instituted 15 August 2013);

(emphasis added).

79

(c) Commissioner Masibo had acted in breach of the Mining Act and the Kenyan

Constitution.

215. CMK’s appeal against this judgment was dismissed on narrower grounds by the Court of

Appeal on 9 June 2017.74°

216. Justice Torgbor says the Kenyan Courts only decided that there was no basis on which to
issue judicial review orders because Cortec had come to the wrong forum. It should have initiated

an appeal (not judicial review) under s. 93 of the Mining Act. Justice Torgbor states:

The most fundamental decision made by the trial court in this matter was
that judicial review orders were not available owing to the availability of
an alternative remedy. The Court was ready to rest its decision on that
finding. *4' In short, the High Court found that Cortec had come to, and I
am quoting, “the wrong forum to ventilate its grievance”? ...the orders
for judicial review sought cannot therefore issue in these proceedings.”

217. Everything else, according to Justice Torgbor, was obiter and in his view, wrong:

Tam saying, and I emphasise it, both courts were entirely wrong, wrong in
every way, and I have given my reasons in my opinion why I say so
respectfully.74*

Hk a ak a

So if you put all of it together, the Court of Appeal is saying the High
Court has not misdirected itself, and the judgment is not wrong, and I am
saying it is wrong, wrong, wrong, for the reasons I have been giving. Both

courts.

218. As may be expected, the Government’s legal expert, Professor Mumma, took a different
view. He notes that the High Court judge states “although the determination of this single issue
[wrong forum] would have been sufficient to dispose of this application, I will in case Iam wrong

in determination of the issue deal with the other issues for completeness of my determination on

all of the issues.”?46

219. The Court of Appeal endorsed the decision of the High Court judge not only on the “wrong
forum” issue”*” but on his broader invocation of validity issues because in the view of the Court
of Appeal, those issues were relevant to the exercise of the High Court “discretion” in disposing
of the judicial review application (a discretionary remedy) and to that extent were not obiter. The

Court of Appeal stated:

36. But the trial court was vilified for delving into the validity of the
license issued in a manner that was irrelevant and totally outside the
purview of the application before it. In the end, it is said, it determined
the merits of the license rather than the process of its revocation. With
respect, we think that criticism is rather harsh. The application before
the trial court was initially between Cortec and the two public offices of
the CS and the AG. But Cortec had pleaded that it had a valid license
on account of consents and approvals obtained from the institutions that
must be involved before the issuance of the license. Those institutions
then became necessary parties and were enjoined in the proceedings and
provided information which the trial court was bound to consider in
abundant caution. The information was relevant and it assisted in the
judicious exercise of the discretion the court was called upon to exercise.
In our view, it was not a determination of the merits of the decision of the
cs.

246 Cortec Mining Kenya v. Cabinet Secretary Ministry of Mining, Judgment, 20 March 2015, RL-089, p. 23.

*47 In affirming the High Court judge’s finding of an alternative remedy, the Court of Appeal stated:

That was an alternative remedy which the appellant ought to have disclosed and explained why it was not
efficacious, thus resorting to judicial review. The appeal process, unlike judicial review, would afford the parties
an opportunity to explore the merits of the decision. We think in the circumstances, the trial court did not
misdirect itself in the exercise of its discretion as it accorded with the law. That finding would be sufficient to
dispose of this appeal. (Cortec Mining Kenya v. Cabinet Secretary Ministry of Mining, Court of Appeal Judgment,
9 June 2017, CL-91, para. 35).

81

37. We have come to the conclusion that in exercising its discretion, the
trial court did not misdirect itself in the matter and as a result arrive at a
wrong decision, or that the decision as a whole was clearly wrong. In the
result we find no merit in the appeal and order that it be and is hereby
dismissed. As the matter raised more of public interest rather than private
issues for consideration, we order that each party bears its own costs of the
appeal.”“* (emphasis added)

220. Justice Torgbor, confronted with these passages, testified “well in a sense, yes, it is

endorsing it.”*4? Seven issues were raised by the Applicant and the Kenyan Courts decided to

dispose of the case, “on the basis of validity not of the others.”?°

221. The Court of Appeal unequivocally affirmed the trial judge’s view that SML 351 was

issued in violation of the relevant statutes:

...the facts brought out in this case were that the license was clandestinely
issued by the Commissioner at a time when the country was transitioning
to anew government, in a manner that flouted the provisions of the Act.
The Commissioner was complicit in the matter, was under suspension, and
could not therefore issue any notice to show cause. Was the CS then
powerless to take action under section 27. The trial court did not think so
and we have no reason to fault him. It was not an isolated case involving
the appellant and in the scheme of the Act the CS was the overall custodian
of the provisions of the Act.*! (first emphasis added)

(This last paragraph suggests some substance to Professor Mumma’s view that in fact CS Balala
and the Courts were exercising constitutional remedies not Mining Act remedies but the Tribunal

makes no comment on this suggestion.)

(i) The Tribunal’s Ruling

222. The Tribunal is mandated to apply international law not Kenyan domestic law, yet in the
Tribunal’s view, the application of international law reaches the same conclusion. The alleged
“investment” is a mining licence. A mining licens is not bricks and mortar. It is wholly the creature
of Kenyan domestic law. Its creation is governed by Kenyan law. The Forests Act and the
Antiquities and Monuments Act excluded from Mr. Masibo any discretion to issue a licence to
mine Mrima Hill. Mr. Masibo was precluded by s. 4(2) of the Environmental (Impact Assessment
and Audit) Regulations 2003 from issuing a mining licence in the absence of EIA approval
expressed in the form of a licence. In the Tribunal’s view, neither the BIT nor the ICSID
Convention can be construed to protect an investment (SML 351) prohibited by Kenyan law
especially in circumstances where, in the Tribunal’s view, the Claimants knew that they had no
such entitlement but attempted a political end-run around the statutory requirements with Mr.
Juma’s assistance. The Claimants were aware of the requirements set out in the roadmap and their
non-compliance with s. 4(2) of the EJA regulations. There is no plausible argument that the
Government is estopped by the Claimants “reliance” on SML 351 as a valid investment under
Kenyan law. If estoppel was available to the Claimants, they have failed to establish the

prerequisites for its application.

223. The Claimants were successful in bending Mr. Masibo to their will but they knew enough
about the Kenyan regulatory system to know they had not yet met its requirements. The Claimants

had no legitimate expectation that SML 351 was valid.

83

PART 23 - THE CLAIMANTS PURSUE A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT

224. In parallel with the Claimants’ judicial review application, Mr. Anderson wrote to the

Deputy President of Kenya, William Ruto,?°* on 22 August 2013, to request a meeting. He

received no response. Mr. Anderson tried again on 9 December 2013.?°* In February 2014, Mr.

Juma intervened and arranged a meeting of Mr. Anderson and Mr. O’Sullivan with Deputy

President Ruto.?4

225. Mr. Anderson’s evidence is that on 11 February 2014, he attended a meeting with Mr. Juma
and Deputy President Ruto and Major (Retired) John Waluke Koyi,?°° a friend of Mr. Juma.
According to Mr. Anderson, Deputy President Ruto admonished CMK for going to the courts and
the press. Mr. Anderson testified that Deputy President Ruto proposed that the Commissioner of
Mines would be willing to “restore” CMK’s licence if (i) CMK withdrew its legal challenge to the
revocation of SML 351; and (ii) the level of royalties was increased so that the project was more
beneficial to the State. Deputy President Ruto also noted that the Governor of Kwale County was

hostile to CMK’s cause.?°°

226. Mr. Anderson testified that he was summoned to another meeting with Deputy President

257

Ruto on 13 February 2014, held in the Deputy President's private office. At this meeting,

Townsend attended a further meeting with Deputy President Ruto.”*? CS Balala also attended the

meeting and said that to restore CMK’s licence the Government would require a free-carried

interest of between 10 and 50%. This proposal was not acceptable to the Claimants.”°!

228. The Claimants contend that they are the victims of “resource nationalism” that operated in
disregard for licence holders’ rights. Days after he was appointed, CS Balala announced details
of a new Kenyan Mining Bill which included Government royalties and other benefits to the

mining sector.?°

229. Around this time, Kenyan officials held mining-related discussions with various Chinese

Government officials and Chinese State-owned organizations.”

Weekly, 6 March 2015, Exhibit C-152. The Mining Bill included (inter alia):
(a) the establishment of a State-owned national mining company;
(b) a rule that the State would be given a 10% free-carried interest in large mining concessions;
(c) increased royalties — in the case of rare earths and niobium, the royalty would more than triple (from
3% to 10%); and
(d) a requirement that holders of mining licences list at least 20% of their equity on the local Kenyan
stock exchange within four years.

 

 

(“Balala says new mining royalties non-negotiable”, Business Daily Africa.com, Exhibit C-153).
26 The evidence is of a very general nature and includes reports that:

(a) on7 August 2013, the Mining Minister met with a Chinese delegation in relation to “issues crucial
to mining”;

85

230.

In the Claimants’ submission, they have been discriminated against in favour of Chinese

investors. The Government responds that the Claimants’ fuss over “resource nationalization” is

sim,

ply an attempted diversion from “the reality. ..that the government in Kenya was getting tough

on corruption and had identified the mining sector as one area where compliance with the law

could be improved.” The Tribunal regards the issue of “resource nationalization” as irrelevant

to the present dispute.

PART 24 - OUTLINE OF CLAIMANTS’ POSITION

231.

In summary, the Claimants contend that:265

(a) the State cannot invoke its own law to avoid its international obligations, especially
considering that most of the State's complaints relate to the alleged acts and

omissions of its own officials;

(b) on 14 August 2013, the Business Daily reported that CS Najib Balala had signed a memorandum
of understanding with the President of the Geological Exploration Technology Institute of Jiangsu
province in China “to map out areas in Kenya that have signs of mineral deposits in a government-
to-government pact that gives the Asian giant [China] an upper hand in future bidding for
exploration and miningcontracts” (See “Minerals survey deal gives Chinese firms upper hand”,
Business Daily, 14 August 2013, Exhibit C-161);

(c) on 29 January 2014, the Shanghai Daily reported that “Mining Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala
said late last year that both Kenyan and Chinese governments have entered into a partnership that
will see the latter do a geo-mapping or airborne survey for minerals in all counties beginning 2014” (See
“Kenya approves mining bill to regulate mineral operations”, Shanghai Daily, 29 January 2014, Exhibit
C-163);

(d) in March 2015, CS Najib Balala announced that the Chinese Geological Institute, a non-
commercial, Government-owned entity, had been awarded the contract to conduct a country-wide
aeromagnetic survey to acquire geological data (See “Kenya to embark on massive exploration campaign
to spur mining investment, economic development”, Mining Weekly, 6 March 2015, Exhibit C-164).

the State's corruption case was baseless from the outset and collapsed at the Hearing

(the State not even putting its allegations to Commissioner Masibo);

the State has no defence to the Claimants’ claims as they relate to SPL 256, which
the State accepts was not affected by “irregular conduct”. The Claimants

invested millions under this licence and generated valuable IP;

the key decision-maker (Commissioner Masibo) “bravely” came forward and his
explanation of his statutory discretion to re-grant SPL256 as SML 351 (a
conditional mining licence) was not effectively challenged by the State at the

Hearing;

the Claimants’ reasonably relied on SML 351 to their detriment;

the State withheld (until Day 4 of the Hearing) two statements given by
Commissioner Masibo to the State in November 2013 that directly contradict

allegations of fact underpinning its legality Objections;

CS Balala’s revocation of SML 351 on 5 August 2013 was arbitrary, malicious and
a clear excess of power under the licence, the Mining Act and the Constitution. He
has been conspicuously absent from these proceedings. Even if the Tribunal were
to find SML 351 void ab initio, the arbitration provision in SML 351 is separable

and valid; and

(h) the Claimants are entitled to relief for the State’s violations of the BIT, plus costs.

PART 25 - JURISDICTION
1. Preliminary Remarks

232. The Claimants contend that ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1) requires that any objection
to the jurisdiction of ICSID or the competence of the tribunal be made “as early as

possible...and in any event no later than the time fixed for the filing of the Counter-Memorial.”

233. The Claimants state that the Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction are out of time.
However, Rule 41(5) expressly permits the Respondent to raise its objections when it did. In any
event, Rule 41(2) provides that the Tribunal “on its own initiative...at any stage of the proceeding”
may consider whether the dispute is “within the jurisdiction of the Center and within its own
competence.”?°* Either way, the jurisdictional issues have been fully argued and will be addressed

by the Tribunal. The Claimants’ “preliminary” objection is rejected.

234. Equally, the Tribunal acknowledges that the arbitration clause survives the Government’s
allegations of illegality, but the continued validity of the arbitration clause simply affirms the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction to determine whether the Claimants made investments that qualified for

treaty protection.

268 ICSID Convention, Regulations and Rules, Rule 41, Preliminary Objections:

(1) Any objection that the dispute or any ancillary claim is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre or, for
other reasons, is not within the competence of the Tribunal shall be made as early as possible. A party shall
file the objection with the Secretary-General no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing
of the counter-memorial, or, if the objection relates to an ancillary claim, for the filing of the rejoinder —
unless the facts on which the objection is based are unknown to the party at that time.

(2) The Tribunal may on its own initiative consider, at any stage of the proceeding, whether the dispute or
any ancillary claim before it is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and within its own competence.

(3)...
88

235. On the other hand, the Government raises the preliminary point that the Claimants have no
claim because SML 351 was never revoked. It was just “suspended” pending review of the Task
Force. No treaty relief is available in respect of a mere “suspension”, decided in the proper conduct

of Government business.

(i) The Claimants’ Position on “Revocation”

236. CS Balala purported explicitly to revoke SML 351 under s. 27 of the Mining Act. In Justice
Torgbor’s opinion, “the State in my view cannot now say such licence was not revoked, or that it
was merely suspended. The State never argued during the court proceedings that SML 351 was

suspended and not revoked.””©? Moreover, according to Justice Torgbor,

(a) there is no express provision in the Mining Act in respect of revocation of a special

mining licence;

(b) the heading to s. 27 is “Revocation of Prospecting Right or Exclusive Prospecting

Licence.” It has no application to a mining licence;?””

(c) an appeal under s. 93 presupposes that the original revocation was accomplished

under s. 27, which is not the case.

237. Regardless of the source of power, Justice Torgbor says revocation is clear from (i) CS

Balala’s public announcement that the licence was revoked; (ii) the letter from the Attorney

General dated 5 August 201377! which provides advice on revocation of licences; (iii) the letter
from the Ministry of Mining dated 19 June 20147” which confirmed that SML 351 has been

revoked; and (iv) the High Court decision which referred to the revocation of SML 351.27

238. To date, no formal notice has been given for the revocation of SML 351 but the

Government took the position before the Kenyan Court that the licence had been revoked.
(ii) The Government’s Position on “Revocation”
239. The Government’s position in this arbitration is that SML 351 has not been revoked.

240. Pending the outcome of the audit by the Task Force, the licences under review were treated
as suspended. Of those licences reviewed by the Task Force, only seven licences were revoked,
by Gazette Notice No. 3264 dated 8 May 2015.7 The Claimants’ purported mining licence,

SML 351, was not one of the licences revoked.

241. The Kenyan Courts did not need to invalidate SML 351 because it was void ab initio.
However, should the Tribunal view the judicial decisions as the source of “revocation”, the
Claimants are not entitled to pursue the claim because there is no plea of “denial of justice” and
there is no Treaty basis on which the Tribunal can otherwise grant relief in a case of “judicial

expropriation”.

242. Professor Mumma argued that CS Balala “could lawfully resort to his oversight powers
that are to be found in the Constitution as well as in statutes that implement the Constitution”.?”>
CS Balala’s press release of 5 August 2013, according to Professor Mumma, “was not revocation
of the licence, it was an intervention which was designed to enable the Cabinet Secretary to gather
the information that would enable the Cabinet Secretary to decide whether in fact any action was

required beyond?’° ‘the establishment of the Task Force.’”?””

243. Justice Torgbor responded that high level constitutional remedies are irrelevant where there
is specific applicable legislation like the Mining Act.?”8

(iti) The Tribunal’s Ruling

244. Regardless of how the Government chooses to describe the status of SML 351, the
Claimants’ mining activities and aspirations were effectively terminated on 5 August 2013. The
Claimants’ attempts to make payments otherwise due under SML 351 were rejected. The
Respondent’s argument that the Claimants have no valid claim because SML 351 was (and is)

simply “suspended” is rejected. The real issue is whether SML 351 is a protected investment.

215 Tr, Day 6, p. 112, Il. 1-21. On Day 6, at p. 58, Justice Torgbor expressed the view that high level constitutional
remedies are irrelevant where there is specific applicable legislation like the Mining Act. Professor Mumma points
out that Article 132(3) of the Constitution assigns responsibilities to the Cabinet Secretary and the National
Government Coordination Act of 2013 in s. 9(3) and 10(1) gives the Cabinet Secretary oversight of the executive
Government. Executive Order No. 2/2013 gave CS Balala specific responsibility for the Ministry of Mines.

2. The Standard of Proof for Jurisdictional Questions

245. The Claimants accept the burden of proof of establishing that they qualify as an “investors”
for the purposes of the BIT and the ICSID Convention?” as well as proving that they held a

qualifying “investment” within the meaning of the BIT and the ICSID Convention.

(i) The Claimants’ Position

246. While the Claimants accept the onus of establishing jurisdiction, they do not accept that
they bear the onus of proof on matters that go beyond the express jurisdictional requirements of
the BIT and the ICSID Convention — neither of which, they say, includes a requirement of
compliance with host State law — and maintain that the State bears the burden of proving the facts

on which its preliminary objections are based. 7°°

(ii) The Government’s Position

247. The Government cites Paushok v. Mongolia where the tribunal found that the “[c]laimants

bear the burden of the proof to demonstrate that their investment is protected [by the dispute

resolution provision of the Russia-Mongolia BIT].”?*!

219 Limited Liability Company Amto v. Ukraine, SCC Arbitration No. 080/2005, Final Award, 26 March 2008,
Exhibit RL-O51, para. 64. See also Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v. The United Arab Emirates, ICSID Case No.
ARB/02/7, Award, 7 July 2004, RL-032, para. 58 (“Claimant accordingly bears the burden of proving to the
satisfaction of the Tribunal that he...belongs to the class of investors in respect of whom the Respondent has
consented to ICSID jurisdiction.”

280 Where the State objects on the basis that an act or event alleged by the Claimants never occurred, the State can
adopt a position of bare denial (but it does so at its own peril). But where the State makes an objection premised on
the existence of a fact the Claimants did not allege in their positive case on jurisdiction, the burden must be on the
State alone (and from the outset) to prove that fact to the applicable standard of proof (which will be higher for more
serious allegations, such as corruption and fraud).

281 Sergei Paushok, CJSC Golden East Company and CJSC Vostokneftegaz Company v. The Government of
Mongolia, UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, 28 April 2011, RL-068, para. 200. See also the
Perenco v. Ecuador tribunal's finding that “[t]he burden of proof to establish the facts supporting its claim to standing

92

248. Inthe same manner, in JCS v. Argentina, the tribunal concluded that:

The burden of proof for the issue of consent falls squarely on a given
claimant who invokes it against a given respondent. Where a claimant
fails to prove consent with sufficient certainty, jurisdiction will be
declined.”*?

249. The Claimants cannot invoke Kenya's consent to ICSID arbitration until they have
fulfilled all of the procedural prerequisites under the BIT andthe Convention. If they are unable

to do so, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear their case.

(iti) | The Tribunal’s Ruling on the Onus of Proof

250. The Claimants bear the onus of establishing jurisdiction under the BIT and under the ICSID
Convention. The onus includes proof of the facts on which jurisdiction depends. One of the
“jurisdictional facts” is the existence of a qualified investment. The Claimants seek to reverse the
onus onto the Government in respect of “the facts on which [the Government’s] preliminary
objections [e.g. illegality] are based.” However, for the most part, the Government’s arguments
are simply denials that the Claimants have proven the jurisdictional facts to the requisite standard,
ie. on a balance of probabilities. According to the Tribunal, the facts on which the Claimants rest

the jurisdiction of the Tribunal have to be proven by them at the outset, as explained in Hamester:

In order to clarify the distinction between a jurisdictional question and a
merits’ question, it is useful to consider the different burden of proof
required for each. If jurisdiction rests on the existence of certain facts, they
have to be proven at the jurisdictional stage. However, if facts are alleged
in order to establish a violation of the relevant BIT, they have to be

 

lies with the Claimant” (Perenco Ecuador Lid. v. The Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petréleos del
Ecuador (Petroecuador), ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6, Decision on Jurisdiction, 30 June 2011, RL-069, para. 98).
282 JCS Inspection and Control Services Limited (United Kingdom) v. The Argentine Republic, UNCITRAL, PCA
Case No. 2010-9, Award on Jurisdiction, 10 February 2012, RL-072, para. 280. (internal citation omitted).

93

accepted as such at the jurisdictional stage, until their existence is
ascertained (or not) at the merits stage.7**

251. In any event, even if proof of the facts on which the illegality rests were considered a
Government’s issue in respect of which it bears the onus of proof, the Tribunal finds, as will be

seen, that the Government has met the burden.

252. While the Claimants assert that there is no doubt that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over
their claims, the Respondent denies that the Claimant has established the prerequisites to

jurisdiction.

253. The Government contends that:

(a) the Claimants have failed to demonstrate that they held any investments capable
of protection under the BIT and the ICSID Convention. In particular, according to

the Government:

(i) the licence at the heart of this dispute (SML 351) was unlawful and void
ab initio. The Claimants disregarded the legal requirements of applying for
and securing valid rights and licences to prospect and mine in Kenya and

procured SML 351 through illegal means and/or bad faith;

(ii) the Claimants had no intellectual property that was capable of treaty
protection. Information provided by the Claimants to the Government in

pursuit of prospecting and mining rights was provided as a matter of self-

283 Gustav F W Hamester GmbH & Co KG v. Republic of Ghana, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/24, Award, 10 June 2010,
para. 143.

94

interest and was no more protected “intellectual property” than the
extensive data utilized by the Claimants from earlier exploration from

Anglo American in the 1950s and onwards;

(iii) no claim arises out of SPL 256 which expired according to its own terms
when the second renewal lapsed on 1 December 2014 without any

Government intervention.

3. The Jurisdictional Requirements
254. It is common ground that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is contingent upon the fulfillment
of the jurisdictional requirements of both the ICSID Convention and the relevant text providing

for consent to arbitration.

255. Article 41 of the ICSID Convention makes plain that the Tribunal is the judge of the
Centre’s jurisdiction and its own competence. In order to determine the existence of its jurisdiction
in any given case, an ICSID tribunal has to analyze the fulfillment of the requirements of the
Washington Convention, and the requirements of the contract, the national law, the BIT or the

multilateral treaty providing for the submission of investment disputes to ICSID arbitration.

(i) The Definition of “Investment”

256. The relevant jurisdictional requirements of the ICSID Convention are contained in its

Article 25, which reads, in pertinent part, as follows:

(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising
directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any
constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the
Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which
the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When

95

the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent
unilaterally.

(2) “National of another Contracting State” means:

any natural person who had the nationality of a Contracting State other
than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties
consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration as well as
on the date on which the request was registered pursuant to paragraph (3)
of Article 28 or paragraph (3) of Article 36, but does not include any
person who on either date also had the nationality of the Contracting State
party to the dispute; and

any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other
than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties
consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any
juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to
the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties
have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State
for the purposes of this Convention.”

257. In other words, in order for the Centre to have jurisdiction over a dispute, three conditions
must be met, according to Article 25 (to which one must add a condition resulting from a general

principle of law, which is the principle of non-retroactivity):

— first, a condition ratione personae: the dispute must oppose a
Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State;

— second, a condition ratione materiae: the dispute must be a legal dispute
arising directly out of an investment;

— third, a condition ratione voluntatis, i.e. the Contracting State and the
investor must consent in writing that the dispute be settled through ICSID
arbitration;

— fourth, a condition ratione temporis: the ICSID Convention must have
been applicable at the relevant time.

258. The jurisdictional requirements of the BIT are contained in its Article 1:

ARTICLE 1
Definitions
For the purposes of this Agreement:

(a) “investment” means every kind of asset and in particular, though
not exclusively, includes:

96

(i) moveable and immovable property and any other property
rights such as mortgages, liens or pledges;

(ii) shares in stock and debentures of a company and any other
form of participation ina company;

(iii) claims to money or to any performance under contract having
a financial value;

(iv) intellectual property rights, goodwill, technical processes and
know-how;

(v) business concessions conferred by law or under contract,
including concessions to search for, cultivate, extract or exploit
natural resources.

A change in the form in which assets are invested does not affect
their character as investments and the term ‘investment’ includes all
investments, whether made before or after the date of entry into force
of this Agreement.

(c) ‘nationals’ means:

(i) in respect of the United Kingdom : physical persons deriving their
status as United Kingdom nationals from the law in force in the United
Kingdom;

(ii) in respect of the Republic of Kenya : physical persons deriving
their status as Kenyan nationals from the law in force in Kenya;

(d) “companies” means:

(i) in respect of the United Kingdom : corporations, firms and
associations incorporated or constituted under the law in force in any
part of the United Kingdom or in any territory to which this Agreement
is extended in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 ;

(ii) in respect of the Republic of Kenya : any juridical person as well
as any company or association with or without legal personality and
having its residence within the Republic of Kenya , irrespective of
whether or not its activities are directed at profit;

ARTICLE 8

Reference to International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes

(1) Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit to the International
Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter referred to
as "the Centre") for settlement by conciliation or arbitration under the
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and
Nationals of Other States opened for signature at Washington on 18 March
1965 any legal dispute arising between that Contracting Party and a
national or company of the other Contracting Party concerning an
investment of the latter in the territory of the former.

97

(2) Acompany which is incorporated or constituted under the law in force
in the territory f one Contracting Party and in which before such a dispute
arises the majority of shares are owned by nationals or companies of the
other Contracting Party shall in accordance with Article 25(2)(b) of the
Convention be treated for the purposes of the Convention as a company of
the other Contracting Party.

259. In other words, the essential jurisdictional requirements under the BIT, to which one must
add a condition resulting from the general principle of law of non-retroactivity, overlap with the
requirements of the ICSID Convention — the condition ratione voluntatis being fulfilled by Article
8:

— first, a condition ratione personae: the dispute must oppose a
Contracting State and a national or company of another Contracting State;

— second, a condition ratione materiae: there must exist a dispute
concerning a qualifying investment;

— third, a condition ratione temporis: the BIT must have been applicable
at the relevant time.

(ii) The Definition of Protected Investment

260. It is accepted jurisprudence that in order to be protected an investment has to be in
accordance with the laws of the host State and made in good faith. This requirement can be

analyzed at the jurisdictional or the merits level.

261. The formulation of this requirement can be found in the summary given in Phoenix:

To summarize all the requirements for an investment to benefit from the
international protection of ICSID, the Tribunal considers that the
following six elements have to be taken into account:

1 —a contribution in money or other assets;
2 —a certain duration;
3 —an element of risk;

4~—an operation made in order to develop an economic activity in the host
State;

98

5 — assets invested in accordance with the laws of the host State;

6 — assets invested bona fide.”**

262. The Tribunal will proceed to analyze the conditions ratione personae, ratione voluntatis,
ratione temporis and ratione materiae, including in the last element the question of its legality and

its bona fide.

PART 26 - JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES ON WHICH THE CLAIMANTS ARE
SUCCESSFUL

(a) Ratione Personae

263. The protections granted pursuant to Articles 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the UK-Kenya BIT are

expressed to be in favour of “nationals or companies of either Contracting Party.”

264. The Republic of Kenya is a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention. As Cortec UK
and Stirling are nationals of the UK — also a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention. CMK is

a Kenyan company.

(i) The Claimants’ Position

265. Article 1(d) of the BIT defines “companies” as (in the case of the UK) “corporations, firms
and associations incorporated or constituted under the law in force of any part of the United
Kingdom.” Cortec UK was incorporated as a private limited company under the law of England

and Wales on 13 March 2007;7*° Stirling was incorporated as a private limited company under the

284 Phoenix Action, Lid. v. The Czech Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award, 19 April 2009, CL-27, para. 114.

Exhibit C-3.

99

law of England and Wales on 24 April 2007.78° Cortec UK and Stirling are therefore “companies”
of the UK for the purposes of the BIT. The Government raises the alleged sale of shares to Uppal
(a company wholly owned by Cortec UK and Stirling) but the evidence is that no such sale took

place.?*”

266. The Government’s argues that for a time, Cortec UK and Stirling were temporarily struck
off the English Companies Register, and that this discontinuity is fatal to their status as qualified
investors. The Claimants have demonstrated that under the UK Companies Act restoration to the
Registry cures the default.7** There was therefore, as a matter of UK law, no discontinuity. Cortec

UK and Stirling meet the criteria for qualified investors.

267. In the case of CMK, a Kenyan company, jurisdiction ratione personae arises from the

specific regime of Article 8(2) of the BIT, which provides as follows:

A company which is incorporated or constituted under the law in force
in the territory of one Contracting Party and in which before such a
dispute arises the majority of shares are owned by nationals or
companies of the other Contracting Party shall in accordance with
Article 25(2)(b) of the [ICSID] Convention be treated for the
purposes of the [ICSID] Convention as a company of the other
Contracting Party.

268. CMK was incorporated on 4 July 2007. On 31 July 2007, Cortec UK and Stirling each

acquired 35% of the shares of CMK. Together, Cortec and Stirling therefore hold the majority

(70%) of the shares of CMK, with the result that the deemed nationality mechanism in Article 8(2)

is engaged in this case (and has been since 31 July 2007 at the latest).

(ii) The Government’s Position

269. The two UK incorporated Claimants, Cortec UK and Stirling, are not protected investors.
Quite apart from being struck off the UK Companies’ Register, neither company made any
meaningful financial contribution, or undertook any risk in relation to the Mrima Hill project.
There is no evidence that any investment was made flowing from the United Kingdom to Kenya.
The true investors in the Claimants’ Mrima Hill project are Mr. O’ Sullivan, an Australian national,
Mr. Anderson, a South African national, and Pacific Wildcat, a Canadian Company. Yet none of

these investors are UK nationals and they are not entitled to bring a claim under the BIT.

(iti) The Tribunal’s Ruling

270. The Tribunal concludes on the evidence that for the purposes of the BIT, the Tribunal has
jurisdiction ratione personae in respect of CMK as well as Cortec UK and Stirling. Restoration
of the UK companies to the UK Companies’ Register nullified the legal effect of being, for a time,

struck off for administrative reasons.

271. It is well established in arbitral law that the “origin of funds” issue is not a valid objection.
The UK companies hold the shares. Through their corporate network money was invested in

Kenya.

101

272. Kenya and the UK reached an agreement in Article 8(2) of the BIT, which specifically
refers to Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention?” which allows the parties to agree that a
locally-incorporated company will be treated as a “national of another Contracting State.””°! Thus,
when read together, Article 8(2) of the BIT and Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention deem

CMK to be a “national” of the UK for the purposes of being a “qualified investor” in this dispute.

273. Accordingly, the Tribunal is satisfied it has jurisdiction ratione personae over all Parties

to this dispute.

(b) Ratione Voluntaris

274. Article 8 of the BIT embodies the State’s advance written consent (“[e]ach Contracting

Party hereby consents”) to submit to ICSID arbitration legal disputes arising between the State and

UK nationals or companies concerning a protected investment.?°

(i) The Claimants’ Position

275. The Claimants argue that these words constitute an offer to arbitrate which a qualified
investor (in this case, a UK company) may accept by filing a Request for Arbitration at ICSID.

Article 8(3) of the BIT reflects this, providing that the claimant “may institute proceedings by

299 BIT, 13 September 1999, Exhibit C-17. Article 8(2) of the BIT provides that “[a] company which is incorporated
or constituted under the law in force in the territory of one Contracting Party and in which before such a dispute
arises the majority of shares are owned by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party shall in accordance
with Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention be treated for the purposes of the Convention as a company of the other
Contracting Party.”

29! Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention defines “National of another Contracting State” to mean “any juridical
person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which
the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person which had
the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control,
the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this
Convention.”

282 BIT, 13 September 1999, Exhibit C-17, Article 8.

addressing a request to that effect to the Secretary-General of the Centre...”” The Claimants did so

on 18 June 2015.

276. Article 8(1) of the BIT provides as follows:

Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit to the International
Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter
referred to as "the Centre") for settlement by conciliation or
arbitration under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment
Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States opened for
signature at Washington on 18 March 1965 any legal dispute arising
between that Contracting Party and a national or company of the other
Contracting Party concerning an investment of the latter in the territory
of the former.** (emphasis added)

277. Article 8(3) of the BIT provides that, in circumstances of an investment dispute, if
“agreement cannot be reached within three months between the parties to [the] dispute through
pursuit of local remedies or otherwise, then, if the national or company affected also consents in
writing to submit the dispute to the Centre for settlement by conciliation or arbitration under the
Convention, either party may institute proceedings by addressing a request to that effect to the

Secretary-General of the Centre as provided in Articles 28 and 36 of the Convention.”

278. Inthe Request For Arbitration, the Claimants consented in writing to the submission of the
dispute to ICSID, choosing arbitration (in the exercise of the right expressly given to them under
Article 8(3) of the BIT).?** Both the State and the Claimants have, therefore, provided their written
consent to the submission of their dispute to ICSID. Jurisdiction ratione voluntatis is present for

the purposes of the ICSID Convention.

284 Claimant’s Request for Arbitration dated 18 June 2015, para 6.6(d).

103

279. An issue has arisen, however, with respect to proper notice of the claim. The Claimants
note that the BIT does not include any notice requirement and argue that it would do considerable
violence to the text of the BIT to imply a requirement of formal notice.” In any event, the facts
show that written notice of CMK’s complaint was given in August 2013.7°° The Claimants

consider that the State is maintaining this objection in bad faith.?°”

280. The dispute was clearly notified to the Government as soon as SPL 351 was revoked on 5

August 2013.

(ii) The Government’s Position

281. The Claimants failed to give proper notice of their claim to the Respondent pursuant to the
BIT prior to commencing these proceedings, and accordingly failed to provide the “cooling off”

requirement in Article 8(3) of the BIT** thereby vitiating the Respondent’s consent.

(iti) The Tribunal’s Ruling

282. There was no issue of lack of notice or lack of an opportunity to arrive at a settlement. The
extensive negotiations between the Claimants and the Deputy President Rutu have already been

described. The Claimants had been pursuing judicial local remedies since well before the initiation

295 See Claimants’ Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections dated 10 November 2017, paras. 303-305. As set out by the
tribunal in Bear Creek v. Peru (at para. 320), “under international law, the Tribunal may not import a requirement
that limits its jurisdiction when such a limit is not specified by the parties” (Bear Creek Mining Corporation v. Republic
of Peru, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/21, Award, 30 November 2017, CL-105).

of this arbitration.” The three-month curative period contemplated by Article 8(3) of the BIT

was therefore satisfied well before the Claimants referred the dispute to arbitration.

283. The Tribunal agrees that the all Parties gave advance consent to the arbitration of disputes

concerning qualified investments.

(c) Ratione Temporis

(i) The Claimants’ Position

284. The Claimants contend that the protections of the BIT are not time limited. Article 1(a)
of the BIT provides that “the term ‘investments’ includes all investments, whether made
before or after the date of entry into force of this Agreement.”*° The BIT entered into

force on 13 September 1999 and remains in force today.*”!

Thus, the BIT protects any
investments made before and after 13 September 1999. Nevertheless, all of the Claimants'

investments were made, and the dispute arose, well after the BIT came into force.

(ii) The Government’s Position

285. The Government contends that the Claimants cannot establish that the jurisdictional

requirements were satisfied at that relevant time.

105

(iti) The Tribunal’s Ruling

286. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that if there existed qualified investments, ratione

temporis would not be a problem.

(d) Ratione Materiae: the existence of an investment

287. The Parties concentrated on Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention (“Jurisdiction of the

Centre”) which provides:

The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising
directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or
any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State
designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another
Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in
writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their
consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.*°? (emphasis
added)

(i) The Claimants’ Position

288. Each of the jurisdictional requirements prescribed in Article 25(1) of the ICSID

Convention is satisfied in this case as follows.

“Legal Dispute”
289. The dispute at hand arises out of Kenya’s alleged violation of the Claimants’ rights under
the BIT. The BIT is a treaty and, therefore, an instrument of international law. Accordingly, the

present dispute is inherently legal in nature.

302 |CSID Convention, Article 25(1).

106

“Arising Directly”
290. The Claimants’ investments referenced above, include (without limitation) SPL 256 and
SML 351 and the rights granted under these instruments. The present dispute arises directly out
of Kenya’s allegedly unlawful revocation of SML 351, the measures the Kenyan Government took
against the Claimants’ other assets and interests (namely their shares, intellectual property rights
and know-how) and the resulting alleged injuries suffered by the Claimants. The dispute therefore

arises directly out of the Claimants’ investments.

“Out of an investment”

291. The Claimants’ investments are specifically covered by Article 1(a)(i), (ii), (iv) and (v) of
the BIT. The Claimants note that the ICSID Convention does not define “investment” and so it is
for the Tribunal to ascertain the meaning of this term and apply it to the facts. In determining
whether there is an “investment” for ICSID Convention purposes, it is usual to take into account

some or all of the four Salini*”? indicators:

(a) contribution by the investor;

(b) duration of performance;

(c) participation in the risks of the transaction; and

(d) contribution by the investor to the economic development of the host State.**

Jurisdiction, 23 July 2001, CL-3.
304 Salini Costruttori SpA v. Kingdom of Morocco, CL-3.

107

292. In the Claimants’ submission, the Salini criteria to determine the existence of an

“investment” are satisfied in this case.

293. The Claimants have contributed both money and assets in relation to their interests in the
project. They say that between 31 July 2007 and 5 August 2013 when CS Balala intervened, CMK
alone spent not less than Kshs 773,525,404 (US $9.32 million)*° on the Mrima Hill project.
Cortec UK spent not less than Kshs 68,140,942 (US $775,651) and Stirling spent not less than
Kshs 61,818,188 (US $703,679)" on the Mrima Hill project. Between 1 July 2009 and 31
December 2015, PAW spent over CAN $37 million (US $33.7 million)*”* in connection with the

Mrima Hill project.*°? Throughout this period, the Claimants also contributed geological and

useful information regarding mine development.*!?

294. The concept of “investment” must recognize the realities of funding and management
within a corporate group. The Vienna Convention requires the interpretation of the term
“investment” to have due regard to the object and purposes of the Convention.*!! This means the

term should be read in a way that recognizes the realities of funding and the essential role that

3! There is nothing in the text of the Convention to require that a claimant investor itself make a monetary
contribution in order for there to be an “investment” for the purposes of Article 25.

108

corporate structures like that used by the Claimants play in financing private foreign investment
and driving economic development. The overwhelming weight of authority is against treating
“origin of capital” as a condition for ICSID jurisdiction.*'? In the case at hand, there is no dispute
that Stirling and Cortec UK contributed capital directly to CMK, the dispute is over how much

they contributed.

295. The BIT does not allow for the origins of CMK's capital to be treated any differently to the
origins of Cortec UK's and Stirling's capital. This is because, under Article 8(2) of the BIT, Kenya
agreed that CMK is to be “treated for the purposes of the [ICSID] Convention as a company of the
[UK].”3!3 To permit the State to draw a distinction between the origin of capital expended by
Cortec UK and Stirling and the origin of capital expended by CMK would be to allow the State to

breach Article 8(2) of the BIT and to benefit from that breach by using it as a basis for objection.

296. Details of the proof and timing of Stirling’s, Cortec UK’s and PAW’s investments can be
found in the Claimants’ Memorial of Claim (paragraphs 213-217 under the heading “Damnum
emergens”). CMK’s audited Annual Reports note that “[t]he Company has received cash or had
its liabilities settled by persons or companies related to directors” and treat payments by Stirling

UK, Cortec UK, Messrs. O’ Sullivan and Anderson and PAW as “Long Term Loans” and/or “Other

Liabilities”*"*

313 See Claimants’ Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections dated 10 November 2017, paras. 293-294. The only condition
that must be met in order for CMK to be deemed British for ICSID purposes under Article 8(2) of the BIT is
that the majority of its shares were owned by nationals or companies of the UK before the dispute arose, which they
were. Once this condition is met, CMK has all the rights of a UK national under the ICSID Convention (including
the right to an award under Article 48).

109

(ii) The Government’s Position

297. Quite apart from the objection ratione personae, the Government alleges that Cortec UK
and Stirling are two shell companies that made no financial contribution and that no investment

was made from the United Kingdom into Kenya.

(iti) The Tribunal’s Ruling

298. In the Tribunal’s view, the Government has adopted an excessively narrow view of
financial contribution. In Wena Hotels v. Egypt,*'> the tribunal addressed not only the intertwined
“interests of subsidiaries and affiliates” but also the situation were at least some of the “subsidiaries

and affiliates” are nationals of other States:

ICSID practice has also been quite flexible on claims that include the
interests of subsidiaries and affiliates, including on occasion entities that
are nationals of States that are not contracting parties to the Convention.*!°

299. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that the Respondent’s objection denies a realistic
appreciation of customary corporate structures and investment financing. The Tribunal concludes

that there was a contribution by the Claimants to the project in Kenya.

300. The other elements of the Salini test are similarly satisfied:

(a) the Claimants’ investments (though not protected) had existed for more than

five years before the dispute arose;>!”

(b) the Claimants’ investments involved acceptance of the commercial risks that
are inherent in a long-term mining project, both in respect of discovery and

exploitation;

(c) as to “contribution to economic development”, it is evident that prospecting and

developing a mineral deposit of the potential value of Mrima Hill could make an

{318

important contribution to Kenya's Gross Domestic Produc Of course, risk

capital cannot guarantee a successful result. Otherwise it would not be

characterized as risk capital.

301. The Claimants also note some collateral benefits associated with the Mrima Hill project.
CMK hired local staff (from labourers through to geologists), built (or offered to build)
classrooms for local schools, a medical clinic (although contradicted on this point by the
evidence of Dr. Rogers), provided pumps at community water points, established a nursery

for forest rehabilitation, developed infrastructure and provided technology.

37 Donald O'Sullivan First Witness Statement, para 10; David Anderson First Witness Statement, paras. 26 and 147.

As the PS Mohammed put it in his 26 March 2013 letter to NEMA:
The mineral resource riches of Mrima Hill have been confirmed through extensive historical work
and prospecting spanning several years. The initial results from the drilling works by Cortec Mining
company has inferred niobium resource estimate of over 100 million tonnes and additional 30 million
tonnes of rare earth minerals that could sustain the project for 20-30 years. In fact the rare earth
mineral deposits of Mrima are estimated to be the third largest in the world. These minerals are
some of the most valuable in the world and are therefore considered a significant economic resource
for the country with tremendous potential to contribute to the attainment of the country's Vision
2030 towards a globally competitive and prosperous nation with a high quality of life.

Director General NEMA, 26 March 2013, Exhibit C-135.)

318 Memo of Meeting at Office of the President of Kenya, 6 March 2013, Exhibit C-166.

111

302. If the Claimants had fulfilled the requisites of a lawful investment, other requirements of

the ICSID Convention, whether or not viewed through the lens of Salini, would have been satisfied.

(e) Ratione Materiae: the existence of a protected investment; no lack of good faith

303. The Tribunal will now discuss the issue of the existence of a protected investment, i.e. it
will verify whether the investment has been made in good faith. This issue is discussed here, as
the Tribunal concludes that there was no lack of good faith and thus this is an issue on which the
Claimants succeed. The question of the existence of an investment made in accordance with the

Kenyan laws will be dealt with later.

(i) The Claimants’ Position

304. The Claimants proceeded at all times in good faith in its dealings with the Government

which did not reciprocate the good faith, but acted abusively and in bad faith.

(ii) The Government’s Position

305. The Government argues that the Claimants’ conduct vis-a-vis the Government violated
the principle of good faith and the Tribunal should decline jurisdiction to hear the Claimants’

case.

306. It relies on the maxim nemo auditur propriam turpitudinem allegans, the Inceysa tribunal

confirmed that:
...the foreign investor cannot seek to benefit from an investment
effectuated by means of one or several illegal acts and, consequently,

enjoy the protection granted by the host State, such as access to
international arbitration to resolve disputes, because it is evident that its

112

act had a fraudulent origin and, as provided by the legal maxim,
“nobody can benefit from his own fraud.”*!°

307. Similarly, the Khan v. Mongolia tribunal echoed the Jnceysa tribunal’s finding on this
point, stating that:

An investor who has obtained its investment in the host state only by acting

in bad faith or in violation of the laws of the host state, has brought him

or herself within the scope of application of the [investment treaty] only

as a result of his wrongful acts. Such an investor should not be allowed

to benefit as a result, in accordance with the maxim nemo auditur
propriam turpitudinem allegans.*°

(iti) The Tribunal’s Ruling

308. The Tribunal has rejected the allegations of bribery and corruption. Other forms of bad
faith on the part of the Claimants have not been proven on a balance of probabilities. While some
aspects of the Claimants’ conduct have been criticized in these reasons, such acts as are criticized

do not amount, either individually or collectively, to proof of bad faith.

PART 27 - JURISDICTION ISSUES ON WHICH THE CLAIMANTS FAIL

309. The issue is whether SPL 256 or SML 351 or associated “intellectual property” qualify as

protected investments, as having been made in accordance with the Kenyan laws.

113

(a) Purposive Interpretation: Does the BIT Contain an Implicit Limitation to
Lawful Investments?

310. The Tribunal agrees with Justice Torgbor that it is appropriate to interpret the Mining Act
“purposively, meaning to allow the objects of the Act or the licence to be fulfilled rather than to
prevent such fulfillment.”**! However, Justice Torgbor views the purpose to be “to enable the
licence to be issued.”*?? The Tribunal prefers the broader approach of Professor Mumma which
interprets the Mining Act in the context of the entire regulatory system and requires the eligibility

of a mining project to be evaluated in that broader statutory context.

311. The Tribunal does not agree simply to interpret the Mining Act so as to facilitate the issue
of mining licences. There may be cases where (as here) issuance of a mining licence conflicts

with the broader purposes of the Mining Act and the broader Kenyan legislative framework.

312. As mentioned earlier, this aspect of the case does not turn on the Government's allegations
of bribery and corruption, which the Tribunal has put aside in light of the Government’s decision
not to put those allegations to Mr. Masibo for his explanation. Equally, the allegations of
corruption against Mr. Juma are speculative and entirely insufficient to support such a serious

allegation.

313. The issue here is whether the BIT extends protection to a mining licence [SML 351] not
issued “in accord with the laws of Kenya” because the Claimants failed to satisfy statutory

prerequisites such as EJA approval.

22 Ty, Day 6, p. 73, Il. 14-20.

114

(i) The Claimants’ Position

314. Regulatory compliance is not a jurisdictional issue. There is no express legality
requirement in the UK-Kenya BIT. As held by the tribunal in the recent case of Bear Creek v.

Peru: “under international law, the Tribunal may not import a requirement that limits its

9932

jurisdiction when such a limit is not specified by the [contracting] parties.”*** In the case at hand,

without any express legality requirement, questions of regulatory compliance could only go to the

merits (in which context the onus of proving non-compliance would be on the State).*?+

315. The decision of the tribunal in Kim v. Uzbekistan* should apply to the “illegalities”
alleged by the State. The burden is on the State to apply and satisfy the Kim test*?° which holds

that:

...the interpretive task is guided by the principle of proportionality. The
Tribunal must balance the object of promoting economic relations by
providing a stable investment framework with the harsh consequence of
denying the application of the BIT in total when the investment is not made
in compliance with legislation. The denial of the protections of the BIT is
a harsh consequence that is a proportional response only when its
application is triggered by noncompliance with a law that results in a
compromise of a correspondingly significant interest of the Host State.*?’

33 Bear Creek v. Perti, Award, 30 November 2017, CL-105, para. 320.

324 See Claimants’ Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections dated 10 November 2017, paras. 14-54.

325 See Claimants’ Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections dated 10 November 2017, paras. 131-137.

326 In Vladislav Kim and others v. Republic of Uzbekistan, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/6, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8
March 2017, RL-185, the tribunal held that the State would need to prove that “the investor's conduct and the law
involved results in a compromise of a significant interest of the Host State to such an extent that the harshness of the
sanction of placing the investment outside of the protections of the BIT is a proportionate consequence for the
violation examined.” For example, the State alleges that Commissioner Masibo did not have authority to issue a
conditional mining licence without degazetting the area as a national monument. To establish that this “illegality”
vitiates jurisdiction, the State would need to lead evidence as to the considerations relevant to the first and second
steps of the Kim test. A summary of the three step Kim test and the relevant factors is provided in the Claimants’
Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 133.

327 Kim v. Uzbekistan, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 March 2017, RL-185, para. 413

  

 

115

316. Even if (arguendo), regulatory compliance was treated as a matter of jurisdiction, the
Claimants submit that a proper application of the Kim test should result in a rejection of each of

the alleged “illegalities” as a basis for the “harsh consequence” of denying treaty protection.

317. The Claimants submit that none of the alleged violations that underpin the Government’s
Illegality Objections would justify the Tribunal declining jurisdiction, even if the alleged illegal

conduct had occurred (which is denied) and blame for it could be assigned to the Claimants (which
is also denied).***

(ii) The Respondent’s Position

318. The Respondent contends that the Claimants’ purported investment was procured in
violation of both Kenyan law and international law. The Phoenix tribunal found that “States cannot

be deemed to offer access to the ICSID dispute settlement mechanism to investments made in

99329

violation of their laws, and this is so whether or not the treaty at issue contains an explicit

clause requiring investments to be made “in accordance with” domestic law.**° It stated that
“this condition — the conformity of the establishment of the investment with the national laws —

is implicit even when not expressly stated in the relevant BIT.”>*!

*°8 The Claimants note that most of the “illegalities” alleged by the State (see Claimants’ Rejoinder on Preliminary
Objections, Kim Annex, items 3-6) do not arise out of the Claimants’ conduct, but rather the acts and omissions of
Commissioner Masibo in granting SML 351 (i.e. this is not a case of a foreign investor allegedly flouting local
regulations, but a case of State officials supposedly failing to adhere to internal rules and processes). This
undoubtedly impacts the assessment of the “seriousness of the Claimants’ conduct” for the second step of the Kim test.

331 Phoenix Action v. The Czech Republic, CL-27, para.101.

116

(iti) The Tribunal’s Ruling

319. The Tribunal concludes that for an investment such as a licence, which is the creature of
the laws of the Host State, to qualify for protection, it must be made in accordance with the laws
of the Host State. The claims do not relate to bricks and mortar, as earlier observed. The claimed
rights flow from a document which has no legal existence or effect, and cannot therefore give rise

to compensable rights.

320. The Tribunal endorses the application of the Kim principle of proportionality to an
assessment of the impact of alleged illegalities. Omission of a minor regulatory requirement, such
as the act of Mr. Langwen on 8 July 2013 to issue an ordinary letter rather than use Form 3 of
Schedule 1 of the Environmental (Impact Assessment and Audit) Regulations, or inadvertent
misstatements, will not have the same impact as an investment “created” in defiance of an

important statutory prohibition imposed in the public interest.

321. The Tribunal concludes that for an investment to be protected on the international level, it

has to be in substantial compliance with the significant legal requirement of the host state.

(b) Were the Claimants’ Investments Made in Accordance with Kenyan Law:
What Was the Content of the Kenyan Law Concerning Mining Licences?

322. The next question is therefore to examine whether the Claimants’ Investments were made

in accordance with the Laws of Kenya

(i) The Claimants’ Position

323. As stated, the definition of “investment” was clearly intended to be very broad (“every

kind of asset”), and, according to the Claimants, include:

117

(a) the shares in CMK;

(b) Special Prospecting Licence 256 issued to CMK as renewed from time to time and

the rights granted thereunder, including:

(i) CMK’s “full and exclusive liberty and license to prospect and explore for

ALL MINERALS”? in the licenced area; and

(ii) CMK’s entitlement (“shall be entitled”) to “such further or other rights over
the Area or any part of parts of the Area or to the grant of a Special Mining

Lease or Leases for a period not exceeding twenty-one (21) years [...]”;?77

(c) Special Mining Licence 351 and the rights thereunder, including;***

(i) CMK's right, under Clause 2, which provides that “[CMK] shall have the
full and exclusive right to explore, develop and mine Niobium and Rare
Earths Elements (REEs) resources in the area”>*> for the term fixed in the

preamble to SML 351, being 21 years; and

(ii) CMK's right, under Clause 16, to “occupy such portions of the surface
of the land of the Area for the purposes of the operations permitted by

[SML 351]”;*%6

82 SPL 256, Exhibit C-6, Preamble (emphasis added).
PL 256 Exhibit C-6, Clause 22.

34 SML 351, Exhibit C-9.

335 SML 351, Exhibit C-9, Clause 2 (emphasis added).
336 SML 351, Exhibit C-9, Clause 16.

  

118

(d) Intellectual Property (IP) rights, including the know-how that CMK generated and
applied in furtherance of the Mrima Hill project, such as geological and drilling
data, resource analyses, feasibility studies, technical processes and project
development plans authored by or on behalf of CMK and provided to the State (via

the DMG and other agencies).

324. The investments of Cortec UK and Stirling include the shares they each directly hold in
CMK, including the value of those shares, dividends and the returns due to Cortec UK and Stirling
as their owners. Shares and other “forms of participation in a company” are covered investments
under Article 1(a)(ii) of the BIT; dividends and returns are “claims to money” for the purposes of

Article 1(a)(iii) of the BIT.

325. The BIT does not require that “investments” be direct. It is well settled that, where a BIT
does not expressly require that investments be direct, indirect investments by Cortec UK and

Stirling are covered.

326. The Claimants argue that all their investments were made in accordance with Kenyan laws.

(ii) The Respondent’s Position

327. The Claimants case stands or falls on the validity of SML 351. The prospecting licence,
SPL 256, expired as a result of the terms of the second renewal ending 1 December 2014. No
Government action was taken against it. The Kenyan Courts have held that SML 351 was void ab
initio. It had no legal existence. The Tribunal should accept the rulings of the Kenyan Courts on

a point of Kenyan law and dismiss the claims.

119

(iii) The Tribunal’s Ruling on SPL 256

328. The special prospecting licence was not itself a licence to make money. It was a licence to

spend money. Prospecting, as such, involves cost not revenue.

329. Prospecting may be a stepping stone to a profitable mine but not necessarily so, and in Dr.
Rigby’s opinion (which the Tribunal accepts), the Claimants never established the economic
viability of the Mrima Hill mine (a conclusion echoed, according to Dr. Rigby, by Mr. Townsend

of PAW in his statement of 29 July 2013).

330. If the Claimants had proceeded to fulfill the conditions precedent to a mining licence
(assuming they were ever in a position to do so), the prospecting work might have led eventually
to the wealth the Claimants describe, but the wealth would in that case flow from work under the

mining licence not the prospecting licence.

331. There is no doubt CMK generated and submitted considerable data about the minerals of
Mrima Hill, but the data was freely given by the Claimants to the Government in the hopes of —
but with no entitlement to — a mining licence. The data was not disclosed on the basis it was to
remain the property of CMK. There was no protected investment in intellectual property. It will
be recalled that the Claimants made extensive use of the data generated by the exploratory work

of earlier prospectors as well as the Kenyan Mines and Geological Department.

(iv) — The Tribunal’s Ruling on the Legality of SML 351

332. The Tribunal concludes that the sole surviving subject matter of the arbitration is the

alleged special mining licence, SML 351. The Tribunal rejects, for reasons to be discussed, Mr.

120

Masibo’s theory, apparently developed in the course of his criminal case, that SML 351 was really

a “re-grant” of SPL 256 with fresh conditions.

333. In the Tribunal’s view, SML 351 was void ab initio under international law and the

Tribunal is without jurisdiction:

(a)

(b)

(c)

for the reasons already outlined, ICSID and the BIT protects only “lawful
investments.” The text and purpose of the BIT and the ICSID Convention are not
consistent with holding host governments financially responsible for investments
created in defiance of their laws fundamental protecting public interests such as the
environment. The explicit language to the effect that protected investments must
be made “in accordance with the laws of Kenya” is therefore unnecessary to secure

the objects and purpose of the BIT;

in any event, SML 351 is a piece of paper whose value, if any, lies exclusively in
the consequences attached to it by Kenyan law. In this case, as the Kenyan Courts

have said, Kenyan law attached no consequences to the piece of paper;

Mining Commissioner Moses Masibo lacked jurisdiction even to consider issuance
of a special mining licence in light of the status of Mrima Hill as a nature reserve,
a forestry reserve and a national monument encircled by layers of statutory
protection under the Forests Act, The Environmental (Impact Assessment and
Audit) Regulations 2003, the Antiquities and Monuments Act and the Mining Act

and reinforced by the conditions attached to SPL 256;

121

(d) although this Tribunal is applying international law rather than Kenyan law, the

Tribunal agrees with the Kenyan Courts that SML 351 as issued was void ab initio.

(c) Were the Claimants’ Investments Made in Accordance with Kenyan Law: Did
Commissioner Masibo Have Jurisdiction to Issue a Mining Licence?

334. Mr. Masibo asserted a very broad jurisdiction and discretion. In his witness statement,
dated 27 November 2017, he testifies that as Commissioner, he possessed “sole,
express/unequivocal and primary legal authority, power and responsibility under the Mining Act
Chapter 306 to grant, deny or cancel Licenses of the first instance.” The short answer to Mr.

Masibo’s position was provided by the Claimants’ own legal expert, Justice Torgbor:

Q. ...but you accept that if there is a mandatory statutory requirement, that
the statute will prevail.

A. (by Justice Torgbor) Yes, indeed. Professor Mumma agrees.**”

(i) The Claimants’ Position

335. The Claimants contend that the issuance of SML 351 was fully in accordance with Kenyan

law.

336. In the alternative, the Claimants contend that the Government’s arguments are not

jurisdictional. The Claimants refer the Tribunal to three authorities in this regard:

(a) Liman Caspian Oil BV and NCL Dutch Investment BV v. Kazakhstan: in this
case, the tribunal found (at paragraph 187) that “[s]ince the transfer of the Licence

was not invalid, but only voidable, Claimants’ investment does not fall outside the

31 Ty, Day 6, p. 254, Il. 17-25.

122

scope of Respondent’s consent to jurisdiction [under the Energy Charter
Treaty].”*** Significantly, the Liman Caspian tribunal considered that it would
arguably have had jurisdiction even if the investment (a licence) was void ab

initio under host State law;°?

(b) World Duty Free v. Kenya: although this case concerned a contract governed by
Kenyan and English law (and was therefore not a case decided by application of
international law), the award includes a discussion of the void/voidable

distinction;*“°

(c) Parry & Grant Encyclopaedic Dictionary of International Law: “void/voidable —
The distinction common in municipal legal systems, applicable mainly to contracts,
that particular circumstances may render them void or voidable, whereby some are
null ab initio and require no formal recognition of their nullity, and other subsist
until such time as they are nullified by a judicial body, has no direct counterpart

in international law.”*4!

Excerpts of Award, 22 June 2010, CL-106, para. 187.
389 Liman Caspian v. Kazakhstan, CL-106, para. 187:
even in the case of an investment finally found to be in breach of Kazakh law from the very beginning
it could be argued that an investment had still been made and consequently that a dispute over such an
investment regarding an alleged breach of the [Energy Charter Treaty] would fall within the jurisdiction
of this Tribunal. In such a case, the question of legality might well be relevant to the merits, but it would
not have preclusive effect at the level of jurisdiction.

Press, 3" edition, 2009), CL-107, p. 664.

123

(ii) The State’s Position

337. The State refers to the decision dated 20 March 2015 of the Nairobi High Court that
because Commissioner Masibo had not been furnished with the requisite consents under Kenyan
law, “he could not issue a valid Mining Licence and the Licence...was null and void and of no

legal effect.”*? The Government endorses the view of the Trial Justice that:

A party who flouts the law to gain an advantage cannot expect that the
court will aid him to sustain the advantageous position that he acquired
through the violation of the law. “4

338. A number of tribunals have relied upon and applied host State courts’ determinations
on questions of domestic law.*4 For example, the GAMI v. Mexico tribunal found that the

Mexican courts’ decision on the legality of an expropriation was “an authoritative expression

of national law” to which the tribunal had to defer as far as Mexican law was concerned.*45

In the Chevron v. Ecuador decision, the tribunal similarly emphasized the importance of a

tribunal deferring questions of municipal law to the local courts of a host State.*4°

339. Further, a tribunal should not act as an appellate body in respect of the decision of a

national court.*4” Instead, a tribunal should “accept the findings of local courts” as long as there

are no gross deficiencies, including those amounting to a denial of justice under international
law 348

340. In Fraport v. Philippines, one of the arbitrators observed that:

It [the Tribunal] is not bound by a decision of a Philippine court...but
its own judgment on Philippine law must be premised on Philippine law
itself.“

341. In the Azinian case, a Mexican court had ruled that the decision of the Mexican authorities
to annul a concession contract for waste collection and disposal was lawful, inter alia, due
to procedural irregularities in the award of the concession.**° On this basis, the tribunal found
itself precluded from scrutinizing the decision of the Mexican local authorities which had already

been confirmed by the Mexican court.

342. According to the Azinian tribunal, “a governmental authority surely cannot be faulted
for acting in a manner validated by the courts unless the courts themselves are disavowed at the
international level.”*°! The Azinian tribunal also emphasized that it did not have an appellate

function and that the claimant would have to show that the court decision constituted “either a

denial of justice, or a pretence of form to achieve an internationally unlawful end.”*>

(iti) The Tribunal’s Ruling

343. Whether or not the concepts of “void ab initio” and “voidable” are commonly discussed in
investment treaty awards, as a matter of treaty interpretation it is impossible to conclude that the
parties intended to protect non-existent assets. Production of a piece of paper with the signature
of a rogue official, signed in defiance of the applicable statute law does not constitute a “qualified
investment” for purposes of jurisdiction. In this respect, the Tribunal will apply (as suggested by
the Claimants) the analysis of illegality set out in Kim v. Uzbekistan**? in which proportionality

was identified as the governing principle. For ease of reference, Kim’s basic proposition, cited by

354

the Claimants”’, is as follows:

In the Tribunal’s view, the interpretive task is guided by the principle of
proportionality. The Tribunal must balance the object of promoting
economic relations by providing a stable investment framework with the
harsh consequence of denying the application of the BIT in total when the
investment is not made in compliance with legislation. The denial of the
protections of the BIT is a harsh consequence that is a proportional
response only when its application is triggered by noncompliance with a
law that results in a compromise of a correspondingly significant interest
of the Host State.*°

344. The Kim tribunal suggested, and the Claimants agree, that this aspect of the analysis should

proceed in three stages:

First the Tribunal must assess the significance of the obligation with
which the investor is alleged not to comply.**°

126

345. It is difficult to overstate the importance of environmental protection in areas, such as
Mrima Hill, of special vulnerability. The vulnerability was evidenced by the layers of protection

applied by statute and regulation:

(a) Mrima Hill was gazetted as a forest reserve.**’ The effect of this gazettement
was to restrict any activities that would adversely affect the flora and fauna,

without the express permission of the Kenya Forest Service (“KFS”);

(b) Mrima Hill was designated as a nature reserve by the Minister of Environment
and Natural Resources.*°® Under the Forests Act, nature reserves provide an
additional level of protection and all proposals for disruptive activities within a

nature reserve are subject to the consent of a forest conservation committee;*°

(c) the Mrima Hill kaya was designated as a national monument under the

Antiquities and Monuments Act*® by the Minister of Home Affairs and National

Heritage.**' This classification as a national monument was confirmed by further

notice in 1994. A month before the issuance of SML 351, (namely on 5 February
2013) NMK had advised CMK that the Mrima Hill site would need to be fully

mapped in order to identify “the cultural sites within the area (e.g. early

357 Legal Notice No. 304 of 1961, The Forest Ordinance (Cap. 176), 26 May 1961, Exhibit R-4; and Esau O. Omollo
First Witness Statement, para. 13. The Government produced a map of the gazette “forestry reserve”, which was co-
extensive with the “nature reserve”, and covered the entire area of Mrima Hill of interest to the Claimants. The
Claimants raise an argument about the map coordinates but the intention is clear and the Tribunal does not accept their
objection. The Claimants always acknowledged that Mrima Hill was protected as a nature reserve and forestry reserve

settlements, burials and community ritual sites).”*°* Dr. Farah, the Director
General of NMK at the time, testified that “[u]ntil a proper mapping of the area had
been conducted it would be impossible for NMK to consider whether it would be
appropriate for part of Mrima Hill to be degazetted.”** There is no evidence that

such mapping ever took place. There was no “de-gazettement”;>

(d) The vulnerability was buttressed by strong environmental legislation and in

particular, the Environmental (Impact Assessment and Audit) Regulations, 2003

  

which read:

No licencing authority under any law in force in Kenya shall issue a
licence for any project for which an environmental impact assessment
is required under the Act unless the applicant produces to the licencing
authority a licence of environmental impact assessment issued by the
Authority [NEMA] under these Regulations. (emphasis added)

346. In the Tribunal’s opinion, the regulatory obligations on which the Claimants defaulted were
of fundamental importance in an environmentally vulnerable area faced with a project to remove

and at least partially process 130 million tonnes of Mrima Hill.

347. Having said that, the Tribunal wishes to make it clear that its decision in this case rests on
(1) the protected status of the Mrima Hill forest and nature reserve; and (2) the lack of EIA

approval. While the Claimants failed to respond to the requests of NMK, there is enough doubt

about the precise boundaries of the “national monument’””®, so that the Tribunal does not rely on

the absence of NMK approval in its decision to dismiss the claim.

Second, the Tribunal must assess the seriousness of the investor’s
conduct.

348. Non-compliance with the protective regulatory framework was a serious matter. The
Tribunal has already discussed at length the disregard exhibited by the Claimants for compliance

issues.

349. The attempt by the Claimants to use Mr. Juma’s assistance to by-pass statutory
requirements and obtain a purported mining licence within weeks of Mr. Juma being enlisted,
despite such non-compliance, showed serious disrespect for the fundamental public policies of the

host country in relation to the environment and resource development.

350. It will be recalled that Mr. Wahungu, the Director General of NEMA testified as follows:

...the [CMK] report was not a good submission and that large sections of
the documents appeared to be still in draft and there were significant gaps
and glaring omissions. My officials were very concerned that Cortec was
simply going through the motions and not addressing the significant legal
and environmental obstacles to establish a mine at Mrima Hill.

It became the norm that whenever NEMA wrote a letter to Cortec, Cortec
would show up a NEMA’s offices a day or two later, accompanied by
lawyers and environmental consultants. This was most unusual and
unnerving. I recall being very uncomfortable with this trend where Cortec
hardly replied to our letters in writing and instead made in person visits

36 Gazette Notice No. 5187 dated 10 November 1989, Exhibit R-006, “gazette” the national monument as follows:
Mrima Hill Sacred Grove.

Square 2840 of Map Sheet 200/4, Series Y731, Edition 3-SK at a Scale of 1:50,000 in Kwale District, Coast
Province.
There was much argument at the Hearing regarding the boundary limits of the “Sacred Grove” which was
inconclusive.

to assert their views and positions. What was most disconcerting with
Cortec was that, whenever we requested that Cortec address particular
issues, Cortec would show up at our offices with huge bundles of
documents which did not address the specific issues we had raised. I
felt that Cortec was bombarding us with information to try to intimidate
my officers and me.*”’ (emphasis added)

351. The Tribunal regards the Claimants’ failure to comply with basic statutory requirements as

a serious breach of the “investors” obligations

Third, the Tribunal must evaluate whether the combination of the
investor’s conduct and the law involved results in a compromise of a
significant interest of the Host State to such an extent that the harshness
of the sanction of placing the investment outside of the protections of the
BIT is a proportionate consequence for the violation examined. **

352. The Kim tribunal added the following: “The primary indication of such a compromised
significant interest is whether the legal consequence of the violation under the Host State’s law
manifests a gravity to the act of non-compliance that is proportional to the harshness of denying

access to the protections of the BIT”?

353. The legal significance of non-compliance on Commissioner Masibo’s powers was the

subject of some debate between the Kenyan law experts.

567 Geoffrey Wahungu First Witness Statement, para. 20. (emphasis added). Recall also the report in the Kenyan

newspaper, the Daily Nation, that:
Huge trees have been felled, and according to kaya elder and chairman of Kaya Mrima Self-Help group
Omari Alale, the exploration for minerals is worrying because the company is not doing what it
promised to do.
“As we see the situation now, the work is going against the conditions set. They have brought in big earth
movers in the forest to open up the roads and the machines have caused untold damage.” (emphasis added).

354. Justice Torgbor proposes what could be called a “Wait and See” theory and refers to EIA
Regulation 4(1)°” which says that “no proponent shall implement a project...unless an
environmental impact assessment has been concluded and approved,” and argues from the word
“implement” that an EIA licence is required only when mining activity is eventually initiated.
However, as Professor Mumma points out, s. 4(1) is an instruction to the proponent. So far as the
regulator [Commissioner Masibo] is concerned, the limitation is found in subregulation 4(2) which

says:

no licencing authority under any law in force in Kenya shall issue a licence
for any project for which an environmental impact assessment is required
under the Act unless the applicant produces to the licencing authority a
licence of environmental impact assessment issued by the authority [i.e.
NEMA].*”!

355. Nevertheless, Justice Torgbor insisted that SML 351 could live side by side with the [forest

and nature] reserves until mining commenced:

Because s. 17 does not expressly mandate the Commissioner to override
nature designation that had not been degazetted, I would prefer the view
that SML 351 can live side by side with the designation until mining
commenced.*”

356. Further, Justice Torgbor argued that Mr. Masibo could transform conditions precedent into

conditions subsequent even in the case of statutory conditions precedent.

357. A member of the Tribunal, referred Justice Torgbor*” to the letter from the Mining

Commissioner to CMK dated 27 January 2012” stating that:

Consequently, to enable us further consider your application, you are
required to furnish us with the following lacking documents.

358. The Tribunal member suggested that this language indicated Commissioner Masibo
realized that the “lacking documents” are required before not after issuance of the licence.>”°
Justice Torgbor said “I think you are right to take that view, yes that is what the letter says”>’° and
the Tribunal member then asked, “so it seems that there are conditions precedent.” Justice Torgbor
said “well, J would say yes, if it is required before the issuance, yes, I would say it is a condition

precedent.”?7”

359. According to Professor Mumma,*”* no mining licence could lawfully be issued until:

(a) the land in respect to which the licence is to be issued is open to mining. He points
out that s. 7.1 of the Mining Act gives 10 categories of exclusions under which land
could be excluded from mining, only one of which is within the purview of
Commissioner Masibo, i.e. s. 7(1)(j). Other ministries have power pursuant to s.

7(1)(@) to exclude land from mining for other reasons;

(b) where the Commissioner has closed lands, there must be a gazetted reopening;

purview of Commissioner Masibo to vacate;>”? and

(d) an EIA licence.**°

360. Both Justice Torgbor and Professor Mumma agree that not all licence conditions are

381

conditions precedent. Professor Mumma gave an example” of local equity participation:

...conditions are of different kinds. There are some conditions that would
invalidate a licence, if they are not compliant with, if they are missing.
There are other conditions that would not invalidate a licence, so it would
depend on the nature of the condition in issue.**?

361. Justice Torgbor added*** that “what should render anything void must be something of
considerable weight as to remove the ground from under the licence” (but not necessarily fraud).
Justice Torgbor is essentially expressing the need for proportionality or, in the words of Kim, the

“compromise of a significant interest.”

38 In Professor Mumma’s view, respecting SPL 351 is that “it was void, it is invalid, it is null and void ab initio” for
three reasons:

 

(a) it was clear to the Commissioner and to the Applicants that SML 351 was issued in breach of express
provisions of the law and “even at the time they received [SML 351], it was void” (Tr. Day 6, p. 126, Il. 5-
17). Specifically, “the Commissioner was aware that these (EIA) provisions had not been complied with
because nobody produced to hima licence.” (Tr. Day 6, p. 125, Il. 14-19).

(b) it is void ab initio because the High Court has stated that it is void and the Court of Appeal has said that
the appeal against the High Court findings has failed; (Tr. Day 6, p. 126, Il. 19-24).

(c) Professor Mumma says the conditions now described as conditions subsequent are not conditions the
Applicant has any capacity to implement. Compliance is out of its hands. They are therefore not appropriate
conditions. (Tr. Day 6, p. 127, Il. 7-11).

362. As the Tribunal has already made clear, it regards the issue of excluded lands and an EIA

licence to be “of considerable weight” and “significant” prejudice to the host country.

363. The Tribunal rejects the “wait and see” theory presented by Justice Torgbor. The
Claimants failed to comply with the statutory conditions precedent to the issuance of SML 351.
These conditions were specifically notified to the Claimants by Mr. Masibo himself in the Mining

Investment Road Map.***+

364. There is no doubt on the evidence that protection of the environment and forest and nature
reserves was required by the legislature to be resolved by the appropriate authorities (not just the
Mining Commissioner) prior to the issuance of a mining license. This was not done. The

Claimants’ “wait and see” and “live together” arguments are inconsistent both with the terms of

 

SPL 256 and the Envi l (Impact Assessment and Audit) Regulations of 2003, s. 4(2).

365. The Tribunal therefore concludes that the Claimants’ failure to comply with the
legislature’s regulatory regime governing the Mrima Hill forest and nature reserve, and the
Claimants’ failure to obtain an EIA licence (or approval in any valid form) from NEMA
concerning the environmental issues involved in the proposed removal of 130 million tonnes of
material from Mrima Hill, constituted violations of Kenyan law that, in terms of international law,
warrant the proportionate response of a denial of treaty protection under the BIT and the ICSID

Convention.

PART 28-EVEN IF NOT VOID AB_ INITIO, THE TRIBUNAL WOULD
NEVERTHELESS DENY PROTECTION TO SML 351 ON THE MERITS

366. The Tribunal’s analysis of the illegalities attending the birth of SML 351 is equally
applicable to a situation if the onus were to switch to the Government to establish that SML 351

is not a protected investment.

(i) The Claimants’ Position

367. This is an argument in the “merits” phase. The issuance of SML 351 was within the
discretion of Commissioner Masibo, and nothing in the evidence justifies the Tribunal in

interfering with the exercise of that discretion.

(ii) The Government’s Position

368. The Government responds that Commissioner Masibo’s discretion was confined by the
purpose and subject matter of the Mining Act, and that his issuance of SML 351 was entirely ultra

vires.

(iti) The Tribunal’s Ruling

369. The Tribunal concludes that Mr. Masibo purported to exercise a discretion he did not

possess. As such, his grant of SML 351 was of no legal effect.

370. In any event, the Tribunal does not accept that Mr. Masibo performed his statutory

functions in good faith and for their intended purpose.

371. Firstly, Mr. Masibo’s re-writing of history in his witness statement of 27 November 2017
that (contrary to all the documentary evidence) SML 351 is not a Special Mining Licence at all but

a “re-grant” of SPL 256 with amended conditions is not credible. The argument seems to be that,

135

as SPL 256 was issued by Mr. Masibo’s predecessor Commissioner Biwott, whatever errors were
made in that respect must have been made by Commissioner Biwott and not Mr. Masibo, who just

“re-granted” SPL 256 and for some reason called it SML 351.

372. Mr. Masibo’s evidence of a re-grant came as news to the Claimants who say the first time
they heard about the re-grant theory is when they received Mr. Masibo’'s witness statement dated
27 November 2017, more than 4 years after the issuance of SML 351 on 7 March 2013.385 Until
then, the Claimants understood SML 351 to be a mining licence as distinct from a prospecting
licence. Indeed, nothing on the face of SML 351 suggests it is a re-grant. SPL 256 is not mentioned

in the document.

373. Second, at the meeting of Messers Anderson, Sullivan and Juma with C.S. Kimemia on 6
March 2013, Mr. Masibo was asked if he had authority to issue a mining licence. Mr. Masibo did
not suggest that there was no need to issue a mining licence at all, merely to amend the conditions

386

of SPL 256. Mr. Anderson’s written recollections in his first witness statement of the meeting

and other meetings with Mr. Masibo, do not refer to a re-grant of SPL 256.

374. Third, the written pleadings of the Claimants in these proceedings (prior to 27 November
2017) do not advance or indeed betray any awareness of a re-grant theory. The idea of a “re-grant”
first surfaced (according to the Claimants) in the subsequent Kenyan criminal investigation into
Mr. Masibo’s conduct. Whatever purpose the “re-grant” theory has in Mr. Masibo’s criminal

inquiries, it lacks any corroboration in the record of this arbitration.

136

375. Fourth, in the 27 November 2018 statement submitted to this Tribunal, Mr. Masibo himself
provides two alternate explanations of his premature issuance of SML 351, neither of which are

related to the due performance of his duties as Mining Commissioner:

(a) he did what he was told by his bureaucratic and political masters;°”

(b) he believed that unless the Claimants got what they wanted they would bring a
claim against Kenya before ICSID. Mr. Masibo thought such a claim would be an
embarrassment. The easiest course of action was to give the Claimants what they

wanted.*%

Neither of these reasons provide authority to issue a mining licence for which CMK had not

satisfied the statutory prerequisites.

376. As to political orders, the Tribunal accepts the expert testimony of Professor Mumma**?
that “where a statute exists and such statute has established a regulator, then that basically means
that the space is occupied, the Minister cannot then start purporting to be regulating in a situation

where statute has appointed a regulator.”

Q. So a Minister cannot usurp a regulator where the powers of the
regulator are prescribed in the Act?

A. That is my view.*”°

377. Professor Mumma repeated:

[W]e have a very strong principle against regulators getting directions
from Ministers in regard to the manner of exercising their regulatory
powers.**!

378. The decision was given to Mr. Masibo. He did not discharge his statutory obligations.

379. Justice Torgbor’s initial testimony about an “unfettered” discretion was moderated in the
“hot tub” phase of the Hearing. He attributed the concept of “unfettered” to s. 17(3) of the Mining
Act which reads:

Without in any way restricting or fettering the discretion of the

Commissioner granted by paragraph (b) of subsection (2), a special licence
may contain terms and conditions in respect of the following matters.

 

380. When it was suggested to Justice Torgbor that “an alternate reading is to say that the
provisions from (a) to (e) are not to be regarded as fettering his discretion to impose other
conditions”, Justice Torgbor said “yes, I agree with that.”*°? Accordingly, s. 17(3) is of little

assistance in determining the limits of the power to grant a mining convention.

381. Moreover, in dealing with the “wrongful exercise of discretionary powers”, JusticeTorgbor

was asked:

Q. ...is it, for example, the case that an exercise of discretionary power
that is not respectful of reason and law is wrongful, or a discretionary
power that is exercised arbitrarily, would that be an exercise of wrongful?

A. Yes, it would be. °°

33 Ty, Day 6, p. 27, Il. 11-24.

138

382. Justice Torgbor goes on to say that the exercise of a discretion by a statutory decision

maker is quite closely supervised under Kenyan law:

Q. ...it is within the reviewing powers of a Court to inquire into whether
the decision maker has acted carefully, sensibly and judiciously.

A. Yes.
383. Also, the reviewing Court may take illegality into account:

Q. Just to be clear on the scope of this review, so illegality comes under
the review quite clearly?

A. Yes.*

384. And then:

Q. So there is the law but there is also a different category which isn’t
illegality but its unreasonableness and rationality on which in some cases
Courts will review how administrative bodies —

A. I wouldn’t argue with that, no.”
Professor Mumma distanced himself even further from Mr. Masibo’s assertion of a “sole,
express/unequivocal and primary legal authority and power.”**’ He testified “that discretion is
always fettered” and he points out that “the discretionary power must be exercised strictly within
the four corners of the statute that donates the power” and “typically [as in this case] there is more
than one law of which the administrator has to be cognizant in exercising discretion.”*°* Moreover,

the decision maker cannot expand the scope of his or her powers through its own loose

interpretation of the law or by inference*” and discretionary power must be exercised in good faith

and for the purpose for which it was given.*°°

385. The Tribunal owes no deference to Commissioner Masibo’s exercise of discretion because
the discretion was abused and the result was an invalid SML 351. Firstly, the discretion was not
exercised in accordance with the law. In particular, Mr. Masibo violated the statutory protections
accorded the forest and nature reserve and issued SML 351 without an EIA licence contrary to the

explicit prohibition under s. 4(2) of the EJA regulations. He acted ultra vires.

386. Secondly, Mr. Masibo did not exercise his discretion for the purpose for which it was given.
According to his own testimony, he issued SML 351 under pressure from the politicians and
cabinet officials and out of fear of ICSID litigation. Neither concern relieves Mr. Masibo from

ensuring statutory compliance.
387. Accordingly, because Mr. Masibo:
(a) purported to exercise a discretion he did not possess; and
(b) ignored statutory requirements he had no authority to ignore,

the Tribunal concludes on the merits that the Government has demonstrated that SML 351 is not

in any event a protected investment.

PART 29 - COSTS

388. The Tribunal has the authority and discretion to make awards of costs pursuant to Article
61(2) of the ICSID Convention. While there is some variation in tribunals’ practices, the

prevailing approach of international investment tribunals is to order costs to follow the event.*°!

389. A party is free to spend as much money as it wishes on legal fees and expenses, but it does
not follow that all such costs and expenses should be imposed on the opposing (unsuccessful)
party. In this case, the Respondent claims a “grand total” of US $6,452,858.42. By way of
comparison, the Claimants claim costs of US $3,600,000.00. In the Tribunal’s view, having regard

to the nature and difficulty of the case, the Respondent’s claim for costs is manifestly excessive.

390. Secondly, the conduct of the party seeking costs is a highly relevant factor. In the present
case, the Government essentially relied on two arguments. The first is the “illegality objection”.
This is extensively discussed in the preceding reasoning. The second main argument is the
“corruption objection”, to the effect that the Claimants procured SML 351 by bribery or other
corrupt means. The main suspect was Commissioner Masibo. The other objections raised by the

Government were somewhat peripheral to the main event.

391. While the Tribunal agrees with the Government in respect of its “illegality objection”, it is
nevertheless deeply concerned about the vague terms in which the allegation of corruption was
made, and the lack of evidence given in support. The Government relied largely on surmise and
speculation. However, shortly before the Hearing on the merits in Dubai, the Claimants produced

a witness statement from Mr. Masibo dated 17 November 2017. The appearance of Mr. Masibo

401 Mr. Saba Fakes v. Republic of Turkey, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/20, Award, 14 July 2010, CL-52, paras. 152-155.

141

as the Claimants’ witness ought to have given the Respondent an opportunity to prove its

corruption case if there was such a case to prove.

392. Mr. Masibo’s statement gave rise to numerous issues, but despite the Claimants’ request
for additional documents in relation to what Mr. Masibo had said (or not said) in his witness
statement, it was not until Day 4 of the Hearing that the Government belatedly produced three

documents to the Claimants‘?

which included two statements that Mr. Masibo had previously
given to the Kenyan authorities shortly after the events in question, namely on 22 November 2013

(Exhibit R-254) and a further statement of the same date (Exhibit R-255), both of which were

highly relevant.

393. In addition, the Government belatedly produced a transcript of proceedings against Mr.
Masibo in the Chief Magistrate’s Court at Milimani Law Courts, Criminal Case No. 1087 of 2017

(Exhibit R-253).

394. In the course of the Hearing, the Tribunal learned from a Government witness, Mr.
Raymond Mutiso, that he had testified in the prosecution of Mr. Masibo on 20 December 2017.

The Government did not produce a transcript of this testimony.

395. In addition, and regrettably, when Mr. Masibo was cross-examined, the Government chose
not to put to him questions regarding the allegations of corruption even though such allegations
lay at the heart of the Government’s case against the Claimants. This omission was manifestly

unfair both to Mr. Masibo and the Claimants.

402 See Tr, Day 4, p. 43.

142

396. Even more egregiously, despite having failed to give Mr. Masibo an opportunity to defend
himself in the witness box, the Government persisted in its Closing Submissions to seek a finding
that Mr. Masibo had acted corruptly on the basis of “red flags” of circumstantial evidence. Mr.
Masibo ought to have been given the opportunity in cross-examination to explain away, if he could,

the allegations made against him.

397. Allegations of corruption were also made against Mr. Jacob Juma, but these too were
essentially unsubstantiated apart from some evidence that in the past Mr. Juma had provided
relatively modest amounts of money (in the neighbourhood of US $1,500.00) from time to time to
Government officials in pursuit of his various projects. None of this evidence in respect of Mr.

Juma related to the events at issue in this arbitration.

398. Essentially, the Government’s case came down to the proposition that Mr. Masibo had
conducted himself in office with such gross inconsistency and inexplicable haste as well as
disregard for his statutory duties starting from the time Mr. Jacob Juma became involved with

Mrima Hill, that the only rational explanation for his misconduct must be corruption.

399. In the Tribunal’s view, it is not appropriate for a Party to make such serious allegations of
corruption and then not only fail to support it with credible evidence but to withhold from the
opposing party documents which shed significant light on the conduct of the individual (Mr.

Masibo) at the center of the bribery allegations.

400. Accordingly, in considering the disposition of costs, notwithstanding that the Government
succeeded in its “illegality objection”, the Tribunal wishes nevertheless to express its concern at
the excessive level of the Government’s claimed costs and, more importantly, its disapproval of
the Government’s conduct of the corruption allegations.

143

401. In the circumstances, the Tribunal declines to grant the Respondent’s claim for costs of US
$6,452,858.42 but reduces the award by 50%. In the result, the Government will be entitled to

recover costs in the sum of US $3,226,429.21.

402. The costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID’s

administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in US $):

Arbitrators’ fees and expenses

Tan Binnie 136,113.50
Kanaga Dharmananda 106,432.42
Brigitte Stern 161,682.79
ICSID’s administrative fees 106,000.00
Direct expenses 134,893.57
Total 645,122.28

403. The above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts.*°°

As a result, each Party’s share of the costs of arbitration amounts to US $322,561.14.

404. The Tribunal orders the Claimants to pay the Respondent US $322,561.14 for the expended

portion of the Respondent’s advances to ICSID.

PART 30 - AWARD

405. The Claimants’ claims are dismissed with costs to the Respondent in the sum of US

$3,226,429.21 plus US $322,561.14 in ICSID costs.

4°3 The remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to
ICSID.
