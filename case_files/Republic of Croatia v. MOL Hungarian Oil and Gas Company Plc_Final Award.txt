OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE FASHA

Also on 30 January 2009, the Parties entered into the First Amendment
to the Shareholders Agreement (“FASHA’). Croatia says that the
FASHA was procured by a bribe paid to the then Prime Minister Dr lvo
Sanader, and seeks a declaration that it is therefore null and void.
Croatia also contends that the FASHA should also be declared null and
void because it contains the following unlawful corporate governance

provisions:
“Executive Directors and Executive Board

7.5.1. Executive Directors, including the Chief Executive Officer,
will be appointed by the Management Board and shall be
responsible for day-to-day operation of each business and
function ("Executive Directors"). The Management Board
members shall not be Executive Directors at the same time.

7.5.2. The key selection criteria for the appointment of the
Executive Directors shall be the relevant business expertise and
knowledge. Their tasks and responsibilities will be regulated and
controlled by the Management Board.

7.5.3. Executive Directors shall form an Executive Board. The
Executive Board will be headed by the Chief Executive Officer.

7.5.4 The Management Board shall issue the Rules of
Procedure of the Executive Board, which in any case can not
hurt the fulfilment of the Management Board's obligation with
respect to the necessary prior approval of the Supervisory Board

in case of Reserved Matters.”

Vil. GENERAL BACKGROUND

15.

This case is of grave importance to the Parties. Croatia seeks to set
aside as null and void certain agreements entered into with MOL which
relate to INA Industrija Nafte d.d. (“INA”) the former monopolistic
government owned energy supplier in Croatia. Croatia alleges that its
own former Prime Minister, Dr Sanader, agreed to accept a bribe of
EUR 10 million from MOL’s managing director, Mr Zsolt Hernadi. The
bribe, so Croatia asserts, was intended to facilitate the passage of
amendments to the SHA that were detrimental to Croatia but beneficial
to MOL. Since none of this money was ever received into any account
in the name of Dr Sanader, Croatia relies on inferences and on the
testimony of a witness whose account is vehemently denied by MOL
and by Dr Sanader.

Mr Hernadi has been judicially acquitted of bribery in Hungary but has
declined to face charges in Croatia. Dr Sanader was originally
convicted of bribery but his conviction was set aside by the
Constitutional Court on 24 July 2015" and he is facing re-trial after
having been incarcerated for four years. The putative conduit for the
bribe, Mr Robert Jezié, has never been charged in connection with this
allegation. He has admitted that an entity owned by him received EUR
five million said to have been the first tranche of the alleged bribe”, and
moreover that, despite having agreed under oath to return the money
to Croatia, he has not done so and is apparently not being pursued by
Croatia on this account.

This Tribunal will have to decide whether, applying Croatian law, it is
persuaded that the bribe was offered and accepted as alleged. If it finds
the bribe took place, it will have to decide whether the amendment
agreements should be set aside and then, if so satisfied, embark on
the damages phase of this arbitration to assess Croatia’s true loss. As

stated above, Croatia relies on alleged breaches of Croatian Corporate
Law as an additional ground to set aside the amendment agreements.
Croatia also claims damages for MOL’s alleges breaches of the SHA
and the Cooperation Agreement.

The complexity of this dispute is significantly exacerbated not only by
the sheer number of protagonists involved, but also by the refusal to
appear of several of important witnesses. Pursuant to Procedural Order
No 1, the Parties provided an agreed Dramatis Personae to the
Tribunal before the main hearing. This joint document is attached as

19. The genesis of this dispute was the privatisation of INA, a state-owned

energy company incorporated in Croatia and founded in 1964. The
government of Croatia became the main shareholder of INA in 1990.
Thirteen years later, and upon Croatia’s initiative, MOL — the most
significant oil and gas company in Hungary — entered into INA’s capital

and bought 25% plus one share in INA for USD 505 million. By doing

so, MOL became INA’s ‘strategic investor’.

This operation was enabled by the INA Privatization Act passed in
2002.3 Croatia was required to privatize INA in order to apply for EU
membership, which it did on 21 February 2003. The accession process
properly speaking lasted no less than 10 years, although the prospect
of membership had previously been under discussion for a decade and
a half4

On 17 July 2003, MOL and Croatia entered into the SHA,® which
provided a legal framework to the Parties’ long-term relationship. The
Parties also signed a Share Sale and Purchase Agreement® and MOL
entered into a Co-Operation Agreement with INA.”

Pursuant to the SHA, INA’s corporate governance was composed of a
Supervisory Board, a Management Board, and a General Assembly.
This “two-tier management system”¢ allowed the majority shareholder,
Croatia at that time, to maintain management control over INA. The
Claimant now insists that this provision was essential to Croatia.

It is impossible to sketch an accurate picture of this case without
mentioning broad features of the political context in Croatia at the
relevant time. Dr Sanader, a member of the Croatian Democratic Union
(‘HDZ’), became Prime Minister on 23 December 2003. He supported
the privatization process and made it known in strong public
statements.9

4 Dr Sanader confirmed that this issue was mentioned in the HDZ’s first programme:

24. The primary allegation in this case is that Dr Sanader was induced by
a EUR 10 million bribe offered by MOL’s CEO Mr Hernadi to use his
influence to cause Croatia to enter into certain amendment
agreements, the effect of which, it is alleged, was to give management
control of INA to MOL. The conduit for the alleged bribe was Robert
Jezié, a prominent businessman with whom Dr Sanader was well
acquainted. The only direct evidence of the alleged bribe are the
statements of Mr Jezi¢. The Tribunal will return at length to the roles of
these two key protagonists.

25. In October 2005, when Croatia had already commenced negotiations
with the European Union (“EU”) regarding its accession, the
Government decided to sell 7% of INA shares to the War Veterans
Fund." The process of the privatization of INA continued for a few
years"! and Croatia progressively gave up its majority shareholding in
INA. Moreover, in March 2007, Croatia passed the Gas Market Act,
which aimed to effect the liberalisation of the domestic gas market.

26. In early 2008, when Croatia decided to constitute a commission to
discuss the amendment of the SHA with MOL, Croatia’s stake in INA
had been reduced to 44%.

27. [A] , the then-Minister of Economy, represented the
government in a proposed share-swap with MOL. The purpose of these
discussions was for MOL to obtain a majority of INA shares and for
Croatia to become the “third largest shareholder of MOL with 6.5% and
the right to nominate one member of MOL’s board.”"? This point was
essential for both sides. Mr Hernadi and [A] started the

negotiations on this issue in early 2008, in parallel with the Croatian
Commission’s work on the amendment of the SHA.

The discussion concerning the amendment of the SHA was mainly
focused on the new internal organisation of the company resulting from
the change of control. The Parties quickly came to an agreement
regarding the composition of INA’s Supervisory and Management
Boards, and the creation of an Executive Board. [A] also
proposed that Croatia should purchase INA’s gas storage and trading
business from MOL.” Three days later, on 10 July 2008, MOL sent a
draft term sheet to Croatia.’®

On 14 July 2008, MOL made a voluntary public bid for INA shares’®
which had the automatic effect, in accordance with Croatian securities
regulations, of suspending the negotiations between the Government
and MOL in relation to the FASHA. Two months later, on 5 September
2008, MOL issued a public offer to the remaining shareholders of INA.

By 10 October 2008, after a long negotiation process with [B] 1
the Head of the Veterans’ Fund, MOL acquired the shares of the
Veteran Fund and obtained 47.15% of INA shares. MOL thus became
INA’s largest shareholder. It has been alleged that Dr Sanader forced
[B] to sell the shares. According to contemporaneous reports,
however, when asked by the press she stated that the board’s decision
was unanimous and that it was “the best decision” considering the
context.” The same month, the negotiations regarding the FASHA
resumed and, on 31 October 2008, Dr Sanader and Mr[A]

presented the terms of the FASHA and the GMA to the Government.
Despite some initial hesitations, the Croatian Government unanimously

approved the FASHA and GMA, and both were executed on 30 January
2009."8

At this point the narrative mutates from a typical privatisation process
with contractual issues into an alleged political scandal. According to
Mr Jezié, a prominent Croatian business man specialising in the energy
sector, sometime at the end of 2008, Dr Sanader asked him whether
he “could arrange receipt of a larger amount of money which was
supposed to be paid to him’."® Croatia claims that this money was to
come from Mr Hernadi, who was desperate to find a way to ensure that
Dr Sanader would support MOL’s acquisition of INA.

Mr Jezi¢ testified that he told Dr Sanader that he would see “what can
be done”. Dr Sanader allegedly elaborated on his request a few months
later, asked Mr Jezié to meet him at his office, and then explained that
Mr Jezié “should organize a receipt of the amount of EUR 10 million
which was supposed to be paid to him for certain consultancy services
and (...) that the payment was going to be made by MOL”. Mr Jezié
further stated that he promised the former Prime Minister that he would
speak “with a person from Switzerland who could organize the same
and who has my confidence”.2' Mr Jezié’s alleged plan was to ask his
tax advisor Mr Hirlimann to help him transfer the money. Mr Hirlimann,
a Swiss accountant, served as the director of [1Co] , an entity
belonging to Mr Jezié. According to Mr Jezi¢, Mr Hurlimann estimated
that the operation (tax and handling fee) would cost approximately 20%
of the total amount, but undertook in some unspecified way and
magnitude to mitigate the costs of the transfer.

Mr Jezi¢ averred that he was anxious that [1Co] should not carry
the financial burden of these fees, and that he raised this issue with Mr

Hirlimann. He then stated that he gave Dr Sanader the contact details
of Mr Hirlimann so that the latter could first arrange for the payment of
the fees before going forward with the transfer of EUR 10 million.” Dr
Sanader allegedly passed the information on to Mr Hernadi. Mr Jezié
reported that, at a later time, Mr Hirlimann informed him that he had
been in touch with Mr [x] 3, MOL’s consultant, regarding the
payment of the alleged bribe.

At the same time, the take-over process was continuing. MOL had to
comply with the requirements set out by the Croatian Competition
Authority (“AZTN’). Indeed, pursuant to Croatian law, INA’s change of
control effected a concentration, and therefore had to be notified to and
approved by AZTN.

On 9 April 2009, AZTN issued a certificate confirming that the
notification of the concentration was complete. AZTN also invited
“competitors and all other interested natural persons and legal entities
to deliver to the Agency their opinion on the concentration (...) or rather
its effect on market competition”. A few days later, on 16 April 2009,
the European Commission initiated the process of European law
compliance in relation to INA’s change of control. On 20 April, AZTN
felt the need to issue a report analysing the INA-MOL concentration
from a legal and economic perspective. On 23 April 2009, AZTN
announced that it would carry out an assessment of the compliance of

the INA-MOL concentration with Croatian law. This raised concerns

with the Government and MOL’s management. They were of sufficient
importance that Mr Hernadi requested a meeting with Dr Sanader to
discuss this issue.

Notwithstanding these on-going compliance proceedings, the
Government started implementing the GMA and took over INA’s gas
storage business on 30 April 2009.

The following month, the European Commission authorised MOL’s
takeover of INA.44

In the morning of 26 May 2009, Dr Sanader had two meetings back to
back at his office in Zagreb. They have been the focus of extraordinary
attention in this case, because the Tribunal is urged by the Claimant to
conclude that taken together they provide crucial evidence of the
alleged bribery. The first one was with Messrs Hernadi and Josip
Petrovié (a INA Board member at that time). Mr Hernadi wanted to warn
Dr Sanader about the consequences of a potential refusal by AZTN to
approve MOL’s acquisition of INA’s management control. The second
meeting was with Mr Jezi¢. Mr Jezié reported that during that meeting
he informed Dr Sanader that the alleged bribe payment had not arrived.
According to Mr Jezi¢, Dr Sanader then immediately called Mr Petrovié
on his mobile phone and asked them both to return to his office. A brief
discussion ensued while Mr Jezié was waiting in another room.

Whereas he did not witness their conversation, Mr Jezié testified that
Dr Sanader immediately thereafter informed him that the transfer would
“be made in several instalments given the large amount of money. (...)
The amount of 5 million euros was going to be paid very soon whereas
the rest, the other 5 million, was going to be paid by the end of 2009”.
The Tribunal will come back to this account of this meeting when
assessing the credibility of Mr Jezi¢’s testimony.

Mr Jezié alleged that although he was only a minority shareholder of
[1Co] at that time, he could secure the transfer of the money with
the help of Mr Hirlimann. Indeed, a few days after this allegedly key

meeting, two companies allegedly indirectly connected to MOL,

purpose of these contracts was allegedly to cover up the bribe. For its

part, MOL counters that whatever these transactions amounted to, they

had nothing to do with Dr Sanader. MOL submits that they were

selected post factum by Mr Jezi¢é to construct a narrative of corruption

which he offered to the Croatian prosecutors, who were avidly pursuing

the even bigger fish of the former Prime Minister, in return for being

released from detention and to escape his ultimate inculpation for

unrelated business crimes.

alleged cover-up as it was originally presented to the Tribunal at the

In order to understand the diagram set out above, it is necessary to
explain some background. Yukos has been selling oil to MOL for many
years but in 2001 decided to use [3Co] (Yukos’ subsidiary) as its
intermediary. The Tribunal was informed that this arrangement was a
common procedure of Russian oil companies. MOL entered into
different agreements with [3Co] regarding the supply of gasoil
ultimately provided by Yukos. Slightly before the commencement in
2004 of Yukos’ spectacular collapse, Mr [Y] a Russian
billionaire, took over control of [3Co] _ with the help of Mr [X]

Then, in 2006 as Yukos gradually ceased its supply of gasoil to
[3Co] Lukoil took over and became [3Co] supplier. Lukoil was

also represented by Mr [X] 6 Despite these structural changes,
MOL always maintained its contractual relationship with [3Co] It is

alleged by Croatia that this business structure facilitated the cover-up
of the bribe by MOL; it is Croatia’s case that [3Co] was actually a
slush fund that MOL fed with payments in Euros — the so-called
premium payments — and that MOL used these monies to bribe Dr
Sanader.

43. On 9 June 2009, AZTN approved the transfer of INA’s management
control to MOL subject to the condition that, inter alia, INA sell Crobenz
d.d.—one of INA’s retail and wholesale businesses — to a non-INA and
non-MOL related entity. Pursuant to European law, AZTN was required
to select the condition(s) it deemed appropriate among the list of

measures suggested by the acquirer, i.e. MOL.

44, Shortly after the release of AZTN’s decision, Dr Sanader contacted
Olgica Spevec, who was the Chair of AZTN. He was allegedly upset
and asked for an explanation of the conditional approval issued by the
AZTN. He asked Ms Spevec to come to his office, which she did. She
was accompanied by a member of the Council. The Deputy Prime
Minister [A] as well as members of his team attended the
meeting. They discussed the content of the decision at length, but
AZTN maintained its decision despite the Government's complaints.
The Tribunal will return to the details of this meeting below.

On 1 July 2009, Dr Sanader announced his resignation as Prime
Minister. On the same day, the deadline for the Government to
purchase INA’s trading and gas company lapsed. MOL sent a first
notice of breach two days later.

On 27 September 2009, [1Co] issued a loan to [4Co] for
EUR 4,567,608.

In the following weeks, Mr Hernadi and Dr Sanader met twice at the
Marcellino Restaurant. The first time was on 5 October, and the second
time on 19 October. At the second meeting, Mr Jezié joined them in
order to discuss INA’s ethane recovery plant at Ivani¢grad. A third
meeting occurred between Mr Hernadi and Dr Sanader in Budapest but
without the attendance of Mr Jezic¢.

On 20 October 2009, Dr Sanader and Mr Jezi¢é used a jet aircraft
provided by [4Co] to go to Milan and attend a soccer match.*8 The
following day they went to Zirich. Although the dates of these two trips
are agreed between the Parties,29 the content of Dr Sanader’s and Mr
Jezi¢’s interactions is in sharp dispute. For his part, Mr Jezi¢ testified
that during this trip to Milan, he informed Dr Sanader that he would no
longer be involved in the transfer of the second instalment. Mr Jezi¢
explained that this decision was prompted by the fact that Dr Sanader
had resigned from office and, as a result, Mr Jezié was no longer
concerned about any kind of retaliation from him.3° According to Mr
Jezi¢, Dr Sanader “reacted quite calmly’ and asked him to go to Ziirich
to see Dr Sanader’s brother [N] They did so the next day. Mr Jezié
further reported that the three of them met at the Baur au Lac Hotel in
Zurich. At this meeting, the two Sanader brothers discussed the
transfer of the second instalment. Mr Jezi¢’s involvement in the alleged
bribe allegedly ended after this trip.

Meanwhile, Croatian authorities began to investigate various matters
involving former Prime Minister Sanader and some of his closest

associates and friends.

On 30 October 2009, Mr [A] resigned as Deputy Prime Minister.
At the same time, the rumour of a possible political comeback by Dr

Sanader spread in Croatia.

On 20 November 2009, USKOK*' started to investigate whether the
FASHA and GMA “were detrimental to Croatia’. However, on 21
November, [B] informed MOL that the draft
FAGMA was accepted.

On 16 December 2009, despite the fact that [3Co] and [2Co]
terminated their contracts with [1Co] , the Government approved
the FAGMA and the amendment was ratified.

In 2010, Dr Sanader’s political destiny took a decisive turn. After
announcing his return to politics on 3 January 2010, the HDZ expelled
him at the end of a nine-hour meeting organised by [B] with the
party leadership.

On 18 March 2010, the Croatian Parliament formed an Investigative
Committee for establishing the facts in relation to the privatization of
INA and all agreements signed by the government and INA. Two weeks
later, Mr [A] was arrested in relation to the Podravka matter.*2

In April and June 2010, upon USKOK’s request, Mr Hernadi was
interviewed as a witness in Hungary regarding the Podravka

facilitating a EUR 34 million loan to Podravka from a Hungarian bank, OTP.

investigation. At approximately the same time, INA ceased providing
[4Co] with ethane’.

In July 2010, [Z] hed
entered into an agreement with MOL for the provision of consulting
services.*> According to Croatia, [Z] played an active role in the
implementation of the alleged bribe and MOL was prepared to pay him
to secure his testimony. The Tribunal will accordingly consider the
evidence of [Z] ’s actions in due course.

In September 2010, Mr Jezi¢ met Mr Hernadi in order to solve his
issues with INA, namely [4Co] debt towards INA, but they failed to find
an agreement.

On 9 December 2010, Dr Sanader’s steep fall from grace continued
with the loss of his immunity, and the consequent pursuit of
investigations in multiple corruption cases. On the same day, Croatian
authorities arrested Mr Jezi¢ for his alleged role in the HEP-[4Co] case.
6 Dr Sanader was also arrested in Austria in relation to the same case.

It is of note that [1Co] issued another loan to [4Co] for
EUR 4,431,351.41 while Mr Jezié was in pre-trial detention.

On 21 April 2011, Mr Jezié was released from investigative detention
but returned to meet the Croatian prosecutors on 25 May to give
evidence. Although they did not arrive together at the prosecutors’
office, on the same day Mr Hirlimann also testified in support of Mr
Jezié’s evidence.

In June 2011, USKOK applied to the Hungarian authorities for
authorisation to interview Mr Hernadi, but were given the answer that

such an interview would be “injurious to the security of the Republic of
Hungary’, although the Hungarian authorities undertook to perform
their own investigation. On 30 January 2012 and after having
investigated the matter, they released a press communiqué stating that
“there was no criminal act committed in MOL’s interest és [sic] by its
managers, thus the investigation was closed referring to the lack of any
criminal act’.5”

On 27 June 2011, [1Co] and [4Co] merged retroactively to 1
January 2011. Curiously, a few days later both companies agreed to
defer the repayment of [4Co] debt of EUR 4,431,351.41.%

[4Co] was also facing continuing difficulties with INA, which activated
debentures against the company and froze its accounts. Later that
year, INA stopped delivering ethane to [4Co] 9%

In July 2011, Dr Sanader was finally extradited to Croatia and
questioned by USKOK. He was later indicted on corruption allegations
in the INA-MOL case.

In September 2011, Mr Jezié gave his second witness statement to
USKOK. Roughly at the same time, Mr [X] asked him to return
the money which had been transferred to him in Switzerland.

Dr Sanader’s trial commenced on 17 November 2011. Mr Jezi¢ testified
twice. During his testimony, Mr Jezié promised under oath to return the
money to Croatia within 30 days. However, when Jezi¢é gave evidence
before the Arbitral Tribunal some four years later, he confirmed that the
money was still in [4Co] account.*°

As mentioned above, the Hungarian prosecution continued during Dr
Sanader’s trial.47 Mr [Y] and Mr[X] were also interviewed,
but these proceedings did not lead anywhere as the Hungarian
prosecutor decided to close the investigation in January 2012. On 26
May 2014, Mr Hernaddi was acquitted in Hungarian private
prosecution.‘2

On 20 November 2012, Dr Sanader was convicted by the Zagreb
County Court of having agreed to receive a bribe in return for ensuring
MOL’s successful acquisition of control over INA and for his
involvement in the Hypo Bank scandal. He was sentenced to (i) 7 and
a half years in prison for having accepted a bribe; and (ii) 3 and a half
years in prison for crimes related to the Hypo Bank case.

On 11 April 2013, MOL sent a notice of “non-compliance” to Croatia
concerning the implementation of the SHA, FASHA, GMA and FAGMA.
On 24 July 2013, MOL reiterated its correspondence to Croatia and
threatened to file a claim before an arbitral tribunal by September 2013
if no settlement was found.

On 4 July 2013, Croatia renewed its request for mutual legal assistance
to Hungary with respect to its investigation of Mr Hernadi.4 This
second attempt also failed, and Croatia issued a detention order and
an Interpol warrant against him on 1 October 2013.

On 25 October 2013, MOL initiated ICSID proceedings under the
Energy Charter Treaty, followed a few months later by Croatia's
request for this UNCITRAL arbitration.

have evolved. First, on 3 April 2014, the Croatian Supreme Court

Hungarian private prosecution brought by the wife of a close colleague.

Second, on 24 July 2015, the Croatian Constitutional Court overturned
Dr Sanader’s conviction and ordered a retrial. It should be observed
that the decision of the Constitutional Court ruled upon certain legal
issues in relation to Dr Sanader’s human rights as opposed to the
consideration of his guilt.

Dr Sanader was released from prison on 25 November 2015 during the
currency of the substantive hearing of this arbitration in The Hague. His
case in Croatia has now been joined to Mr Hernadi’s. Dr Sanader is
thus awaiting a retrial but prior thereto has spent 4 years in prison in
solitary confinement. He was granted bail and was thus able to travel
to London and give evidence before this Tribunal in April 2016.

Introduction

At the outset, the Tribunal observes with satisfaction that this case has
been excellently and fully presented by both sides. The Tribunal
appreciates the courtesy afforded to the Tribunal by both sides’
Counsel and most of the witnesses. The record is substantial. The
numerous submissions are extremely detailed. Many points were put
and recorded in the 15 days of oral testimony and oral submissions,
but even so in many respects they were but the tip of the iceberg of the
thorough and clearly organized written record.

In these circumstances, it would be impossible for the Tribunal to refer
to each submission made without transforming this Award into a
document of unmanageable length. The Tribunal has dealt in this
Award with all the points it considers necessary for the determination
of the issues before it all the while assuring the Parties that all
contentions have been considered with care even if not specifically
mentioned in this Award.

PCA Case. No. 2014-15
FINAL AWARD

This case is multi-faceted. At one level it concerns issues of
management control of INA, the former State-owned monopolistic gas
provider in Croatia. It involves issues of Croatian corporate law. At
another level it revolves around differences between the two main
political parties in Croatia.

As said, it also raises an issue of alleged corruption at the highest level
of government, having had a direct impact on affairs of State. Woven
into all of this are issues of the supply of substantial quantities of
Russian gas essential for the Croatian economy, initially involving
internationally well known entities such as Yukos, Lukoil, and Russneft.

Croatia’s Case on Bribery

When this case started, Croatia based its allegation of corruption on
three principal strands of evidence.

Firstly, it relied upon the fact that Dr Sanader had been convicted of
bribery by the Zagreb County Court and the conviction had been upheld
by the Court of Appeal. Although Croatia did not submit that this
Tribunal was bound by that conviction and, indeed, there was no
challenge to the expert reports from Judge Schwebel and
Professor Reisman to the contrary effect, Croatia submitted that the
conviction was nevertheless a factor which this Tribunal should take

into account.

Secondly, Croatia relied upon the evidence of Mr Jezi¢, who had given
statements to USKOK, had given evidence at the trial of Dr Sanader,
and finally gave evidence before this Tribunal in May 2015. His
evidence, says Croatia, establishes the bribery without any doubt.

The third strand of evidence was from Mr Hirlimann. The Tribunal
thought originally that he was a lawyer, as he was a partner in the law
firm of Wenger and Vieli, which is based in Zug. Mr Hirlimann, who
had been involved in some of the transactions to be considered below
and was certainly acting on behalf of Mr Jezié and his companies, gave

PCA Case. No. 2014-15
FINAL AWARD

a voluntary statement to USKOK, which was placed before the Sanader
trial court when Mr Hurlimann declined to attend the Sanader trial.

Mr Hurlimann’s statement to USKOK was submitted as a witness
statement in this arbitration. Mr Hirlimann’s evidence was said to be
important because he stated that when [X] came to see him
to discuss the payment of the alleged bribe, [x] said he was
acting on behalf of MOL and allegedly produced a card to that effect.

The evidence at the close of the evidential phase of this arbitration is
markedly different to what it was when this arbitration commenced.
Firstly, the Constitutional Court had set aside Dr Sanader’s conviction
and he is awaiting retrial. Therefore, Croatia cannot rely upon or
otherwise invoke any conviction of Dr Sanader for bribery. Secondly,
Mr Jezi¢ has been cross-examined for some ten hours in this arbitration
and the Tribunal will have to make up its mind what conclusions it
should draw from his evidence. Thirdly, because Mr Hirlimann refused
to answer any material questions either from the Tribunal or from
Counsel for MOL, MOL submits that Mr Hirlimann’s evidence should
be excluded entirely from the Tribunal’s consideration. If the Tribunal
agrees with MOL in this respect, then the Tribunal will have to consider
very carefully what evidence remains to implicate MOL.

Mr Jezié

The Tribunal has come to the view that there are three possible
scenarios open to the Tribunal with regard to the evidence of Mr Jezic¢.

Scenario one would be that having heard the cross-examination and
considered his evidence, the Tribunal is convinced that he is telling the
truth. If that is the conclusion of the Tribunal, then Croatia’s case is
made out.

Scenario two would be the reverse. The Tribunal could conclude that
the evidence of Mr Jezié was so contradictory, unlikely, and implausible

30

89.

90.

Case 1:17-cv-02339 Document 1-6 Filed 11/06/17 Page 32 of 196

PCA Case. No. 2014-15
FINAL AWARD

that it could give no credence whatsoever to Mr Jezi¢’s evidence and
thus the case would have to be dismissed.

Counsel for Croatia did attempt to argue that Croatia still had a case,
even absent the evidence of Mr Jezi¢. The Tribunal finds this
submission hard to accept and it is quite contrary to the way in which
the case was presented. The Tribunal has some difficulty in seeing how
Croatia could have pleaded this case absent the evidence of Mr Jezi¢.

Scenario three involves a possible finding by the Tribunal that even
though there were inconsistencies in Mr Jezi¢’s version and that part of
his evidence is quite unsatisfactory, nevertheless the Tribunal could not
confidently dismiss it. It would have in mind, of course, the Consultancy
Agreements, the amounts of money and the dates of payments when
coming to this conclusion. If this is the conclusion arrived at by the
Tribunal, then it is necessary for the Tribunal to look at all the other
evidence in the case and see whether Mr Jezi¢’s version of events is
corroborated by other evidence or, to put it differently, supported and
made more likely by other evidence in the case. This enquiry would
involve an examination of various payments — the so-called premium
payments — made by MOL to H[3Co] which Croatia said was in effect
a slush fund to pay the bribe. Further, if the Tribunal were to admit the
so-called ‘Austrian files’4° then it will have to decide whether they
corroborated Mr Jezi¢’s version of events.

Having given this matter the most careful and anxious consideration,
the Tribunal is minded to adopt scenario three. It will later in this award
set out the inconsistencies and some of the improbabilities of Mr Jezi¢’s
story, but will in any event also look at the other evidence to see
whether despite the considerable difficulties with his version, there is
evidence that corroborates in a material way the evidence he has given,

legal assistance scheme that were then transmitted to Croatia for use in these
proceedings.

such that this Tribunal can rely upon it and find that Croatia's
allegations of bribery have been made out.

Corruption — General

This Tribunal takes the allegation of corruption extremely seriously.
There can be no doubt as to the gravity of corruption in the modern
world. In the foreword to the United Nations Convention Against
Corruption (“UNCAC’), Kofi Annan, the former Secretary General of the
United Nations, stated:

“Corruption is an insidious plague that has a wide range of
corrosive effects on societies. It undermines democracy and the
rule of law, leads to violations of human rights, distorts markets,
erodes the quality of life and allows organized crime, terrorism
and other threats to human security to flourish”.4”

As Vladimir Pavic has put it in ‘Bribery and International Commercial
Arbitration —- The Role of Mandatory Rules and Public Policy’:

“The very notion of “bribery” (and “corruption’) in international
trade seems to provoke an almost unison condemnation. Legal
commentators and judges alike have been resolute in labelling in
as a vile, repugnant behaviour that tears the very fabric of society
and the cross-border exchange of goods and services”.8

The Civil Law Convention on Corruption also emphasise the damage
caused by corruption:

“Emphasising that corruption represents a major threat to the rule of
law, democracy and human rights, fairness and social justice, hinders
economic development and endangers the proper and fair functioning
of market economies.”9

It is thus generally accepted that corruption is a cancer that eats into
the body politic. Many governments and international organisations
have done much in recent years to attempt to stamp it out.
Unfortunately it is endemic in certain parts of the world. Issues of
corruption sometimes arise in international arbitration and arbitrators
must be on their guard to ensure that they are not used as a mean of
disguising this evil. But where in a case such as this the issue is raised
fairly and squarely before the Tribunal it must not shirk its
responsibilities. If this Tribunal finds corruption proved as alleged it will
not hesitate to say so and subject MOL to all the consequences flowing
therefrom. But, on the other hand, corruption has to be proved by
evidence that convinces the Tribunal that the allegation has been made
out. The Tribunal readily appreciates the enormous consequences that
MOL and its officers will suffer if the allegation is established. It will not
shrink from dismissing the allegation if it is not convinced by the
evidence presented to it.

Corruption is made unlawful in Croatia by virtue of articles 293 and 294
of the Croatia Criminal Code (“CCC”):

“Article 293 —

(1) An official person who solicits or accepts a gift or some other
gain for himself or for another person, or who accepts a promise
to be given a gift or some other gain in order to perform within the
scope of his authority an official or other act which he should not
perform, or to omit an official or other act which he should perform
shall be punished by imprisonment for one to ten years.

(2) An official person who solicits or accepts a gift or some gain
for himself or for another person or who accepts a promise to be
given a gift or some other gain in order to perform within the scope
of his authority an official or other act which he should perform, or
to omit an official or other act which he should not perform, shall
be punished by imprisonment for one to eight years.

(3) An official person who after the performance or omission of an
official or other act referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article
solicits or accepts a gift or some other gain for himself or for
another natural or legal person as a result of such performance
or omission shall be punished by imprisonment up to one year.’°°

“Article 294 —

(1) Whoever gives or promises to give a gift or some other gain
to an official person or another person in order to perform, within
the scope of his official authority, an official or other act which he
should not perform, or to omit an official or other act which he
should otherwise perform, or whoever mediates in bribing an
Official or responsible person in such a way shall be punished by

imprisonment for one to eight years.

(2) Whoever gives or promises to give a gift or some other gain
to an official person or another person in order to perform, within
the scope of his official authority, an official or other act which he
should perform, or to omit an official or other act which he should
not perform, or whoever mediates in bribing an official or
responsible person in such a way, shall be punished by
imprisonment for six months to five years.

(3) The court shall remit the punishment of the perpetrator of the
criminal offense referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article,
provided that he gives the bribe on the request of an official
person or responsible person and reports the offense before it is
discovered or before he learns that the offense has been
discovered.”51

97. It follows from the above that Croatian law sets out three requirements
allowing Croatian judges to identify bribery.

First, the alleged briber must have promised or given a gift or any other
gain. Second, the alleged gift or gain must be intended for an official
person. Third, the gift or gain must be given or promised in exchange
for the performance of an act within the scope of the person’s authority
that the person should not perform.

In short, Croatia considers that these three requirements are all fulfilled
in this case:

“MOL promised Sanader EUR 10 million and paid him EUR 5
million. (...)

Sanader was the Prime Minister of Croatia and thus an official
person. (...)

Sanader was bribed to influence the Government's decision to
enter into the 2009 Agreements”.

It is worth noting that the Constitutional Court quashed the lower court’s
decision on the basis that the second requirement was not adequately
considered. It held that the lower court failed to set out the reasons
allowing it to conclude that Prime Minister Sanader was indeed an
official person.

The Constitutional Court expressly referred to the definition of “public
official” contained in the UNCAC which reads as follows:

“Public official’ shall mean: (i) any person holding a legislative,
executive, administrative or judicial office of a State Party,
whether appointed or elected, whether permanent or temporary,
whether paid or unpaid, irrespective of that person’ seniority’.

The Constitutional Court also explained that whereas it is essential to
specify why it is considered that the person who allegedly received the
bribe is an official person, it is not required to assess whether the official
person has indeed exercised any influence in exchange for the money

received or promised. The proof that the official person has accepted
the bribe is sufficient under Croatian law.

The civil consequence of the bribe is foreseen in two articles of the
Croatian Obligation Act (“COA’). A contract obtained through bribery is
null “regardless of whether it is favourable, less favourable,
unfavourable, extremely unfavourable, detrimental or neutral to the
Republic of Croatia (...)."°2

Article 322 reads as follows:

“A contract that is contrary to the Constitution of the Republic of
Croatia, the mandatory provisions or the morals of the society
shall be null unless the objective of the violated rule refers to
some other legal effect or the law provides otherwise for such
particular case.”™3

Article 273 (2) provides:

“However, if an impermissible motive substantially influenced the
decision of a contracting party to enter into the contract and if the
other contracting party knew or ought to have known about the
existence of such a motive, the contract shall have no effect.”

The Tribunal will apply these provisions to assess whether the SHA
and GMA were obtained through bribery.

Standard and Burden of Proof

Assessing the truth of a bribe allegation is a difficult task and the
Tribunal fully appreciates as a matter of realism that transactions of
such a nature are unlikely to be well documented. The Tribunal has
given consideration to the comments of a number of other international
tribunals invoked by the Parties because of their consideration of

similar allegations. The Tribunal therefore turns to the questions
relating to the adequacy of evidence required to sustain such
allegations.

(a) What Level of Certainty Is Required to Conclude that
Corruption is Established?

107. As far as Croatian law is concerned, article 221a of the Croatian Civil
Procedure Act (“CCPA’) confirms that the Tribunal is required to reach
certainty, or at least “a high degree of probabilities’, when deciding on
allegations of bribery. Croatian law does not provide a precise definition
of ‘certainty’. Thus, Professor Bareti¢ and Professor Tepes (Croatia's
experts on Croatian law) stated that the Tribunal “has full freedom as
to the choice of a particular piece of evidence, as to the method of proof
presentation and as to the assessment of evidentiary value”.

108. Croatia further relies on two decisions of the Croatian Supreme Court.
Neither of these decisions involves issues of corruption. Indeed, the
first decision dated 15 October 2014 deals with the causation of
damage resulting from an explosion at the claimant’s house. As for the
second decision dated 29 October 2014, it relates to the termination of
a fixed-term work contract. However, in both decisions the Supreme
Court provided general guidance as to the standard of proof applicable
under Croatian law.

109. The Supreme Court emphasised that:

“Considering the particular disputable moments in the factual
complex of this case (...) it is never possible, with respect to
establishing the facts, to reach the level of complete certainty but
only the level (in the best case) of a high degree of probability.”

FINAL AWARD

Those two decisions have caused Croatia to submit that the Tribunal is
not required to apply a high standard of certainty, especially in a case
where the factual matrix is particularly complex.

Also relying on the CCPA, MOL requests the Tribunal to reach a
particular degree of certainty when ruling on this case. However, MOL’s
interpretation of Croatian procedural law is different from Croatia's.
MOL considers that under Croatian law, the Tribunal is required to
apply a high standard of certainty, or rather a high degree of probability,
because of the seriousness of the allegations made in this case. MOL
invites the Tribunal to adopt its position, as it allegedly is the common
practice in international arbitration when it comes to corruption: “arbitral
tribunals uniformly employ a high standard of proof for allegations of
corruption.”8

As far as international law is concerned, Croatia relies heavily on two
well-known cases, namely, Metal-Tech v. Usbekistan®? and World Duty
Free Company Ltd. V Kenya.® Croatia invites the Tribunal to use the
guidance provided in these two cases when approaching the issue of
bribery.

These two cases further support Croatia’s position that the Tribunal
should apply a “reasonable certainty’ standard.

In the Metal-Tech case, just like in the World Duty Free case, the
Tribunal considered that it did not need to “resort to presumptions or
rules of burden of proof where the evidence of the payments came from
the Claimant and the Tribunal itself sought further evidence of the
nature and purpose of such payments’. Rather, in both cases the
tribunals accepted that, considering the difficult task before them, they
were only required to reach “reasonable certainty (...) through

circumstantial evidence” ®' as to whether corruption could be
established.

It is generally accepted that in civil cases the balance of probabilities is
an appropriate standard of proof. It is important to consider that
although an adverse finding against MOL in relation to the corruption
allegation would have severe financial and reputational consequences,
it would not lead to the incarceration or fine of any individual.

Nevertheless, the fact remains that international tribunals and scholars
have made diverging pronouncements with respect to the burden of
proof to be applied to allegations of corruption. It may well be that the
various approaches and analyses, although diverse in their
conceptualization of the problem (and the nomenclature used), would
not often — if ever -- lead to different outcomes. Given the centrality of
the allegations of corruption in this case, and the exceptional public
interest they have generated, the Tribunal feels it appropriate to state
its broad understanding of precedents and commentary, and to clarify
its own path to the resolution of this case.

Some international tribunals have reasoned that the seriousness of
allegations of corruption should lead to a heightened standard of proof,
often referred to as “clear and convincing”. Others have declined to
depart from the ordinary “balance of probabilities” standard. One
commentator, while generally accepting the traditional test, suggests
that that the “more likely than not” or “balance of probabilities” standard
needs to be applied flexibly by arbitral tribunals when dealing with
allegations of corruption, and to follow a two-step approach: first,
looking at the "balance" of the evidence before them; and second, when
appropriate, relying on inference to fill the gap; “where an inference is
a reasonable conclusion to draw from the known or assumed facts,
Tribunals should be willing to draw the inference to determine
allegations of illegality as they would any other allegation—indeed

more so given the often deliberately concealed nature of an illegality...”
and not content themselves with “a mere mechanical comparison of
probabilities independently of any belief in its reality”. 62

In sum, no consensus has as yet emerged as to how to reconcile these
conceptual approaches in theory. The difficulty of the subject is likely
to be related to the general legal presumption of good faith. In civil
actions for negligence or breach of contract, there is no presumption
that a defendant has complied with an agreement or has conducted
himself with due care. True enough, the plaintiff has the burden of
proof, but a mere preponderance of the evidence, meaning only "more
likely than not", will suffice. But if the particular claim being made
involves an accusation of bad faith — such as misrepresentation or
wilful endangerment -- the presumption of good faith means that the
starting pointis, in effect, a presumed preponderance against the claim.
How could evidence that shows that an allegation is more likely true
than false overcome a presumption that the allegation is not true,
unless one is prepared to take the unacceptable step of disregarding
the presumption of good faith? (A defendant does not have to prove
the absence of breach or the absence of negligence, so if the
presumption of good faith is to mean anything it must surely put the
defendant in an even better position.)

This is, one may plausibly surmise, why it is often said that proof of
"serious" allegations require something more than a preponderance of
the evidence. The quantification of that "something more", however, is
elusive. To say that something more means 67% certainty, or to give
any such number, is fatuous. Even the notion of preponderance cannot
seriously be thought of as 51%; law cases are not scientific activities
where absolute truth is thought of as a litre or a kilo, and the judge or
arbitrator records the weight or volume of evidence with the effect that

a total of 501 centilitres or grammes justifies the conclusion that
something is "true enough".

Although it is difficult to escape subjective appreciation, that does not
lead ineluctably to arbitrariness. Searching for something more than
preponderance but less than the "beyond a reasonable doubt"
formulation of criminal law, modern common law courts have referred
to the standard of "comfortable satisfaction’, notably used by the
highest court of Australia in 1938 in a case known as Briginshaw v.
Briginshaw,® which involved allegations of adultery. There, Dixon J.
stated: "The nature of the allegation requires as a matter of common
sense and worldly wisdom the careful weighing of testimony, the close
examination of facts proved as a basis for inference and a comfortable
Satisfaction that the tribunal has reached both a correct and just
conclusion."

Lawyers of the civil law tradition seemingly strive for a very similar
degree of certainty when they refer to their "conviction intime". As the
ICC arbitrators put it in the much-discussed Westacre case,“

"[I/f the claimant's claim is based on the contract is to be voided
by the defense of bribery, the arbitral tribunal, as any state court,
must be convinced that there is indeed a case of bribery. A mere
suspicion by any member of the arbitral tribunal...is entirely
insufficient to form such a conviction of the Arbitral Tribunal."

This "inner conviction" standard has been often used in sports
arbitration when cheating or corruption is alleged. In many awards,
arbitrators of the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne have
invoked the "personal conviction" or "comfortable satisfaction"

standard. Thus, in FK Pobeda et al. v. UEFA,® the arbitrators held as
follows:

"Taking into account the nature of the conduct in question and the
paramount importance of fighting corruption of any kind in sport
and also considering the nature and restricted powers of the
investigation authorities of the governing bodies of sport as
compared to national formal interrogation authorities, the Panel is
of the opinion that cases of match fixing should be dealt in line
with the CAS constant jurisprudence on disciplinary doping cases.
Therefore, the UEFA must establish the relevant facts ‘to the
comfortable satisfaction of the court having in mind the

seriousness of the allegation which is made’.

It might be said against the notion of a heightened standard, such as
requiring "clear and convincing" evidence, or a subjective "comfortable
Satisfaction", that it leads to unpredictability. Some decision-makers
may consider that they are not "convinced" or "satisfied" with respect
to a particularly grave accusation unless it is proved beyond reasonable
doubt. If they apply that standard, it would be false to insist — as is
generally thought — that the standard, while "heightenea", nevertheless
is less exacting than that of criminal law. One might therefore retain the
“preponderance” approach, while bearing in mind the proposition, as
one ICSID Tribunal put it, that “the graver the charge, the more
confidence there must be in the evidence relied on’, although this does
not “necessarily entail a higher standard of proof’. Some may
nevertheless object that whatever the words used, this must still
amount to an elusively stricter standard.

From the expressions used in the Croatian court decisions put before
this Tribunal, which in translation are rendered in paragraphs 212 and
213 of Croatia’s Post-Hearing brief as “a high degree of probability’, it

seems clear that there is judicial acceptance of the proposition that the
test in matters of corruption should be somewhere between the simple
balance of probabilities and absolute certainty — while recognising that
the latter is unobtainable in human affairs. At the same time, there
seems to be an undeniable consensus of judges and arbitrators that
mere suspicion is never enough.

None of the ultimately residual conceptual difficulties, however, needs
to be resolved in this case if the Tribunal finds that the allegations of
corruption fail even under a traditional balance-of-probabilities
approach. In any event, it seems from the decisions referred to above
that Croatian courts also apply a test which is more onerous than the
balance of probabilities but not as onerous as beyond reasonable
doubt; this seems inherent in the expression they have used: “a high
degree of probability’. |t clearly focuses on something between the
balance of probabilities and absolute certainty whilst at the same time
recognizing that the latter is unobtainable. Of course one must be
conscious of semantics when dealing with this important issue but
another way of looking at the matter is for the Tribunal to ask itself
whether on the evidence it has heard, read, and seen it is convinced
that the bribe took place as alleged by Croatia, which can hardly
complain if the Tribunal adopts the standard which Croatia itself puts
forward, in the first paragraph (203) of Volume II of its Post-Hearing
Brief, entirely devoted to the burden of proof, as follows: “the question
is whether corruption was established with reasonable certainty”. This
is a matter of persuasion, and it may well be that for most minds
becoming persuaded of something requires more than accepting that it
is more likely than not. In any event, if the test of reasonable certainty
is not satisfied, no “heightened” standard, however understood, would
have been met either. To adapt the common French expression: quine
peut pas le moins, ne peut pas le plus (‘if you can't do the easier thing,
you can't do the harder’). This is the approach the Tribunal will take:
are the allegations of corruption supported by evidence that produce

reasonable certainty?

FINAL AWARD

(b) Who Bears the Burden of Proof?

Croatia asserts that the Tribunal, if it followed the Metal-Tech case,
would be justified in going so far as to shift the burden of proof to MOL.

Yet the circumstances of the Metal-Tech case were different and this

undoubtedly explains why the tribunal in that case shifted the burden
of proof. The briber in that case was actually the claimant, and the
tribunal's “reasonable certainty’ was based on the testimony from the
claimant's CEO himself who admitted having paid USD 4 million to
consultants at the time of the investment. The tribunal gave the
claimant the opportunity to provide evidence of the services supposedly
rendered in exchange for these monies, but none was produced. In the
absence of an alternative explanation of the claimant's own payment,
the tribunal was persuaded of its unlawfulness. In other words, this was
very clearly a contextually specific instance of shifting the burden of
proof.

In this case, by contrast, Croatia’s allegations rest upon the testimony
of Mr Jezi¢é, who was the alleged intermediary between MOL and Dr
Sanader. Furthermore, nothing seems to support Croatia’s assertion
that, under Croatian law, the Tribunal can shift the burden of proof to
MOL.

The Tribunal will consider later in this Award whether it could rely solely
on the evidence of Mr JeZi¢ to establish the bribe. If not, the Tribunal

must examine all the other admissible evidence that Croatia contends

supports or corroborates Mr Jezi¢’s testimony. The burden of
establishing this at all times remains with Croatia.

FINAL AWARD

(c) What Evidence is Relevant?

i. The Evidence Related to the Money Trail and the Issue of
Adverse Inferences

The evidence establishing the money trail is the first thing that the
Tribunal needs to analyse. Croatia’s case is that there was an actual
payment, not just a promise; if it thought a promise could have been
proved, it would presumably have sought to do so. The picture drawn
by the evidence in the record might not be complete or accurate.
However, to be convincing the money trail must lead the Tribunal from
the alleged briber, Mr Hernadi, to the alleged recipient of the money,
Dr Sanader. Once it is established that a payment passed from the
briber to the corrupt official, the Tribunal will consider the services
provided in exchange for it.

Croatia has attempted to shed light on the financial structure that
supported the alleged bribe in order to prove its case. Bearing in mind
the difficulty of proving allegations of corruption, Croatia invited the
Tribunal to draw adverse inferences “in two common circumstances: (i)
where a party has refused to produce evidence that is reasonably within
its possession or control and (ii) where a party has failed to respond to
a prima facie case put on by the other party. (...) These adverse
inferences may then be used to establish that a party has met its
burden of proof’.® This approach must then lead the Tribunal to
conclude that “the situation, as established by prima facie evidence,
coupled with the adverse presumption arising from the non-production
of available counter-evidence, is thus sufficient to create a moral
conviction of the truth of an allegation.”

PCA Case. No. 2014-15
FINAL AWARD

In international arbitration it is widely accepted that tribunals are
required to “be proactive” and demand that the Parties provide “all
evidentiary elements in their possession”. © In the Metal-Tech case for
instance, the claimant failed to provide the evidence required by the
tribunal to prove that legitimate services had been performed, and the
tribunal drew adverse inferences from this lack of explanation. In the
case at hand, the Tribunal agrees that if a party had failed to disclose
evidence regarding the money trail, adverse inferences might be
drawn.

However, the Tribunal has received thousands of pages of exhibits.
Some, but far from all of them, were relevant to the issues at stake. The
abundance of immaterial evidence can sometimes be as disappointing
as the lack of it. Although the Tribunal is satisfied that both Parties
made their best efforts to provide as much evidence as they possibly
could, a grey area remains.

For this reason, the Tribunal has had to look very carefully at the many
witness statements provided by both Parties — no less than 15. And yet
some of the most important witnesses, i.e. those who were supposedly
directly involved in the alleged bribe, either refused to give evidence or
were unable to testify when the main hearing took place. The Tribunal
made its best efforts to invite these witnesses to testify and both Parties
jointly supported these attempts. The Tribunal even requested judicial
assistance in Switzerland (from the Tribunal de premiére instance of
Geneva) to secure the testimony of Mr Hirlimann. Thanks to these
initiatives, Dr Sanader, Mr Petrovi¢, and Mr Hirlimann finally appeared
before the Tribunal in special sessions some six months after the
substantive hearing.

Considering the above, the Tribunal can only conclude that contrary to
what happened in the Metal-Tech case, neither Croatia nor MOL “has

refused to produce evidence that is reasonably within its possession or
control’. No adverse inferences can be drawn on this basis.

Thus, the Tribunal’s discussion will rather deal with the issues as to
whether Croatia has established a plausible prima facie case regarding
the bribe and whether MOL has failed to respond to it.

ii. The Sanader Trial

The Tribunal must approach the evidence in the Sanader trial with
considerable caution. No transcript of that trials available, only a précis
of each witness's oral testimony recorded by Judge [kK]

That leads to two concerns. Firstly, what the Judge recorded was the
summary of what he presented as his perception of what the witnesses
said. Dr Sanader in his testimony to this Tribunal recognized that this
was a difficult task for the Judge and that inevitably there were
inaccuracies. Dr Sanader told the Tribunal that he recalled about 15
occasions where he felt it necessary to challenge the Judge’s
summary.

Furthermore, the Tribunal cannot ignore the Judge’s obvious bias at
the trial. The Tribunal needs not say anything about this save to point
out that after a retrial had been ordered by the Constitutional Court,
Judge [k] sought to reserve the case to himself and gave two
interviews to the press, the first on 29 July 2015, and the other on
2 August 2015, which made it quite clear that he disagreed with the
decision of the Constitutional Court and intended to hear the retrial
himself. He certainly indicated that if the Chairman of a Tribunal is the
same, namely himself, “then transcripts on the presentation of evidence
may be read out without the consent of parties’. |t is regrettable that
the Judge decided to discuss these issues in the public domain. It is a
fair inference from what the Judge said in his interview that he was
minded to make the same decision as before if he presided over the
retrial.

FINAL AWARD

It results from the above that the Tribunal will consider the testimony
and findings collected at the Sanader trial with the utmost caution.
When ruling on this case, the Tribunal will favour the evidence directly
introduced by the Parties in this arbitration rather than second-hand
evidence from the Sanader trial.

The Missing Witnesses

An unusual feature of this case has been the number of important
missing witnesses. As noted and as will become apparent later, the
names of Mr [X] , Mr [Y] Mr Petrovié, Mr [Z] , Dr Sanader
and Mr Hirlimann feature heavily in the narrative yet none of these
individuals attended the substantive hearing in The Hague to give
evidence before the Tribunal.

The Tribunal took steps to attempt to secure the attendance of all of
the above, dispatching several letters to all of them. Ultimately only
Dr Sanader and Mr Petrovi¢ agreed to attend to give evidence several
months after Dr Sanader’s release. Mr [Y] simply ignored the
Tribunal’s correspondence. Mr! | through his attorney expressly
refused to attend the main hearing held in The Hague in
November 2015, and although Mr [X] was apparently willing to
assist at first, he ultimately refused to testify. As for Mr Hirlimann, the
Tribunal determined that it had no choice but to apply to the Geneva
Court to compel his attendance at a special session. The Court granted
the Tribunal’s request on 24 February 2016 and Mr Hirlimann was
examined by the Tribunal and MOL in Ziirich on 27 May 2016. The
Tribunal will revert to his testimony below.

The Tribunal has not had the advantage of hearing from or seeing
Messrs [X] and [Y] They both gave statements to USKOK
and they both gave evidence at the Sanader trial. The normal approach
with regard to a witness who has given a written statement but declined
to attend for cross-examination is to give the statement such weight as
the Tribunal thinks appropriate in all the circumstances of the case. The

PCA Case. No. 2014-15
FINAL AWARD

Tribunal sees no reason to depart from this approach in the case of
Messrs [X] and [Y] However these statements will be
considered with great care for all the reasons stated above.

iv. Mr Hirlimann’s Testimony

Originally Mr Hirlimann declined to give evidence before this Tribunal.
The Tribunal applied to the Geneva Court of First Instance for an order
requiring him to attend. Such an order was granted. Mr Hirlimann wrote
to the President of the Tribunal making it clear that he would not answer
any questions on the ground that it might incriminate him.
Nevertheless, the Tribunal called for his attendance and he did attend
the hearing convened in Zurich on 27 May 2016.

Mr Hirlimann attempted to make a blanket refusal to answer any
questions, but the Tribunal pressed him to answer some questions and
he did respond to a few innocuous questions. However, he declined to
recognize his signature on certain documents and to give any other
evidence pursuant to questions from the Tribunal. He was then asked
a long series of questions by Counsel for MOL which he
comprehensively declined to answer. In order to save time, the
remainder of Counsel’s questions were reduced to writing and it was
agreed by both sides that these were deemed to have been asked, but
not answered on the grounds of alleged self-incrimination.

One thing that Mr Hurlimann did make clear was that he was not a
qualified lawyer, but a tax consultant. He had been a partner in the
Wenger law firm, but was now Of Counsel. He was accompanied to the
hearing by Mr! —_1, a partner in the Wenger law firm, who purported
to act for Mr Hirlimann. However, as the Wenger law firm through Mr
Hirlimann were involved in some of the transactions, the subject matter
of this arbitration, it seemed unlikely that Mr! 1 was, as a member of
the firm, in a position to give independent advice to Mr Hirlimann as to
whether he should answer the Tribunal’s questions.

PCA Case. No. 2014-15
FINAL AWARD

In the light of the above, the Tribunal has decided that it would not be
appropriate to attach any weight or significance to Mr Hurlimann’s
written statements. When a person qualified to exercise a regulated
profession who is ordered by a court to appear before an international
arbitral tribunal with respect to his or her professional activities refuses
to answer any relevant questions on the ground that the answers might
incriminate him, thus preventing the other party from cross-examining
him, it would be grossly unfair to give his untested statement any weight
or credence whatsoever. Furthermore the Tribunal is satisfied that
Croatia’s legal team must have known or suspected Mr Hirlimann’s
reluctance to give evidence before this Tribunal and regrets that this
was not shared at the time with MOL’s counsel and the Tribunal.

v. Are the Austrian Files Admissible?
Background

Immediately before the opening of the substantive hearing in The
Hague in November 2015, MOL applied for an Order from the Tribunal
declaring the Austrian files inadmissible. This application came
extremely late in the proceedings and there was no way that the
Tribunal could rule on the issue before the commencement of the
hearing. Furthermore, it would have been most prejudicial to Croatia to
consider the detailed application without having reasonable and
sufficient time to prepare.

Accordingly, the Tribunal ruled that the Austrian files could be referred
to de bene esse and that the Tribunal would rule on the issue in the
final Award.

Detailed written submissions followed over the next few months
culminating in the hearing in Zurich on 26 and 27 May 2016 at which
Ms Lester QC appeared for MOL to make the submission in support of
the application. Mr Anway made submissions in response on behalf of
Croatia.

PCA Case. No. 2014-15
FINAL AWARD

A chronology of the basic dates relating to the Austrian Files issues is
set out in Appendix 3 to this Award.

The Facts

On 7 May 2014 USKOK asked the Austrian Ministry of Justice for
relevant documents that might be used in the criminal trial of Mr
Hernadi. The application was made State to State under the terms of
the Council of Europe Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal
Matters 1959 (the “COE Convention’). .

It is clear from the request that the documents were sought in relation
to the criminal proceedings brought against Mr Hernadi in Croatia. He
was charged with offering the bribe to Dr Sanader.

The request was granted. It has not been suggested that Croatia ever
asked Austria whether these documents could be used for any other
purpose save for the criminal proceedings against Mr Hernadi.

It appears that in mid-2015 USKOK passed these documents to
Croatia’s arbitration team for use in this arbitration. The Tribunal well
remembers the statement contained in Croatia’s August 2015 reply:

“Austrian criminal authorities have delivered to Croatia a treasure-
trove of new documents”.

Miss Lester took the Tribunal to the COE Convention, emphasizing
specific articles that she submitted made clear that the Convention
deals solely with criminal matters.

In 1993 Austria and the former Yugoslavia entered into a bilateral
Treaty dealing with assistance in criminal matters. Article 11.3, in
particular, states:

“The country receiving the request can retain records, documents
or other goods that are necessary for criminal proceedings in that
country for the duration of the case”.

Case 1:17-cv-02339 Document 1-6 Filed 11/06/17 Page 53 of 196

PCA Case. No. 2014-15
FINAL AWARD

157. The Tribunal was also shown Croatia’s response to a Council of Europe
website in which Croatia underscored that:

“The evidence obtained can be used only in the criminal
proceedings from which it was requested/obtained and for
purposes specified in a request’.

158. However, Croatia made the point that because Austria stated, as under
the Convention it was entitled to do, that it did not want the documents
returned, this somehow permitted Croatia to use the documents for
other purposes.

159. Croatia argues that MOL is being over-technical because the Council
of Europe Civil Law Convention on Corruption obliges Austria to allow
Croatia to use the documents in proceedings that make corruption
allegations. MOL’s response is that this is a misreading of the
Convention, which does not impose obligations to supply documents,
but rather requires Convention States to make appropriate provision in
their law for effective remedies for people who have suffered damage
as a result of corruption. Thus, it is concerned with the remedy, not the
evidence to prove corruption.

160. MOL also submits that the COE Convention and the bilateral Treaty
prevent any collateral use of such documents obtained for criminal
proceedings.

161. To counter this proposition Croatia relies on the expert testimony of
Professor Zlata Durdevié who wrote in her third Export Report:

“Once documents are transferred from a requested State to a
requesting State, the latter gets the ownership of them and can
use them in accordance with its legal order for any purpose”.”

PCA Case. No. 2014-15
FINAL AWARD

This argument is clearly based on the absence of any provision
explicitly preventing collateral use of requested documents.

Mr Anway argued that even if Austria had requested the return of these

documents:

“They could be used for other purposes until that use was
complete”.

He relied on Professor Durdevi¢’s statement in paragraph 28 where
she said:

“When evidence is in the possession of a State, it is governed by
that State’s internal legal order. Only if there is an international
obligation such as a clause in the applicable MLA Treaty, (we saw
there was none) can the requested State limit their use for other
purposes”.”

Professor Durdevié also helpfully reviewed state practice on this point
and found no consistent approach. Therefore, Professor Durdevié
concludes that in the absence of a “consistent state practice and [no]
common attitude to the limitation on use of evidence obtained by
MLA”,’2 the Tribunal should conclude that “there is no doubt that the
states may be bound by that principle only if it is provided for by the
treaty provisions.” In other words, the Tribunal should consider that
there is a presumption resulting from state practice that allows states
to use as they wish evidence obtained through the mutual legal

assistance channel.

The Tribunal believes that the safest course is to construe the Treaty
in question rather than rely exclusively on state practice in this area.
This is particularly true when such practice lacks consistency. Indeed,
this lack of common attitude from State-parties indicates that there is

FINAL AWARD

no agreement between them as to the use of evidence obtained
through mutual legal assistance.

Croatia, through Professor Durdevié, relies on Article 13.1 of the COE
Convention which states:

“A requested Party shall communicate extracts from and
information relating to judicial records, requested from it by the
judicial authorities of a Contracting Party and needed in a criminal
matter, to the same extent that these may be made available to
its own judicial authorities in like case”.

The point being made here is that “judicial authorities’ is wide enough
to extend beyond criminal courts.

Discussion

It strikes the Tribunal as implausible that a Treaty dealing with mutual
assistance in criminal matters can be construed, on the basis of Article
13.1, as being wide enough to permit collateral use when there is no
express article to that effect. In the Tribunal’s opinion, this Article does
not assist Croatia’s submissions.

Nor is the Tribunal persuaded by the argument that because Austria
did not require the documents to be returned, it agreed that they could
be used for other than the stated purpose. There is all the difference in
the world between producing documents for a specific and limited
purpose and not being required to return them after use for that very
purpose.

Neither is the Tribunal impressed with Croatia’s reliance on the Civil
Law Convention on Corruption. Croatia misreads the Convention when
it argues that the Convention obliges Austria to allow Croatia to use
these documents in proceedings that make corruption allegations. The
Tribunal agrees with MOL as construing the Convention as imposing
an obligation on contracting States to make provision in their law for
remedies for those who have suffered damage as a result of corruption.

FINAL AWARD

In any event, the request was not made under this particular
Convention.

The Tribunal cannot accept Professor Durdevic’s opinion that once
documents had been transferred to a requesting State, the latter can
use them for any purpose. This argument, of course adopted by Mr
Anway on behalf of Croatia, cannot be right because it devalues the
whole request process. It is contrary to the terms of the Convention
itself.

The Tribunal is satisfied that the terms upon which Austria made
available this file to the Croatia prosecution authorities was for use
exclusively in criminal proceedings in Croatia against Mr Hernardi.
Nothing in the treaties invoked permit collateral use. If collateral use
was to be permitted, then the Tribunal would expect it to be stated in
the clearest possible manner. The use of such documents has very
wide implications. States must know that when they provide such
documents to requesting States, they will be used only for the purpose
requested. What would be the purpose of stating a purpose if it could
be ignored with impunity? Furthermore, Croatia itself sets out in the
public questionnaire its practice in this matter and any reader was
entitled to assume that this representation was reliable.

MOL also raised issues relating to the law of data protection. The
Tribunal need not go into this interesting issue because it is satisfied
that MOL succeeds on the basis of the terms of the specific request
and those of the relevant treaties on the topic.

Unfortunately, MOL’s submission goes on to argue that the document
could not be considered because they were obtained and used in bad
faith. This allegation has engendered a lot of unnecessary heat
between the Parties. Ms Lester relied on the Methanex case as an
example of where a tribunal excluded evidence because it was illegally
obtained — found in a dumpster in a parking lot in California and copied
from private files. It was submitted to that tribunal:

Case 1:17-cv-02339 Document 1-6 Filed 11/06/17 Page 57 of 196

“... Documents illegally fished out of another man’s trash have no
place in an international arbitration under a Treaty such as
NAFTA, and that it would act as a malign incentive if any NAFTA
Tribunal were to condone the collection and submission of
evidence procured by illegal means’.

This case is nowhere near Methanex. It may be that Croatia is not
allowed to use the documents because of the terms of the request and
the Treaty under which the request was made. But that is a far cry from
the situation in Methanex; the attempted analogy is hopelessly inapt.

The Tribunal is satisfied that under the provisions referred to by MOL
and set out above, the Austrian files were only to be used for the
purposes for which they were requested, namely the criminal
proceedings in Croatia against Mr Hernadi.

Waiver

That is not the end of the matter. Croatia argues that MOL, by using
these documents themselves, waived any right to complain about their
legal admissibility. In the opinion of the Tribunal this is the real
battleground between the Parties in relation to the Austrian files issue.
If MOL knew that the documents in the record had been obtained
contrary to the terms of a request from Croatia to Austria and
proceeded without objection thereto, the Tribunal would prevent MOL
from objecting to the use of these documents.

The argument that only Austria could waive its rights in relation to this
issue is invalid; if the Tribunal were to prevent MOL from objecting to
these documents, it would rather do so by virtue of a rule of evidence
that prevents a party from taking a stance that is inconsistent with its
prior behaviour. Accordingly, if MOL knew that Austria's consent had
not been obtained but had nevertheless made use of these documents

themselves, this rule of evidence would prevent such inconsistent
position.

It must be remembered that Croatia is alleging waiver and that,
consistent with legal principle, a party making an allegation has the
burden of proving it on the balance of probability. MOL bears no
evidential burden on this issue.

MOL submits that after these documents were tendered in the
arbitration in August 2015, it objected to them in its responsive
submission in October 2015. MOL submits that they could not possibly
have objected earlier. MOL’s formal application to strike the Austrian

documents was made on the eve of the November 2015 main hearing.

Croatia relies heavily on the fact that these documents were produced
in the criminal proceedings in Croatia against Mr Hernadi. These
proceedings were in absentia. It seems clear that these documents, in
German, were available to Mr Hernadi and Mr Karra, MOL’s General
Counsel, who was co-ordinating all of MOL’s and Mr Hernddi’s
proceedings. However, the criminal proceedings were against Mr
Hernadi and not against MOL.

It is striking that although six pages of the Austrian files had been
introduced into the arbitration record by Croatia, it was not until August
2015—three months before the hearing — that Croatia sought to put the
whole Austrian file into the record in this arbitration.

Both Parties had submitted document requests. In particular, on 16
January 2015 MOL had requested the following from Croatia:

“16. Documents regards, or obtained in investigation conducted
by the Bureau for Combatting Corruption and Organized Crime
(USKOK) from 1 January 2011 to the present, insofar as such
documents pertain to the alleged bribe by Mr. Hernadi and/or
MOL.

21. Documents evidencing any effort by GoC to investigate Mr.
Hernadi concerning the bribery allegations against him, and the
results of such investigations.

34. Documents (including records of discussions between
USKOK and any other Croatian Government Agency or
authority), regarding the bribery allegations involving MOL and/or
Mr. Hernadi.”

Croatia informed the Tribunal that it had produced all documents
relevant to this request that were in its possession, custody, or control.

On 25 March 2015 the Tribunal and the Parties sent a joint letter to
USKOK and to the Croatian State Attorney requesting, inter alia:

“[djocuments (including records of meetings between USKOK
and any other Croatian Government agency authority) regarding
the bribery allegations involving MOL and/Mr. Hernadi.”

On 2 April 2015 ( of USKOK responded to this joint letter
stating that all documents in the possession of USKOK and the State
Attorney that had been gathered during the investigations had already
been shared with Croatia’s arbitration Counsel. The letter stated:

“Copies of all documents gathered during the investigations of Mr.
Ivo Sanader and Mr. Zsolt Tamas Hernadi that are in the
possession of the State Attorney’s Office of the Republic of
Croatia and the Office for the Suppression of Corruption and
Organized Crime were delivered to the Government of the
Republic of Croatia and its Legal Counsel in the arbitration
proceedings against MOL in three batches in April and July of
2014 and March 2015.”

On both 4 and 22 April 2015, Counsel for Croatia confirmed that they
had produced all responsive documents in their possession. The
Tribunal is satisfied that Croatia’s arbitration Counsel did have most of

the documents included in the Austrian files in their possession by the
time this representation was made. During the early opening there was
of course a reference to this “treasure-trove” of documents, but they
were not all put into the record until August 2015.

It seems clear that Croatia did not provide a translation from the
German of the correspondence with the Austrian Ministry of Justice,
which included the request for mutual legal assistance. Counsel for
MOL informed the Tribunal that the entirety of the Austrian files were
translated in order to understand Croatia’s allegations and how this
purported “new evidence’ related to the bribery allegations in this case.
The documents were translated by 21 September 2015.

On 10 September 2015, MOL’s Counsel wrote to Croatia’s Counsel,
asking for the disclosure of all the correspondence between Croatia
and Austria in relation to the Austrian files.

MOL's Counsel informed the Tribunal in its submissions that following
the translation of the Austrian files, it appeared that several of the
documents were missing therefrom. Apparently the missing documents
were the correspondence between Croatia and Austria in relation to the
request for mutual legal assistance. There then followed
correspondence between Counsel that concluded on 1 October 2015
with the production of further untranslated documents. MOL had the
missing documents translated and completed its reconstruction of the
Austrian files on 5 October 2015. As stated above, on 16 October 2015
MOL filed its Rejoinder, and objected to Croatia’s reliance on the
Austrian files.

On 13 November 2015, following the completion of its factual and legal
consideration of the Austrian files issue, MOL brought the matter to the
attention of the Tribunal and applied for the Austrian File documents to
be stricken from the record.

On 16 November 2015 the Tribunal agreed with the Parties that the
matter would proceed with the Austrian files being admitted de bene

esse and that both Parties would have an opportunity to make legal

submissions on the admissibility of these documents. There were

several rounds of written submissions culminating in oral submissions
in Ziirich on 26 May 2016.

In the opinion of the Tribunal, Croatia has not established that MOL or
its Counsel knew that the Austrian files had been provided by Austria
to Croatia for the sole purpose of use in the criminal trial in Croatia of
Mr Hernadi. Croatia has had every opportunity to establish that fact. It
has not done so. It seems most unlikely that, given the intensity with
which this arbitration has been conducted, MOL’s Counsel would have
known about the terms of the request and taken no action in respect
thereto. Their subsequent conduct belies such a conclusion.

Unfortunately, the Austrian files issue has engendered a great deal of
heat and allegations of bad faith as between Counsel. No purpose
material to the mission of this Tribunal will be served by repeating these
allegations or attempting to answer them. The plain and dispositive
facts of the matter are that, firstly, these documents are clearly
inadmissible under the terms of the COE Convention and that although
the argument of waiver was in the opinion of the Tribunal open to
Croatia to establish, it failed to do so on the facts placed before the
Tribunal.

Finally, the Parties disagree on the extent that Swiss law governs the
issue of admissibility of evidence in arbitration and the interpretation of
that law. Still, it is accepted that Swiss law does not oblige, under all
circumstances, the Tribunal to accept illegally obtained evidence. Even
if arguendo the Tribunal adopts Claimant's interpretation that Swiss law
governs the question of admissibility of the Austrian files and that the
Tribunal must assess, inter alia, “the importance of the documents to
establish the truth’,” after reviewing the Austrian files the Tribunal
concludes that the inclusion of the files does not support Croatia’s

74 Claimant's opposition to MOL’s Application to strike the Austrian Files from the
Record of 16 December 2015, para. 92.

arguments and will not have any significant probative value. Therefore,
even under Swiss law, the Tribunal is not obliged to accept the
admissibility of the Austrian files.

Accordingly, the Austrian Files are inadmissible and will be stricken
from the record in this arbitration; they will not form any part of the
Tribunal’s consideration in this matter.

The Tribunal wishes to add the following comment. For the reasons set
out above, the Tribunal has had access to the Austrian files and has
had detailed submissions on them by Counsel. They have been
referred to by some of the witnesses. Although the Tribunal will not go
behind its Order declaring these documents inadmissible, it can and
should state that having had regard to all of those documents and
having heard submissions concerning their relevance or otherwise to
the allegations in this case, it is satisfied that these documents do not
corroborate either the evidence of Mr Jezi¢ nor the narrative of the
purported money trail described by Croatia.

Croatia’s Prima Facie Case on Corruption

(a) Robert Jezi¢ and the Money Trail

The main evidence of the bribery is alleged to come from Dr Sanader’s
acquaintance and associate, Mr Jezic¢.

i. Mr Jezi¢’s Background Relationship with INA, MOL and the
Government

Mr Jezié is a man of considerable mystery, long known in Croatia for
his personal fortune and his political network. Mr Jezi¢ owns several
companies in Croatia, including [4Co]

Mr Jezi¢ was certainly perceived as influential. For example, Mr Aldott,
the President of the Management Board of INA, explained that thanks
to Mr Jezié’s connections in the government, [4Co] used to benefit from

a certain flexibility regarding gas prices and payment terms. ” [4Co]

debt to INA amounted to approximately USD 12 million in late 2009 and
never stopped growing since then. In May 2010, [4Co] debt was as
high as USD 18 million and, due to INA’s change of control Mr Jezié
was no longer able to use his contacts to obtain special treatment.

Despite several attempts, [4Co] and INA failed to find a settlement
regarding [4Co] debt. Thus, INA started implementing measures to
recover its money, e.g. “activation of debenture notes, enforcement
procedure and suspension of deliveries’.’® This disagreement soon
turned into a public dispute ventilated in the local press. [4Co] accused
INA’s new management, i.e. MOL and Mr Hernadi, of protecting its
Hungarian subsidiaries and abusing its monopolistic position in
Croatia.”” As a result, in May 2010 Mr Jezié decided to take official
control of [4Co] nanagement in order to solve these issues.’8

In July 2010, the pressure between INA and [4Co] seemed to ease and
the two companies found an agreement regarding [4Co] debt. Under
this deal, INA would recover USD 14 million from [4Co] and the
remaining debt would be paid in several instalments.”? Despite this
agreement, [[4Co] ‘ailed to pay its debt to INA, and Mr Jezi¢ had to
intervene again. He tried to meet Mr Hernadi in Budapest in late
September 2010 but to no avail.

A few months later, Mr Jezié was arrested by USKOK because of his
apparent involvement in the HEP-[4Co] Case. INA tried again to obtain
payment from [4Co] in July 2011 while Mr Jezié was still in custody, and
INA kept up its attempt to collect until [4Co] bankruptcy proceedings
began in 2013.

ii. The Two Conversations with Dr Sanader in Late 2008 and
Early 2009

After his release from investigative detention in connection with the
HEP-[4Co] case, Mr JeZzié testified for the first time regarding the INA
case on 25 May 2011. He stated to Croatian prosecutors that Dr
Sanader asked him to secure a payment from MOL. This payment was
in fact, so he said, a bribe promised by Mr Hernadi to the Prime Minister
so as to ensure INA’s change of control.

Mr Jezié explained that he had two conversations with Dr Sanader
regarding the alleged bribe in late 2008 and early 2009. Dr Sanader
allegedly asked Mr Jezi¢ to help him arrange for the payment of EUR
10 million from Mr Hernadi.

Mr Jezié professes to have apparently random recollections of what
happened between 2008 and 2009. For instance, he was able to give
great details about unrelated events such as the lunch at the Marcellino
restaurant, but he was completely incapable of remembering when or
where Dr Sanader mentioned the bribe to him for the first time.
Moreover, his alleged answer to Dr Sanader raises doubts. Despite the
absence of particulars as to amount, currency, provenance, and
destination of the money to be transferred, Mr Jezié did not ask Dr
Sanader anything further and promised that he would “see what can be
done” about it.8°In fact in his narrative he did nothing after that first

conversation and completely disregarded Dr Sanader’s request.

According to Mr Jezi¢, Dr Sanader raised this matter again a few weeks
or months later. Mr Jezié then spoke with Mr Hurlimann about the
potential payment.*' In particular, Mr Jezi¢ stated that his conversation
with Mr Hirlimann was about the cost of such a transaction for

shareholders of [1Co] 2 As a minority shareholder, he could not
take any decision without them.

No evidence in the record supports the allegation that such a
discussion between Mr Jezié and [1Co] 's other shareholders ever
took place. According to Croatia, this is because Mr Jezié never
intended to talk to the other shareholders about the transfer. Croatia
stated that it was a mistake in the transcript of Mr Jezi¢’s testimony.
When he said that he would consult his colleagues, he was actually
referring to one individual: Mr Hiirlimann.®3

After he received Mr Hirlimann’s views on this matter, Mr Jezi¢
allegedly gave Dr Sanader the “information containing the name, last
name and address of the person in Switzerland who was going to carry
out the business deal related to the payment of the fee. This was

iii. The Meeting at the Prime Minister’s Office on 26 May 2009

It is important to recall that the FASHA had been signed in January
2009. Mr Jezié asserted that on 26 May 2009 he saw Messrs Hernadi
and Petrovic after they had been into the Prime Minister's office. This
is consistent with the entry and exit logs for the Prime Minister's office,
and Mr Hernadi himself confirmed that he and Mr Petrovi¢ met the then
Prime Minister that day.® For the sake of clarity, the Tribunal sets out

Mr Jezi¢ explained that in his meeting he informed Dr Sanader that the
money had not come through yet. Dr Sanader’s alleged reaction was
to call Mr Petrovié on his mobile telephone and ask him to return to his
office with Mr Hernadi. Mr Jezié did not witness what happened when
both Mr Petrovié and Mr Hernadi came back to the Prime Minister's
office because Dr Sanader had allegedly asked him to leave the room.
However, Dr Sanader allegedly reported to Mr Jezi¢ that Mr Hernadi
confirmed that the payment would occur shortly and in two equal
instalments of EUR 5 million.

MOL provides another version of the meeting described by Mr Jezi¢.
Indeed, Dr Sanader, Mr Hernadi and Mr Petrovié themselves tell a
different story. They all said that the reason Dr Sanader called
Messrs Hernadi and Petrovi¢ back in his office was to discuss [4Co]
issues with INA. Considering Mr Jezi¢’s involvement in this situation,
Dr Sanader preferred to have this discussion without him. Hence he
asked him to wait in the Prime Minister's office while he talked to
Messrs Hernadi and Petrovic in the anteroom.

MOL observes that the 26 May 2009 meeting was not the only occasion
when Mr Jezié and Mr Hernadi went to the Prime Minister's office on
the same day. They were both at Dr Sanader’s office on 24 March
2009, i.e. two months after the FASHA and GMA were executed, and
yet the bribe was not allegedly discussed then.

It may certainly be said that Mr Jezi¢’s account of the rapid conclave in
the Prime Ministerial antechamber is contextually implausible. The
hour-long meeting involved the same three men (Dr Sanader, Mr
Hernadi, and Mr Petrovic) as the subsequent discussion of the after-
thought triggered by Mr Jezié (who arrived after the longer meeting and
was not privy to the chat in the antechamber). The cone of secrecy was
the same, indeed lesser when they were standing up in the outer office.
IfMr Jezic’s story were true, Dr Sanader was thus comfortable
reminding Mr Hernadi of the expected payment in the presence of Mr
Petrovi¢. Dr Sanader would not have forgotten his EUR 5M, and surely
his close friend Mr Jezié would have kept him aware that it had not
been paid. (In fact Mr Jezi¢ declared in his first pre-trial statement that
Dr Sanader had asked him several times prior to 26 May whether the
payment had been received.) It would have been pressing on his mind
as soon as Mr Hernadi came into his presence.

What was plausibly less pressing on his mind was Mr Jezi¢’s personal
problem with INA; what is thus also plausible is that Mr Jezi¢, coming
into Dr Sanader’s office immediately after Mssrs. Hernadi and
Petrovic’s departure, would have said “you didn’t forget my request, did
you Ivo?” to which Dr Sanader's likely response would be “/’m so sorry
— it slipped my mind; get them back right now and I'll say something to
them immediately’. And so the improvised meeting might have gone
this way:

Dr Sanader: “Once MOL/INA are restructured | hope this will

resolve my friend Robert's issue?”

Mr Hernadi: “
are defensible.”

 

I'll do what | can, as long as the commercial terms

But implausibity does not mean impossibility. The evidence is
contradictory, and before reaching conclusions the Tribunal feels it
imperative to consider other evidence in order to test the credibility of

each witness. In order to do so, the Tribunal must consider the

19 October 2009 meeting at the Marcellino restaurant.

iv. The 19 October 2009 Marcellino Restaurant Meeting

Mr Jezié explained that he met Dr Sanader at the Marcellino
Restaurant, apparently an establishment frequented by VIPs, for lunch
on 19 October 2009. During this lunch, he requested that Dr Sanader
help him regarding [4Co] relationship with INA and MOL. Mr Jezi¢
(and Dr Sanader) testified that he left the restaurant at around 3.00 pm
after having paid the bill.8° Shortly thereafter, Mr Hernadi joined Dr
Sanader in the restaurant.8” They discussed the situation of INA vis-a-
vis [4Co] but Dr Sanader failed to convince Mr Hernadi to help Mr Jezic¢.
The two men left the restaurant, and much later Mr Jezi¢ came back to
pay their bill (at 10.41 pm.).8&8

Dr Sanader’s and Mr Hernadi’s testimonies support Mr Jezi¢’s
evidence regarding this meeting.®° However, the videotape provided by
Croatia is to some extent contradictory. The video recording shows Dr
Sanader’s table on 19 October 2009 from 13:54 to 13:59. According to
Mr Jezi¢’s testimony and the receipt from the restaurant, the video
should display Mr Jezi¢ and Dr Sanader finishing their lunch. According
to them, Mr Hernadi did not join Dr Sanader in the restaurant before
15.00. And yet, the video shows Dr Sanader and Mr Hernadi seated at
a clean table at 13.54. It is common ground that the three gentlemen
are telling the truth about the comings and goings of the protagonists
in the restaurant that day; but the timing is a different matter. Thus,
MOL’s conclusion is that the video must have been altered “so that the

clip would ‘corroborate’ Jezi¢’s testimony that he met with Sanader and
Hernadi on 19 October 2009 at the Marcellino”.° MOL also
emphasises that the length of the video has probably been reduced as
well without any apparent reason. Having regard to all the evidence in
this case, including the expert testimony of Mr Quick who examined this
video carefully, the Tribunal has concluded that it would be wrong to
place great reliance on this video, especially as to date and time.

Even though it is agreed that none of the witnesses lied about the date,
time and venue of that meeting, it is possible that someone was
prepared to create evidence in order to support Mr Jezi¢’s testimony.

Mr Quick — MOL’s expert on the USKOK criminal investigation and the
investigation against Mr Hernadi in Hungary —is a former senior police
officer in England “specialised in the areas of countering corruption,
serious and organised crime and terrorism’.®' He gave evidence about
the very unsatisfactory nature of the video.9* MOL spent considerable
time questioning Mr Jezié about this meeting. Although the episode at
the Marcellino has no real significance with regard to the issues at
stake, the Parties devoted considerable time dissecting it because of,
or so the Tribunal assumes, its possible implications with respect to the
credibility of Mr Jezi¢é. USKOK relied on this luncheon episode to
contend that Mr Jezié was indeed telling the truth, while MOL maintains

that it rather shows Mr Jezi¢ to be an unreliable witness.

The Tribunal was struck by a line of questions put to Mr Jezi¢ by MOL
regarding the two receipts from the Marcellino restaurant. Counsel
asked Mr Jezié to explain the inconsistency between the meals
recorded on the receipts and the alleged number of participants to this
lunch with the result that he had struggled vainly to provide a

satisfactory explanation.° This detail is consistent with the conclusion
that Mr Jezi¢’s testimony must be approached with the utmost caution.

v. The Trip to Milan and Ziirich in October 2009

On 20 October 2009, Dr Sanader and Mr Jezi¢é went to Milan in a
private aeroplane provided by [4Co] to see a football match. Mr Jezié
allegedly took this opportunity to tell Dr Sanader that he no longer
wanted to help him with the transfer of the money from MOL. Mr Jezié
had apparently read articles in the Croatian press and realised (so he
suggested) that he had been unwittingly involved in a bribe.

As aresult, Dr Sanader allegedly asked Mr Jezié to use the plane to go
from Milan to Zurich where [N] Dr Sanader’s brother, would help
him with the second payment of EUR 5 million. Dr Sanader, Mr Jezi¢
and [N] all met in a hotel and allegedly discussed [N] possible
role in the bribe. The Tribunal sees no need to await its ultimate
assessment of the case to observe that it is difficult to understand why
Mr Jezié agreed to accompany Dr Sanader to meet with his brother to
discuss the transfer of the money — something he had just told Dr
Sanader that he did not want to have anything to do with it. It is at least
as strange in these circumstances that Dr Sanader, who impressed the
Tribunal as the very opposite of naive or slow-witted, would have
allowed Mr Jezié to come along and thus for no reason become privy
to dangerous secrets. In Mr Jezi¢’s account, the two men never talked
about the bribe again although Mr Jezi¢é was still in possession of the
first instalment.

At this point, it is worth repeating and emphasizing that to this day, Mr
Jezié still remains in possession of the alleged bribe money and that Dr
Sanader had never tried to secure the payment of this money into his

account between these trips in October 2009 and his arrest in
December 2010. MOL’s position is that Mr Jezi¢’s inconsistency in this
regard can only be explained by the fact that his testimony is untruthful,
and that USKOK provided him with information in order to help him

concoct this story to bring down Dr Sanader.

Considering the importance of the issues in dispute, the Tribunal needs
now to turn to the other evidence provided by Croatia in alleged support
of Mr Jezi¢’s testimony.

(b) Other Relevant Evidence in Purported Support of Mr Jezic’s
Story

Mr Jezié’s allegations, if accepted, could have very serious
consequences for both INA and MOL. MOL obviously disputes Mr
Jezi¢’s testimony and questions his credibility. To the extent that Mr
Jezié’s testimony were found not to suffice in itself to prove that Dr
Sanader accepted a bribe from Mr Hernadi, the Tribunal needs to
assess whether other evidence in the record adequately supports the
bribe theory apart from Mr Jezi¢’s testimony.

i. The Consultancy Agreements Between [1Co] » [3Co]
and [2Co] and the Premium Payments

Croatia asserts that the two contracts signed by Mr Hirlimann on behalf
of [1Co] with [3Co] and[2Co] °° were actually made to cover
the payment of the bribe to Dr Sanader. Indeed, the fact that Mr
hal 87 and Mr [X] %8 both testified before the Hungarian State
Attorney that they never met Mr Jezi¢ ® raises the question as to why
they entered into these contracts. Moreover, Croatia established that

MOL and [3Co] _ had close financial links, °° which could make the

bribe theory plausible. MOL was [3Co] only source of revenue,
and Mr [ ] - was also one of
[3Co] owners (he owned 33% of the company when the alleged

bribe occured). Croatia asserts that the money needed to be laundered
so as to erase any connection between MOL and Dr Sanader. These
contracts between random companies were, so Croatia asserts, the
best vehicle to achieve this goal.

229. Croatia submitted a chart to the Tribunal so as to emphasise the close
links between these different entities. For the sake of clarity, the
Tribunal reproduces this chart below:“°"

101 Croatia has been able to provide the exact figures corresponding to [3Co]
ownership, and accordingly the chart required correction. At the time of the alleged
bribe, [3Co] was owned at 33,3% by [5Co] (controlled by Mr! —_!) and 66,7% by

also raise doubts. '°2 These payments occurred exactly one week after
the vote regarding INA’s management transfer to MOL. As far as
Croatia is concerned, these facts are not just mere coincidence.

Croatia moreover points out that one of the two Termination
Agreements prepared by Mr [X] recites that “according to our
Agreement dated 4! of June 2009 you had to use your contacts and
lobbying in the interest of our company, in our opinion it was partly
fulfilled, but after the partial payment of 2,400,00 EUR your activity
was stopped for a not understandable reason for us’.'°? Croatia’s
understanding of these terms is that the alleged performance of this
contract must have occurred “during the 13 days between 4 June (when
the contracts were signed) and 17 June (when the payment was
made)”.'% One significant event happened during these 13 days: on 10
June 2009, Croatia voted in favour of INA’s change of control at the
Shareholder’s Assembly.

At the end of the day, however, there is no evidence that any services
had been provided by [1Co] 5 and the payment remains
unexplained. It is true that MOL has not provided a fully convincing
explanation as to the purpose of these contracts. Still, the Tribunal
notes that none of these agreements directly involves MOL and the
money never reached Dr Sanader. The person who could have shed
light on these agreements, Mr HUrlimann, declined to assist the
Tribunal.

Croatia submits that it has succeeded in establishing a regular financial
flow from MOL to [3Co} Further it relies heavily on an answer Mr
Quick gave in cross-examination where he allegedly admitted that MOL

However an analysis of the background and context of these payments
between MOL and [3Co] do not permit such an inference from Mr

Quick’s answer.

Pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding signed in 1999 by MOL
and Yukos,'°° MOL has purchased vast quantities of gasoil for the last
17 years from Yukos. [3Co] was Yukos’ subsidiary and in 2001,
Yukos and MOL began to use [3Co] as an intermediary at the
insistence of Yukos. MOL thus signed its first agreement with [3Co]
(the “2001 [3Co] Agreement”) '°” dealing with, inter alia, “the
reactivation of the Eastern Product Pipeline”.'°8 This 2001 [3Co]
Agreement was the first of many more, as “MOL’s needs for gasoil grew
and changes in the market affected Hangarn’s ability to source and
deliver the quantities of gasoil at previously agreed upon prices”.'° It
is not disputed that these agreements were all negotiated by Mr
Horvath on behalf of MOL and Mr [x] on behalf of [3Co] (and
indirectly Yukos and then Lukoil).1° These dates make it crystal clear
that the contractual relationship between MOL and [3Co] _long pre-
dated the matters in dispute in this arbitration and was part of a pattern
of unrelated bona fide commercial transactions.

In the light of the above Croatia’s reliance on Mr Quick’s answer that
the sums came from MOL must be viewed in the context of the
substantial trading activities conducted between MOL and [3Co]
over a number of years. Accordingly the Tribunal does not consider that
the answer relied upon by Croatia assists Croatia in attempting to
establish the corrupt payment.

In his testimony to the Tribunal, Mr Horvath explained that, in 2007, Mr
[IX] asked for a substantial price increase of[ ] per ton

of gasoil. This request was mainly due to the growth of MOL’s needs

and the difficulties encountered by [3Co] in delivering such high
quantities of gasoil. As he put it:

‘[3Co] difficulties originated in part from a decrease in the

availability of Russian gasoil due to new transport routes, and in
part due to losses that [3Co] had suffered on account of large
scale thefts that occurred on the Ukrainian section of the
pipeline.”

For the sake of their commercial relationship, Mr Horvath agreed that
MOL would “pay [3Co] a performance premium for each metric ton
of gas it delivered to MOL during the quarter, if the deliveries met a
predetermined target set by MOL for the quarter’."'2

Mr Horvath explained that:

“[3Co] would have stopped the supply of gasoil to MOL
altogether. As MOL continued to need (even more) gasoil for its
diesel production and more flexibility in quarterly deliveries, as
well as to ensure that MOL’s gasoil orders were continued to be
fulfilled by [3Co] we suggested that instead of a fixed price
increase we introduce a performance premium that [(3Co}
would get only if it delivered the quantities of gasoil that MOL
would determine on a quarterly basis.”""

According to Mr Horvath, the premium payments achieved three
purposes. First, it was a financial incentive for [3Co] Second, it
ensured regular delivery of gasoil to MOL. And third, it gave MOL some
flexibility by allowing MOL to review the quantity ordered to [3Co] on
a quarterly basis.

The outcome of these negotiations was set out in Addendum No.1 to
the 2007 Agreement, which was then extended in 12 further addenda.
Mr Horvath testified that the disputed payments made by MOL to
[3Co] in 2009 related to Addendum No. 5.4 According to him,
between 1 April and 30 June 2009, MOL indeed met its target of
[ ] _ tons of gasoil as set out in the relevant addendum and thus,
MOL had no choice but to pay [3Co] premium.

However, Croatia asserts that there was no genuine rationale behind
Addendum 1 or any other Addendum signed thereafter; under the old
agreement, [3Co] had agreed to deliver [ ] tons per quarter
whereas under the new agreement, [3Co] _ undertook to deliver only
[ ] tons per quarter. This does not match Mr Horvath’s testimony

that MOL’s demand was continuously increasing.

Croatia further asserts that MOL paid these performance premiums
regardless of whether [3Co] _ fulfilled its contractual obligations. This
was, according to Croatia, because Addendum No. 1’s alleged purpose
was in fact to allow the payment of commissions to Mr{[ _] through
[5Co] so as to facilitate the implementation of MOL’s business in the
region. According to Croatia's own words, [3Co] __ was a slush fund
for MOL.

This allegation is said to be supported by two observations. First,
although MOL paid [3Co] delivery of gasoil in USD, the so-called
premium payments were all paid in Euros to a Cypriot bank account.
Second, between 2008 and 2009, MOL made extraordinary payments
to [3Co] despite its failure to deliver the target quantity of gasoil.
These Premium payments amounted to a total of approximately EUR
5.2 million. Croatia states that nearly half of this sum, namely
EUR 2.6 million, was then conveniently transferred to Mr Jezié from
[3Co] account. As far as Croatia is concerned, this cannot be a
simple coincidence.

FINAL AWARD

Croatia relies on this financial arrangement between MOL and [3Co]
to support its bribe allegations.

The Tribunal has considered the evidence of Mr Horvath very carefully
and concludes that Mr Horvath was an honest and reliable witness. He
explained with clarity how the relationship with [3Co] commenced
and continued. He explained the rationale behind the premium
payments issue. The Tribunal is satisfied that in exchange for the
premium payment MOL received the benefit indicated by Mr Horvath.
It is common ground that these premium payments were invoiced in
Euros and paid in Euros to [3Co] account. The Tribunal is sceptical
of Croatia’s depiction of the premium payments as a slush fund to be
used as a bribe because the premium payments commenced long
before the events of this case and thus lack the necessary connection
with the allegation made. But there is more reason to resist Croatia’s
contention: if the Tribunal was persuaded that the premium payments
were for nefarious purposes it seems incredible to conclude that Mr
Horvath would not have been complicit. Yet no dishonesty or complicity
was directly put to Mr Horvath. When the Tribunal raised with Counsel
for Croatia whether their theory involved Mr Horvath’s complicity, the
response was on more than one occasion unsatisfactory and
unacceptable. The Tribunal rejects any suggestion that Mr Horvath was
dishonest or in any way complicit. If the premium payments were in fact
a subterfuge to cover a bribe or some other nefarious activity, Mr
Horvath must have been a party to it. The Tribunal is not the least
convinced that this was so.

Furthermore, Croatia did not establish any link between Mr [Y]

and MOL or even Mr Hernadi, nor prove that the sum paid by [2Co]

to [1Co] came from MOL. Mr [X] controlled [2Co] __ in 2009,
but he shared ownership with Mr [Y] 115 At the very least, Croatia
was required to show that MOL was likely to be the source of the money
transferred from [2Co] to [1Co] Without this evidence, the

Tribunal can only conclude that the money came from Mr [Y]

and/or Mr [X] ‘assets. This begs the question as to why Messrs
[IX] and [Y] would have agreed to pay EUR 2.4 million out
of their own pocket for MOL. The simple fact that Mr [x] was
MOL’s paid consultant does not prove the origin of [2Co] sEUR 2.4
million.

Mr [Y] testified that he had only heard of Mr Jezi¢, Mr Hirlimann
and Dr Sanader. When he was questioned in Budapest by the Central
Investigation Bureau of the Attorney General’s Office, he stated as

follows:

“I have heard about Ivo Sanader, as a former prime minister in
Croatia, but | do not know him and we have never got anything
common. | do not know him, just like Huirlimann or Jezi¢, and | do
not want to seem as offending them, but they are not at the level
to get into personal contact with me”."®

At the time of the alleged bribe, Mr [Y] owned 66,7% of [3Co]
through his company, [6Co] and 50% of [2Co]__."” Why would he
take the risk of helping MOL bribe Dr Sanader through a Swiss
Company, which was owned by Mr Jezié and some unknown
shareholders? What would have been his motive? Or was he
completely unaware of this matter? These questions are still
unanswered.

Before concluding the analysis of this first category of evidence, the
Tribunal underscores its perception of a serious overriding difficulty
with the proposition Croatia advances to the effect that Mr Hernardi,
having resolved to bribe Dr Sanader, entrusted Mr Jezi¢ with the
organization of the illicit transaction, controlling it from beginning to end
and using an unknown agent or agents (who in fact turned out to be Mr
Hirlimann). The implausibility of this contention — which requires that

one believe that the CEO of a major corporation would have exposed
himself forever to the potential blackmail by Mr Jezi¢ and to the latter's
unknown agents -- is augmented by the uncontested fact that the
relations betweenMr Jezi¢and MOL were conflictual (Mr
Jezi¢'s distressed company, [[4Co] was in substantial arrears to INA
and MOL was unwilling to allow supplies to continue).

Bribers tend to take the elementary precaution of organizing their
own mise en scene of fictitious transactions rather than running the risk
that it is effectuated in the clumsy and perilous manner depicted in Mr
Jezié’s narrative, in such ways that MOL had no way of ensuring that
the money would not stick in the hands of third parties beyond MOL’s
reach and never reach the intended recipient — which is precisely what
happened here.

According to Mr Jezié, his second discussion with Dr Sanader
regarding the large offshore payment (which he vaguely situated as
having taken place "sometime”in early 2009) revealed that the
payment was coming from MOL, and on account of unspecified
consulting services. No names of persons within MOL, or associated
with MOL, were mentioned. Yet on 26 May Dr Sanader agreed to call
back both Mr Hernadi and Mr Petrovic for the alleged purpose of asking
about the missing payment. So either:

- Dr Sanader, who could have made this inquiry directly of
Mr Hernadi while he was with him, unnecessarily revealed Mr
Hernadi’s implication to Mr Jezi¢. This is something which, ex
hypothesi, an intelligent and unscrupulous person would avoid.

or

- There had been intervening discussions when Dr Sanader

PCA Case. No. 2014-15
FINAL AWARD

gave Mr Jezié further details. This would contradict the latter's
testimony before this Tribunal.

Considering the very substantial international money transactions in
which MOL is involved as matter of routine, surely Mr Hernadi (if he
was guilty as charged) would have seen to it that the alleged bribe was
arranged via channels that were entirely outside the sensitive Croatian
context, and in any event not in the hands of Mr Jezi¢. Nor does it make
any sense that Dr Sanader, on the putative receiving end, would have
had any reason to entrust this matter to the latter, given any number of
safer and more plausible alternatives starting with the evident one of
his own expatriate brother.

Although the purpose of these agreements is unclear, it was incumbent
on Croatia to prove MOL’s role in this financial structure. The simple
fact that MOL’s top management was connected, through consultancy
and employment agreements, to the directors of the two offshore
companies allegedly involved in the bribe is not sufficient to establish
that MOL initiated the signature of these contracts, let alone that they
involved a payment to Dr Sanader. Other motives could explain the
signature of these agreements. MOL contended that these agreements
could have been related to the D-A project. The Tribunal will
revert to this argument below.

ii. The Negotiations of the FASHA, the GMA and the Share
Swap

The second category of evidence submitted by Croatia in support of Mr
Jezi¢’s testimony concerns the negotiations of the FASHA, the GMA,
and the share swap. Croatia seeks to establish that but for the bribe
and Dr Sanader’s strong pressure on the government, these
agreements would have never been concluded.

The thrust of Croatia’s contentions with regard to the alleged corruption
is that the agreements contemplated at the time of the bribe were

Case 1:17-cv-02339 Document 1-6 Filed 11/06/17 Page 82 of 196

PCA Case. No. 2014-15
FINAL AWARD

unbalanced in favor of MOL and detrimental to Croatia. The premise is
ambitious. It asks the Tribunal to conclude that the contemplated
bargain went beyond the pursuit of the expected self-interest of a
negotiating party and can only be explained as a degree of
overreaching that is possible if MOL had procured an illicit bargaining
advantage by corrupting a person of influence on the Croatian side. For
the reasons set out in the two following paragraphs, such contentions
must be approached with caution and discernment.

Yet the existence of a self-interested motive does not suffice as proof
of corruption. Successful negotiations should not automatically be
exposed to a presumption that the conclusion of an advantageous deal
is the fruit of underhanded dealings. While an egregious and
uncontestable disequilibrium may tip the scales, a lack of astuteness is
not proof of moral culpability, and all the less so when the bargain is
evaluated retrospectively.

This is part of a more general difficulty of proof by inference; the fact
that (A) is consistent with (B) does not prove (B). Just as the fact that
an alleged middleman is connected to shadowy cross-border financial
transactions does not prove that someone whom he has met, no matter
on how many occasions, is a principal in a corrupt transaction, so also
the fact that a transaction is said (or even proved) to be commercially
“unbalanced” does not prove fraud or corruption in the inducement.

a. Events Prior to the Start of the Negotiations

In 2003, by virtue of its agreement with Croatia, MOL acquired 25% +1
share of INA. The same year, Croatia sold 7% of INA’s share to the
Homeland War Veterans’ Fund and 7% to INA’s employees. Over the
next few years, MOL purchased these shares from the Veterans’ Fund

and INA’s employees, and became INA’s majority shareholder.

In 2008 MOL made a voluntary public offer to buy the Veterans’ Fund’s
shares. This offer was first rejected because the offered price was

allegedly too low. However, after a few months, the Fund — which was
then directed by [B] — gave up and sold its shares at the offered
price. The Tribunal will return later to the issue whether Dr Sanader
played any part in influencing this decision.

Later in 2008, MOL allegedly informed Mr [A] of its project to
purchase more of INA shares so as eventually to become its main
shareholder. In his testimony at the Sanader trial, Mr [A] reported
that he spoke with Dr Sanader about MOL’s agenda. According to Mr
[A] Dr Sanader did not react to this information and said only
that MOL’s plan could succeed.

b. Dr Sanader’s Role in the Negotiations

The Negotiations of the FASHA

In February 2008, the Government formed a Commission which was
charged with negotiating the amendments of the SHA and the
conditions of the share swap with MOL. The Commission, headed by
Mr [A] , held several meetings and had the mandate to to protect
Croatia’s strategic interests.

In his testimony at Dr Sanader’s trial, Mr [A] explained that Mr

[s] , who was a member of the Commission, was reluctant to
cooperate with him and even tried to jeopardise the Commission’s
work. He refused to attend the Commission’s meetings and always sent
one of his assistant ministers instead. The assistant would defend a
position during the meeting and then change sides afterwards. This
behaviour obviously put the Commission in a difficult position. Dr
Sanader was aware of this situation but encouraged Mr [A] to
pursue the negotiations. |B] also attended two meetings in
December 2008, where Mr Hernadi was also present.""8

FINAL AWARD

At some point, a meeting was held of the inner cabinet at the
Government premises. Dr Sanader, Mr [A] , Mr [Ss] and also

[B] attended this meeting along with other ministers. Dr Sanader
allegedly presented MOL’s request to revise the management's right
and obtain INA’s consolidated accounts, i.e. MOL’s project to acquire
control over INA. According to Mr [A] , Dr Sanader had already
an opinion on this proposal and made clear statements to the effect
that it should be accepted.

As far as Mr [A] was concerned, Dr Sanader’s position on this

matter was essential because it had a decisive influence on the other

members of the Commission:

“The way things worked, and other participants of such meetings talked
about it in the media, was that if the then Prime Minister would express
a certain position on a matter, the same would become binding. By
stating this, | am stating something that is not in my favour, however,
this is how it was, and | cannot remember a single meeting during which
a decision was delivered that would be contrary to such a position”."19

However, during his cross-examination before this Tribunal, Dr

Sanader made clear that his involvement remained at a high level:

“The Chairman — Who in your Government was responsible for
dealing with the amendment? Which minister had, as it were, the
carriage of that particular —

Dr Sanader — Mr Deputy Prime Minister Mr Polanéec.
(...)

The Chairman — So how much control did you have over that
particular process?

Dr Sanader - | was the Prime Minister and | was co-ordinating all
the ministries, and like in any other case with any other Prime
Minister | was the one to whom the ministers would report, next
to the Government and to the party bureau (...).

The Chairman — There has been a suggestion somewhere in the
evidence that everyone did what you told them to do, would you
like to comment on that?

Dr Sanader - Yes, | would really like to comment on that, Mr
President. This is complete nonsense. We are a Government, a
body that runs the state that governs the state. (...) | am aware
that such statements have been made. But people are trying to
blame the Prime Minister and shift the blame on me”.'2°

According to Dr Sanader, Mr [A] was the one in charge of leading
the negotiations:

“Dr Sanader —(...) What a Prime Minister minds is that whoever
conducts the negotiations, to report back to the Prime Minister
and his colleagues, and then the leadership will gauge whether
this is to the benefit of Croatia or not in political and other terms.
(...) This [the details of the deal discussed with MOL in June 2008]
was not the object of my interest. | have a Vice Prime Minister
who is in charge of that. | trust him fully, he is a man of integrity,

and he reports back to the party leadership and the Government
(..)".121

The Tribunal is in a difficult situation where, once again, it is
Dr Sanader’s word against someone else’s. The Tribunal could recount
in this Award the full process of the negotiations, based on Croatia's
pleadings. However, this would not assist the Tribunal in assessing

whether Dr Sanader did use his influence to make the government
execute the FASHA. It seems that Dr Sanader was a strong personality
with a firm hand on his Government's general policy, but the evidence
does not establish that he involved himself in the detailed negotiation.

The Negotiations of the GMA

On 9 September 2008, Mr [A] held a meeting at the Ministry of
Economy's office with MOL’s management. Mr Hernadi, Mr Branko
Radoevié (the then Chairman of Plinacro) attended that meeting, as
did several members of the Ministry of Economy and INA’s
representatives.

At this time, MOL was negotiating the amendment of the SHA and the
content of the GMA with the Croatian commission led by Mr [A]

In particular, MOL and Croatia were discussing the transfer of the gas
storage and gas trading activities to Croatia. Several subsidiaries of
INA were involved, such as Plinacro. One of them was to acquire PP
(‘gas storage” or “PP”) and/or PSP Okoli (“gas trading’ or “PSP”).

The Purchase of PP

INA was required to unbundle its gas storage business in order to
comply with the accession requirements set out by the European
Union. This was also contemplated in the Gas Market Act passed by
Croatia on 30 March 2007.17

As Croatia stated in its Statement of Claim, Plinacro “was identified as
a possible State-owned company to acquire PP and PSP”.'23 However,
Mr RadoSevié was against MOL-INA’s proposal as such. In his witness
statement, Mr RadoSevié highlighted that, at the end of 2008 and
despite Plinacro’s “very good business results’, the company was

unable to purchase PP and PSP without the Government's financial
support.’24

One of the key issues when negotiating the GMA was the price at which
PP would purchase gas from INA. The gas price could be calculated
using different formulae resulting in different prices. According to
Croatia, MOL and INA wanted to use the Russian formula, i.e. INA
would have sold its gas at the same price as Russia. On the other hand,
Mr Rado§Sevié found that the Russian formula resulted in “inflated gas
pricing”.'?° Therefore, the use of this formula would inevitably lead to
an increase of PP’s loss, because the company would never be allowed
to sell gas to Croatian people at a higher price than the purchase price.
Croatia stated moreover that Mr RadoSevi¢ favoured a gas market-
based pricing scheme. This methodology would have allowed both INA
and PP to adapt their prices taking into account the market and their
costs and risks.

During the 9 September 2008 meeting, Mr [A] as well as Mr
RadoSevié opposed MOL-INA’s proposal. In his testimony at the
Sanader trial, Mr RadoSevi¢ explained that Messrs [A] and
Hernadi left the meeting together for about 10 minutes. Mr RadoSevi¢
assumed that Mr Hernadi was trying to convince Mr [A] to
support MOL’s position. This attempt apparently failed because Mr
[A] decided to cut the meeting short. Thus, when Mr [A]

finally agreed to MOL’s proposal a few months later,'2° Mr Radogevié
was rather surprised.

After his change of mind, Mr [A] explained that Croatia’s control
over PP would allow it “to negotiate lower prices on the imported
Russian gas and keep prices down’.'2’ For him, and despite his
previous opposite position, the operation made economic sense for

Croatia on a long-term basis, but it required an immediate upfront

payment of at least USD 500 million from the Government.

As far as Croatia is concerned, Mr [A] ’s sudden change of heart
has no real explanation but for the bribe and thus Dr Sanader’s
influence. It is argued that this position supports Mr Jezi¢’s evidence.
Dr Sanader made a deal with Mr Hernadi during this period, his alleged
role was to facilitate the signature of the GMA; Mr [A] , who was
Dr Sanader’s avatar at the negotiation table, simply executed the Prime
Minister's orders.

In late 2008, Mr [A] provided Dr Sanader, Mr [S] and Ms
[M] with draft agreements. Dr Sanader wanted
to execute these documents quickly but [IM] thought

that a further meeting was needed in order to overcome Mr __[S]
concerns. Dr Sanader believed that the delay in the signature of the
agreement was mainly due to the discord between Mr ~ [Ss] and Mr
[A] . Thus, he asked [B] to attend the next meeting to help
them settle the remaining issues. [B] succeeded and the GMA
was signed on 31 January 2009.18

After his resignation, Dr Sanader stayed involved and held a meeting
upon [B] ’s request sometime during the summer of 2009. Mr
Hernadi, Mr [S]_ and Mr [A] attended this meeting. Dr Sanader

briefly introduced the matter to be discussed, namely the purchase of
PP by Croatia, and then left. According to Mr [A] ’s testimony, Mr

[Ss] and Mr Hernadi found some grounds of agreement during the
meeting. Several other meetings were held between Mr Hernadi, Mr
[A] andMr_ [s]_ [B] attended some of them.

Despite Mr [A] ’s and Mr Hernadi’s active support, no agreement
was reached regarding PP and Croatia never purchased it.

The Purchase of PSP

The discussions between MOL and Croatia regarding the spin-off of
PSP had been on going for a long time. Although the negotiations
started in 2008, in 2006 INA’s IPO prospectus - issued by the
Supervisory Board — already mentioned that PSP was going to be
detached from INA. Several meetings were then held in order to
discuss the conditions of the purchase of PSP by Croatia. MOL’s goal
was to reach an agreement before the end of 2008 so as to improve
INA’s financial results.

On 24 December 2008, INA’s representatives negotiated the draft
agreement regarding the acquisition of PSP with Mr RadoSevi¢ and
representatives from the Government. Mr RadoSevi¢ explained in his
statement that the draft agreement proposed by MOL and INA was
incomplete in that the purchase price of PSP was missing.129 It also
included a damages clause, which was not acceptable to Mr
Radogevié.

A few days later, on 28 December 2008, another meeting was held with
Messrs Markotié and Petrovié of INA. Croatia stated that both of them
applied heavy pressure — supposedly on behalf of Dr Sanader — on Mr
RadoSevié. Mr RadoSevicé was still reluctant to enter into the agreement
and he closed the meeting without signing anything. 1°

Croatia emphasized that it would not have been necessary to use
illegitimate pressure to force Mr RadoSevicé to enter into the GMA if the
agreement was favourable to Croatia and Plinacro. In fact, the GMA’s
alleged main effect was to shift “all of INA’s losses in the gas business
and placed them 100% with Croatia, rather than spreading the losses
between MOL and Croatia as INA’s shareholders”."3"

Ultimately, Dr Sanader allegedly pushed Mr Rado§Sevic¢ into entering
into the agreement, and it is alleged that he suggested that Mr
Rado§gevié should “withdraw if he were not ‘capable’ of carrying out the
conclusion of the agreement’. '%2 It is submitted that Dr
Sanader’s alleged role in ensuring the signature and implementation of
the GMA corroborates Mr Jezi¢’s story. For Croatia, the only reason
explaining the Government's support for this agreement was the bribe.

On 29 December 2008, in a final attempt to find an agreement on the
purchase price, another meeting was held at the Ministry of Economy.
Mr RadoSevié reported that Mr [A] was called away for a phone
call with Dr Sanader. When he returned to the meeting room,
Mr [A] said that Dr Sanader had decided that: “ihe agreement
between Plinacro and INA should be concluded, even if the price and
method of payment were not specified”. 159

Despite the external pressure, the negotiations were still pending on 31
December 2008. Mr RadoSevicé received further instructions stating that
the agreement must be signed by 31 January 2009. On 30 January
2009, he finally capitulated and signed the agreement subject to
Croatia’s financial support. Plinacro agreed to purchase PSP for 514
million Kuna."4

The FASHA was also signed on 30 January 2009. Significantly, this
was 5 months before the alleged bribe was paid.

Tribunal’s perception, this episode is a good example of how things
worked under the then Prime Minister's leadership.

In her testimony to USKOK, Ms Spevec — the Chair of Croatia’s Agency
between 2003 and 201319 — explained that on 9 April 2009 the Agency
received complete notification of the transaction from MOL. The role of
the Agency was to assess whether this it was a concentration under
Croatian law and, if so, whether it complied with the Croatian
Competition Act. Specifically,, the Agency needed to ensure that this
change of control would not have a negative effect on the Croatian
market.

The Agency was required to issue its decision within a 30-day deadline
from the date of receipt of the notification from MOL. During this time,
the “competitors and all other interested natural persons and legal
entities” were publicly invited to provide their opinion regarding the
change of control.136 The Agency did not receive any external opinion.

Ms Spevec explained that Deputy Prime Minister Mr [A] 137
contacted her sometimes between February and April 2009 to inquire
about the purpose of the Agency’s proceedings. Dr Sanader also
contacted her and highlighted that this deal was “about getting the gas
business up on its feet’, and that it was of a “strategic interest’ for
Croatia."38 Contrary to the assertion that Dr Sanader had full control
over the entire process, after the Prime Minister's call, the Agency did
not stop its scrutiny nor did it issue a fully positive opinion regarding the
take over. In fact, Ms Spevec decided to issue a report providing a
“legal and economic analysis of the concentration”.'°° The report also
pointed out that some remedial alterations were needed to “reduce the

negative effects of the concentration on the Croatian Market’. The
Agency sent this report to both Dr Sanader and Mr [A]

After the Agency had rendered its decision approving INA’s change of
control subject to certain conditions, Dr Sanader contacted Ms Spevec
and questioned the Agency's decision. Ms Spevec tried to explain the
rationale behind it, but Dr Sanader stopped the conversation and
demanded that she come to his office for a meeting.14°

Dr Sanader did not attend this meeting, but Mr [A] , Mr Bacs, and
a representative from MOL were all there. They were particularly
worried about the delay caused by the Agency's decision, but also by
the fact that, due to this decision, INA would be forced to supply gas
under the same conditions as those applicable to PP. The meeting was
tense but Ms Spevec stood her ground and affirmed that the Agency's
decision was final. At the end of the discussion, Mr [A] briefly met
with Dr Sanader in camera. Dr Sanader then came to see Ms Spevec

and apologised for his previous behaviour.

After this meeting, Ms Spevec stayed in regular contact with MOL and
the commissioners without any further argument. She said:

“Also, | must note that after the resignation of Prime Minister Sanader
and the arrival of Aldott as the Chairman of INA’s Management Board,
MOL’s attitude toward the Agency has changed significantly and has
become more cooperative in relation to the implementation of

measures regarding the sale of Crobenz”.""

This episode shows two things. First, Mr [A] played a key role in
the negotiations, and even though he did report his actions to the Prime
Minister, it was Mr [A] who was in charge of this issue. Second,
the final decision regarding INA’s change of control did not only depend
on Dr Sanader’s influence, or even on the Government's approval.

Other independent governmental entities were involved, and despite
the fact that Dr Sanader was in favour of the operation, the Agency
followed its usual procedure and rendered an independent opinion on
this matter.

It follows that the Tribunal cannot conclude that Dr Sanader’s influence
was decisive. Moreover, and most importantly, the [B] | Government
unanimously approved the take over after Dr Sanader’s resignation.
This obviously puts into question why MOL would have paid Dr
Sanader EUR 10 million without having the firm assurance that the
change of control would succeed.

This question remains unanswered by Croatia. The Tribunal will now
look at MOL’s response and assess whether on the balance of
probabilities Croatia’s case is persuasive.

MOL’s Response to Croatia’s Case on Bribery

MOL defence is based on two assertions. First, MOL contends that Mr
Jezié was an unreliable witness whose evidence should be given no,
or at the very most scant, weight. Second, MOL submits that the
contracts involving [1Co] , [3Co] and [2Co] _ had a legitimate
purpose, i.e. the lobbying in support of the D-A project.

(a) Mr Jezié’s Lack of Credibility

i. Mr Jezié’s Personal Interest in Blaming Dr Sanader

Mr Jezi¢’s testimony is the only direct evidence that allows Croatia to
contend that Mr Hernadi arranged for the payment of EUR 10 million to
Dr Sanader in exchange for the signature of the FASHA and GMA.
Indeed, Mr Jezié is the putative essential link between MOL and Dr
Sanader. Without his testimony, the money trail gets nowhere near to
Dr Sanader. For this reason, MOL spent much time questioning Mr
Jezi¢’s credibility.

FINAL AWARD

Mr Jezié gave several statements to USKOK and to this Tribunal.
USKOK based its entire investigation on Mr Jezi¢’s testimony to such
extent that MOL now questions the neutrality and impartiality of the
Croatian investigation bureau. MOL strongly relies on the fact that Mr
Jezi¢é has never returned the alleged bribe money to support the
inference that Mr Jezi¢ made a deal with USKOK in exchange for his
testimony against the Prime Minister. MOL’s first argument is that Mr
Jezié has not been charged in the INA-MOL case despite admitting
having participated in a bribe.

Yet he has been indicted by Croatia in the HEP-[4Co] case. If there had
been a deal between Mr Jezié and Croatia, one might wonder why he
is still facing those proceedings. On the other hand, that case has not
progressed for some time. Moreover, Mr Jezié was released and
authorized to leave the country before he gave his testimony to
USKOK. If USKOK had agreed to release Mr Jezié in exchange for his
testimony, he would have certainly been released after and not before
he testified.142

Croatia also emphasises the fact that the money is not actually held by
Mr Jezié but by [[4Co] \s a matter of fact, no judgement nor any other
adverse decision has ever been rendered against [4Co] in Croatia with
regard to this matter."43 [4Co] bank account is located in Switzerland,
which makes the proceedings to recover the money more difficult.
Croatia did request judicial assistance in Switzerland, but to no avail so
far.

At this stage, it is worth going back to the chronology of events. Croatia
asserts that USKOK had not started to investigate the FASHA and
GMA when Mr Jezié was in prison. Hence, nobody could have
whispered the bribe story to him. The chronology, however, suggests

otherwise.

PCA Case. No. 2014-15
FINAL AWARD

The joint chronology submitted at the request of the Tribunal reveals
that USKOK requested the Hungarian authorities to interview
Mr Hernadi regarding the FASHA and GMA on 27 October 2010.14
Mr Jezi¢ was arrested on 9 December 2010. Then, on 7 March 2011,

USKOK requested the entry and exit logs into the Prime Minister's

office for Mr Jezié This was more than a month before Mr

Jezié’s release.’*° It was only 5 days after Mr Jezié’s release, namely
on 26 April 2011, that USKOK requested the entry and exit logs into
the Prime Minister's office for Mr Hernadi.'*° Croatia claims now that
these two requests were related to the Podravka investigation, but it
seems that USKOK was mainly focusing on investigating the FASHA
and GMA at that time. Moreover, MOL pointed out that neither
Dr Sanader nor Mr Jezi¢ was involved in the Podravka case. Thus, it is
unclear why USKOK would have requested the logs relating to Mr Jezié
in the context of this investigation. Consequently, it appears that the
documents that are now used to corroborate Mr Jezi¢’s testimony had
in fact been obtained by USKOK before he gave evidence.

ii. Mr Jezié’s Inconsistencies

Considering Mr Jezi¢’s conflict of interest in this case and the
chronology of events, the veracity of his evidence must be seriously in
doubt. This is further supported by the fact that Mr Jezi¢é changed his
testimony to USKOK several times. For instance, Mr Jezié said in his
second statement that the point of his 26 May 2009 meeting with
Dr Sanader was to give him an update regarding the payment of the
bribe. However, at the Sanader trial he changed this part of his
testimony and said that the only reason why he mentioned the payment
was because he saw Mr Hernadi in the building."4”

Events prior to the
26 May meeting

The 26 May 2009
meeting at
Dr Sanader’s office

 

- Mr Jezié: “Even prior to this
[26 May 2009] meeting at the
Government, Sanader would
ask me whether any deposits
had been made”'8°

- Mr Jezié encountered Mr
Hernadi and Mr Petrovic¢ in the
government building

- Then Mr Jezié allegedly

told Dr Sanader that the
“money has not arrived yet’
- Dr Sanader called Mr

Hernadi and Mr Petrovié back

to his office

During this second meeting

which lasted one or two
minutes, Mr Jezi¢ contended
that Dr Sanader told him that

Mr Hernadi explained:

- The money would be paid
in two instalments _ of

EUR 5 million

- The first payment would
occur soon and the second
payment would be made at the
end of 2009

 

- Mr Jezié then changed
his testimony: “Q. had you
ever before mentioned that
the money had not arrived
before May 26? A. No”'5!

- In his first testimony to
USKOK, Mr Jezié said that
he “met Zolt Hernadi and

- Mr Jezié did not contest
that USKOK might have

Did Mr Jezi¢ know
that the transaction
was for illegitimate

services?

- During Sanader’s
Mr Jezi¢ stated that:

trial,
“these
were consultancy agreements
based on which no services
were provided or business
activities performed; these
were fictitious agreements
which were concluded as a
form for the payment of funds
upon the request of the then
Prime Minister Ivo Sanader,
and which were supposed to

be paid to him by MOL”.187

Before this Tribunal, Mr
Jezié said the complete
opposite: “Q. Did you

consider that you were
bound by these contracts
against a value of

€10 million? A. In any case.
Yes, in all respects, yes. Q.

going to perform, either as

connections in the government to move their project forward. They also
knew that he owned land on Omi8alj through his several companies.
MOL’s pleadings stressed that this ownership was essential to Mr

308. In 2002, several countries including Russia and Croatia “executed the
Intergovernmental Agreement on Cooperation on Implementation of
the Project of Integration of the D-A Oil Pipelines“. MOL
admitted that the project “stalled in the mid-2000s, largely due to the
opposition of the Sanader Government on environmental grounds’, i.e.
the government issued a negative evaluation regarding the project and
this led to litigation in Croatia.1®

309. Whereas it is true that after a long break, the discussion between
Croatia and Russia regarding the D-A project resumed in
2009,"* there is no evidence that Messrs [x] and [Y] were
involved. In fact, the most recent evidence of Mr [X] * involvement
in the project leads back to early 2000 when he was working for Yukos,
and there is no indisputable evidence that he and Mr [Y] were
really in the process of implementing this project in 2009.1

310. According to Croatia, it was not necessary to lobby Croatia because
the blockage came from Russia.‘ In early June 2009, when the
agreements were signed with [1Co] , Croatia had already stated to
the press that it was willing to reconsider the project.'®”

On the other hand, Dr Sanader testified before this Tribunal that
Russia’s support was in fact much stronger. MOL therefore argues
that it made more sense to lobby Croatia whose support was still
uncertain. During his examination by the Tribunal, Dr Sanader

explained:

“While we were in the Opposition we were taking this project, and
| personally was very much against it and | will say openly why.
Not due to any economical reasons but due to political reasons,
Croatia wanted to become a NATO member, and at the moment
when we are fighting for our NATO membership in this western
alliance where we want to become a member, and where | think
that Croatia belongs to, it would really be counterproductive we
would enter into huge infrastructure programme with the
Russians.

So due to political reasons | was against this project. Then in 2006
and when | became the Prime Minister in 2003 | was against the
[D-A] 1 project.”1®8

MOL asks the Tribunal to find it possible that in 2009, Mr [x]
agreed that in exchange for Mr Jezi¢’s active lobbying, Mr [X]
would pay him EUR 10 million in two instalments of EUR 5 million. This
deal was set out in two contracts, one between [1Co] and[2Co] ,
and the other one between [1Co] and [3Co] Mr FLX]
admitted that neither of the contracts he signed with Mr Hurlimann
actually mentioned their real purpose. However, he explained that this
was because he wanted to maintain the confidentiality of the project.
He also insisted on the fact that he told Mr Hirlimann that the money
was not going to be used to bribe politicians."

After Dr Sanader’s resignation and considering the lack of efforts from
Mr Jezi¢, Mr [x] testified that he decided to terminate the
agreements in December 2009. For the same reasons, he refused to
pay the remaining EUR 5 million.1”°

The Tribunal notes that apart from Messrs Sanader’s, [X] * and
IY] statements and testimony to the Hungarian and Croatian
authorities, nothing else supports this narrative. However, the
Hungarian Attorney General, who reviewed all the evidence regarding
this case, concluded that the money paid by [2Co] —_ and [3Co] to
[1Co] was indeed to “support the initiative making the [D-A]

oil transmission pipeline a two-way facility, and the lobby
activities (which remained unsuccessful) aiming at expanding the
storage capacity for the said pipeline in the interest of the major
Russian investor holding actual business interests in the said-Cyprus
based companies”."”

It is not really necessary for the Tribunal to decide whether these
payments were in fact connected to the D-A project. The
Tribunal’s proper focus is on the issue whether Croatia has established
that the payments relied upon were corrupt payments as alleged. All
the Tribunal needs to say about the DA project is that it
cannot be ruled out as the reason for this payment.

Absence of Crucial Croatia’s Witnesses

Given that Croatia's case is that the FASHA and GMA were detrimental
to the interests of Croatia and that Dr Sanader was an overbearing
Prime Minister who cowed his senior colleagues into agreeing with him,
it is highly surprising — now that Dr Sanader has been comprehensively
disgraced — that none of them has come forward to support this case.
The Tribunal will consider some of them below.

He told the Sanader trial “! acted according to my own beliefs in the
negotiations on the amendments of the Shareholders Agreement and |
was not taking the easy way out by predicting what Sanader was
predicting; | believe the negotiation of the agreements were protecting
the interests of the Republic of Croatia’.

With regard to the Veterans’ Fund shares, Mr [A] told the
Sanader trial “that the Government did not have any influence over the
sale of shares of the Homeland War Veterans’ Fund; all the decisions
regarding the same were delivered by the Funds’ management board
upon a proposal of the company governing the Fund. The Government
was no obligated to discuss this matter’. He also told the trial court “The
War veterans, or rather those War veterans who had a stake in this
Fund, were requesting payments in cash for their stake and the Fund
was at a risk of becoming insolvent. Thus, the people who were
managing the Fund decided to sell the shares at a price of Kuna 2,800”.

Funds’ shares in INA to MOL, it is even more surprising that Ms [B]
was not called. It was reported in the press on 1 October 2008 “at the
Veterans Fund Board Meeting it was unanimously decided that the
whole packet of INA shares that the fund owned, be sold to MOL said
the Vice President of the Croatian Cabinet, [B] .. she
added that there was no political pressure for the Cabinet to sell all of
the 700,000 shares that the Veterans Fund owned ... the decision of
the sale was proposed by the fund manager, meaning the association
controlling the assets, explained [8] , and stressed the Croatian
Veterans Fund is operating well’.

He told the trial court “/ thought about everything and voted for the
decision. Therefore the decision was rendered on the basis of my
deliberations and of course there had been nobody, even the former
Prime Minister Sanader, who would have put pressure on me how to
vote.”

(U]

He told the trial court “As for the signed Agreement, | think that it was
a good Agreement, by which provisions the ROC protected its position
and kept certain rights regarding the ban to MOL to sell its shares for a
certain period of time, and the right of the ROC to repurchase MOL’s
shares”.

These are some of the witnesses that one would reasonably expect to
support Croatia’s main case, namely that Dr Sanader used his
influence to push through these agreements and that this informs the
bribery allegation. What these witnesses said in the Sanader trial
undermines Croatia’s case that Dr Sanader used his influence to make
the Government enter into the FASHA and the GMA. It is regrettable

that the Tribunal has not had the opportunity to hear directly from these
witnesses who were at the heart of the ratification process.

Conclusions on the Allegations of Bribery

As a preliminary point, the Tribunal wishes to emphasise that it
appreciates the importance of this case to the Parties. It also
appreciates that this case and all its component issues have
engendered considerable publicity in Croatia. Both sides hold
impassioned views as to what happened and why.

It is very important for all concerned Parties to appreciate the precise
role and function of this Tribunal. No Tribunal can ascertain the
absolute truth of the contested events in this case. What a Tribunal has
to do is to weigh up the evidence, which has been presented to it, in
accordance with applicable legal principles.

A party making an allegation has the onus of establishing the allegation.
It may fail to establish the events in question because the evidence
does not tip the scales in favour of proof. Such a finding does not
necessarily mean that the event in question did not occur —only that in
applying the applicable rules the evidence did not satisfy the Tribunal
that it could confidently conclude that the event did in fact occur.

The Tribunal makes this observation to underscore the nature of the
task facing the Tribunal and to ameliorate the disappointment that will
be experienced by the non-prevailing party.

Considering what has already been said relating to Mr Jezic, the
Tribunal is quite satisfied that no judge or tribunal seeing or reading Mr
Jezi¢é’s evidence would come to any other conclusion but that he was
a wholly unreliable witness. The Tribunal will set out below a list of
implausibilities in his version of events which trouble the Tribunal.
However, the Tribunal has borne in mind that even an untruthful and
unreliable witness occasionally gives accurate evidence. The Tribunal

acknowledges that both Mr Jezi¢ and Dr Sanader gave evidence about

events that occurred some years ago. The Tribunal is well aware of the

frailties of human recollection.
Implausibilities of the evidence of Mr Jezié

a) When Dr Sanader allegedly first mentioned the receipt of a large
amount of money, why did Mr Jezi¢ fail to ask for more details?
Why did he fail to make any enquiries and rather disregarded his
Prime Minister's request? How can Mr JeZié seriously say that he

did not take his own Prime Minister's request seriously?

Zz

Why would MOL agree to use Mr Jezié when it knew he was in
dispute with INA relating to the affairs of [4Co] Why would MOL,
an internationally active corporation with very large streams of
income and expenditures, expose itself to the risk of Mr Jezi¢
having knowledge of an illegal transaction which could rather
easily have been arranged using more distant intermediaries who
could arrange the matter for a fraction of the cost of 20% Mr Jezié

“thought” or “was informed” it would cost?

2

Why would Dr Sanader use Jezi¢é, a Croatian citizen, when he
knew that [4Co]and INA were in dispute? Why would someone in
his position expose himself to the permanent leverage that Mr

Jezié would have by dint of his knowledge of the secret?

2

Why would Dr Sanader discuss a bribe in the Government offices
with secretaries nearby, especially in the light of Mr Jezi¢’s
testimony that on occasions he and Dr Sanader would drive

around town alone discussing various matters?172

2

Why would he discuss the bribe in front of Mr Petrovic?

In light of the entry and exit logs to the Government building, Mr

Jezi¢’s version of events is simply incoherent.

Case 1:17-cv-02339 Document 1-6 Filed 11/06/17 Page 108 of 196

FINAL AWARD

Why would Dr Sanader permit the execution of the FASHA in

January 2009 before any funds had been transferred and before

discussion with Mr Jezi¢, which Mr Jezié now puts in March or
April 2009?

How could Mr Jezi¢é honestly say that when Dr Sanader
mentioned the Euro 10 million payment, it did not cross his mind
that something unlawful was being planned? It cannot be right
that Mr Jezié only tumbled onto the realisation that something was

wrong when he read the rumours in the papers.

Although Mr Jezié said that he mentioned the issue of a possible
20% fee this was never mentioned again and as far as the
Tribunal knows, no such fee was ever paid. Why was that?

Why would not Dr Sanader have asked Mr Jezié during the Milan

trip why he was no longer prepared to be involved?

If Mr Jezié told Dr Sanader that he wanted no more to do with this
payment, why would Dr Sanader include Mr Jezi¢ in his
discussion with his brother, [N] about alternative means of
receiving the money? Why give Mr Jezi¢é ahold on [N] _ as well?
In any event, how can it be explained why Dr Sanader would not
in any event have used|[N] who lives in Switzerland, in the
first place -- rather than Mr Jezié?

Mr Jezié has failed to repay the money to this day after having
given sworn testimony to the Zagreb County Court that: “/ will
transfer the money within thirty days on to (sic) the deposit
account of the Zagreb County Court’, Why?

m) Why has Mr Jezié not been charged? Why has his passport been

returned, and why has he been allowed to live undisturbed in
Switzerland?

The Tribunal has no choice but to conclude that Mr Jezi¢ is a witness
unworthy of belief, who had a strong motive to shift the blame onto
Dr Sanader. However, most unreliable witnesses sometimes tell the
truth and the Tribunal might have been able to accept Mr JeZzi¢’s
evidence had Croatia provided sufficient additional proof in support of
his testimony. The Tribunal has carefully analysed the other evidence
submitted by Croatia such as the bank statements showing years of
money transfers from MOL to [3Co] and the consultancy
agreements signed by [1Co] , [8Co] and [2Co] _. But none of
these documents traces back to Dr Sanader. Mr Jezi¢’s testimony
apart, nothing that has been presented to the Tribunal in this case over
the past two years has permitted a finding that, even on the balance of
probabilities, the money received by [1Co] from [3Co] and
[2Co] _ was ultimately intended for Dr Sanader rather than any other
purposes.

Croatia stated that “adverse inferences can be important element in
corruption-related cases where, as here, there is an unexplained
money trail leading back to the accused party’.'”5 The Tribunal agrees
that adverse inferences could have been drawn, had Croatia
demonstrated that there was a money trail connecting MOL to
Dr Sanader through several entities. In fact the money trail allegedly
established by Croatia is flawed by two missing links. First, Croatia
failed to prove that the source of the money received by[2Co] was
indeed MOL. Second, nothing in the record allows the Tribunal to
conclude that the money received by Mr Jezi¢ was actually a bribe to
Dr Sanader. Thus, the Tribunal does not even need to look at MOL’s
D-A defense to reject Croatia’s case on corruption.

Croatia has laid great emphasis on the argument that the FASHA was
detrimental to Croatia and can only be explained by the bribe. But this
is the fallacy that led the Constitutional Court to set aside the Zagreb
County Court finding. The Zagreb Court had placed too much

significance on this issue and had not properly analysed the evidence
relating to the alleged bribe. As the Constitutional Court put it:

“Any such transaction [procured through bribery] is [by definition]
contrary to the interests of the Republic of Croatia.’ The
Constitutional Court therefore held that it does not matter whether
a contract procured through a bribe ‘is favorable, less favorable,
unfavorable, extremely unfavorable, detrimental or neutral to the
Republic of Croatia, strategically or otherwise,” and the trial court

should not have analysed the issue.”174

Having considered most carefully all of Croatia’s evidence and
submissions on the bribery issue, which has been presented in a most
painstaking and comprehensive way, the Tribunal has come to the
confident conclusion that Croatia has failed to establish that MOL did
in fact bribe Dr Sanader. Accordingly, Croatia’s case that the FASHA
and GMA be rendered null and void due to the alleged bribery fails.

Is the FASHA Null and Void Under Croatian Corporate Law?

Croatia contends, in the alternative, that if the Tribunal were not to find
the FASHA to be null by virtue of the bribery, it should nevertheless be
declared null and void as a matter of Croatian corporate law.

INA’s corporate structure changed with the signature of the FASHA.
This new structure strengthened MOL’s influence — as a majority
shareholder — at three different levels. First, MOL now benefits from a
simple majority of 5 seats on the 9-seat Supervisory board. Second,
MOL has the right to nominate the President of the Management Board,
who has a tie-breaking vote. Third, the FASHA created a new body, the
Executive Board, composed of Executive Directors who are all
appointed by the Management Board.

According to the Claimant, these changes were only acceptable to
Croatia on the premise that the share swap between MOL and Croatia
would take place. Indeed, according to the Parties’ negotiations on the
so-called Bluebird project, MOL’s increase of power in INA should have
been balanced by Croatia taking 6,5% shares in MOL and, more
importantly, obtaining the right to appoint one member of MOL’s Board
of Directors.'7° Croatia contends that but for the share swap, MOL’s
deal was in effect a catch-22 for Croatia. Although Croatia still owned
44.85% shares, it lost control over INA. Croatia could have made the
share swap a condition precedent to the signature of the GMA, but it
did not. Ultimately, the share swap never happened, and yet Croatia
agreed to the GMA and even adopted the Russian formula as a basis
to calculate the gas price.1”°

Croatia’s position is that “clause 7.5 of the First Amendment is unlawful
also because it is not for the shareholders to decide upon the
delegation of the Management Boara’s authority’.""” The Tribunal is of
the opinion that the FASHA, as an agreement between shareholders,
to the extent that it purports to regulate the decision-making of the
Executive Directors and Executive Board, can only be implemented
through the vote of the Management Board members, which the Parties
to the FASHA were expected to procure. Shareholders agreements are
commonly used to regulate corporate governance when a company
has several substantial shareholders but decisions as to how corporate
governance will be implemented depend exclusively on the resolution
of competent corporate organs and not on the will of two shareholders
alone.

Croatia considers that the Shareholders Agreements are invalid
because pursuant to article 275 para 2 of the CCA “General assembly
shall decide upon issues relating to conducting the company business

affairs only if this is requested from it on the part of the company
management board”.‘”8 The Tribunal is of the opinion that this provision
of the CCA regulates the competence of the General Meeting and is
irrelevant to the FASHA’s validity. Croatia and MOL are not themselves
the general meeting, nor does that part of the FASHA relating to the
Management Board, Executive Directors and the Executive Board
contemplates acting through the General Meeting.

The simple fact that Croatia contends that it entered into a poor
agreement with MOL does not suffice to conclude that the FASHA
breaches Croatian law. The Tribunal needs to scrutinise the provisions
of the FASHA, and the way the Parties implemented them, in INA’s by-
laws, in order to determine whether they respected the letter of Croatian

law.

Croatia’s position is that the FASHA is “null ab initio because clause
7.5 provides for impermissible performance” under articles 270, 271
and 322 Croatian Obligations Act (“COA”).'79 The nullity of article 7.5
allegedly infects the entire agreement because it sets out the “decisive
motive for MOL to enter into the First Amendment’ .1°°

Article 7.5 —the content of which was suggested by Mr Hernadi—allows
MOL to increase its influence in INA. It is common ground that this
provision was crucial to MOL. Indeed, the members of the Management
Board are appointed by a simple majority vote of the Supervisory
Board. MOL has full control over the selection process with its 5
Supervisory Board’s members. In addition to this first circle of influence,
MOL also indirectly controls the Executive Board members who are all
nominated by the Management Board. This three-dimensional power
gives an undisputable advantage to MOL, which now has either a
majority or a casting vote in each decision-making body of INA.

Contemplating this result, Croatia firstly asserts that article 7.5 is
impermissible because it creates a corporate governance model that
breaches the mandatory provisions of Article 240 of the Croatian
Companies Act (the “CCA”);'81 second, it gives INA’s shareholders the
right to decide on certain matters that are outside of their prerogatives.

Article 7.5 of the FASHA reads as follows:

“7.5. Executive Directors and Executive Board

7.5.1. Executive Directors, including the Chief Executive Officer,
will be appointed by the Management Board and shall be
responsible for day-to-day operation of each business and

members shall not be Executive Directors at the same time.

7.5.2. The key selection criteria for the appointment of the
Executive Directors shall be the relevant business expertise and
knowledge. Their tasks and responsibilities will be regulated and
controlled by the Management Board.

7.5.3. Executive Directors shall form an Executive Board. The
Executive Board will be headed by the Chief Executive Officer.

Reserved Matters”.152

According to Croatia, article 7.5 of the FASHA has two pertinent
consequences. First, the Management Board members’ hands are tied
when it comes to INA’s daily management. Indeed, as per article 7.5,
the Executive Board’s members are now in charge of piloting the ship,
whereas, under the previous agreement, the Management Board used
to take the day-to-day business decisions.

Second, Croatia considers that article 7.5 introduces a hierarchy
among Managing Board’s members with additional powers given to the
President of the Management Board. This inequality of Management
Board members, so it contends, breaches Croatian corporate law.

The Tribunal will discuss these two claims below.

(a) Applicable Provisions and Jurisdiction of the Tribunal

Before going further with the analysis of the relevant provisions and
facts, it is essential to set out the applicable legal framework. The
Tribunal’s jurisdiction is entirely based on the relevant dispute
resolution clause of the FASHA and GMA. The corporate structure of
INA, on the other hand, rests upon other rules and agreements: INA’s
Articles of Association (Schedule 1 of the FASHA), the Rules of
Procedure of the Supervisory Board and Management Board
(respectively Schedule 2 and 3 of the FASHA) and the Rules of
Procedure of the Executive Board, issued by the Management
Board.'®’ The so-called LODO system which regulates, inter alia, the
relationship between MOL and its new subsidiary INA, is also relevant

to INA’s management structure as it allegedly “allowed MOL to
circumvent the Management Board” of INA."®4

As far as Croatian law is concerned, Croatia relies heavily on article
240 of the CCA and articles 270, 271 and 322 of the COA.

While the Tribunal has no doubt as to its jurisdiction over any dispute
related to or arising out of the FASHA and its attached schedules,
nothing seems to support the argument that disputes between the
Parties in relation to INA’s Executive Board’s Rules of Procedure or the
LODO system could be submitted to this Tribunal. The Executive
Board’s Rules of Procedure have been freely decided and issued by
the Management Board in accordance with article 7.5.4 of the FASHA
and article 11 para. 2 of the Articles of Association, just as any other
decision from the Management Board. Moreover, it appears that the
Management Board’s members unanimously voted in favour of the
Executive Board’s Rules of Procedure. It follows that Croatian
members have voted in favour of these Rules. On 10 June 2009, they
also voted in favour of the Management Board's Rules of Procedure.
Article 11 of which relates to the Executive Board. These latter Rules
of Procedure differ from the Management Board's Rules of Procedure
in Schedule 3 of the FASHA.

The content and the implementation of these Rules of Procedure and
the list of Decision-Making Authorisation for INA d.d. the so-called INA
LODO, are not related to the FASHA or GMA. If a dispute arises in
relation to the content or the implementation of these Rules, it should
be referred to the competent court in Croatia, as it is a matter of
corporate governance. The Tribunal cannot disregard the fact that the
Croatian Commercial Court may have exclusive jurisdiction over any
dispute arising out of these rules.

Finally, and maybe more importantly, neither MOL nor Croatia is
allowed to intervene in the Executive Board’s work. This prerogative is
assigned to the Management Board. Pursuant to article 274 para 1 of
the CCA, “unless otherwise provided by the law, shareholders shall
exercise their rights with respect to company matters through the
general meeting’. Thus, one can reasonably doubt that Croatia would,
in any event, have been allowed to submit such a claim before the
relevant state court, had no arbitration agreement been in place.

Considering the above, when ruling on this claim the Tribunal will
exclusively consider the provisions of the FASHA (including the three
Schedules) as well as the way the Parties to this arbitration
implemented them.

(b) MOL’s Alleged Right to Veto the Management Board’s
Decisions

After the FASHA was implemented, INA became one of MOL’s
subsidiaries-®° On 17 August 2009, the Management Board of INA
passed the List of Decision-Making Authorisation for INA d.d., i.e. the
so-called INA-LODO.'® The relationship between INA and MOL is
regulated by INA-LODO, inter alia, section 4, under the paragraph
called ‘Consultation’, sub-paragraph 4 of which reads as follows:

"When consultation must be required from the Management
Board of MOL Group or a competent director of the MOL Group,
the body or person requesting consultation must reach an
agreement with the Management Board of MOL Group or a
manager from MOL Group."

185 For definition of control see article 1.5 under b) of the FASHA, see also section 475
para 1 of CCA which states: “(1) a controlled company shall be legally independent
company over which another company (controlling company) is able to exert a
controlling influence, either direct or indirect’.

FINAL AWARD

Croatia argued that this provision granted a veto right to MOL’s
management (subject to certain limitations). Under Croatian corporate
law, such interference in a company’s decision-making process is
clearly limited pursuant to article 496 of the CCA, which reads as
follows:

"(1) Unless a control agreement has been concluded, the
controlling company shall not be allowed to exert its influence on
the controlled company by instructing it to perform
disadvantageous legal transactions or to perform other activities
at its own expense, unless the controlling company has
committed itself to compensate the damage caused to the
controlled company.

(2) If the damage is not compensated within the current financial
year, not later than at the end of the financial year in which the
damage to the controlled company was caused, it shall be
determined when and in what manner the said compensation
shall be effectuated. The priority right in settling the claims shall
be guaranteed to the controlled company."

However, Mr Aldott firmly rejected the assertion that MOL used its
influence on INA in the form of a formal veto right. Indeed, he testified
as follows:

"There would not, of course, be a formal veto right, for sure. (...)
Don't forget that at that time in 2009 there was a lot of internal
inefficiencies in the system, so the company needed to improve
the quality of decision-making. So therefore the idea was to
consult with people who had experience in that to get their value
added to the process. And that was the formal way to achieve
this."187

When Counsel asked Mr Aldott whether there was any procedure in
place in case MOL’s and INA’s managements could not reach an
agreement on certain issues, his answer was clear: "At that time | don't
think there was, yeah".188

Despite the uncertainty regarding MOL’s veto right, the Tribunal is of
the view that the INA-LODO was in line with Croatian corporate law.
Indeed, pursuant to article 496 of the CCA, MOL has the right to exert
its influence on the conduct of INA’s business. On the ground of article
496 para. 1 of the CCA, INA can refuse to perform disadvantageous
legal transactions or to perform other activities at its own expense
unless MOL has committed itself to compensate the damage caused
to INA. Croatian corporate law even foresees the consequences that
such influence could have on INA at para. 2 of article 496. Any dispute
concerning such issues would quintessentially be a matter for the
Croatian Court and not this Tribunal.

The latest version of the INA-LODO (as amended in 2014) supports the
assertion that MOL had a limited right to influence INA’s affairs. For
instance, pursuant to article 2.2. of the 2014 INA-LODO, INA's
management body must obtain a “prior opinion’ from MOL regarding
certain specified matters. However, INA's management (i) shall refuse
professional opinions or recommendations from MOL’s
managers/bodies, if they breach the applicable laws; (ii) may refuse or
revise professional opinions or recommendations from MOL’s
managers/bodies if they a) negatively affect INA’s business results, b)
could harm INA’s business processes or c) are not feasible. INA’s
interests are thus protected in full, which complies with the letter of the
CCA.

(c) The Limitation of the M Board’s Members’

Prerogatives

As a preliminary point, it is essential to emphasise that after the FASHA
entered into force, the Supervisory Board adopted its amended Rules
of Procedure on 10 June 2009, and on the same day, the Management
Board adopted its amended Rules of Procedure as well as the
Executive Board’s Rules of Procedure. Croatia’s Experts, Prof. Bareti¢
and Prof. Tepe’, 189 have spent considerable time describing INA’s
governance structure under these rules in their first Expert Report.
However, the Tribunal notes that INA’s corporate governance has been
amended several times since 2009. The rules now applicable to INA’s
governance structure are as follows:

- Articles of Association of INA dated 5 June 2013;1%°
- 2014 Management Board Rules of Procedure;

- 2011 Executive Board’s Rules or Procedure;

- 2014LODO.

The previous versions of these rules provide helpful contextual
background when assessing whether INA’s governance fully complies
with Croatian corporate law.

Under Article 240, 1) of the CCA,"9" the Management Board of a PLC
company is responsible for the day-to-day management of the
company. This prerogative is not transferable and must be exercised
with no limitation or control from the other organs of the company.

Considering this formal requirement, the Tribunal needs to ascertain
the exact scope of the Management Board's legal obligation. Does that
provision mean that the Management Board must take each and every

decision for INA apart from the decisions relating to the reserved
matters? This interpretation does not seem reasonable nor practicable.
Rather, Croatian law requires the Management Board to enable
efficient and adequate performance of the company by means of a
pertinent decision process. Thus, the Management Board is allowed to
empower certain tasks to middle and low-level management bodies, so
long as the implementation of these tasks remains under the
Management Board's control (Art. 7.5.2 of the FASHA).

Moreover, the structure of the company shall not deprive the
Management Board of its authority, which means that it must have
access to information regarding the company’s activity. Its substantive
role in the decision-making process cannot be denied.

This leads the Tribunal to look at the responsibilities that INA’s new
Executive Board assumed. Pursuant to article 7.5. of the FASHA, the
Executive Board works under the control of the Management Board.
This also results from the fact that (i) Executive Directors and the Chief
Executive Director are appointed by the Management Board (Art.
7.5.1.), (ii) the Management Board determines and controls the
Executive Board’s work (Art. 7.5.2.), and (iii) the Management Board
has issued the Rules of Procedure of the Executive Board (Art. 7.5.3.).

Croatia considers that article 7.5 undermines the Management Board’s
members’ right to access information and monitor the Executive
Board’s work because, as a matter of fact, only the President of the
Management Board is allowed to attend the Executive Board's
meetings:

"What the practice was is that the Management Board did not
operate and function in the way that the law lays down, meaning
it doesn't run the company. Most of that has been transferred to
the Executive Board, and the LODO-based system of running the
company, and the CEO's way of running the company, which

means that the overall situation ran counter to the Companies

However, there is a difference between the organ of a company and its
other corporate bodies. Article 173 para. 4 of the CCA states that
"unless explicitly excluded by this Law the Articles of Association may
regulate other matters besides those referred to in paragraph 3 of this
article". In other words, the CCA is silent regarding the Management
Board’s right to create working groups. The Tribunal agrees that, under
Croatian law, it is not possible to create new organs in addition to the
Management Board and the Supervisory Board. But nothing prevents
the Board from establishing an additional working group to assist in
managing the company.

Moreover, pursuant to article 11 para. 2 of the Articles of Association
of INA, "the Management Board may appoint committees together with
their Rules of Procedure, for the scope defined by the Management
Boara".'® This was supposed to be the role of the Executive Board.

Mr Aldott’s testimony reinforces this interpretation of the FASHA.
Indeed, Mr Aldott has been President of the Management Board of INA
since 2010. He gave evidence at the main hearing of his personal
understanding of article 7.5 of the FASHA and how it was implemented:

“I don't think there is voting on the Executive Board because, for
sure since | was there, it was not operating like that, it was more
collegial meeting when basically the executives will bring
materials, it would be discussed, some comments would be given
and they either decide to take the decision, to rework or to forward
it to the Management Board, or further even to the Supervisory
Board if the material is good. So there is no formal voting on that
because anyway now is not working as a body-or a board, or
something like that. You should consider it like a collegial meeting

of the senior management of the company, and my role there
basically is to channel according to the internal rules those
proposals which are going to the Management Board further to
that level".!%4

In fact, according to article 12 of the Rules of Procedure of the
Executive Board dated 10 June 2009 "the Executive Board passes
preliminary resolutions and opinions on issues delegated, in
accordance with Company's by-laws in effect. The resolutions or
opinions of the Executive Board are passed or rendered if simple
majority of the Executive Directors being present in person or by
telephone agree on such".'% |t is clear that the Executive Directors’
right to vote was strictly limited to issues empowered by the
Management Board in accordance with INA’s by-laws.

This interpretation is confirmed by the Executive Board’s Rules of
Procedure dated 13 October 2011, which now in article 12 para 1
expressly states that:

“Based on conducted discussion/advice in the Executive Board
meeting, Executive Director passes resolution and opinions on
issues delegated to him/her, in cases when the Executive Board
discussion/advice is required in accordance with internal acts of
INA d.d.”1%8

Further, article 9 para. 5 of the 2011 Rules of Procedure reads as
follows:

"In case where resolution or other act of the Management Board
is required, the Executive Director shall, after the discussion and
advice obtained in the Executive Board meeting, submit the

material to the Management Board through the President of the
Management Board’.'9"

Another provision criticised by Croatia’s Experts was article 9 para. 1
of the Rules of Procedure dated 10 June 2009.1%8 It reads as follows:

“Every Executive Director shall make proposals to the Executive
Board on matters within his/her sphere of competence and
responsibility highlighting where a solution or other act is required
by the by-laws including the decision-making rules of the
Company’.

Article 9 para. 5 and 6 further specified that:

"In case the Executive Board or the CEO does not support the
proposed resolution of the Executive Directors, such resolution
shall not be passed by the Executive Director, unless the proposal
is referred to and approved by the Management Board. Such
Referral can be made only by the President of Management
Board.

The Executive Board may also make proposals to the President
of the Management Board, who may submit such proposal to the
Management Board, where resolution or other act of
Management Board is required, or render resolutions in his or her
competence".

On a prima facie basis, these provisions might seem to contradict the
mandatory provisions of the CCA. However, the Parties subsequently
deleted these provisions from the 2011 Executive Board’s Rules of
Procedure. This deletion is certainly a sign that this article did not reflect
the Management Board’s real intent when the rules were adopted in
2009. The Tribunal is particularly minded to give more attention to the
way the rules were implemented rather than how the Management

Board drafted them some 7 years ago. The Tribunal has read and
heard the testimony of Mr Aldott as well as some members of the
Management Board, such as Mr Mayer and Mr Kre8i¢, and is not
persuaded by the assertion that the Executive Board controlled the
Management Board since the signature of the FASHA.

The Tribunal understands that at the time article 9 was in force, i.e.
before October 2011, if a resolution or an act from the Management
Board was required under the CCA, the Executive Board was required
to make proposals to the President of the Management Board, who had
to submit such proposals to the vote of the Management Board.
Pursuant to article 13 para 1 of the Rules of Procedure of the
Management Board "each member of the Management Board may
from time to time make proposals to the Management Board". On the
basis of this provision, every member of the Management Board may
submit proposals that were not submitted by the Executive Board
and/or the President of the Management Board to the vote of the
Management Board.

Mr Aldott also confirmed that “Executive Directors must report to the
Management Board as a collective body’'®8as opposed to individual
Management Board’s member. Also, whereas members of the
Management Board were not allowed to request documents and data
from the Executive Board, the Management Board, as a collective
body, had the right to request any kind of documents it found
pertinent.2°

The Executive Board was subordinated to and controlled by the
Management Board and —as INA’s second level management — it was
authorized to give binding directives from the Management Board. The
Tribunal is of the opinion that it is the responsibility of the Management

Board to decide which specific authorities will be delegated to the
Executive Directors in accordance with Croatian law. It is in line with
the Management Board's position, which according to article 7.5.2 of
the FASHA regulates and controls "tasks and responsibilities” of the
Executive Directors. Pursuant to article 7 para 3 of the Rules of
Procedure of the Executive Board dated 10 June 2009 "the Chief
Executive Officer shall take-over and directly handle all operational,
executive matters from President of the Management Board to the
extent such matters haven't been reserved by the Management Board
or the President of the Management Board.”

The Tribunal concludes from the above that the Executive Board’s
Rules of Procedure fully complied with the mandatory provisions of the
CCA.

The Parties have debated another issue related to the Executive
Board’s role in INA, namely the regularity of the Powers of Attorney
unanimously granted by INA’s Management Board to all Executive
Directors on 19 June 2009. 2"

These Powers of Attorney were granted pursuant to articles 55 and 56
of the CCA, which read as follows:

"COMMERCIAL POWER OF ATTORNEY
Definition of Commercial Power of Attorney

Article 19 para. 2 of INA's Articles of Association is in line with

Croatian corporate law and reads as follows:

"The members of the Management Board may, within their
authority to represent defined in Article 18, authorise one or
more persons for entering into particular types of agreements or

The Tribunal now needs to look at the wording of the Powers of
Attorney, in order to ascertain whether these documents are in
compliance with Croatian law. They read as follows:

"POWER OF ATTORNEY
Which authorizes,

For managing daily activities, job management, execution
of tasks and commitments as defined by by-laws of INA -
Industrija nafte d.d. and upon Management Board's order and for
signing decisions, contracts, Company's by-laws and submitting
of the same to public notary's verification, as well as undertaking

more Attorney-in-fact from this Power of Attorney.

An Attorney-in-fact is authorized to transfer his/her powers
from this Power of Attorney to another person.

This Power of Attorney is valid until its withdrawal."

By granting these Powers of Attorney to the Executive Directors, the
Management Board was not deprived of its authority to manage INA’s
business. The Power of Attorney only extends the Management
Board’s authority regarding INA’s daily business to the Executive
Directors. This extension is (1) limited to the prerogatives specified in
the Power of Attorney and (2) subject to the Management Board's right
to withdraw such Power.

According to Croatia "Croatian law indeed allows companies to issue
trade powers of attorney, but only to individuals, not to a group"?

Croatia further contends that "the powers of attorney granted to each
executive director always require co-signature of another executive
board member, which is typical for the joint acting of management
board members, and requires the executive directors to work as a body,
just like the management board" and that "the co-signatory
requirement and the powers of attorney to the executive directors,
together with the rules of procedure of the executive board, mean that
the delegated authority is exercised at the level of the executive board
rather than individually by the holders of the powers of attorney, and
this is not consistent with Croatian law".20©

The Tribunal does not share this opinion. The Powers of Attorney were
granted to the individually nominated persons (executive directors) and
not to a corporate body. Nothing prevents the Management Board from
indicating in the Powers how the empowered persons should act when
they represent the company. The Management Board is allowed to limit
the authority of attorneys-in-fact by requiring them to act jointly when
they represent the company. It is not unusual in the business practice.
This is also consistent with Croatian law.

The above supports the position that, according to INA’s by-laws, INA’s
Management Board, as a collective body, appears to have enjoyed the
right and the power to manage INA in compliance with Croatian law. In
any case, had the Management Board’s members considered that they
were unduly deprived of their right to manage INA, they could have
submitted their claim to the Commercial Court in Zagreb, but none of
them did.

(d) Management Board’s Members’ Right to Information and
Attendance at the Executive Board’s Meetings

Croatia alleges that the CCA requires each member of the
Management Board to have plenary capacity to assert a right to access
information and control the implementation of the Board’s
instructions.2 Therefore, the fact that, on a prima facie basis, the
Management Board is in charge of INA’s day-to-day management does
not necessarily mean that the FASHA fully complies with Croatian law.

Two issues have been debated at length by the Parties in their
pleadings: the Management Board’s members’ access to information
and their right to attend Executive Board’s meetings. These two issues
are connected and the Tribunal will discuss them jointly.

According to certain members of the Management Board, the fact that
they were not allowed to attend the Executive Board’s meetings
prevented them from properly exercising their role. Mr KreSi¢, for
instance, explained in his testimony that Croatian members of the
Management Board submitted a formal request to the Management
Board that members be allowed to attend the Executive Board's
meeting. This request was denied by the Management Board by the
means of Mr Aldott’s tie-breaking vote. Mr Aldott was questioned on
this issue at the main hearing and explained the following:

"There was two or three discussions to that matter. | think
immediately after they were nominated to the Management
Board. | think it was in February 2011. It was just in the
Management Board meeting discussed. They expressed that it
would be better or good if they would get a standing invitation to
the Executive Board meetings, on which there was a debate and
there were no consistent views on that. Some of us, we were on
the view that that would not be in line with the best operation of

the company under segregation of the duties among different
decision levels. And later on, | think in March probably, it went to
formal voting, because they made a formal proposal to that
extent. What the actual wording of that was that they wanted to
change the operation of that in a way that the Chief Executive
always must call them, all of them, all of the members of the
Management Board, to all of the meetings of the Executive Board;
and to that we — three of us — basically we said we don't agree
with that, we explained our opinions in the debate. At the end we
did not vote positively for that, so this proposal did not get the
majority required".

388. Mr Aldott also specified that the Management Board’s members were
generally welcome to attend Executive Board’s meeting if they wished
to do so:

“But there is no such kind of limitation as far as who can appear
and who cannot appear, but invitation only goes to the standard
people who are there. And | think the information, actually, on the
meeting, it is normally sent in email from, but it also uploaded into
the internal system of the company so that the Management
Board members could also see what has been discussed from

that meeting and so on. So that's how it operates".2°7

389. This testimony contradicts Mr Mayer's and Mr Vandeli¢’s recollection
of INA’s management structure under the FASHA:

"(...) When | came to the Management Board, | encountered an
illegal situation whereby a third body had executive powers, ran

the company (...)".2%

“In addition, in March 2011 we had a situation where people who
were sitting at the Management Board of INA were not allowed to
do their duty as they have been stopped of attending the meeting
of the executive directors body”.209

Regarding the right to access information, Mr Mayer further explained
that he could access documents, but had to go and sit in the office of a
subordinate, i.e. an executive director, to do so. This situation was
allegedly a way to discourage him from accessing information about
INA’s business:

"(...) That would encroach upon my dignity, and my subordinates
would be imposing limitations on me as instructed by Mr Aldott. |
saw that as something that would be disgraceful. This was not
professional and this was not based in law. | did not want to bring
myself into a situation where | would be part of some shenanigans
which are not proper (...)"*1°

This situation, he said, gave rise to suspicion among Management
Board’s members:

"(...) These data were historical data anyway; they do not pertain
to the present day, they refer to history. So non-delivery to us of
those pieces of information would imply that something is being

covered up, and | did not want to be part of that game (...)".

This issue apparently created a division between MOL’s and Croatia's
Management Board’s members to such extent that the latter stopped
trying to access information anymore. Indeed, Mr Mayer confirmed that
he never actually went to one of the Executive Directors’ office to review
documents:

"Il was told beforehand what the conditions would be, and |
assume they would not have been much different from what | was
told. | allow that there might have been some differences from
what I understood at the time, but yes, the truth is | don't know".2""

Despite the criticism from Croatian Management Board’s members, Mr
Aldott did not resile from his previous position that the Executive Board
was only a consultative body with no real decision-making power. He
also emphasised that “on a _ yearly basis, 300 to 500
proposals/decisions and so on come to the Management Board as
well’.2'2 He further stated that, apart from two cases, Executive
Directors were generally appointed jointly by all members of the
Management Board. This contradicts the position that MOL had a
stranglehold on the Executive Board.

The Tribunal is of the opinion that the Management Board's members
were not deprived of their right to access information pursuant to the
provision of article 240 para 1 and of the first sentence of para 2 of the
CCA, which means that all members of the Management Board were
equal. The principle that all members of the Management Board are
equal is also reflected in article 252 para 2 of the CCA, which provides
that members of the Management Board are jointly and severally liable
for damages caused to the company if they manage the company in
violation of the standard of care of a diligent and conscientious
businessman. It cannot be neutralised by any provision of the Rules of
Procedure. Although this was not expressly stated in the Rules of
Procedure, Management Board’s members had the right to attend
Executive Board’s meetings. The President also had the right to invite
them to attend pursuant to article 10 para. 1 of the Rules.?'9 In so far
as there is any difference in testimony the Tribunal prefers the evidence
of Mr Aldott on these issues.

The Tribunal is of the opinion that attendance of the Management
Board's members at Executive Board's meetings is not subject to
invitation of the Chief Executive Officer. They do not need permission
or invitation to execute their rights to attend any internal meeting in INA.
They are vested with this right on the ground of their position
designated by the CCA. They cannot be deprived of this right by a
decision of the Management Board that there will be no standing
invitation to the Management Board's members to attend any meeting
of the Executive Board.

Further, had the Management Board’s members considered that they
were deprived of their right to attend the Executive Board’s meetings,
they could have submitted their claim to the Commercial Court in
Zagreb. In fact, none of them did.

(e) The Role of the President of the Management Board

Croatian corporate law provides that notwithstanding the formal
equality among Management Board’s members, the President of the
Management Board has a special position.

Article 240 (2), CCA reads as follows:

"(2) If management board consists of several persons, members
of the board shall manage the business only jointly. The articles
of association may provide for a different method of management,
but they may not provide that, in case of different opinions among
members of the management board on a particular matter, final
decision may be made by a minority of members. If the voting
results in a tie and the articles of association do not provide for a
different way of settling the matter, the decisive vote shall be that
of the chairman of the board."

The President of the Management Board has a tie-breaking vote and,
in practice, he communicates with other bodies of the company on
behalf of the Management Board.

According to Croatia, the President of INA’s Management Board has
specific rights, which exceed the framework set out by Croatian law.

First, the President of the Management Board is explicitly allowed to
convene Supervisory Board meetings according to article 11 para. 1 of
the Supervisory Board’s Rules of Procedure. Article 11 para. 1 reads
as follows:

“Each member of the Supervisory Board, as well as the President
of the Management Board, can request that the president
convene a meeting, provided that the member states his reasons
and the purpose of it, such request can not be rejected. The
president shall procure that a meeting is held within 7 days after
the request for the convocation has been made.

(...)"

This, it is said, as a matter of Croatian law allegedly violates the
mandatory provisions of article 265 of the CCA, which provides that
"each member of (...) the Management Board (...) can request that the
president convene a meeting (...) the Management Board can convene
the meeting of the Supervisory Board (...)".

However, the Tribunal is of the opinion that article 265 para. 1 and 2 of
the CCA provides a strong protection of the Management Board’s
members’ right to request that the President of the Supervisory Board
convene Supervisory Board’s meetings. This mandatory provision
cannot be neutralised by the Rules of Procedure. Thus, article 11 does
not put Management Board’s members in an unequal position; all
members are provided with the same right under Croatian law. In and
of itself, the fact that article 11 refers specifically to the President of the
Management Board does not undermine the other members’ right to
request that the President of the Supervisory Board convene
Supervisory Board’s meeting. Only the Management Board and not its
President or its individual Members can convene the Supervisory
Board Meeting so all of them are in an equal position.

Pursuant to article 266 para 1 of the CCA, “ihe meetings of the
Supervisory Board shall not be attended by persons who are not its
members or members of the Management Board of the company’.

Second, Croatia emphasises that the President of the Management
Board is the only member explicitly allowed to attend the Executive
Board meetings. A meeting might even be postponed if the President
of the Management Board advises that he cannot attend.

Mr Mayer's testimony also supports the position that the President of
the Management Board has a specific position in this regard. Indeed,
he stated that the President of the Management Board and the Chief
Executive Officer were actually the decision makers.

The Tribunal’s analysis of this matter leads it to conclude that the
Management Board’s members had the opportunity to attend meetings
if they wished. At least, nothing in the Rules of Procedure of the
Management Board prevented them from attending, and the Rules are
not in contradiction with Croatian corporate law. There is no provision
in the article 11 of the Rules accepted on 10 June 2009 stating that the
President of the Management Board shall be always present in the
Executive Board meeting. The relevant part of Article 11 reads as
follows: “The Chief Executive Officer may invite to take part in the
formal Executive Board meetings the President of the Management
Board, other members of the Management Board or any other person”.
It is worth noting that the Parties to the FASHA did not make any
distinction between the importance of the participation of the President
and of the other members of the Management Board at the Executive
Board meetings. In the Rules of procedure of the Executive Board it is
stated that “the meeting can not be held in absence of the President of
the Management Board, in case he or she expressed its intention in
writing to participate in such meeting in advance, but the meeting shall
be postponed to the earliest practicable time.’14 These Rules are not

part of the FASHA and cannot have any influence on the validity of
article 7.5 of the FASHA. These Rules were unanimously accepted by
the Management Board's members and not by the Parties to the
FASHA.

This being said, the Tribunal cannot ignore that, as a matter of fact,
Management Board’s members were not encouraged to attend to say
the least. It is clear that INA’s Chief Executive Officer's and President
of the Management Board's exercise of their powers exceeded the
scope anticipated by Croatia when it entered into the FASHA.

(f) Conclusions

The provisions of Article 7.5 of the FASHA are not contrary to Croatian
corporate law. Pursuant to the CCA, the Parties were allowed to include
a provision in the FASHA regarding the creation of the Executive Board
as a working group, so long as it was understood that this body was
not a third corporate organ.

The Tribunal notes that the Executive Directors are indeed in charge of
the day-to-day business. However, after analysis of INA's relevant by-
laws, the Tribunal does not consider that the Management Board
yielded its responsibilities to the Executive Board. To the contrary, the
Management Board was entitled to— and expected to — control the work
of the Executive Board.

The Tribunal acknowledges that, as a matter of fact, the Management
Board — upon MOL’s initiative — delegated more duties to the Executive
Board than Croatia had expected. This created tensions between
Croatia and MOL and has exacerbated this dispute. However, this
issue relates to the Management Board’s decisions and, more
particularly, to the content and implementation of the Executive Board’s
Rules of Procedure. The Tribunal has already stated that its jurisdiction
is limited to the FASHA and its attached schedules. Thus, the Tribunal
cannot decide on whether the Executive Board’s Rules of Procedure

and the so-called LODO-system led to INA’s being in breach of
Croatian Corporate Law.

Croatia’s Claim Based on Breaches of the SHA

At the outset, it has to be noted that whereas this Tribunal is competent
to decide whether MOL is in breach of certain provisions of the SHA, it
is not for this Tribunal to comment generally on how MOL, as INA’s
controlling shareholder, has conducted INA’s business in general. Thus
it is important for the Tribunal to concentrate on the specific breaches
alleged and to note that the ‘best effort obligation’ is not an obligation
to achieve a specific result.

Croatia contends that MOL is in breach of some provisions of the 2003

Shareholders Agreement. Croatia's case is summarized as follows:

“As Croatia's strategic partner and shareholder of INA, MOL was
entrusted in assisting with the development and expansion of
INA’s business, including its crucial E&P segment, refining
operations and retail strategy by favouring its own interests over
its duties to INA, MOL failed to meet its contractual obligations
under the SHA and the Cooperation Agreement.”

Croatia contends that in entering into the SHA MOL accepted a
comprehensive set of obligations. Section 6.1 of the SHA defines INA’s

business as follows:

“The Parties agreed that the business of INA will be the
continuation and development of its activities in the spheres of
exploration for and production refining and wholesale and retail of
oil and gas and oil and gas products, as the case may be, and the
provision of on-shore and off-shore oil field related services
conducted in accordance with applicable law, the Articles of
Association, this Agreement, the Cooperation Agreement, the
Annual Budget and the Business Plan.”

Section 6.2 of the SHA provides that:

“The Parties shall cooperate in good faith and use their best
efforts to ensure that INA is able to carry on the business after
completion ...”

Section 9.2.16 of the SHA provides that MOL “will comply with the
terms of the Cooperation Agreement.”

Thus, it is alleged that a breach of the Cooperation Agreement is
considered a breach of Section 9.2.16 of the SHA.

The Cooperation Agreement was entered into on 17 July 2003 between
INA and MOL. Its preamble clarifies that its purpose is to set out matters
necessary for the achievement of INA’s strategic objectives:

“INA has certain strategic objectives, as set out in its Business Plan
which objectives are supported by the Strategic Investor.
Accordingly, the Parties wished to enter into this Agreement to set
out certain matters relating to the achievement of the strategic
objectives.”

Section 3.1 of the Co-operation Agreement replicated section 6.1 of the
SHA on INA’s business and confirmed that:

‘[t]he Parties agree that the business of INA will be the continuation
and development of its activities and the sphere of exploration for
and production, refining and wholesale and retail of oil and gas of oil
and gas products.”

Section 3.2 of the Co-operation Agreement contained the same good
faith obligation set out in Section 6.2 of the SHA.

Section 5.1 of the Co-operation Agreement contains a list of INA’s
strategic objectives. Sections 5.1.2 and 5.1.3 provide some of these
strategic objectives and read as follows:

“Become a dominant regional supplier of oil and oil refined products
and derivatives by enhancing its refining, wholesale and trading

operations and to maximize fully the comparative location and
advantages of both refineries through:

(a) further, modernization of Rijeka and Sisak Refineries to
enable them to produce products which conform to the European
Union quality standards for all white products

(b) maintain its market share and leading position in the
Croatian market and increase profitability and competitiveness of its

retail network ...”

Finally, Croatia relies upon clause 7.1.2 of the Co-operation Agreement
which provides that MOL will:

“Acting in good faith ... refrain from doing anything out side the
ordinary course of business which is intended to interfere with or
disrupt the business as defined in Section 3.1.” (which in turn, it is
alleged, mirrors Section 6.1 of the SHA).

Croatia contends that in addition to MOL’s general obligations of
continuing INA’s business, it had further specific obligations regarding

INA’s refinery operations in Rijeka and Sisak.

Section 9.2.14 of the SHA provide that MOL:

“Will not ... exercise its or their voting rights or take any other action
to:

(..)

(b) dispose of either the Rijeka refinery or the Sisak Refinery
(..).”

This obligation is further defined by Section 9.2.15 which provides that
MOL:

“Will procure that its nominated members of the Supervisory Board
and the Management Board will exercise their voting rights to

138

429.

FINAL AWARD

procure that INA maintains and develops each of the Rijeka Refinery
and the Sisak refinery in accordance with the Business Plan.”

It is Croatia’s positive case that these two provisions establish that
MOL’s obligation extends beyond simply voting not to dispose of these
refineries, but requires MOL to exercise its contractual rights so as to
ensure that these refineries are maintained and developed. Croatia
also relies upon Article 4(3) of the Croatian Energy Act, which provides
that oil refineries are amongst certain facilities that are of special
interest to the Republic of Croatia. Article 4 in turn provides that owners
of these facilities have an obligation to maintain, improve and
modernize such facilities in accordance with the provisions of the
Energy Strategy of the Republic of Croatia and the interests of the
Republic of Croatia described in applicable laws and regulations. It is
asserted that the Energy Strategy of the Republic of Croatia requires,
among other things, expedited modernization of oil refinery facilities.

This part of Croatia’s general claim is heavily dependent on the expert
testimony of Mr Anthony Way. MOL’s experts were Dr Pablo Spiller and
David Aron.

Mr Way made clear in his report that he “had been assisted in the
preparation of this report by the consulting firm of Oil and Gas
Consulting International LLP and its subsidiary, UK and Oil and Gas
Consulting d.o.0 Croatia, whom | engaged to assist me in the analysis
of Croatian data”.

However, Mr Way did not know that Oil and Gas Consultants were
frequently consulted by the Government of Croatia and that one of the
two directors of that company was a Mr Jasminko Umicevic, a former
manager of INA who had publically criticized MOL’s management of
INA. Therefore, insofar as Mr Way relied uncritically on information
provided to him by Oil and Gas Consultants, the Tribunal must treat
that evidence with caution. When an expert witness relies on
information provided by others, the expert has a duty to verify this

139

FINAL AWARD

information independently; it is unfair if the provider of the information
is not called to give evidence and the other party has no opportunity to
challenge the veracity of the statement relied upon.

An example of Mr Way failing to carry out independent due diligence is
reflected in the part of his report where he concluded that MOL’s
exports to Croatia have increased. In the course of his cross-
examination, he was asked for the basis of this assertion and he
replied: “No, it is only my own basis”. In fact, as can be seen from the
unchallenged Aron slide 19,21° MOL’s exports to Croatia have declined
during the period 2010 to 2014 as MOL’s other exports have increased,

The Tribunal considered most carefully the cross-examination of Mr
Way and concludes that his evidence was not persuasive. A few
instances are sufficient to support this conclusion.

Mr Way stated that: “The oil refining business of INA is still economic’,
but in so doing only referred to Rijeka and made no mention of Sisak.
This was pointed out, but Mr Way nevertheless did not provide a
specific analysis of whether modernization of Sisak was economical,
but instead assessed the combined effects of modernizing both Rijeka
and Sisak. Accordingly, he has never concluded one way or the other
whether the modernization of Sisak was economical.

Even taking the two refineries together, it is still not clear how Mr Way
could have reached the conclusion that the combined improvement of
the two refineries would be economical. Mr Way concluded that the
improvement would lead to a US $175+tonne enhancement of the
refining margin. His conclusion is not sufficiently substantiated, and the
same is true with respect to his projection that INA’s refining margin
would hold steady at this rate for the next twelve years.

Mr Way admitted that: “refinery margins change from year to year and
refineries get, unfortunately, rather cyclical on whether their products

are economic or not. And looking at the cycle of refinery margins is
somewhat tricky.” This statement, which seems fair, also seems
inconsistent with the idea that INA’s margins would hold steady for a
substantial period of time.

Mr Way also accepted that if his calculation were expressed in dollars
per barrel, a refinery margin for Rijeka and Sisak would equal 8.97
dollars bbl. Mr Way's projection, assuming a constant margin over a
twelve-year period, would exceed the peak for the margins of European
refineries in the report upon which he himself relied, which seems to
have been 8.5 dollars bbl.

Mr Way was shown evidence that indicated that INA itself did not
consider improvements to both Rijeka and Sisak to be economical. He
admitted that he had not engaged with such evidence in his reports. He
was asked whether the return on investment from the refinery
improvements he claims would have been sufficient to cover debt
repayments and increased return to shareholders, and then admitted
he had not looked at the question of return to shareholders.

Mr Way made clear that the proposition that refinery improvements
would be economical was based on two conditions. First, Croatia could
give INA a substantial subsidy through a cash injection or a foregoing
of dividends. However, he admitted that he did not know whether this
would be permissible under EU law. His other condition was that INA
could obtain a strategic partner who could provide advantageously
priced crude oil to bring refining margins up. This seems to have been
a matter of conjecture rather than expert evaluation.

Mr Way’s evidence that improvements should have been made is
inconsistent with the conclusion reached by INA’s own staff and
reflected in two presentations to INA’s management. A slide presented
to INA’s management dated October 2011 showed that: “investments
in Sisak Refinery do not bring the expected return, concentrating Rijeka

Refinery was the biggest value to shareholders.” 2'° Further in
November 2014 a presentation to INA’s Supervisory Board suggested
concentrating on Rijeka. On 17 December 2014, INA’s Management
Board after acknowledging the Report on CAPEX realisation for
January - November 2014 noted that concentrating on crude
processing in Rijeka was in the best commercial interests of INA.2"”

Furthermore, the INA Group Revised 2014 Plan and the 2015-2016
Outlook of 21 May 2014?'® stated:

"Refinery Sisak turned into a product depot/terminal, effective
2018. Rijeka processing 2014: business plan level, 2015-2017: at
least on a technical minimum capacity, from 2018: operation on a

maximum processing capacity."

INA's Supervisory Board gave prior approval to INA Group Revised
2014 Business Plan at the meeting held on 21 May 2014; two out of
three representatives of Croatia voted against.2'9 Though it cannot be
seen from the files that the INA Group revised plan was later accepted
by the Management Board, it demonstrates MOL's efforts to continue
with investments in the Rijeka refinery.

It is also worth pointing out that Mr Aron told the Tribunal that:
“Refineries have been closing all over Europe.” In 2014 there had been
a drop in refinery utilization: across Europe 85% in 2005 to 77% in
2014. These figures do not accord with Mr Way's expert testimony.

Another plank in Croatia's argument is that MOL’s alleged neglect with
respect to INA’s refineries is substantiated by considering the decline
in capital spend on INA’s refineries whilst at the same time looking at
increase in capital spent on other refineries under MOL’s control. In

short, Croatia relies upon the fact that INA’s downstream Capex has
decreased since 2009, whilst MOL’s downstream Capex has increased
since 2009.

Croatia relies heavily on certain answers given by Mr Aron on Day 5,
at Transcript page 230, lines 3 to 15, relating to INA’s and MOL’s
upstream and downstream Capex and their reserves. From these
answers they seek to draw the conclusion that MOL is somehow
treating itself more favourably than the way MOL is dealing with INA.
The Tribunal does not consider that the comparisons are necessarily
valid nor dispositive. They fail to recognize that different circumstances
face the two companies, nor do they establish a necessary causal link.
The financial and economic positions of the two companies were
markedly different and, thus, it is hard to argue that steps MOL took in
relation to its own development would actually have been appropriate
for INA. The two companies were operating in different markets and
had differing financial structures.

Croatia states boldly; “Capex investment in INA declined steadily since
MOL took control of INA in 2009”. However, MOL pointed out that 2009
is not necessarily the correct starting point as MOL became a strategic
investor in INA in 2003 and Capex in INA actually increased from that
time. Further, it is not without significance that before MOL took control,
INA had been planning for decreases in Capex. The Tribunal moreover
observes that INA’s ability to meet Capex’s requirements already
planned was assisted by inter-company loans from MOL.

INA had substantial loan facilities and banks were more concerned at
ensuring repayment than seeing INA spending more on Capex.220

Insofar as Croatia’s claim is based on a breach of a best endeavours
obligation, it is important to bear in mind that, absent other provisions,
that obligation is not the same as an obligation to achieve a stated

objective. Had that been the Parties’ agreement, it would have so
specified.

The Tribunal is satisfied on the evidence it has seen and heard that
INA, under MOL’s management, did make improvements to its
refineries, calculated to maximize INA’s returns. The reasons why INA
made some improvements to refineries, but declined to make others,
are explained by Mr Aldott who told this Tribunal in his second witness
statement:

“INA’s management is responsible to act in the best commercial
interest of INA, and not according to the wishes of one shareholder
to increase investments without any return expectations. And that is
what MOL’s delegates have done. Some goals that were defined in
2003 and could be pursued, were pursued. One example is the
hydrocracker investment in Rijeka refinery. Other goals (e.g. residue
upgrade in Rijeka), which made sense and still make sense under
certain conditions (e.g. fair and predictable taxation), were delayed
by lack of permits, but are now proceeding. But there are projects
that no longer make economic sense such as the development of oil
refining assets in Sisak, as external and internal experts have
repeatedly concluded.”

Mr Aron also established that even at the Sisak refinery there have
been improvements made such as isomerisation and new coke
chambers. Indeed, INA started a two-phase modernisation plan. Phase
1 was considered by Mr Aron as a ‘stay in business’ investment
required by the E.U. On the other hand, phase 2 was more
controversial:

“(...) The Supervisory Board was well aware of the great difficulty

in economically justifying any Phase 2 development at Sisak,

FINAL AWARD

although it had a dilemma in that closure of the refinery was
politically very difficult, if not impossible."221

There was also a debate between Mr Way and Mr Aron regarding the
pertinence of phase 2. Mr Way stated that the modernisation of the
Sisak refinery made economic sense, although he admitted that “the
delayed and incomplete implementation of modernisation plans
(Phases 1 and 2) has, it is true, resulted in INA reducing the amount of
oil it refines in order to cut losses”.?2? On the contrary, Mr Aron asserted
that Phase 2 carried major risks for INA and as a result did not make
economic sense. In Appendix A of his Second Expert Report?*? Mr Way
stated that investment for a coking unit in the Rijeka refinery would cost
US$ 650 million in order to increase the capacity to 4500 kt per annum.
The same kind of investment in the Sisak refinery would cost US$ 350
million in order to increase the capacity to 3090 kt per annum and would
permit "a positive (pre-tax) Net Present Value (NPV) US$ 13 million
discounted by a reasonable 10%." He added the hypothesis that
"Croatian Government assistance in the form of beneficial tax treatment
due to the projects strategic importance would increase the profitability
of the modernisation of INA's refineries". This led to the question as to
whether this governmental support would have been in compliance with
European law. Mr Aron asserted that a US$ 1 billion capital investment
in the project could have led to a positive return pre-tax NPV of only
US$ 13 million. As Mr Aron stated it was " a very risky investment given
the huge capital investment required and the very small return".224

Indeed, Mr Aron persuasively emphasised that “Mr Way fails to take
into account the value destroying impact that the Phase 2 investments
at Sisak would cause and the underlying problems of operating two
refineries in an over-supplied regional market.’225

Phase 2 of the modernisation of the refineries was suspended on
8 September 2009 by unanimous decision of all members of the INA's
Management Board. The Management Board concluded that, inter alia,
the phase 1 of the modernisation of INA’s refineries should be
completed. Also, the schedule for the implementation of phase 2 in
Rijeka should be modified in the light of the financial status and
financing capacity of INA. The overall plan for phase 2 of modernisation
of the refinery in Sisak was also to be reconsidered. 226 On 21
September 2009, INA's Supervisory Board unanimously gave consent
to INA's Management Board regarding the preparation of a detailed
study on possible rescheduling of phase 2 in Rijeka and Sisak. The
modernisation project was also to remain a top priority in case of a sale
of Prirodni plin d.o.o. by the end of September 2009.22”

On 29 November 2011 INA’s Management Board approved the 2011-
2015 Strategic Development Plan and decided:

"Further development of refinery system with an emphasis on
strengthening synergies. Investments into Rijeka refinery with
Special focus on residue conversion, investments into the Sisak
refinery with a view of ensuring 2 million tons/year available
technical capacity in the strategic period with special focus on
maintenance-type and HSE investments, and investments into
logistic system with special focus on pipeline connection between

Rijeka and Sisak refineries".228

This shows that in 2011, INA was still considering investing more in the
Sisak refinery. MOL intended to make substantial efforts to implement

this strategy. However, the circumstances and the needs for crude oil
products led to a change in this strategy.

According to MOL's delegate on INA’s Supervisory Board, Ferenc
Horvath, the modernisation of the refinery in Rijeka was still a top
priority for INA and MOL. This position was stated during the
Supervisory Board's meeting held on 10 May 2013.%29 Neither the SHA
nor the Cooperation Agreement obliged MOL to proceed with the
modernisation of the refineries. However, Mr Aldott stated that the
delay in the modernisation of the refinery in Rijeka was not due to a
lack of effort from MOL but rather to some difficulties to obtain permits.
Indeed, MOL alleged that "while the Environmental Impact Study (EIS)
was submitted to the Ministry in March 2009, the permit was not
received until December 2013".75° Croatia challenged this allegation.25"

However, Croatia did not support its position with actual evidence. To
the contrary, the Tribunal is of the view that MOL did make its best
efforts to modernise INA’s refineries as agreed in the SHA and in the
Cooperation Agreement.

Mr Aron’s analysis is supported by the Arthur Andersen report upon
which INA based its 1998-2007 strategic proposal. This report
acknowledged the “destroying value” of INA’s refineries.?9? As a result,
INA 1998-2007 strategic proposal went as far as proposing the closure
of Sisak refinery, but the Government rejected this option.

In the light of the above, the Tribunal rejects Croatia’s assertion that
MOL breached its obligations under the SHA when managing INA’s
refineries.

Croatia further contends that MOL has failed in its obligations to expand
exploration in the Region on behalf of INA and that INA failed to meet
the Strategic Objective laid out in the Co-operation Agreement
regarding exploration and production.2°° Croatia argues that capital
expenditures drastically declined from over 3 billion HRK in 2009 to
nearly 1.4 billion in 2013 and consequently, INA has been depleting its
own reserves at an alarming rate. According to Croatia, INA is currently
behind schedule in developing certain Croatian fields, has no
exploration licences due to inactivity and allowed two other licenses to
expire, further decreasing INA's upstream potential. The reserve
replacement ratio is a critical component to the life of an oil and gas
company and INA’s is extremely poor. Comparable companies to INA
have managed to have much healthier reserve replacement ratio. INA
used to be the only holder of exploration licenses in Croatia and this is
no longer the case.

MOL's position is that it has not failed in its obligation to expand
exploration in the Region on behalf of INA. It argues that Croatia's
upstream argument relies entirely on Clause 6.2 of the SHA, whereby
MOL and Croatia undertook to "co-operate in good faith and use their
best efforts to ensure that INA is able to carry on [its] Business" as
described in the Co-operation Agreement.2*4 The basic premise that
INA failed to meet its 70,000 BOED production objective is wrong. INA
met that objective in 2011, when it was under MOL's control. It was
projected to sustain that level of production for the next several years
but this was impacted by the loss of its Syria assets due to force
majeure.2%5 Oil production in Croatia has been in constant decline over

four decades-*°* It was Croatia's expectation that gas production would

decline and imports would increase.2°” In 2014, domestic production
even increased for the first time in several years.2°° INA under MOL's
control started implementing EOR projects, and these are expected to
yield production increases. *°° Three of INA's onshore exploration
licenses were revoked by the Ministry of Economy and then, even after
a court ordered the licenses restored, it revoked them again on the very
same grounds that the court had rejected.2*°Croatia's argument that
INA could have produced more if it had made more aggressive use of
certain EOR techniques is not substantiated. It relies on Mr Way's own
impression only.

Croatia's claim regarding alleged breach of MOL's obligation under the
SHA to expand exploration in the Region on behalf of INA is heavily
dependent on the expert testimony of Mr Anthony Way. Croatia's
particular contentions of breach of SHA are neither sufficiently
articulated nor accompanied with relevant evidence. The only evidence
is Mr Way's expert testimony, which is not convincing.

Mr Way states in his Second Expert Report that "/NA has not come
close to a 100% reserve replacement ratio, and its successful upstream

business has eroded over recent years...".2"'

Mr Way is of the opinion
that INA's objective is to achieve 100% reserve replacement ratio,
which is unrealistic because the largest companies in 2014 were only
able to achieve a reserve replacement ratio of 84% and a regional
company like the Romanian oil company Petrom, only achieved ratio

of 42%.74? INA is not a large international company.24° Mr Way also

states that the strategic objective of INA is to maintain hydrocarbon
production at a minimum of 70,000 BOED.2“4 He suggested inter alia
that maintaining domestic gas production levels to avoid gas imports -—
i.e. obtain 70,000 barrels of oil equivalents a day — was one of the
strategic objectives of INA.245 Mr Way did not mention that this
objective had been restored in INA's 2011-2015 Strategic Plan24° with
an important qualifier "at a reasonable price". Mr David Aron
paraphrased it as "at an economic cost."24” The same is with the
objective of achieving a 100% reserve replacement ratio.24* It means
that it could be done only if it would be viable. Croatia did not show that
it would be the case.

461. Based on what is presented by Croatia the Tribunal is not able to say
that MOL failed in its best efforts obligations to expand exploration in
the Region on behalf of INA.

462. Croatia also contends that MOL has breached its best efforts obligation
to assist INA in maintaining its market share in Croatia as well as
expanding its network into adjacent SEE markets of Albania, Bosnia
and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro and Serbia.?49 According to
Croatia INA's share of Croatian market fell 17% between 2003 and
2012. A comparison of INA and its competitors reveals that only INA
has suffered a loss of retail sales in the same period, a drop 26% in
sales volume. This is in contrast to MOL, which has massively
increased its retail network by more than 50% from 2006-2012, while

INA did not add a single retail site during the same period. Despite its
refineries being well placed to compete, the lack of modernisation
means that Croatia has been exposed to higher inflows of competing
sales volumes, making it difficult to retain market share.

MOL's position is that INA's loss of retail market share is not the result
of neglect by MOL, but transition from a government-controlled
monopoly to an open market. INA's retail sales are not limited to the
items produced by its own refineries. If domestic supplies were
insufficient to meet demand, INA could have imported products to meet
demand. INA has an active retail modernisation plan according to
which in order to improve profitability the retail sites with the lowest
throughput have to be closed. It has not been done due to Croatia's
opposition. INA did not participate in MOL's investments in Serbia for
political reasons?°° and INA'’s Management and Supervisory Board
expressly consented to MOL's investment in Serbia®*" In Bosnia and
Herzegovina, INA participates in a 50-50 joint venture with MOL. MOL's
acquisition of retailer Tifon in Croatia was affirmatively allowed by
Croatian competition authorities after they had prohibited INA from
making the acquisition.2®? INA benefits from MOL's acquisition of Tifon,
as MOL gave INA exclusive rights to provide refined products to

Tifon.26S

Croatia's claim is again dependent on the expert testimony of Mr
Anthony Way. Croatia's particular contentions of this breach of SHA are
neither sufficiently articulated nor accompanied by relevant evidences.
The only evidence is Mr Way's expert testimony, which is not
convincing.

For example when Mr Way says that in his "view a 26% drop in volume
sales and a 17% drop in market share was larger than justified by
market liberalisation. Additionally, in the case of INA, this drop would
have been avoidable had the modernisation of INA's refineries allowed
it to retain its competitiveness and a viable retail site growth strategy
on its local retail markets." 254 By saying this Mr Way did not
substantiate how much the non-modernisation of the refineries would
contribute to INA's drop in volume sales and market share. Mr Aron
showed in his Second Expert Report that INA's loss of retail market
share is entirely consistent with loss of market share by similar state oil
companies in Romania, Hungary and Slovakia under market
liberalisation. The market share of Petrom in Romania dropped in 2000
by 24% and in 2014 by 25.5%. The market share of Slovnaftin Slovakia
showed a reduction of 22% in 2013, MOL in Hungary in 2011 showed
a reduction of 13% in 2011. On average, the market share of these
three companies dropped by over 20% compared with the reduction of
16% that Mr Way has noted in Croatia.2°°The drop in volume sales
and market share cannot be linked to the extent of refinery
modernisation because INA was not obligated to only use its own
refineries to supply its costumers. The products sold in the Croatian
market are freely available and INA could import them. The former
State-owned energy companies in central and eastern Europe held
between 9 and 30% of their respective retail markets as of 2013, INA

still held about 70% of its market.25°

Based on what has been presented by Croatia the Tribunal is not able
to say that MOL failed in its best efforts obligations to assist INA in
maintaining its market share in Croatia as well as expanding its network

into adjacent SEE markets.

Conclusions on Claims

In relation to both the corporate governance claims and the breach of
the SHA, Croatia’s claims fail. The Tribunal is bound to say that it
doubts very much whether Croatia would have launched either of these
claims as freestanding and independent claims. In effect, they were no
more than makeweight claims instituted on the back of the bribery
allegation.

(b) The travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;

(c) The costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by
the arbitral tribunal;

(d) The travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such

subject-matter, the time spent by the arbitrators and any other

relevant circumstances of the case.

2. If an appointing authority has been agreed upon by the parties
or designated by the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court
of Arbitration at The Hague, and if that authority has issued a
schedule of fees for arbitrators in international cases which it

appropriate in the circumstances of the case.

3. If such appointing authority has not issued a schedule of fees
for arbitrators in international cases, any party may at any time
request the appointing authority to furnish a statement setting
forth the basis for establishing fees which is customarily followed
in international cases in which the authority appoints arbitrators.
If the appointing authority consents to provide such a statement,
the arbitral tribunal in fixing its fees shall take such information

circumstances of the case.

4. In cases referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3, when a party so
requests and the appointing authority consents to perform the
function, the arbitral tribunal shall fix its fees only after
consultation with the appointing authority which may make any
comment it deems appropriate to the arbitral tribunal concerning
the fees.

Article 40

1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall
in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the
arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the
parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking

2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance
referred to in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking
into account the circumstances of the case, shall be free to
determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion
such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment
is reasonable.

5. After the award has been made, the arbitral tribunal shall render

There can be no doubt that MOL is the successful party. Accordingly in
the exercise of the Tribunal’s discretion, in accordance with generally
held principle as well as the terms of article 40 of the Rules, not to
mention the Parties’ submissions consistent therewith, costs should
follow the event.

The real issue thus relates to the quantum of such costs. Croatia has
contended that MOL’s costs are excessive and should not be allowed
in full. Croatia in effect contends that MOL has over-lawyered this case
and whilst entitled to spend its money as it sees fit it should not follow
that Croatia should pay for such excesses. It of course refers to the
disparity in total costs claimed by both sides.

In a normal case where experienced international legal counsel are
involved one would expect the legal costs claimed by both sides to be
in a similar order of magnitude. Where this is not the case a tribunal will
look carefully for an explanation of the disparity.

In this case it is clear that MOL’s legal costs exceed Croatia's legal
costs by a large amount. Is there any justifiable explanation for this?

It is accepted by the Tribunal that the allegations against MOL as a
corporate entity and against Mr Hernadi as an individual were of the
greatest seriousness. He was entitled to defend the criminal charges
brought against him in two jurisdictions. MOL was entitled to defend
this arbitration as vigorously as it has because the consequences of an
adverse ruling would likely have been of the gravest moment for MOL.

The Tribunal believes that there is a genuine explanation for the
disparity in legal fees. In relation to the bribery allegation, Croatia's
legal team had the benefit of all the investigative work done by public
Officials of Croatia. This clearly involved significant costs borne by its

157

taxpayers for which Croatia (unsurprisingly) gave no account. MOL, on
the other hand, did not have the benefit of such agencies. The Tribunal
intends no disrespect to Croatia’s excellent legal team but they were
presented with the case that USKOK made against Dr Sanader and Mr
Hernadi. Accordingly they were spared a great deal of investigative
work. At the outset of this arbitration Croatia rested its case on (1) Dr
Sanader’s upheld conviction, (2) the evidence of Mr Jezi¢ and (3) the
evidence of Mr Hirlimann.

What MOL’s team had to do was to attempt to deconstruct this case.
This took very substantial time and effort of retrieval and dissection of
documents written in several languages and not always easy to obtain.

Accordingly the Tribunal does not consider that the large disparity in
legal fees between the parties can be explained simply by over
lawyering.

The assessment of what costs the losing party should pay is not a
science any more than is the assessment of damages. As the US

Supreme Court once observed;

“courts need not, and indeed should not, become green-
eyeshade accountants. The essential goal in shifting fees ... is to
do rough justice, not to achieve auditing perfection.”25"

This Tribunal has years of experience in dealing with cases of this
nature and has a feel for the items and amounts of costs that are
reasonable to award. It will mention the following factors which have a
significant effect on its assessment, but illustrate the impossibility of
scientific exactitude.

The core of MOL’s legal team migrated from one law firm to another at
midstream. The Tribunal is considers that this was likely to create
significant inefficiencies which Croatia should not have to bear.

Some of the expert evidence was unnecessary although that is easy
for the Tribunal to say in hindsight. It is less apparent to a Party in the
midst of a bitter dispute where neither side is willing to forego any effort,
which might conceivably contribute to the success. However the
Tribunal is disinclined to identify work that was “unnecessary” given the
high standard which practically all contributors to the process exhibited
on both sides

The Tribunal is satisfied that there must have been some overlap
between the costs strictly incurred in this arbitration and those incurred
in investigating the criminal proceedings against Mr Hernadi, which are
of course closely linked to the issues in the arbitration. As an example,
the Tribunal doubts that Mr Fitzgerald of Peters and Peters spent 2964
hours solely on this arbitration. This amounts to roughly 50 hours per
week for 15 months. It seems far more likely that his time crossed over
between the criminal and civil proceedings however hard he might have
tried to separate them.

Similarly the costs associated with the evidence of Mr Quick must have
partly related to the criminal proceedings and cannot be said to be
100% attributable to this arbitration.

Avoiding the temptation to take on the role of “green-eyeshade
accountants” and relying on its experience and in the exercise of its
discretion, the Tribunal considers that it should make the following
orders in relation to costs which will reflect the points made above;

1) Croatia shall pay 100% of the administrative fees and other
costs of the PCA as set forth in the Statement of Account to be
provided by the PCA following the issuance of this Award;

2) Croatia shall pay 100% of the fees and expenses of the Arbitral
Tribunal as set forth in the Statement of Account to be provided
by the PCA following the issuance of this Award;
