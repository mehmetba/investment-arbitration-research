national is a party to the dispute (i.e., the United States) may not be appointed as
arbitrator by a party without the agreement of the other party to the dispute. ICSID

appointment could not be effective without the agreement of the parties to the dispute,

and it invited the Parties to comment by 9 February 2009.

Born’s appointment. By letter dated 6 February 2009, ICSID invited the Claimants to

appointment.

. By letter dated 26 March 2009, the Respondent informed ICSID that the Parties had

reached agreement on a process for appointing the President of the Tribunal. By letter

dated 27 March 2009, ICSID asked the Claimants to confirm this agreement.

Ziadé also informed the Parties that Dr Sergio Puig would serve as the Secretary of the

Tribunal.

Ill. FACTS OF THE DISPUTE
A. Introduction

33. This dispute concerns an allegation by the Claimants, Bosh and B&P, that they made an
investment in Kiev, the capital city of Ukraine, which consisted of a contract which B&P
entered into on 29 January 2003 with the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kiev
(‘the University’) to undertake a two-stage renovation and redevelopment of a property at

the address 3 Chervonozorianyi Avenue. This project was to result in the creation of ‘a

facility comprising a hotel, a research training centre with conference and meeting rooms,
dining facility, a garden and sporting facility’ which would be designed ‘to accommodate
academic symposia, seminars and conferences’ (which is referred to as ‘the Project’, ‘the
Science-Hotel Complex’, and the ‘Joint Activity’).* The Claimants further allege that,
through conduct of the CRO, the Ukrainian courts, the Ministry of Justice, and the
University — all of whose acts and omissions are attributable to Ukraine — the contract
between B&P and the University was terminated, and B&P was subsequently evicted
from the Science-Hotel Complex. The Claimants submit that the Respondent has,
through the conduct of these entities, breached its obligations under the BIT, and that this

has caused the Claimants to suffer loss.
B. Establishment of Bosh and B&P in Ukraine

34. The owner of Bosh, Mr Shapsis, had first established Bosh in 1992 in order to operate a
construction firm in Ukraine in order to take advantage of the opportunities that Ukraine’s
newly achieved independence from the Soviet Union would provide for business.” Mr
Shapsis had a background in construction and engineering, having graduated from the
Poltava Engineer Construction Institution in Kiev.° Mr Shapsis also enlisted the
collaboration of Mr Borys Boguslavskyy, who was living in Ukraine and who became the

President of B&P.’

35. The University was founded in 1833, and was named the ‘Taras Shevchenko National
University of Kiev’ in 1929, after a well-known Ukrainian poet and political activist.® It
is a ‘multidisciplinary education and scientific complex’ and consists of ‘15 faculties and

six institutes’, and employs around 2,000 academic staff.”

when the University had engaged B&P to perform some repairs on the building.'° After

° Claimants’ Memorial, pp. 3, 5. The Claimants state that: ‘On April 26, 1996, the University and B&P entered
into an agreement ... about common activity (relating to the building of a hostel for students without any change
of status.”

the completion of this repair work, the City of Kiev decided to upgrade and renovate a
city square close to the property at 3 Chervonozorianyi Avenue, and in the context of
those works, the City of Kiev and the University discussed the future of the property.!!
At the time, a large part of the property was in a state of disrepair, and was partially
occupied by squatters. !? It was designated as for use as a dormitory for students at the
University, but it was used for other purposes due to its inconvenient location for the
University. '° It was decided that a facility should be developed comprising a hotel,
research training centre with conference and meeting rooms, dining facility, a garden and
sporting facility which would be capable of holding academic symposia, seminars and

conferences. '*

37. The University contacted B&P to enquire as to its interest in undertaking the
redevelopment project. The University recognised that it did not have the funds to
finance the redevelopment, and that B&P would have to contribute capital and other
resources to carry out the redevelopment project, and that in return, B&P would own a

50% share of the project for 25 years. Is

. B&P and the University then entered into negotiations, and in the course of these
negotiations, B&P had many meetings with the Rector of the University, Mr V Skopenko,
and other University officials. The Claimants state that they had to ‘comply with a
multitude of legal and bureaucratic requirements to get the Project off the ground’,'° such
as the approval for the project of the Zalaiznichny District State Administration, the re-
zoning of the property, the approval for the project of the Kiev State Administration, and
the approval by the University of the design for the Science-Hotel Complex.!” During the
contractual planning process, the net present value of the project was estimated to be

between USD 9 - USD 11 million.'®

Company. The supreme management body shall be authorised to take decisions in
any matters related to the joint activity that are not contrary to the current laws and do
not belong to the exclusive competence of the parties’ heads.’””

48. Under Article 4(4):

‘The Company shall engage in the joint activity by virtue of a power of attorney
which the University shall issue within five days from the moment of signing this
Contract.’

49. Article 4(6) required that:

‘Financial transactions related to the joint activity of the Parties shall be conducted by
means of the joint activity settlement account which is opened after the registration of
this Contract in accordance with the current laws of Ukraine.’”

50. Under Article 4(7):

‘The University shall be entitled to control the joint activity under this Contract by
the means of examination of the account and other documents of the Company but
only in respect to the joint activity.’*”

51. As the Tribunal has observed above, the 2003 Contract contained an early termination

procedure in Article 11(3):

‘The Parties shall be entitled to an early termination of this Contract on the grounds
and in accordance with the procedure provided by the current legislation.’*"

52. Article 11(4) — 11(6) contained a procedure for the allocation of the joint venture’s assets

in the event of termination:

“11(4). In case of termination of this Contract the remaining funds and property shall
be distributed among the Parties in proportion to their contributions to the joint
property. After the termination of this Contract the building shall remain in the
property of the University. The property that is contributed by the Company to the

11(5). In case of termination of this Contract all improvements of the building that
result from the reconstruction of the joint activity and cannot be detached without
causing damage to the building shall become the property of the University at their
residual value. The Company shall be subsequently compensated for the value of the
tangible assets that cannot be detached from the building.

11(6). In case of termination of this Contract the contributions and the part of the
joint property that can be detached from the building as well as the property rights
contributed by the Parties shall be returned to the Parties in accordance with the
procedure determined in the current legislation.”*?

53. Article 13(1), entitled “Disputes Settlement Procedure’, provided that:

‘All disputes between the Parties in connection to which no agreement has been
reached shall be settled in accordance to the Ukrainian legislation.”

54. And Article 15(1) stated that:

‘In cases provided for in this Contract the Parties are governed by the current
legislation of Ukraine.’

55. As was foreseen in Article 7(2) of the Contract, the Project was to proceed in two phases.
The first phase involved the redevelopment of the first four of the building’s five floors
(including the construction of living, dining and conference facilities.)*° The second
phase included the construction of additional rooms on the fifth floor, the installation of

an elevator, and a renovation of the building’s sports facilities and a garden.*°

56. Construction works at the Science-Hotel Complex proceeded throughout 2003, and the
first phase was completed.*” The commencement of the second phase of the Project was
however delayed, which the Claimant alleges was partly due to difficulties encountered in

evicting illegal tenants from the building who had been there since 1999.8

D. Internal Audit by the University

5

oo

. In October 2006, the University’s Financial and Business Activity Control Department
(‘Control Department’), responsible for the inspection of the financial activity of the
University, commenced an internal audit of the Joint Activity (‘Internal Audit’).“° The
purpose of the Internal Audit was to ascertain whether B&P was in compliance with the
2003 Contract for the period 2003 — 2006. The University’s Control Department issued a
report dated 29 December 2006 (‘Internal Audit Report’), and found ‘a number of

1

irregularities’ in B&P’s performance of its contractual obligations.* These included a

finding that B&P was not using the building in accordance with the terms of the 2003
Contract, including that it was not undertaking any ‘joint educational activities with the

University’ 2

59. Although B&P had provided documentation to the Control Department to support its

claims that the Science-Hotel Complex had hosted conferences, the Respondent has
alleged that those conferences only made use of the accommodation facilities, rather than
the conference rooms; that many of the organisations which had made use or planned to
make use of the conference facilities were private companies, rather than educational
institutions.** The Respondent has further noted that other events hosted by the Science-
Hotel Complex were listed as ‘Ukraine, Eurovision’, ‘Germany. World Football
Championship’, and ‘Italy’.4 The Control Department accordingly concluded that the
Science-Hotel Complex had not hosted seminars, conferences or other university events,

of the kind envisaged by the 2003 Contract.*°

60. The Control Department also found in the Internal Audit that B&P had failed to open a
separate bank account for the Joint Activity in that it had conducted all the financial
operations relating to the Joint Activity through one single bank account held by B&p.*
Further, in the proceedings the Respondent asserted that ‘there were no separate balance
sheets and no separate accounting books and ... the Joint Activity’s financial results

appeared only on B&P’s balance sheets.’*”

61. In addition, the Control Department found that the parties to the 2003 Contract had failed
to ‘exchange available information ... on aspects of their mutual interests’, to “conduct
joint meetings, mutual consultations on subjects of mutual activities’, and had also not
held any meetings of the parties’ representatives, contrary to Articles 3 and 4 of the 2003

Contract.“

62. The Control Department also made findings of other breaches, including that B&P had:
e failed to keep an inventory of the Joint Activity’s assets, in breach of Article 8(2)

of the 2003 Contract;*”

e leased equipment ‘without having assigned inventory numbers on the leased
equipment’;*”

e recruited employees who were not aware that they were employed for the Joint
Activity;*!

e violated Ukrainian tax legislation; and

e made use of the building for purposes not connected with the Joint Activity,
including the sub-let of the fifth floor of the building to one of B&P’s

contractors.**

63. On the basis of these irregularities, the University Control Department concluded in the

Internal Audit Report that B&P owed the University UAH 124,036.60.

E. Audit of the University by the General Control and Revision Office

64. During November and December 2006, the General Control and Revision Office of the
Ukraine Ministry of Finance (‘CRO’) carried out an audit of the University (‘CRO
Audit’), that included a ‘Cross-Revision’ of the Joint Activity (‘Cross-Revision’),

comprised of an inspection of B&P’s documents relating to the Joint Activity’.

65.In the proceedings, the Respondent describes the CRO as an ‘independent financial

control authority within the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine’ ,**

and its purpose is to
ensure that ‘the entities, institutions and organisations that receive state funding comply
with the requirements of the laws of Ukraine regarding the use and accounting of budget

funds and the use of state property.’*”

6

a

. According to the Respondent, in the course of its audit, the CRO decided that it was
‘necessary to extend their inspection to the Joint Activity between the University and
B&P’, and proceeded to review records held by B&P relating to the Joint Activity (‘the

Cross-Revision’).*®

6

x

. B&P claimed that it was not aware of the CRO Audit until it received the CRO’s request
for the production of copies of all documents relating to the Joint Activity.” In response,
the Respondent explained that ‘the CRO was not obliged to notify B&P of the scheduled

audit’, which is ‘not provided for in the applicable regulations’.

68. The CRO’s inspection of B&P’s documents took place from 8 to 15 December 2006.°!

69. In addition to its review of documents, the CRO requested that the University prepare a
report on the physical measurements of the building. This report stated that much of the
building consisted of hotel rooms and commercial premises, and also that two families

were living in the building.

70. The report led the University’s then Deputy-Rector to conclude that the building was

being used mainly for commercial, rather than educational, purposes.

71. On 15 December 2006, the CRO issued the Cross-Revision Report with the finding that
B&P had failed to open a separate joint activity account, contrary to Article 4.6 of the

2003 Contract:

‘the Company did not open a joint activity account. All business operations of the
Company, including the joint activity, were carried out on the account current No
260083012307, MFO 300012, with the Main Operations Department of
Prominvestbank in Kiev.’

72. The CRO also found that B&P had failed to conduct the activities which it was required

to carry out under the 2003 Agreement:

‘Documents evidencing the joint activity of the University and the Company in the
areas identified in [the 2003 Contract] ... inter alia, scientific activity, education
activity, conferences, presentations, meetings, competitions, video- and inter-bridges;
information services; cultural and educational activities, foreign trade activities in the
selected areas, were not provided for collation.’°°

73. B&P protested these findings and its Chief Executive Officer, Ms Olga Romanchuk,
counter-signed the Cross-Revision Report under protest, stating that she disagreed with
the conclusions.” B&P also sent letters of complaint to the CRO, the Ministry of
Finance and the State Prosecutor’s Office, but only received a pro forma reply from the

Ministry of Finance.®

Revision Report of 15 December 2006

74. The CRO issued its Audit Report (‘the CRO Audit Report’) on the University on 29
December 2006, in which it essentially adopted the findings made in the Cross-Revision
Report, including those concerning B&P’s failure to open a separate joint activity account

and B&P’s failure to carry out joint activities in a number of areas.

7:

an

. On 10 May 2007, the CRO wrote to the University and confirmed that it had, in the
course of the Audit, detected various instances of non-conformity with applicable
Ukrainian law, and made 15 recommendations to the University which dealt with a range
of issues, and which were expressed in mandatory terms.”” One of the breaches identified
by the CRO was B&P’s operation of the Science-Hotel Complex. In the letter dated 10
May 2007, the CRO directed the University to do inter alia the following:

‘The University shall:
1. Take effective to elimi completely the blished i
and to bring the guilty officials to responsibility with respect to these breaches.

 

5. Consider the question of termination of joint activities with B&P, LTD as such as
inconsistent with the University status being a [State] budget-maintained institution
as well as return the assets to the above-mentioned company. Prevent violations of
effective legislature by the University concerning the use of its assets (State

property).”

™ Letter dated 10 May 2007 from the CRO to the University (Exhibit R-30); see also Claimants’ Memorial, pp.
11-12; Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 130. The Claimants had submitted a non-certified translation
(Exhibit C-51-1), which translated this passage slightly differently: ‘The University shall comply with these: (1)
Take effective measures to eliminate completely the established inconsistencies and to bring the guilty officials
to accountability with respect to these breaches. [...] 5. The question of cessation of the B and P Ltd activities
as such inconsistent with the University status being a sate [sic] budget-maintained institution, as well as
provision of the return of assets allowed for use by the said company. No instance of the breach of effective
legislature on the University’s part concerning the use of its assets (State property) shall be allowed to take
place.’ The Claimants subsequently presented a certified translation at the start of the oral hearing, which
rendered the passage as follows: ‘The University shall: (1) Take effective measures to fully rectify the violations
discovered and bring the guilty officials to justice. [...] (5) Consider terminating joint activities with B&P LTD
as failing to conform with the University’s status as a State-funded institution as well as ensuring return of
assets transferred to said company. The University must not be allowed to violate the provisions of current law
regarding the use of its assets (State property)’: reproduced in Claimants’ Post-Hearing Brief, para. 103, fn. 120.
The Tribunal does not consider that anything turns on which translation is to be preferred, but it sets out the
competing translations for the sake of completeness.

F. Termination of the 2003 Contract

76. As to rights to termination, the Respondent’s submissions were that Ukrainian law
provides that where there is a material breach of contract, there are two methods to seek

termination of that contract, namely:

“(1) the parties can mutually agree on the termination of the contract; or (2) if the
parties cannot agree on such termination, the interested party may request termination
of the contract before the Ukrainian courts. However, one party cannot unilaterally
terminate a contract, even in case of a material breach.’ rR

77. By letter dated 13 September 2007, the University requested that B&P agree to the
termination of the 2003 Contract by reason of the various breaches by B&P identified by
the CRO. In that letter, the University also stated that unless B&P agreed to the
termination of the 2003 Contract it would be obliged to commence action before the Kiev
Commercial Court.” By letter dated 21 September 2007, B&P refused the University’s
request and asserted that any disputes should be settled despite provisions of the Bir.”
In a further letter dated 1 October 2007, B&P proposed a meeting on 17 October 2007 to
discuss the issue. B&P claims that its representatives attended the office of the Rector for

that meeting, but the Rector was not available to meet with them.”

78. On 2 October 2007, the University initiated proceedings in the Kiev Commercial Court
by filing statement of claim No 03-101, in which it sought the termination of the 2003
Contract and the transfer of B&P’s 50% interest in the joint venture to the University.”

Each party made submissions to the Court.

79. B&P contended that as the dispute was an investment dispute within the meaning of the
BIT and the ICSID Convention, it was invoking the jurisdiction of ICSID, and it argued
that ICSID’s jurisdiction was exclusive of the Ukrainian courts. In Ruling 05-6-6/1061 of

29 October 2007, Judge Kovtun agreed that the Kiev Commercial Court lacked

jurisdiction to determine the case because it fell within the jurisdiction of ICSID. He

therefore did not accept the University’s claim.”

80.On 2 November 2007, the University commenced new proceedings in the Kiev
Commercial Court, requesting the same relief.”* The University filed the same statement

of claim as it had filed in the proceedings it had initiated on 2 October 2007.”

81. On 8 November 2007, B&P filed its objections to the Kiev Commercial Court, referring
to Ruling 05-6-6/1061 of Judge Kovtun. Nevertheless, on 23 November 2007, Judge
Khrypun issued a Ruling in Case No 32/619, in which he accepted the statement of claim
and invited B&P to submit a substantive response, and also scheduled a hearing for 3
December 2007.°° B&P did not attend that hearing because — as Ms Romanchuk
explained in her witness statement — it considered that the hearing was ‘illegal’ and
constituted a violation of B&P’s ‘procedural rights’ .*! On 15 January 2008, B&P filed a
written submission in which it objected to Judge Khrypun’s Ruling of 23 November 2007
on jurisdictional grounds only, and it did not address the University’s claim on the merits

of terminating the 2003 Contract.*

82.On 16 January 2008, Judge Khrypun issued a judgment which terminated the 2003
Contract.*? Judge Khrypun rejected B&P’s submission that the BIT was applicable to the
dispute between the parties, and concluded that the 2003 Contract was ‘commercial’. It
followed that he found that the dispute was subject to the jurisdiction of the Ukrainian
courts, holding that: ‘According to the Article 12 of the Code of Commercial Procedure
of Ukraine, all the disputes arising upon amendment and termination of commercial

contracts belong to the jurisdiction of commercial courts.’** On the merits issues, Judge

Khrypun held that the B&P’s acts and omissions amounted to a material breach of the

2003 Contract, which justified its termination by the Court.

83. On 22 January 2008, B&P sought to appeal the judgment in Case No 32/619. Its appeal
was rejected in the first instance by the Kiev Commercial Court of Appeal due to B&P’s
failure to pay the appropriate court fee.*° B&P then refiled its appeal with the relevant
court fee, which was accepted by the Kiev Commercial Court of Appeal.*” On the
Appeal itself, B&P argued that the Kiev Commercial Court of Appeal should overturn the
decision of Judge Khrypun due to: (1) the inconsistent decision in Ruling No 05-6-
6/1061; and (2) its submission that the dispute fell to be determined under the BIT and not

by the Ukrainian courts.

84. On 3 June 2008, the Kiev Commercial Court of Appeal dismissed B&P’s appeal and
upheld the judgment in Case No 32/619.*8 As to ground (1), it rejected B&P’s argument,
based on Article 80 of the Commercial Code of Procedure of Ukraine, that a commercial
court should discontinue a proceeding if a decision has already been issued in the same
case, which involves the same parties,” and found that Article 80 of the Commercial
Code of Procedure was only engaged where a court issues a ‘judgment’, which considers
the merits of the dispute, but does not apply where a court issues a ‘ruling’ (as Judge
Kovtun had done), which does not examine the merits.” As to ground (2), it also rejected
B&P’s argument that the dispute was within the jurisdiction of ICSID, including on the
bases that the 2003 Contract had not been registered as a foreign investment agreement,
that the 2003 Contract itself provided in Article 13(1) that disputes were to be settled by
the Ukrainian courts, that Article 12 of the Commercial Code of Procedure of Ukraine
provides that disputes concerning the termination of commercial agreements are subject
to the jurisdiction of the Ukrainian commercial courts, and that B&P had, in any event,
failed to provide any evidence that B&P and the University had entered into a written

. Thereafter, B&P launched a further appeal to the High Commercial Court of Ukraine.”
A hearing, attended by B&P’s legal representatives, was held on 9 September 2008. B&P
maintained its contentions that the Kiev Commercial Court’s judgment could not be
upheld, because the dispute was subject to the dispute resolution procedures in the BIT;
and it also repeated its submission that the matter had already been determined by Judge

Kovtun’s Ruling in Case No 05-6-6/1061.

7. On 28 March 2008, the University instituted a third set of proceedings before the Kiev
Commercial Court and filed a statement of claim, requesting that the Court order B&P’s

eviction from the Science-Hotel Complex.”

The University argued that as the Kiev
Commercial Court had ordered the termination of the 2003 Contract B&P ‘no longer had
the right to continue to use the premises.’* B&P filed a statement of defence on 18 April
2008 and, after the hearing which took place on 21 April 2008, further statements of

defence on 6 June 2008 and 9 June 2008."°

8. B&P again objected to the University’s statement of claim on the two grounds noted
above, namely that the dispute was an investment dispute under the BIT and therefore
outside the Ukrainian courts’ jurisdiction, and that the Kiev Commercial Court’s order

that the 2003 Contract be terminated was inconsistent with Ruling No 05-6-6/1061 of 29

Commercial Court that it had filed an application against Ukraine before the European

Court of Human Rights.®

89.On 10 June 2008, the Kiev Commercial Court held that (as upheld by the Kiev
Commercial Court of Appeal on 3 June 2008) the 2003 Contract had been validly
terminated by the Court’s judgment of 16 January 2008, and that B&P no longer had the
right to use the building.” It ordered that B&P be evicted from the Science-Hotel

Complex and ordered that the Complex be transferred to the possession of the

 

University. 100

hearing. On 11 December 2008, the Kiev Commercial Court of Appeal dismissed B&P’s

appeal. tol

April 2009, the High Commercial Court of Ukraine dismissed B&P’s appeal and upheld

the eviction of B&P from the Science-Hotel Complex, and the University had requested

University and the State Enforcement Office presented themselves at the Science-Hotel
Complex, but were told by B&P’s employees that there were no representatives of B&P
in the building, so no eviction could take place. By application on 16 January 2009, the
University sought a clarification of the Kiev Commercial Court’s Ruling of 13 January
2009, and on 19 January 2009, the Kiev Commercial Court ordered that ‘B&P shall be
evicted from the non-residential premises at 3, Chervonozorianyi Avenue, Kiev, by
means of it being emptied of any persons and property.” 106 Over the course of the period
19-20 January 2009, representatives of the University and State Enforcement Office
physically and forcibly carried out the eviction of B&P and its representatives from the

premises. or

. B&P subsequently challenged the State Enforcement Office’s eviction order before the

Kiev Commercial Court. That Court dismissed the challenge on 2 June 2009, and the
Kiev Commercial Court of Appeal rejected B&P’s appeal from that decision on 4

September 2009. 108

Proceedings Regarding the Power of Attorney

. In a final set of court proceedings in the Ukraine, on 10 June 2008, the Kiev Commercial

Court registered a claim by B&P in which it complained that the University had revoked
the power of attorney it had previously granted to B&P in order for B&P to be able to
carry out joint activities concerning the Science-Hotel Complex.'® The Kiev
Commercial Court issued a decision on 4 November 2008 in which it rejected B&P’s
claim, on the grounds that the 2003 Contract had been validly terminated as of the Kiev

Commercial Court of Appeal’s decision of 3 June 2008. Ho

decision at first instance.'!!

I. Commencement of ICSID Arbitration

96. As noted above, on 3 December 2007, the Claimants filed its Request for Arbitration with
ICSID, and on 21 August 2008, ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration under
Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention.

97. It is not an unusual development in adjudication proceedings for the claims of the parties
to evolve as the proceedings move on. As the Claimants’ case has undergone substantial
refinement during the course of this arbitration, the Tribunal takes the Claimants’ final
claims for determination as those which were presented at the substantive hearing and

maintained in the Claimants’ Post-Hearing Brief.

98. As reformulated, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal make the findings that:
1. _ the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute; '!?
2. the Respondent is responsible for the conduct of the CRO, the Ukrainian
courts, the Ministry of Justice, and the University;''3
3. the Respondent has breached its obligations under the BIT in ‘four material
ways’:

a. the manner in which the CRO ‘conducted its audit and enforced its
conclusions’ was contrary to Articles II(3)(a) and III of the BIT;

b. the manner in which ‘University officials failed to act in good faith
towards B&P’ by ‘seeking to terminate the Agreement rather than
working with B&P to improve its implementation’ was contrary to
Article II(3)(a) of the BIT;

c. the manner in which ‘University officials committed a fundamental
breach of the Agreement, contrary to Ukrainian municipal law’ and
contrary to the Respondent’s obligations under Article II(3)(c) of the
BIT; and

d. the manner in which ‘the Ukrainian courts failed to act consistently
with the res judicata principle’ was contrary to Article II(3)(a) of the

BIT.'4

99. In their Post-Hearing Brief the Claimants confirmed their withdrawal of their claims ‘with

100.

respect to the “full protection and security” standard contained in BIT Article II(3)(a) and

the “arbitrary or discriminatory measures” standard contained in BIT Article II(3)(b).’ 1s

The Respondent’s defence also evolved in response to the Claimants’ claims. In its

Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal make the following

findings:

the conduct of the University is not attributable to Ukraine; '!°

the CRO did not interfere with the Claimants’ investment in breach of
Article II(3)(a) of the BIT;!!”

the Ukrainian court proceedings were fair and transparent, and did not
amount to a breach of Article II(3)(a) of the BIT;!!®

the Respondent did not frustrate any legitimate expectations of the
Claimants in breach of Article II(3)(a) of the BIT;'!”

the Claimants’ claims under Article II(3)(c) (the ‘umbrella clause’) should
be rejected; 120 and

the Respondent did not expropriate the Claimants’ contractual rights

contrary to Article III of the BIT. a

102. Article I(1)(a) contains the definition of ‘investment’, which provides that:

‘(a) “investment” means every kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned
or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party, such
as equity, debt, and service and investment contracts; and includes:
(i) tangible and intangible property, including rights, such as mortgages,
liens and pledges;
(ii) a company or shares of stock or other interests in a company or
interests in the assets thereof;
(iii) a claim to money or a claim to performance having economic value,
and associated with an investment;
(iv) intellectual property which includes, inter alia, rights relating to:
literary and artistic works, including sound recordings,
inventions in all fields of human endeavour,
industrial designs,
semiconductor mask works,
trade secrets, know-how, and confidential business information, and
trademarks, service marks, and trade names; and
(v) any right conferred by law or contract, and any licenses and permits
pursuant to law.”

103. Article I(1)(b) provides the definition of ‘company’ as follows:

‘(b) “company” of a Party means any kind of corporation, company, association,
partnership, or other organisation, legally constituted under the laws and regulations
of a Party or a political subdivision thereof whether or not organised for pecuniary
gain, or privately or governmentally owned or controlled’.

104. Article I(1)(f) contains the definition of ‘State enterprise’:

‘(f) “State enterprise” means an enterprise owned, or controlled through ownership
interests, by a Party.”

105. Article II(2)(b) also deals with State enterprises, and states that:

‘(b) Each Party shall ensure that any State enterprise that it maintains or establishes
acts in a manner that is not inconsistent with the Party’s obligations under this Treaty
wherever such enterprise exercises any regulatory, administrative or other
governmental authority that the Party has delegated to it, such as the power to
expropriate, grant licenses, approve commercial transactions, or impose quotas, fees
or other charges.”

106. Article II(3)(a) provides for the obligation on the Contracting Parties to accord fair

and equitable treatment and full protection and security, as follows:

28

‘(a) Investment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy
full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that
required by international law.’

107. The umbrella clause is contained in Article II(3)(c) of the BIT:

‘Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to
investments.”

108. Article III contains the BIT’s protection against expropriation, and provides in part as

follows:

“(1) Investments shall not be expropriated or nationalised either directly or indirectly
through measures tantamount to expropriation or nationalisation (“expropriation”)
except: for a public purpose; in a non-discriminatory manner; upon payment of
prompt, adeq and effective comp ion; and in d; with due process of
law and the general principles of treatment provided for in Article II(2).
Compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated
investment immediately before the expropriatory action was taken or became known,
whichever is earlier; be calculated in a freely usable currency on the basis of the
prevailing market rate of exchange at that time; be paid without delay; include
interest at a commercially reasonable rate, such as LIBOR plus an appropriate
margin, from the date of expropriation; be fully realisable; and be freely transferable.”

109. Article VI contains the BIT’s investor-State dispute settlement procedure. This

provides in part that:

‘(1) For purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is a dispute between a Party
and a national or company of the other Party arising out of or relating to (a) an
investment agreement between that Party and such national or company; (b) an
investment authorisation granted by that Party’s foreign investment authority to such
national or company; or (c) an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this
Treaty with respect to an investment.
(2) In the event of an investment dispute, the parties to the dispute should initially
seek a resolution through consultation and negotiation. If the dispute cannot be
settled amicably, the national or company concerned may choose to submit the
dispute for resolution:

(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Party that is a party to the

dispute; or

(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute-settlement

procedures; or

(c) in accordance with the terms of paragraph 3.
(3)(a) Provided that the national or company concerned has not submitted the dispute
for resolution under paragraph 2(a) or (b) and that six months have elapsed from the
date on which the dispute arose, the national or company concerned may choose to

29

consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding
arbitration:
(i) to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes
(“Centre”) established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment
Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, done at Washington,
March 18, 1965 (“ICSID Convention”), provided that the Party is a party to
such Convention; or
(ii) to the Additional Facility of the Centre, if the Centre is not available; or
(iii) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations
Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL); or
(iv) to any other arbitration institution, or in accordance with any other
arbitration rules, as may be mutually agreed between the parties to the
dispute.
(b) Once the national or company concerned has so consented, either party to the
dispute may initiate arbitration in accordance with the choice so specified in the
consent.
(4) Each Party hereby consents to the submission of any investment dispute for
settlement by binding arbitration in accordance with the choice specified in the
written consent of the national or company under paragraph 3. ...
L.]
(8) For purposes of an arbitration held under paragraph 3 of this Article, any company
legally constituted under the applicable laws and regulations of a Party or political
subdivision thereof but that, immediately before the occurrence of the event or events
giving rise to the dispute, was an investment of nationals or companies of the other
Party, shall be treated as a national or company of such other Party in accordance
with Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.’

B. Applicable Law

110. It is also appropriate to consider the question of applicable law. The Claimants’
claims are presented under Article VI(3)(a)(i) of the BIT, which includes a reference to

the ICSID Convention. Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that:

‘The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be
agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the
law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of
laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.’

1. Position of the Claimants

111. The Tribunal understands the Claimants’ position to be that the law principally
governing the Claimants’ substantive investor protections is the BIT. '22 The expert report
of Professor Cheng, submitted in support of the Claimants’ claims, acknowledges the
provisions of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, but asserts that both the Claimants

122 See, e.g., Cheng ER, p. 15.

30

and Ukraine ‘agree that this dispute is brought under [the BIT], to which Ukraine is a
signatory. The Parties have thus agreed that the applicable rules of law are contained in

the [BIT], satisfying Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention.’ '?*

2. Position of the Respondent

112. For its part, the Respondent does not agree that the BIT constitutes an agreement as to
the applicable law within the meaning of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention. It
submits that that the BIT ‘does not contain a provision as to the applicable law’, which
means that, following Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal may have
reference to the BIT, general principles of international law, and Ukrainian domestic

2
law. '*4

3. Determination of the Tribunal

113. The Tribunal observes that the Claimants’ claims are expressed by reference to the
substantive standards of protection in the BIT, and that the Respondent has defended
those claims on this basis. In this respect, the Tribunal considers that the applicable law
consists, for the most part, of the BIT, as interpreted in accordance with international law.
However, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that, in addition to applying the
provisions of the BIT, it will have to consider Ukrainian law, in particular as the
Claimants’ claims are at least in part based on asserted contractual rights. In this respect,
the Tribunal agrees with the view expressed by the ICSID tribunal in Asian Agricultural
Products v Sri Lanka, which held that:

‘[I]t should be noted that the Bilateral Investment Treaty is not a self-contained
closed legal system limited to provide for substantial material rules of direct
applicability, but it has to be envisaged within a wider juridical context in which rules
from other sources are integrated through implied incorporation methods, or by direct
reference to certain supplementary rules, whether of international law character or of
domestic law nature.”!

V. JURISDICTION AND

 

MISSIBILITY
A. Jurisdiction of the Tribunal over the Claimants’ Claims

1. Position of the Claimants

114. The Claimants assert that they are ‘companies of a Party’ (namely, the United States)
which have an ‘investment’ in Ukraine that falls within the scope of protection of the
BIT. They argue that ‘Bosh is an enterprise incorporated under the laws of New Jersey’,
and that ‘B&P, although incorporated under the law of Ukraine is, according to Article

VI(8) of the Treaty, to be treated as a national of the other Contracting Party.’ 126

115. Article I(1)(b) of the BIT defines ‘company’ of a Party as meaning:

‘any kind of corporation, company, association, partnership, or other organisation,
legally constituted under the laws and regulations of a Party or a political subdivision
thereof whether or not organised for pecuniary gain, or privately or governmentally
owned or controlled.’

116. The Claimants submit that Bosh is incorporated in New Jersey and, as such, qualifies

as a ‘company’ of the United States.

117. As for the standing of B&P to present claims under the BIT, Article VI(8) of the BIT

provides, in part, that:

‘any company legally constituted under the applicable laws and regulations of a Party
or political subdivision thereof but that, immediately before the occurrence of the
event or events giving rise to the dispute, was an investment of nationals or
companies of the other Party, shall be treated as a national or company of such other
Party in accordance with Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.’ 1p

118. Also relevant to this provision is the definition of ‘investment’ in Article I(1)(a) of the

BIT. This provides in part that the term ‘investment’ means:

26 Claimants’ Memorial, p. 18.
27 BIT, Art I(1)(b).
8 BIT, Art VI(8).

32

‘every kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or
indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party, such as equity, debt, and
services and investment contracts; and includes: ... (b) a company or shares of stock
or other interests in a company or interest in the assets thereof.’ 129

 

 

119. As B&P is incorporated under the laws of Ukraine, and because 94.5% of its shares in
are owned by Bosh, the Claimants submit that B&P constitutes an ‘investment’ of Bosh,

and therefore is to be treated as a company of the United States under Article VI(8). 180

120. The Claimants also assert that they have an ‘investment’ in Ukraine within the
meaning of the BIT, and which also satisfies the requirement under the ICSID

Convention that the dispute arise directly out of an ‘investment’.'*!

121. ‘Investment’ is defined in Article I(1)(a) of the BIT in part as meaning:

‘every kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or
indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party, such as equity, debt, and
service and investment contracts, and includes:

(i) tangible and intangible property, including rights, such as
mortgages, lines and pledges;
(ii) a company or shares of stock or other interests in a company

or interests in the assets thereof;
(iii) a claim to money or a claim to performance having an
economic value, and associated with an investment;
(iv) intellectual property which includes, inter alia, rights relating
to:
literary and artistic works, including sound recordings,
inventions in all fields of human endeavour,
industrial designs,
semiconductor mask works,
trade secrets, know-how, and confidential business information,
and
trademarks, service marks, and trade names; and
(v) any right conferred by law or contract, and any licences and
permits pursuant to law.” 1s

122. The Claimants argue that their ‘investment’ included:

‘(i) the value of Bosh’s shareholdings in B&P ...; (ii) the rights conferred by the
Contract and its value; (iii) [a] claim to performance having an economic value; (iv)
goodwill and the technical processes and know-how made available to the Project

33

through B&P personnel; and (v) the tangible and intangible property of B&P’s
interest in the joint venture.” 133

123. The Claimants also submit that they are entitled to invoke the BIT’s investor-State

dispute settlement procedure, which is contained in Article VI.
124. Article VI(1) provides that an ‘investment dispute’ is:

‘a dispute between a Party and a national or company of the other Party arising out of
or relating to (a) an investment agreement between that Party and such national or
company; (b) an investment authorisation granted by that Party’s foreign investment
authority to such national or company; or (c) an alleged breach of any right conferred
or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment.’ 14

125. Article VI(2) goes on to provide that in the event of an ‘investment dispute’, the
parties to the dispute are to seek a resolution by negotiations. If the dispute cannot be
settled amicably, the national or company concerned may choose to submit the dispute for

resolution:

‘(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Party that is a party to the dispute;
or

(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute-settlement
procedures; or

(c) in accordance with the terms of paragraph 3.” 185

126. Article VI(3) states that if ‘the national or company concerned has not submitted the
dispute for resolution under paragraph 2(a) or (b) and that six months have elapsed from

the date on which the dispute arose’, that national or company may ‘consent in writing to

the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration.’ 186

127. Three options are provided for the national or company, namely submission of the
dispute to ICSID, provided that the Party is a party to the ICSID Convention; submission

of the dispute to the ICSID Additional Facility, in the event that ICSID is not available; or

submission of the dispute to UNCITRAL arbitration.'*”

128. The United States signed the ICSID Convention on 27 August 1965, and ratified it on
10 June 1966, to enter into force for the United States on 14 October 1966.'°8 Ukraine
signed the ICSID Convention on 3 October 1998, and ratified it on 7 June 2000 to enter
into force for Ukraine on 7 July 2000. Hence, each of the United States and Ukraine is a
party to the ICSID Convention, with the result that ICSID is available for the purposes of
Article VI(3)(a)(i) of the BIT.

129. The Claimants submit that the Respondent has given its consent to ICSID arbitration
by virtue of Article VI(4) of the BIT, in which ‘[e]ach Party hereby consents to the
submission of any investment dispute for settlement by binding arbitration in accordance
with the choice specified in the written consent of the national or company under
paragraph 3’, namely the national or company’s submission of the dispute to international

tee 3
arbitration.'”

130. The Claimants maintain that their claims are claims under the BIT, rather than claims
under the 2003 Contract. They note that their claims concern not only the University’s
alleged non-compliance with its contractual obligations, but also the conduct of the CRO

and the Ukrainian courts.'*°

N

Position of the Respondent

131. The Respondent does not contest the standing of Bosh and B&P to assert a claim
under the BIT. Nor does the Respondent challenge the Claimants’ submission that they
have made an ‘investment’ in Ukraine within the meaning of the BIT. Although the
Respondent initially objected to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on the basis that all of the
claims were ‘fundamentally contractual’, '4! ultimately the Respondent did not pursue its
objection that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction due to the contractual nature of the claims,
but rather asserted that the Claimants’ claims neither arose under the BIT nor amounted to

‘investment disputes’.

3. Determination of the Tribunal

132. The Tribunal finds that Bosh and B&P are ‘companies’ within the meaning of the
BIT, that the Claimants have made an ‘investment’ in Ukraine, and that the Claimants are

entitled to invoke the investor-State dispute settlement procedure in Article VI of the BIT.

B. Admissibility of the Claimants’ Claim under the Umbrella Clause
1. Position of the Claimants

133. In the absence of other objections, the principal jurisdictional controversy between the
parties concerns the claim asserted by the Claimants under the umbrella clause in Article
I(3)(c) of the BIT. The Claimants concede that their previous counsel ‘should have
elaborated upon this argument’ earlier in the arbitration, but the Claimants argue that they
raised this claim in their Memorial and their Reply Memorial. ‘2 The Claimants explain

that they ‘remedied this omission [in their] skeleton issues statement and addressed the

4B

relevant arguments in oral submissions’.'° In any event, the Claimants argue that the

Respondent has addressed the umbrella clause issue in its written submissions. '“*

2. Position of the Respondent

134. The Respondent maintains its objection to the Claimants’ claim under the umbrella

clause in Article II(3)(c) of the BIT.'* The Respondent’s objection is principally made

on the basis that that claim was made too late and is ‘untimely’ .'4°

135. The Respondent submits that although the Claimants referred to the umbrella clause
in their Memorial and Reply, they had not identified ‘the contractual breaches complained

of’, and had ‘made no attempt to establish these breaches under the governing law of the

9147

2003 Agreement, i.e., Ukrainian law. The Respondent further notes that the

Claimants had, in their Reply, merely sought to invoke the umbrella clause as ‘an

alternative ground for the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over this dispute’ ,'** and that the

Claimants’ expert, Professor Tai-Heng Cheng, had not addressed the umbrella clause in
his report.” Accordingly, the Respondent asserted in its Rejoinder that the Claimants
appeared to have withdrawn their umbrella clause claim.’ The Respondent observed
that this claim was, first, ill-formulated (in the Claimants’ Memorial), then seemingly
abandoned (in the Claimants’ Reply), such that the Respondent did not address these
claims seriously (in its Counter-Memorial and Rejoinder), with the result that the
Respondent has not had the opportunity to address those claims properly.'*! However,
the umbrella clause claim had then resurfaced in the Claimants’ skeleton outline of 2
December 2011 and opening oral submissions on 7 December 201 1.1% The
Respondent’s position is that, by reason of this confined pleading, the umbrella clause
claims should ‘be dismissed in their entirety without any further consideration of their

merits.’!*°

3. Determination of the Tribunal

136. The Tribunal understands the Respondent’s objection to the Claimants’ umbrella
clause claim as an objection to the admissibility of that claim, rather than as an objection
to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to determine the claim. In this respect, the Tribunal agrees
with the tribunal in Chevron Corporation and Texaco Petroleum Company v Ecuador,

which explained the distinction between jurisdiction and admissibility as follows:

‘An objection to the admissibility of a claim does not, of course, impugn the
jurisdiction of a tribunal over the disputing parties and their dispute; to the contrary, it
necessarily assumes the existence of such jurisdiction; and it only objects to the
tribunal’s exercise of such jurisdiction in deciding the merits of a claim beyond a
preliminary objection.’ Is4

137. In the present case, the Respondent does not contest the Tribunal’s personal
jurisdiction over the Claimants, nor the subject-matter jurisdiction of the Claimants’

contest this latter point.) Nor does the Respondent seek to argue that the claim under the
umbrella clause is outside the temporal scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. Rather, the
Respondent’s preliminary objection is essentially that as the Claimants failed to articulate
their umbrella clause claim until the substantive hearing and their Post-Hearing Brief, the

Tribunal should decline to determine the claim.'*

138. The Tribunal agrees that the presentation of the Claimants’ case with regard to the
umbrella clause claim has lacked precision and consistency, and that this has given rise to
a degree of confusion. Nevertheless, the pleadings show that the Claimants did advert to
a claim under the umbrella clause, and that the Respondent’s Counter-Memorial contains

a section which deals with the umbrella clause.'*°

157

In its Rejoinder, the Respondent
reiterated these submissions, and the Respondent made relevant submissions in its
Post-Hearing Brief.'** In the circumstances, the Tribunal is of the view that the
Respondent cannot maintain that it was completely taken by surprise by the presentation

of the Claimants’ claim at the substantive hearing.

139. Although this may be close to the margin for appropriate pleading, the Tribunal finds
that the Claimants’ claim under the umbrella clause is within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction,
was not made in an untimely fashion, and that in all the circumstances of the pleadings,

principles of fairness do not require that the claims be rejected.

140. Accordingly, the Tribunal determines that it has jurisdiction over all of the Claimants’

claims, and none is inadmissible.

conduct of various entities; namely, the CRO, the Ukrainian courts, the Ministry of

Justice, and the University.
A. The CRO, the Ukrainian Courts, and the Ministry of Justice
1. Position of the Claimants

142. The Claimants argue that the CRO, the Ukrainian courts, and the Ministry of Justice
are all ‘State organs’ within the meaning of Article 4 of the Articles on State

Responsibility of the International Law Commission (‘ILC’). 1S article 4 provides that:

‘ARTICLE 4
Conduct of organs of a State

1. The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under
international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any
other functions, whatever position it holds in the organisation of the State, and
whatever its character as an organ of the central government or of a territorial unit of
the State.

2. An organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with
the internal law of the State.’

143. The Claimants submit that the CRO and the Ministry of Justice are ‘administrative

161

agencies’ of Ukraine (and as such ‘State organs’), and the Ukrainian courts are the

judicial arm of Ukraine (and also a ‘State organ’), within the meaning of Article 4 of the

ILC Articles on State Responsibility.
2. Position of the Respondent

144. The Tribunal does not understand that the Respondent contests that any of the CRO,
the Ukrainian courts, and the Ministry of Justice are not ‘State organs’ within the

meaning of Article 4 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, and that their conduct is

not attributable to Ukraine.’

‘© Th the Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 331, the Respondent accepted that ‘the CRO’s actions and the
courts’ actions could in some circumstances be attributed to Respondent’, but argued that the actions of the
CRO and the courts ‘could not give rise to any liability... The Respondent did not address this issue in its
subsequent written submissions.

39

3. Determination of the Tribunal

145. The Tribunal also recalls that, on the Respondent’s own description, the CRO is an
‘independent financial control authority within the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine’ .'
Further, its purpose is to ensure that ‘the entities, institutions and organisations that
receive State funding comply with the requirements of the laws of Ukraine regarding the

use and accounting of budget funds and the use of State property.’ ‘64

146. The Tribunal determines that the conduct of the CRO is plainly attributable to

Ukraine.

147. The conduct of the Ukrainian courts, as the judicial arm of Ukraine, and the Ministry

of Justice, as a government department, likewise is attributable to Ukraine.
B. The University
1. Position of the Claimants

148. The Claimants contend that the conduct of the University is attributable to the State,
as it is a ‘State budget entity that receives funding from the national government and

whose rector is appointed by the President of Ukraine and holds the rank of minister.’ 165

149. Although this position was later abandoned, the Claimants initially advanced the view
that the University was a State organ within the meaning of Article 4 of the ILC Articles

on State Responsibility.’

150. The Claimants’ position, as put forward at the substantive hearing and in their Post-

Hearing Brief, is that the conduct of the University is attributable to Ukraine either on the

basis of Article 5 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, or, alternatively, on the
basis of Article II(2)(b) of the BIT.!

151. Article 5 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility provides that:

‘ARTICLE 5
Conduct of persons or entities exercising elements of governmental authority

The conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under Article 4
but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the
governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law,
provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.” 168

152. The Claimants call in aid the ILC’s commentary to Article 5, which states that Article
5 extends to such ‘autonomous institutions as exercise public functions of a legislative or

administrative character’.!™ In its commentary, the ILC adds that:

‘of particular importance will be not just the content of the powers, but the way they
are conferred on an entity, the purposes for which they are to be exercised, and the
extent to which the entity is accountable to government for their exercise.”

153. The Claimants also refer to the ICSID tribunal’s Decision on Jurisdiction in Toto
Construzioni Generali SpA v Lebanon, in which the tribunal found that the conduct of an

‘independent entity’ with ‘financial and administrative autonomy’ could be attributed to

1

the State.'”!_ The Claimants note that, as in the present case, in Toto Construzioni, the

claimant ‘had contracted with the entity rather than with Lebanon.” ed

154. The Claimants argue that the University is ‘funded by the Ukrainian State’; is

‘delegated control over State property to establish and maintain its campuses,’ !”* is

empowered by a ‘State charter’ and that the Rector of the University exercises authority

‘delegated to him under Ukrainian legislation.’ ' The power to appoint the Rector lay

University is also subject to the control of the CRO.!”° Further, although the Respondent

has argued that the Joint Activity was ‘commercial’ in nature, the Claimants also submit

that this does not prevent the University’s conduct from being attributed to Ukraine. 7

155. The alternative contention is that the University is a ‘State enterprise’ within the

meaning of Article II(2)(b) of the BIT:'

‘Each Party shall ensure that any State enterprise that it maintains or establishes acts
in a manner that is not inconsistent with the Party’s obligations under this Treaty
wherever such enterprise exercises any regulatory, administrative or other
governmental authority that the Party has delegated to it, such as the power to
expropriate, grant licenses, approve commercial transactions, or impose quotas, fees
or other charges.” '

156. The term ‘State enterprise’ is defined in Article I(1)(f) of the BIT as ‘an enterprise

owned, or controlled through ownership interests. 7180

 

by a Party.

157. The Claimants submit that the University may be considered a ‘State enterprise’ for
which the Respondent is responsible, because the term ‘State enterprise’ should be
understood as including ‘a government-owned, chartered corporate entity such as the
University.’ 8!

Education of Ukraine (Law No 2984-III), which provides in Article 17 that the State

In support of this argument, the Claimants refer to the Law on Higher

‘implements State policy in the area of higher education’, and Article 3 of the Law on

Higher Education of Ukraine provides that State policy is ‘determined by the Verkhova

Rada of Ukraine’, being Ukraine’s Parliament. !*”

2. Position of the Respondent

158. For its part, the Respondent argues that the University is ‘a separate and autonomous

juridical entity which is not a party to the ICSID arbitration’, whose conduct ‘is not

attributable to Ukraine’. '**

159. The Respondent contends that the University is not an ‘organ of the State’ within the

meaning of Article 4 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility on the basis that the

4

University is legally and financially distinct from the State,'** and further, that the

University is not a de facto organ of the State as it is ‘not part of the structure of any

Ministry’ and does not act in that capacity.'*°

160. The Respondent separately argues that the University’s conduct is not attributable to
Ukraine under Article 5 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. It argues that the
Claimants have misstated the ‘functional’ test that applies to Article 5,'8° and contend that
the Claimants must establish both that the University is empowered to exercise

governmental authority, and that the University actually exercised such authority vis-a-vis

7

the Claimants in deciding to terminate the 2003 Contract.’ The Respondent draws

support from the ILC’s commentary to Article 5, where the ILC explains that:

‘The generic term “entity” reflects the wide variety of bodies which, though not
organs, may be empowered by the law of a State to exercise elements of
governmental authority. They may include public corporations, semi-public entities,
public agencies of various kinds and even, in special cases, private companies,
provided that in each case the entity is empowered by the law of the State to exercise
functions of a public character normally exercised by State organs, and the conduct of
the entity relates to the exercise of the governmental authority concerned.” '

161. As to its first contention, the Respondent argues that ‘the University is not empowered
under Ukrainian law to exercise elements of governmental authority’, for ‘the provision

of education and the management of State property do not require the exercise of any

public power’ ,'*° and in addition, ‘the University is not empowered to enter into

commercial agreements on behalf of the State’, and ‘it did not do so’ in relation to the

2003 Contract. '*°

162. As to its second contention, the Respondent argues that, even if the University is
empowered to exercise governmental authority, the termination of the 2003 Contract was
not carried out in the exercise of such authority; it was simply the termination of a

commercial agreement, rather than the carrying out of any sovereign act. io
3. Determination of the Tribunal

163. Although it was initially submitted by the Claimants that the conduct of the
University was attributable to Ukraine under Article 4 of the ILC Articles, this position
was later abandoned. For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal could not agree that the

University is a ‘State organ’ within the meaning of Article 4 of the ILC Articles.

164. As for the question of attribution under Article 5 of the ILC Articles, the Tribunal
agrees with the Respondent that in order for the University’s conduct to be attributable to
Ukraine, it must be established both that:

(1) the University is empowered by the law of Ukraine to exercise elements of
governmental authority; and
(2) the conduct of the University relates to the exercise of that governmental

authority. 192

165. As to the first of these two limbs, the question of the University’s authority to exercise
elements of governmental authority raises complex issues concerning the University’s

status under Ukrainian law.

166. Each party has submitted largely uncontroversial evidence concerning the

University’s status under Ukrainian law. '°3

established by the Decree of the President No 1496/99 of 25 November 1999 (Decree on

The University’s autonomous status was

National Taras Shevchenko University),'* and was confirmed in the University’s Charter
of 2000, and the current Charter of 2009. The Charter of 2000, which was effective from
14 January 2000 until 14 March 2007, included the following provision concerning its

autonomy:

‘The University has the self-governing (autonomous) status of a higher educational
institution, which within the limits of the competences granted by laws and other
regulatory-legal acts of Ukraine, independently resolves issues of the training and
advanced training of highly-qualified specialists, the education of a nationally-
conscious intelligentsia.’ ! 5

167. The Charter of 2009 also confirms that the University is a separate legal entity, in the

following terms:

‘The University shall be a legal entity, have separate property, be able to gain
property and personal non-property rights and have obligations in its own name and
can be a claimant and respondent in court ... shall have its own balance sheet,
emblem, flag.’

168. The ‘Law on Higher Education’ (Law No 2984-III) of 17 January 2002 enables the
University, as an autonomous higher educational institution, to ‘organise its own
educational processes’, ‘hire faculty and other personnel’, ‘develop and implement
educational and scientific programs’, ‘create structural subdivisions, including institutes,
colleges, faculties, etc’, ‘engage in publishing activities’, ‘engage in joint activity with
other education institutions, organisations and enterprises’, ‘participate in the work of
international organisations’, and ‘make proposals to State organs of educational

management regarding possible changes to existing regulatory acts in the area of

education. This Law also authorises the University to exercise control over State

property to establish and maintain campuses. 198

169. Although the University also receives income from other sources, such as ‘payments
for educational and related services, as well as scientific activities, income from
securities, leases of property, credit funds and charitable contributions,’ !” the Tribunal
accepts that the University is largely funded by the State budget (from which around 60%

of its income was derived for the years 2003-2006).°°°

170. The Rector of the University was until 2007 appointed by the President of Ukraine.
In 2008-2009, the power to appoint the Rector was then transferred to the Cabinet of
Ministers of Ukraine, but in June 2009, the method of appointing the Rector was again
altered such that the Rector is now elected by ‘the Conference of the Labour Collective’,
which is ‘the highest self-governing body of the University and is composed of
employees of the University.’ The Rector’s appointment is now formally confirmed by

order of the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine.”"!

171. The Charter of 2009 confirms that University has the right to pursue business

activities and make use of property for such activities, as follows:

‘The autonomy of the University shall ... provide for:

The right of the University to make independent decisions and take relevant actions in
its educational, scientific-research, instructional and production-business activities:

The independent use of property, transferred to the University, and which shall
belong to it under operational management right, including for the execution of
business activity, leasing it and allowing it to be used.’~

172. It is clear from the evidence on the record that the University is a separate legal entity,

and also that it has a large degree of autonomy as a higher educational institution

concerning the manner in which it organises its educational curricula and develops and

implements its various educational and scientific programmes.

173. Nonetheless, the Tribunal considers that the University remains an entity that is
empowered by the law of Ukraine to exercise elements of governmental authority. In this
regard, it is of no moment that the University has a large degree of autonomy, as the ILC
commentary to Article 5 states, that provision also covers ‘autonomous institutions as
exercise public functions of a legislative or administrative character.’”"? The Tribunal
considers that the provision by the University of, inter alia, higher education services and
the management of State-owned property in accordance with Presidential Decree No
1496/99 of 25 November 1999, the Law on Higher Education (Law No 2984-III), and the
Charters of 2000 and 2009 (which were, respectively, adopted by an Order of the
President of Ukraine, and an Order of the Minister of Education and Science of
Ukraine)” constitute forms of governmental authority that the University is empowered

by the law of Ukraine to exercise.

174. For these reasons, the Tribunal determines that the first limb of Article 5 of the ILC

Articles on State Responsibility is satisfied.

175. As to the second limb, namely the requirement that the conduct of the University must
relate to the exercise of that governmental authority, the Tribunal observes that the ILC

commentary explains in this regard as follows:

‘If it is to be regarded as an act of the State for purposes of international
responsibility, the conduct of an entity must accordingly concern governmental
activity and not other private or commercial activity in which the entity may engage.
Thus, for example, the conduct of a railway company to which certain police powers
have been granted will be regarded as an act of the State under international law if it
concerns the exercise of those powers, but not if it concerns other activities (e.g. the
. - +205
sale of tickets or the purchase of rolling stock.)

176. In accordance with the ILC’s commentary to Article 5, the Tribunal considers that it

is only the ‘governmental activity’ of the University which is attributable to Ukraine

under Article 5, and not the University’s ‘private or commercial activity.’ In other words,
the question that falls for determination is whether the University’s conduct in entering
into and terminating the 2003 Contract with B&P can be understood or characterised as a

form of ‘governmental activity’, or as a form of ‘commercial activity.’

177. The Tribunal recalls that, under the Law on Higher Education (Law No 2984-III), the
University has the right to ‘engage in joint activity with other education institutions,
organisations and enterprises’,”°° and that it has the right to do so as an autonomous
higher education institution. The University was entitled under its Charter to enter into
the 2003 Contract in its own right, and without the need for any particular authorisation
by Ukraine. In the Tribunal’s view, the University’s decision to enter into and
subsequently terminate the 2003 Contract with B&P did not relate to the exercise of the
University’s governmental authority, but by reference to the nature and purpose of the
2003 Contract, as indicated for example in Articles 2(1) and 9(1) of the Contract, the
terms of which are set forth above, was a private or commercial activity which was aimed

to secure commercial benefits for both parties.

178. For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the University’s conduct in entering into and
terminating the 2003 Contract is not attributable to Ukraine under Article 5 of the ILC

Articles on State Responsibility.

179. This leaves the Claimants’ argument that Ukraine is responsible for the University’s

conduct by virtue of Article II(2)(b) of the BIT, which provides that:

‘Each Party shall ensure that any State enterprise that it maintains or establishes acts
in a manner that is not inconsistent with the Party’s obligations under this Treaty
wherever such enterprise exercises any regulatory, administrative or other
governmental authority that the Party has delegated to it, such as the power to
expropriate, grant licenses, approve commercial transactions, or impose quotas, fees
or other charges.’

207 BIT, Art II(2)(b).

48

180. Although the point was first made by the Claimants in their Memorial, in
considering this argument the Tribunal has not had the benefit of submissions from the

Respondent.

181. Article I(1)(f) of the BIT defines the term ‘State enterprise’ as ‘an enterprise owned,
or controlled through ownership interests, by a Party.’ The Letter of Transmittal from the
President of the United States to the Senate which accompanied the BIT merely states in

relation to Article II(2)(b) that:

‘Paragraph 2 is designed to ensure that a Party cannot utilize State-owned or
controlled enterprises to circumvent its obligations under the Treaty. To this end, it
requires each Party to observe its treaty obligations even when it chooses, for
administrative or other reasons, to assign some portion of its authority to a state
enterprise, such as the power to expropriate, grant licenses, approve commercial
transactions, or impose quotas, fees or other charges.’”

182. Consistent with the definition of ‘State enterprise’ in Article I(1)(f), Article II(2)(b)
assumes that a State enterprise has separate legal personality from ‘the Party’ (here

Ukraine).

183. The Tribunal does not agree with the Claimants that the effect of Article II(2)(b) is to
render the conduct of the University attributable to Ukraine. Rather, it imposes a positive
obligation on Ukraine to ensure that any ‘State enterprise’ that exercises governmental
authority acts in a manner that is consistent with Ukraine’s obligations under the BIT.
Thus, if a protected investor in Ukraine were to consider that Ukraine had not ensured,
consistently with its obligation in Article II(2)(b), that any State enterprise had acted in
conformity with Ukraine’s obligations under the BIT, that would give rise to a claim for
breach of the BIT against Ukraine. But it does not have the effect of making the conduct

of that State enterprise attributable to Ukraine under the law of State responsibility.

184. For these reasons, the Tribunal determines that the conduct of the University that is

the subject of these proceedings is not attributable to Ukraine.

VII. THE CLAIMANTS’ CLAIMS
A. Claims for Breach of Articles II(3)(a) and III based on the Conduct of the CRO
1. Position of the Claimants

185. The first of the four claims maintained by the Claimants is that the conduct of the

CRO constituted a breach of Articles II(3)(a) and III of the BIT.7!

186. Article II(3)(a) of the BIT provides that:

‘Investments shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy
full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that
required by international law.’

187. Article ITI(1) of the BIT provides in part that:

‘Investments shall not be expropriated or nationalised either directly or indirectly
through measures tantamount to expropriation of nationalisation (“expropriation”)
except: for a public purpose; in a non-discriminatory manner; upon payment of
prompt, adeqr and effective comp ion; and in d; with due process of
law and the general principles of treatment provided for in Article 1(2).7

188. In the Claimants’ submission, ‘the [CRO] ordered the University to terminate its
relationship with B&P. This termination order ... substantially deprived Bosh of its
enjoyment of its investment in Ukraine — i.e. its participation in the Joint Activity,
through B&P.’?3 The Claimants also argue that ‘the process by which the [CRO] came
to its decision did not afford fair and equitable treatment to B&P’ because its decision-
making with respect to the CRO Audit and Cross-Revision was ‘marred by a lack of due

process and it also led to a manifestly arbitrary result.’?!* It is convenient to set out the

differently, in the Claimants’ Memorial, pp. 31-41 (expropriation), and pp. 41-46 (fair and equitable treatment);
as well as in the Claimants’ Reply, paras. 132-177 (fair and equitable treatment), and paras. 178-210

details of the Claimants’ claims for breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard

(Article II(3)(a)) and for expropriation (Article III) separately.

189. Fair and Equitable Treatment: The Claimants submit that the CRO’s conduct
violated due process, in that the CRO’s cross-revision exercise amounted to an audit of
B&P’s compliance with the 2003 Contract, which went further than what was authorised
under Ukrainian law. The Claimants also submit that B&P was denied ‘any meaningful
opportunity ... to participate in the process, or to contest [the CRO’s] findings’,”'° and
that these actions constitute a breach of the obligation to accord fair and equitable

treatment under Article II(3)(a) of the BIT.*!°

190. In particular, the Claimants submit that the CRO’s initially stated reason for the
recommendation to terminate the 2003 Contract was that ‘the Joint Activity was not
consistent with Ukraine’s State property and budget laws’, and later the CRO stated that
the reason for the recommendation was that B&P had failed to comply with its

°17 The Claimants submit the second of these

obligations under the 2003 Contract.
reasons that they alleged were adopted by the Respondent after the commencement of the
present arbitration proceedings constitutes ‘an egregious expansion of the [CRO’s]

authority to conduct a cross-revision exercise.’?!®

191. The Claimants refer in this regard to the evidence of Mr Kyrylenko, who had given
evidence that the purpose of the Cross-Revision of B&P was merely ‘to clarify that such
activities indeed took place and were correctly reflected in the accounting of the audited
entity’.?!” The Claimants ask, if this was indeed the case, why the CRO then proceeded
to engage in a ‘painstaking, clause by clause compliance review of B&P’s alleged

performance under its Joint Activity Agreement with the University.” 220

192. In addition, or in the alternative, the Claimants argue that the CRO did not accord fair

and equitable treatment to the Claimants, as B&P was not afforded due process in the

CRO’s Cross-Revision. In the Claimants’ submission, these omissions breached the

requirement that governmental decisions be put to the test of procedural propriety.””!

193. In this regard, the Claimants refer to the Award of the ICSID tribunal in ADC Affiliate
Ltd and ADC & ADMC Management Ltd v Hungary, in which the Tribunal held that:

‘Some basic legal mechanisms, such as reasonable advance notice, a fair hearing and
an unbiased and impartial adjudicator to assess the actions in dispute, are expected to
be readily available and accessible to the investor to make such legal procedure
meaningful. In general, the legal procedure must be of a nature to grant an affected
investor a reasonable chance within a reasonable time to claim its legitimate rights
and have its claims heard. If no legal procedure of such nature exists at all, the
« . A 9222
argument that “the actions are taken under due process of law rings hollow.

194. The Claimants further submit that it makes no difference that Ukrainian law does not
entitle B&P to comment on drafts since it was not the entity being subjected to the audit
(it was the University which was being audited),””* for there is an international standard
of due process with which the Respondent must comply. They also argue that B&P
submitted written comments on the Cross-Revision process, but these letters were
‘unacknowledged appendices’ to the Cross-Revision Report.?4 In summary, it is
contended that there was an ‘evident lack of procedural fairness’ in the manner in which

the Claimants were treated by the cro.”

195. Expropriation: As for the Claimants’ claim of expropriation, the Claimants refer to
the CRO’s letter to the University dated 10 May 2007, to which reference has already

been made. This stated in part that:

‘The University shall:
1. Take effective to elimi pletely the blished i

196. The Claimants submit that ‘the documentary evidence ... supports only one
conclusion: that the [CRO] effectively ordered senior University officials to immediately
terminate the Joint Activity with B&P, or else find alternative means of personal
employment.’”” The Claimants submit that the effect of the CRO’s demand is manifestly
‘expropriatory’,””* because as a result of this ‘order’, ‘University officials took all
necessary steps to cease its relationship with B&P and to immediately terminate the [2003
Contract], without payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation.’ This
resulted in a ‘complete deprivation of the value and utility of [the Claimants’] investment

in Ukraine — because [CRO] officials decided it should be so.’?””

197. The Claimants argue that the CRO’s conduct leading to the termination of the 2003
Contract amounts to an uncompensated ‘indirect expropriation’ contrary to Article III of
the BIT. The Claimants submit that expropriations include not only ‘open, deliberate and
acknowledged takings of property’, but also ‘covered or incidental [governmental]
interference with the use of property, which has the effect of depriving the owner, in
whole or in significant part, of the use or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of

property even if not necessarily to the obvious benefit of the host State"! The

Claimants submit that the present case amounts to an ‘indirect expropriation’ 7” which is

unlawful unless four conditions are met, which include ‘the payment of prompt, adequate

and effective compensation and compliance with due process of law’.?*? In. the

Claimants’ submission, because the Respondent has not paid compensation to the
Claimants, and because the process by which the CRO decided that the 2003 Contract
should be terminated lacked due process, the Respondent is in breach of its obligations

under Article III.“

2. Position of the Respondent

198. For its part, the Respondent rejects the Claimants’ ‘unsubstantiated theories’
concerning the CRO.” The Respondent observes that the Claimants had had to abandon
their complaints regarding ‘conspiracy theories at the highest levels of Government’
which they had advanced in their earlier submissions,”°° and notes that the Claimants’
claims were based on an assertion that the CRO had discovered that the University had
lacked the authority to enter into the [2003 Contract], and that a threat was made to
‘dismiss the University’s management if they did not act to terminate the [2003
Contract].’?*” The Respondent therefore rejects the Claimants’ claims that the conduct of
the CRO constitutes a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, as well as the

claims that the same conduct amounts to an unlawful expropriation.

199. Fair and Equitable Treatment: First, the Respondent submits that the CRO’s audit
and the Cross-Revision were carried out in accordance with relevant law and procedures,
including the Law of Ukraine ‘On the State Control and Revision Service in Ukraine’,

which provides in part that the main function of the State Control and Revision Service is

to ‘exercise financial control over the use of State funds’,?** and the ‘Procedure for

> 239

Holding Inspections by the State Control and Revision Service The Respondent

notes that, in particular, the University was notified of the Audit on 4 May 2006, being
several months in advance of the planned Audit; two officers of the CRO were appointed
to carry out the Audit on 23 October 2006; B&P was notified of the Cross-Revision of the

Joint Activity on 8 December 2006, and was invited to provide documents in relation to

the Joint Activity; the CRO issued the Cross-Revision Report on 15 December 2006; the
CRO issued its Audit Report on 29 December 2006, and the CRO issued instructions to
the University on 10 May 2007. The Respondent submits that the Claimants have failed
to demonstrate anything surrounding the Audit or the Cross-Revision Report that was at

variance with the applicable laws and regulations.”

200. Second, the Respondent argues that the CRO’s Audit and Cross-Revision were carried
out transparently with B&P’s participation, and that B&P was not denied “due process’ in
relation to the Cross-Revision. In particular, the Respondent notes that B&P was aware
of the Audit as early as October 2006, that B&P participated in the Cross-Revision
exercise, and that B&P had an opportunity to contest the CRO’s Cross-Revision Report,
which it did by submitting comments to the CRO as well as by appealing to the General

6 Office 2
Prosecutor’s Office."

B&P did not, however, challenge the legitimacy of the Cross-
Revision Report before the Ukrainian courts, even though it was aware that it had the
possibility of doing so. Further, and in any event, the Respondent argues that the due
process requirement in the context of administrative decisions is lower than the judicial
due process requirement,” and that this was met. As the Respondent put it: ‘B&P had
notice of the Cross-Revision, it was given an opportunity to participate in the audit
process, to review the findings before they were published and to contest the findings

both to the [CRO] and to the General Prosecutor’s Office.’**

201. Third, the Respondent argues that the CRO did not make any finding that the
University did not have the requisite authority to enter into the 2003 Contract, and the

Claimants made no attempt to corroborate their unsubstantiated claim with evidence.”

202. Fourth, the Respondent submits that the Claimants have no basis for suggesting that
the CRO ordered or threatened the University to terminate the 2003 Contract.° The

Respondent observes that the University had already been in discussions with B&P

regarding the implementation of the 2003 Contract prior to the Cross-Revision Report,
and that if there had been any pressure, there is no reason why the University would have
waited until 13 September 2007 to terminate the 2003 Contract.” Further, and in any
event, the Respondent submits that the CRO’s letter dated 10 May 2007 is misinterpreted

by the Claimants.“*

The Claimants interpret the letter as a threat, but the relevant
language in the CRO’s letter (namely, that the University ‘take effective measures to
eliminate completely the established inconsistencies and to bring the guilty officials to
responsibility with respect to these breaches’) was only directed at those issues where the
CRO had determined that there had been violations of Ukrainian law; and in relation to
the 2003 Contract, the CRO had only recommended that the University ‘consider the
question’ of termination.°” This was confirmed in the testimony of Mr Kyrylenko, who
explained that the University had the discretion to adopt appropriate measures to address
the CRO’s concerns with respect to the 2003 Contract.° For instance, Mr Kyrylenko

said in his witness statement that:

‘In the letter, the CRO asked the University to consider the possibility of terminating
the [2003 Contract] as one of the measures that would allow the University to
eliminate the violations discovered during the audit. Had the University discovered
another way to eliminate violations related to the joint activity that would have also
been acceptable to the CRO. In any case, this letter should not be construed to mean
that the CRO ordered the University to terminate the [2003 Contract], because its
purpose was only to notify the University of the discovered violations and to propose
that the University take appropriate measures to remedy those violations.’?>!

In his reply witness statement, Mr Kyrylenko added that:

‘I wish to emphasise that the CRO did not impose the means that the University had

to use in order to remedy the violations. We did not “pressure” the University to take

any action. The University had to decide by itself which measures to take in this
92:

204. Mr Kyrylenko also explained the position at the oral hearing.” Hence, the ultimate
decision to terminate the 2003 Contract was made by the University, and not by the

cRo.2*

205. Further, the Respondent submits that the item | of the letter dated 10 May 2007, in
which the CRO directed that the University ‘[t]ake effective measures to eliminate
completely the established inconsistencies and to bring the guilty officials to
responsibility with respect to these breaches’ did not apply to item 5, in which the CRO
merely recommended that the University ‘consider the question of termination’ of the
2003 Contract. As the Respondent submitted, because ‘item 5 did not order
termination, the CRO could not impose any administrative sanction for any failure to seek

termination of the 2003 Agreement.’?°°

206. Expropriation: As for the Claimants’ claims that the CRO’s letter dated 10 May 2007
amounted to an ‘expropriation’ of the Claimants’ rights under the 2003 Contract, the
Respondent’s position is as stated above: namely, that the CRO only recommended that
the University ‘consider the question’ of termination, and that the ultimate decision was

made by the University, rather than by the CRO.”

3. Determination of the Tribunal

207. There are a number of issues to address in determining whether the conduct of the
CRO constituted either:
(1) a breach of the obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment contrary to Article
TI(2)(a); or

(2) an expropriation contrary to Article III.

208. Fair and Equitable Treatment: The Claimants’ claim for breach of the obligation to
accord fair and equitable treatment under Article II(3)(a) is primarily based on the

allegations that the CRO’s Audit and Cross-Revision of the Joint Activity was not carried

out in accordance with Ukrainian law; that B&P was denied due process in the CRO’s
Cross-Revision exercise; and that the CRO exceeded its mandate in directing the

University to terminate the 2003 Contract.

209. The Respondent’s defence is that the CRO’s Audit and Cross-Revision of the Joint
Activity was conducted in conformity with the applicable laws and regulations; that B&P
was in fact afforded the right to participate in the Cross-Revision; and that the CRO did

not order the termination of the 2003 Contract.

210. Before addressing the Claimants’ complaints, the Tribunal makes some observations
as to the content of the obligation on Ukraine to accord fair and equitable treatment. The
Parties have referred to various arbitral awards and decisions concerning the content of
this standard of treatment,** and there would not appear to be any major disagreement
between the Parties on the content of the obligation. Rather, the Parties join issue on

whether Ukraine is in breach of that obligation.

211. Although the Tribunal does not consider itself bound by past decisions of other
arbitral tribunals, it recognises that it should pay due regard to the conclusions of such
tribunals. In this respect, the Tribunal agrees with the views of the ICSID tribunal in
Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi AS v Pakistan, which stated that, ‘unless there
are compelling reasons to the contrary’, tribunals ‘ought to follow solutions established in
a series of consistent cases, comparable to the case at hand, but subject of course to the

specifics of a given treaty and of the circumstances of the actual case’?

212. Having due regard to the decisions of other arbitral tribunals, the Tribunal records its
agreement with the observations of the ICSID tribunal in Joseph Charles Lemire v
Ukraine, which observed that in order to establish a breach of the obligation under Article

II(3)(a) of the BIT, ‘[i]t requires an action or omission by the State which violates a

factors, including ‘whether the State made specific representations to the investor’;
‘whether due process has been denied to the investor’; ‘whether there is an absence of
transparency in the legal procedure or in the actions of the State’; ‘whether there has been
harassment, coercion, abuse of power or other bad faith conduct by the host State’; and
‘whether any of the actions of the State can be labelled as arbitrary, discriminatory or

: . +261
inconsistent.

213. Turning to the specific complaints of the Claimants, on the basis of the evidence
before it, the Tribunal considers that there is nothing to indicate that the CRO’s Audit and
Cross-Revision was not in fact carried out in accordance with the applicable Ukrainian
laws and regulations. In particular, the Claimants have not established that the CRO’s
Audit of the University was anything other than an audit conducted in accordance with
the Law of Ukraine ‘On the State Control and Revision Service in Ukraine’, which states
that the main task of the State Control and Revision Service is to exercise financial
control over the use of State funds.”° In this regard, the Tribunal accepts that the CRO’s
Audit constituted a routine review of the University’s use and management of State funds,

and there is no evidence demonstrating that B&P was targeted as a foreign investor.

214. The Tribunal also considers that B&P was entitled to, and was accorded, appropriate
due process in the course of the CRO’s Cross-Revision. The evidential record establishes
that B&P was informed of CRO’s Audit of the University in October 2006, was informed
of the Cross-Revision in December 2006, and participated in the CRO’s Cross-Revision
exercise. The record shows that B&P was entitled to, and did, comment on the CRO’s
Cross-Revision, and had the opportunity to challenge the Report before the General
Prosecutor’s Office (which it did) as well as before the Ukrainian courts (which it did
not). Had B&P elected to bring proceedings before the Ukrainian courts, there is no
evidence before the Tribunal to establish that the Ukrainian courts would not have
afforded B&P a fair hearing.

215. The Tribunal does not accept the Claimants’ allegation that the CRO’s letter dated 10
May 2007 constituted an unambiguous direction to the University to terminate the 2003
Contract. The letter made 15 recommendations, only one of which concerned the
University’s Joint Activity under the 2003 Contract with B&P. The sole recommendation
concerning the Joint Activity was that the University ‘consider the question of
termination of joint activities with B&P, LTD as such as inconsistent with the
University’s status being a [State] budget-maintained institution as well as return the

263 This recommendation did not direct that the

assets to the abovementioned company.’
University terminate the 2003 Contract; rather, it invited the University to consider the
possibility of such termination. On this issue, the Tribunal accepts the testimony of Mr
Kyrylenko, who explained that the formulation of the recommendation in item 5 of the
CRO’s letter reserved to the University the discretion to choose how to address the
CRO’s concerns with regards to the 2003 Contract.” The recommendation to consider
terminating the 2003 Contract was based on the CRO’s findings that B&P was in breach
of various obligations under the 2003, including in particular that B&P and the University

had not engaged in any joint activities within the meaning of the 2003 Contract.?°°

216. In addition, the Tribunal does not accept that the recommendation made by the CRO
in item 5 of the CRO’s letter is within the reach of the first paragraph of the CRO’s letter,
where it was directed that the University shall ‘take effective measures to eliminate
completely the established inconsistencies and to bring the guilty officials to
responsibility with respect to these breaches.’ The Tribunal accepts Mr Kyrylenko’s
testimony that this directive applied to ‘the established inconsistencies’ identified by the
CRO in its Audit Report, but that its letter dated 10 May 2007 only required the

University to ‘consider the question of termination’ of the 2003 Contract.?”

217. For these reasons, the Tribunal rejects the Claimants’ claim that the conduct of the
CRO constituted a breach of the obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment under

Article II(3)(a) of the BIT.

218. Expropriation: As for the Claimants’ claim that the CRO’s conduct constitutes an
expropriation contrary to Article III of the BIT, the Tribunal observes that in order to
amount to an expropriation, the Claimants must establish that the effect of the CRO’s
conduct was an interference that caused a substantial deprivation of the Claimants’ rights
under the 2003 Contract. In this connection, the Tribunal has had regard to the
conclusions of the Tribunal in Pope & Talbot, Inc v Canada, which held that, in the

context of a claim for expropriation contrary to Article 1110 of NAFTA:

“While it may sometimes be uncertain whether a particular interference with business
activities amounts to an expropriation, the test is whether that interference is
sufficiently restrictive to support a conclusion that the property has been “taken” from
the owner. ... [UJ]nder international law, expropriation requires a “substantial
deprivation”.’7

219. The Tribunal considers that the Claimants’ claim for breach of Article III suffers from
the evidentiary difficulty surrounding the effect of the CRO’s letter dated 10 May 2007.
The Claimants assert that the CRO’s letter was a direction to the University to terminate
the 2003 Contract, but the consistent evidence of Mr Kyrylenko is that the CRO made no
such direction to the University, and left it to the University to decide on the most
appropriate means to eliminate any inconsistencies. The Tribunal accepts Mr
Kyrylenko’s explanation of the effect of the 10 May 2007 letter, which is consistent with

a plain reading of that latter.

220. Consistent with its conclusions concerning the Claimants’ claim for breach of the fair
and equitable treatment obligations, the Tribunal thus decides that the CRO’s actions did
not terminate the 2003 Contract. Rather, the CRO carried out its functions in accordance
with applicable Ukrainian law and regulations, and the final decision concerning
termination was made by the University. Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects the
Claimants’ claim that the conduct of the CRO constituted a breach of the obligation not to

expropriate investments contrary to Article III of the BIT.

B. Claim for Breach of Article II(3)(a) of the BIT Based on the University’s Conduct

1. Position of the Claimants

221. The Claimants’ second claim is that the manner in which University officials acted
constituted a failure to act in good faith towards B&P and was thus contrary to the
obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment under Article II(3)(a), which provides as

follows:

‘Investment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full
protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that
required by international law.”?

222. In particular, the Claimants argue that, rather than seeking to work with B&P to
improve its implementation, the approach adopted by University officials, whereby they
sought to terminate the 2003 Contract was a violation of the good faith standard
embodied in Article II(3)(a), rather than seeking proper implementation of the
Agreement.””° The Claimants assert that University officials failed to enter into dialogue
with B&P over its alleged breaches of the Agreement, failed to take any steps to bring
themselves into compliance with the Agreement, and actively sought out excuses to

justify termination.

223. The Claimants further submit that it was the ‘legitimate expectation of each party [to
the 2003 Contract] that B&P would benefit from the addition of the University-backed
Joint Activity to its international business education network, and that the University
would reap the programmatic and financial benefits from revitalisation of the Complex,
participation in the Joint Activity and membership in B&P’s international business

« 22
education network.’?”!

224. However, in the Claimants’ submission, once the CRO had made its recommendation
in its letter dated 10 May 2007, the University adopted the position that the 2003 Contract
was void ab initio as it was inconsistent with the Commercial Code of Ukraine and the

°® BIT, Art 11(3)(a).

Civil Code of Ukraine, and therefore violated Ukraine’s ordre public, and this position
was advanced by the University in its pleadings before the Kiev Commercial Court.?”
The Claimants submit that the Respondent then chose to focus on B&P’s alleged
substantial breaches of the 2003 Contract, allegedly because ‘anything less than a
[substantial] breach would not provide grounds for termination under applicable

Ukrainian law.’*”

2. Position of the Respondent

225. For its part, the Respondent submits that the conduct of the University is not
attributable to the Respondent. In any event, the Respondent contends that the University
did not frustrate the Claimants’ legitimate expectations with respect to the 2003

Contract.?”

The Respondent argues that the Claimants’ legitimate expectations are
inextricably linked with the rights under the 2003 Contract, and that accordingly, because
the 2003 Contract could be terminated in accordance with its terms (as was recognised by
Mr Boguslavskyy, the former CEO of B&P, in cross-examination),””> the Claimants

could not have had any expectation that the 2003 Contract would continue indefinitely.

226. The Respondent understands that the Claimants’ alleged legitimate expectations
include, first, the fact that the University was authorised to enter into the 2003 Contract,
and second, an expectation that B&P would be compensated in the event of early

6

termination.7” In the Respondent’s submission, the Claimants’ claims that these

legitimate expectations have been frustrated are misconceived.

227. As to the Claimants’ first alleged legitimate expectation, the Respondent claims that
the University validly entered into the 2003 Contract, and there is nothing on the record to
say otherwise.””” As to the second, the Respondent rejects the Claimants’ suggestion that
the University deprived B&P of its contractual rights to seek compensation for early

termination of the 2003 Contract.?” After the 2003 Contract was terminated,

negotiations were held between the University and B&P concerning the amount of
compensation, and at the suggestion of B&P, the University obtained an independent
valuation of B&P’s contribution to the Joint Activity, but the proposed amount (UAH
1.485 million) was not accepted by B&P, although B&P failed to comment on the
valuation, and nor did it present a competing valuation report.?”” Nor did B&P make any
submissions concerning the non-payment of compensation in the various proceedings
before the Ukrainian courts, even though B&P had ample opportunity to do so.”*° In the
present arbitration, the Claimants now claim UAH 6,666,700, but this claimed amount
includes compensation in respect of future lost profits, which are not covered by the 2003

Contract.”*!

3. Determination of the Tribunal

228.

c.

As the Tribunal has determined that the conduct of the University that is the subject of
these proceedings is not attributable to Ukraine under the international law of State
responsibility for the reasons expressed in Part V(B) above, it rejects the Claimants’
claims for breach of Article II(3)(a) on the basis of the University’s conduct and dealings

with B&P.

Claim for Breach of Article II(3)(c) of the BIT Based on the University’s Alleged

Substantial Breach of the 2003 Contract

1. Position of the Claimants

229.

230.

The Claimants argue that the Respondent is in breach of Article II(3)(c) of the BIT,
the ‘umbrella clause’, because University officials had committed a substantial breach of

the 2003 Contract Agreement contrary to Ukrainian municipal law.

Article II(3)(c) provides as follows:

‘Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to

investments.’**
231. The Claimants submit that the umbrella clause in the BIT permits them to assert their
contractual claims under the BIT, for such provisions can have the effect of elevating

contractual claims to the level of a treaty claim.”

232. The Claimants’ claim under the umbrella clause is based on the University’s alleged
substantial breach of the 2003 Contract in seeking early termination of that Contract. As
noted above, the Claimants referred to the procedure for the termination of contracts is

provided for in Article 651(2) of the Ukrainian Civil Code:

‘A contract may be amended or terminated by the decision of a court, upon the
demand of one of the parties, due to a substantial breach of the contract by the other
party, and in other cases stipulated by the contract or the law. A breach of a contract
by one of the parties is substantial when as a result of the damages suffered due to
such breach, the other party becomes significantly deprived of the benefits anticipated
at the time of conclusion of the contract.’

233. The Claimants first argue that B&P did not commit a substantial breach of the 2003
Contract that gave the Respondent the right to seek early termination. The Respondent’s
justifications for seeking termination of the 2003 Contract are that B&P had committed a
substantial breach of the 2003 Contract for two reasons: first, it had failed to establish a
separate bank account for the Joint Activity; and second, B&P had failed to conduct the

activities described in the Agreement.”*°
234. On the first of these issues, the 2003 Contract provides in Article 4(6) that:

‘Financial transactions related to the joint activity of the Parties shall be conducted by
means of the joint activity settlement account which is opened after the registration of
this Contract in accordance with the current laws of Ukraine.”

235. The Claimants contend that the Respondent incorrectly understands this as a

requirement to open a bank account, but it only requires that a ‘settlement account’ (or

which might also be described as a ‘book of
accounts’, or ledger to record transactions.”** To fulfil this obligation, Ms Romanchuk,
the former Chief Accounting Officer, and later CEO, of B&P, kept a ‘settlement account’
to track the movement of funds concerning the Joint Activity funds.**° On the basis of
this evidence, the Claimants submit that the University could not maintain that B&P was

in breach of Article 4(6) of the 2003 Contract.

236. As to the second of these issues, the Claimants submit that the 2003 Contract provides

in Article 2(1) that the parties must act ‘jointly for the purpose and creation of the

+290

[Science-Hotel Complex] ... shall engage jointly in [activities]. In the Claimants’

submission, this means that neither party is solely responsible for joint activities, but that

the parties have to act jointly.7"!

The Claimants reject the Respondent’s allegation that
B&P failed to carry out ‘joint activities’ at the Science-Hotel Complex, and argue that the
Science-Hotel Complex hosted educational conference, seminars and lectures which were
of relevance to a business school, which were described by the Claimants’ witnesses.°>
In the course of the Cross-Revision exercise, B&P’s officers had provided the CRO with
‘all necessary documentation in response to their requests’, which ‘outlined the

3293

conferences, seminars, educational activities and other such events. The Claimants

argue further that, in any event, even if there were a breach, this was not substantial so as

to ‘substantially deprive the University of the benefits of the Agreement.’?**

237. The Claimants claim that the University was in substantial breach of the 2003
Contract ‘when its officials took categorical steps to end the joint activities that were
being maintained by B&P on behalf of the University’, and assert that the ‘line was
crossed when the University obtained and enforced an eviction order from the Ukrainian

295

courts against B&P’. In addition, the Claimants also assert that the University had

failed to comply with its contractual obligations by failing to remove squatters in the

renovations.”

238. The Claimants argue that B&P’s eviction from the Science-Hotel Complex had ended
any possibility for B&P to mitigate its losses, which had been accruing since the Phase IT
renovations were stalled.” The University’s conduct was a substantial breach on 21

January 2009, the day that B&P was denied physical access to the Complex.?”*

2. Position of the Respondent

239. In response, the Respondent argues that Ukraine is not a party to the 2003 Contract as
the University is B&P’s contractual counterparty, and reiterates that the University’s
conduct is not attributable to Ukraine.” The Respondent argues further that even if the
University’s conduct were attributable to Ukraine, the umbrella clause does not have the

effect of elevating claims for breach of contract into claims for breach of treaty.°°

240. In any event, the Respondent argues that the University did not breach the 2003
Contract. To the contrary, the Respondent contends that it was B&P that breached the
2003 Contract, and that the Ukrainian courts have confirmed that B&P’s breaches were of
such a character to justify the University’s termination of the 2003 Contract, which the

University had done under applicable Ukrainian law.2"!

3. Determination of the Tribunal

241. The Tribunal recalls that it has already determined that the conduct of the University
that is the subject of these proceedings is not attributable to the Respondent, and in this
sense, to the extent that the University has failed to comply with its obligations under the
2003 Contract, or committed a substantial breach of that contract, that conduct is not
attributable to the Respondent.

242. It remains to be determined by the Tribunal whether the Respondent has assumed any
obligations vis-a-vis the Claimants by virtue of the umbrella clause in Article II(3)(c),

which provides:

‘Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to
investments.”

243. The Tribunal observes that this obligation is incumbent on ‘each Party’ to the BIT to
‘observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments.’ It is
undisputed that Ukraine did not enter into the 2003 Contract with B&P, but that it was the
University that entered into this contract. Nevertheless, the Tribunal considers it
necessary to determine whether the term ‘Party’ in Article II(3)(c) is limited to the two
States parties to the BIT or whether it also extends to entities that are controlled by ‘each

Party.’

244. The Tribunal recalls that, as is confirmed by the Decree of the President No 1496/99
of 25 November 1999 (Decree on National Taras Shevchenko University), and as is also
confirmed in the University’s Charter of 2000, and the current Charter of 2009, the
University has an autonomous status. The Tribunal recalls further that it has concluded

above that the University is authorised to exercise elements of governmental authority.

245. However, the Tribunal notes that the BIT contains the definition in Article I(1)(f) of
the BIT provides that a ‘State enterprise’ is ‘an enterprise owned, or controlled through
ownership interests, by a Party.’*°3 Although the University is ‘owned, or controlled’ by
a Party, a State enterprise is not included within the meaning of the term ‘Party’ for the
purpose of the BIT (the Tribunal also noting that the preamble defines the term ‘Parties’
as referring to ‘the United States of America and Ukraine’). Leaving to one side the
question of whether the University is in fact a ‘State enterprise’ within the meaning of the
BIT, which the Tribunal does not determine, the Tribunal nonetheless considers it
relevant to observe that the BIT draws a distinction between the term ‘Party’ as a legal
entity, and the term ‘State enterprise’ as a legal entity. This leads the Tribunal to
conclude that the University and the State should be regarded as separate entities.

5° BIT, Art I1(3)(c).

3 BIT, Art I(1)(f).

68

246. For these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the term ‘Party’ in the umbrella clause
refers to any situation where the Party is acting gua State. This means that where the
conduct of entities can be attributed to the Parties (under, for instance, Articles 4, 5 or 8
of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility), such entities are considered to be ‘the Party’
for the purposes of Article II(3)(c). As the Tribunal has concluded above that the conduct
of the University is not attributable to Ukraine, it follows that it cannot be said that
Ukraine, as a ‘Party’, has entered into any obligations (in the 2003 Contract) with regard
to investments. Rather, if the umbrella clause is to have the effect argued for by the
Claimants, it could only do so in respect of obligations that have been assumed by the
host State or by an entity whose conduct is attributable to the host State. In this regard,
the Tribunal agrees with the conclusion of the ICSID tribunal in Bureau Veritas,
Inspection, Valuation, Assessment and Control BIVAC BV v Paraguay, which, in relation
to the particular facts of that case, including the terms of the umbrella clause in issue,

stated that:

‘On a plain meaning, [umbrella clauses] are undoubtedly capable of being read to
include a contractual arrangement entered into by BIVAC and the Ministry of
Finance of Paraguay, whereby the alleged breaches of the Ministry are attributable to
the State.’**

247. The Tribunal also agrees with the view of the ICSID tribunal in SGS Société Générale
de Surveillance SA v Philippines, which held that although the umbrella clause in Article
X(2) of the Switzerland-Philippines BIT made it a breach of the BIT for the host State ‘to
fail to observe binding commitments, including contractual commitments, which it had
assumed with regard to specific investments’, the umbrella clause did not have the effect
of converting ‘the extent or content of such obligations into an issue of international

305

law. Rather, the scope of the contractual obligations had to be determined in

accordance with the contract.*°°

248. Although the conclusion of the Tribunal that an umbrella clause might in principle be
capable of making a claim under a contract justiciable under a BIT is fortified by a review
of the cases cited by the Parties, as well as a number of others, which have involved
claims brought under an umbrella clause, in none of these cases was the relevant contract
entered into by the investor with an entity akin to the University.

20. In SGS Société Générale de Surveillance SA v Paraguay, the contract

249. Insofar as the Claimants’ claim under the umbrella clause relies on obligations on the
University under the 2003 Contract, given that the Tribunal has decided that the conduct
of the University that is the subject of these proceedings is not attributable to Ukraine

under the international law of State responsibility, the Claimants’ claim must fail.

250. In light of the conclusion reached above, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to consider
whether, even if the University’s conduct in question were attributable to Ukraine, the
Claimants’ umbrella clause claim would succeed. Nevertheless, in view of the
submissions of the Parties, and for the sake of completeness, the Tribunal has considered
it appropriate to expand its analysis to decide this issue.*”” Having done so, the Tribunal

has come to the conclusion that the Claimants’ claim would nonetheless fail.

251. The Tribunal takes the position that in order to present a contractual claim under the
umbrella clause in the BIT, the Claimants (here B&P) are required to have their rights and
obligations under the 2003 Contract determined by the applicable dispute settlement
forum, i.e., in accordance with Article 13(1) of the 2003 Contract, which refers the parties
to dispute settlement ‘in accordance to the Ukrainian legislation’ .* In other words, B&P
is obliged to follow the dispute settlement provision included in the 2003 Contract. The
Tribunal agrees with the ICSID tribunal in Bureau Veritas, Inspection, Valuation,
Assessment and Control BIVAC BV v Paraguay, which, in the context of the Netherlands

— Paraguay BIT, stated that:

‘Assuming that Article 3(4) does import the obligations under the Contract into the
BIT, giving this Tribunal jurisdiction to interpret and apply the Contract as such, then
it must have imported into the BIT all of the obligations owed by Paraguay to BIVAC
under the Contract. This would include not only the obligation to make payment of
invoices in accordance with the requirements of the Contract, but also the obligation
(implicit if nothing else) to ensure that the Tribunals of the City of Asuncién were

73

available to resolve any “conflict, controversy or claim which arises from or is
produced in relation to” the Contract.’*””

252. The present Tribunal agrees, and concludes that where a contractual claim is asserted
under an umbrella clause, the claimant in question must comply with any dispute

settlement provision included in that contract.

253. This conclusion is also consistent with that of the ICSID tribunal in SGS Société
Générale de Surveillance SA v Philippines, which held that the Switzerland — Philippines
BIT ‘did not purport to override the exclusive jurisdiction clause in the CISS Agreement,
or to give SGS an alternative route for the resolution of contractual claims which it was
bound to submit to the Philippine courts under that Agreement.’**° The ICSID tribunal

concluded that it

‘should not exercise its jurisdiction over a contractual claim when the parties have
already agreed on how such a claim is to be resolved, and have done so exclusively.
SGS should not be able to approbate and reprobate in respect of the same contract: if
it claims under the contract, it should comply with the contract in respect of the very
matter which is the foundation of its claim.’*”'

254. The Tribunal also agrees with the tribunals in Bureau Veritas, Inspection, Valuation,
Assessment and Control BIVAC BV v Paraguay and SGS Société Générale de
Surveillance SA v Philippines that the question whether the Claimants can submit
contractual claims under the umbrella clause in Article II(3)(c) of the BIT will depend on
an analysis of the contractual forum selection provision in question, namely Article 13(1)

of the 2003 Contract.
255. As has been set out above, Article 13(1) provides that:

‘All disputes between the Parties in connection to which no agreement has been
reached shall be settled in accordance to the Ukrainian legislation.’~ 3

74

256. The Claimants have submitted that Article 13(1) should be interpreted as requiring the

dispute between B&P and the University to be submitted for settlement under the BIT.
This is because the BIT ‘forms part of the national legislation of Ukraine’, and that it did
so in 2003, at the time of the conclusion of the 2003 Contract.**? For its part, the
Respondent rejects the Claimants’ position as ‘absurd’, and submits that under Article 12
of Ukraine’s Code of Commercial Procedure, the jurisdiction of the Ukraine courts
extends to ‘cases on disputes arising out conclusion, amendment, denunciation and

: - . 3334
execution of commercial contracts.

Further, the BIT only provides for the resolution
of disputes where the investor is the claimant. This means that, if Article 13(1) of the
2003 Contract were interpreted as requiring any disputes under the Contract to be
resolved in accordance with the BIT’s dispute settlement procedures, the University — one
of the parties to the 2003 Contract — would have no standing to assert a claim, for the BIT
does not cater for claims to be brought by the Contracting Parties against an investor, let

alone by an entity such as the University.**

257. The Tribunal accepts the position of the Respondent, and finds that Article 13(1) of

the 2003 Contract is an exclusive jurisdiction clause that requires any dispute arising
under the Contract to be submitted to the Ukrainian courts. The Tribunal observes that
this conclusion was also reached by three levels of Ukrainian courts in the litigation

concerning the termination of the 2003 Contract, although it had initially been rejected.

258. Were it necessary to decide this issue, the Tribunal would accordingly find that in

333,

order to invoke the umbrella clause in Article II(3)(c) of the BIT, the Claimants would
first have to submit their claims under the contract for settlement in accordance with the
jurisdictional clause in Article 13(1) of the 2003 Contract, i.e., to the Ukrainian courts.
On the facts of the present dispute, the dispute was, in fact, referred to the Ukrainian
courts, albeit in the context of the University’s claim for termination of the 2003 Contract,
rather than any claim by B&P that the University was in breach. The matter was
considered by three levels of Ukrainian courts, which decided that they had jurisdiction
over the dispute concerning the termination of the 2003 Contract, and terminated it in

accordance with applicable Ukrainian legislation.

259. It is thus apparent that the extent and content of B&P’s rights under the 2003 Contract
have been determined in accordance with the applicable dispute settlement procedure,
with the result being that the Ukrainian courts terminated the 2003 Contract. This having
occurred, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants could not now claim that B&P has rights
under the 2003 Contract that it can properly assert under the umbrella clause. Even
assuming that the University’s conduct was attributable to the Respondent, for these

reasons, the Tribunal would reject the Claimants’ claim for breach of Article II(3)(c).

D. Claim for Breach of Article II(3)(a) Based on the Conduct of the Ukrainian Courts
and the Ministry of Justice

1. Position of the Claimants

260. The Claimants’ fourth claim is that Ukraine is responsible for a breach of the
obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment contrary to Article II(3)(a) because the
Ukrainian courts failed to act consistently with the principle of res judicata during the
Ukrainian court proceedings initiated by the University to terminate the 2003 Contract.
The Claimants argue that, as a general principle of law, the principle of res judicata

applies in Ukrainian law, and forms part of the fair and equitable treatment standard.**°

261. The Claimants refer to a number of decisions of national and international courts and
tribunals as well as learned writings on the principle of res judicata and its status as a
general principle of law that is applicable within the Ukrainian legal order. The
Claimants argue that ‘res judicata is composed of three cumulative elements: (1) identity

of the parties to the dispute; (2) object of the claim; and (3) grounds for the claim.’3*”

262. As noted above, the factual basis of the Claimants’ claim for breach of Article
T1(3)(a) is that on 4 October 2007 the University initiated proceedings in the Kiev
Commercial Court by submitting a statement of claim (No 03-101) for termination of the

2003 Contract as well as the transfer of B&P’s 50% interest in the joint venture to the

University.*** On 29 October 2007, Judge Kovtun held that the Kiev Commercial Court
lacked jurisdiction to determine the case, because it fell within the jurisdiction of ICSID,
thus accepting B&P’s submissions. Judge Kovtun therefore did not accept the

«arcity? «33:
University’s claim.*”

263. Instead of appealing this decision, the University refiled the same statement of claim
on 2 November 2007 before a different judge (Judge Khrypun), and despite B&P’s
objections, the matter was set down for trial by Judge Khrypun’s Ruling of 23 November
2007.*° On 16 January 2008, Judge Khrypun issued a judgment which terminated the
2003 Contract.*4! Judge Khrypun rejected B&P’s submission that the BIT was applicable
to the dispute between the parties, and concluded that the 2003 Contract was
‘commercial’. For Judge Khrypun, it followed from this that the dispute was subject to
the jurisdiction of the Ukrainian courts, holding that: ‘According to the Article 12 of the
Code of Commercial Procedure of Ukraine, all the disputes arising upon amendment and
termination of commercial contracts belong to the jurisdiction of commercial courts,’

This judgment was clearly inconsistent with the Ruling of Judge Kovtun of 29 October

2007.

264. B&P appealed this decision, and through the subsequent appeals, B&P maintained its
objection to this breach of the res judicata principle. Hence, B&P elected hereafter not to
address the University’s claim for Termination of the 2003 Contract. After all appeals
were exhausted, Judge Khrypun’s decision stood, which had the effect of terminating the

2003 Contract, and led to the eviction of B&P from the Science-Hotel Complex.*4

265. The Claimants submit that the conduct of the Ukrainian courts evidences a clear
breach of the res judicata principle, which they describe as a fundamental procedural
safeguard which forms part of the fair and equitable treatment standard. The Claimants

observe that, as regards the proceedings initiated by the University on 2 October 2007

(which came before Judge Kovtun, who issued Ruling 05-6-6/1061 on 29 October 2007),
and the proceedings commenced on 2 November 2007 (which came before Judge
Khrypyn, who issued a Ruling on 23 November 2007, opening the case, and the judgment
on 16 January 2008), it can be seen that the parties were identical (B&P and the
University); the object of the University’s claim in both cases was identical (namely, to
obtain a determination that B&P had breached the 2003 Contract and to terminate the
2003 Contract), and the grounds for the claim were also identical (namely, B&P’s alleged
fundamental breach of the 2003 Contract). The Claimants also note that the documents

“Tn the

submitted before both courts were, for all material purposes, identical.
Claimants’ submission, ‘[t]his is a clear cut case of the same action being brought
twice.’*“° The Claimants contend that the Ukraine Ministry of Justice also ‘abetted’ the
Ukrainian courts’ breach, because representatives of the Ministry of Justice appeared
before the Ukrainian courts and permitted the non-observance of res judicata to go

3
uncorrected. *“”

266. Finally, the Claimants argue that the obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment
under Article II(3)(a) of the BIT should be interpreted in light of its context, which

348

includes the ‘effective means’ standard in Article II(7),” which provides that each Party

‘shall provide effective means of asserting claims and enforcing rights with respect to

: : . ee 93
investment, investment agreements, and investment authorisations. “9

2. Position of the Respondent

267. The Respondent argues that the various proceedings before the Kiev Commercial
Court were fair and transparent. In particular, in each of the proceedings, B&P had the
right to be heard, on the merits, the opportunity to participate, and the right of appeal, and
the proceedings followed the rule of law in all cases.**° In the Respondent’s submission,
any prejudice that the Claimants suffered can be attributed to its own litigation strategy of

maintaining its position that the BIT ‘divested the Ukrainian courts of any jurisdiction to

hear claims related to the [2003 Contract], but without addressing the fall-back position of

making defences on the merits to the University’s claim for termination.’*!

268. In consequence to the Claimants’ claims concerning the courts’ alleged non-

compliance with the principle of res judicata, the Respondent submits that after Judge
Kovtun had dismissed the University’s statement of claim on 29 October 2007, the

commencement of fresh proceedings by the University was consistent with Ukrainian
2

law.” The Respondent asserts that under the Ukrainian Code of Commercial Procedure,
‘a claim that is submitted to the courts is considered for preliminary review before the
court officially “opens” the case’, and prior to opening the case, ‘the court must be
satisfied that the materials presented by the plaintiff are “sufficient for acceptance of the
claim for consideration”.’** A statement of claim can be rejected on limited grounds,
including, in Article 62(1) of the Code of Commercial Procedure, if the ‘statement of
claim is not subject to consideration by the commercial courts of Ukraine.’** Where this
happens, the statement of claim is returned to the plaintiff with the ruling ‘on the refusal
to accept the statement of claim’, and no case is opened.**° But if the statement of claim
is accepted by the court, it issues a ruling ‘on the institution of court proceedings’, and an

ps coos «356
official case number is given to the proceedings.

269. The Respondent argues that the University’s statement of claim which it filed on 2

October 2007 was rejected by Judge Kovtun on his Ruling of 29 October 2007 under
Article 62(1) of the Code of Commercial Procedure. Accordingly, Judge Kovtun did not
open a case, or assign an official number to the case.*57 Upon receiving Judge Kovtun’s
Ruling of 29 October 2007, Ms Salenko, the Head of the University’s Legal Department,
filed a duplicate of the statement of claim, rather than appealing Judge Kovtun’s Ruling,

because Ukrainian law does not prohibit refiling the statement of claim.*°*

79

270.

The Respondent’s submissions on the effect of Judge Kovtun’s Ruling of 29 October

2007 were supported by the Expert Report of Professor Luts:

‘The [Code of Commercial Procedure] prohibits the repeated submission of a claim in
entirely different circumstances. The [Code of Commercial Procedure] distinguishes
situations where the claim was not accepted for consideration by the court and the
proceedings were not opened (dealt with in Article 62 of the [Code of Commercial
Procedure]) and situations where the proceedings were opened upon a claim, but
were, for specific reasons, terminated afterwards. In the latter case, [Code of
Commercial Procedure] expressly stipulates that the claimant may not submit a claim
related to the dispute between the same parties, over the same subject matter and
based on the same grounds (see Article 80 of the [Code of Commercial Procedure]).
Article 62 of the [Code of Commercial Procedure] contains no such stipulation.’*?

Professor Luts’ Export Report was not challenged by the Claimants, and he was not

called for cross-examination at the hearing. Nor did the Claimants provide any expert

evidence of Ukrainian law of their own on this matter.*”°

271. The Respondent thus submits that there is a cardinal distinction between Articles 62

and 80 of the Ukrainian Code of Commercial Procedure. The provision in Article 80 of

the Code of Commercial Procedure referred to by Professor Luts states that:

272.

‘[iJn case of termination of proceedings resubmission of an action to a commercial
court in dispute between the same parties, on the same subject, under the same
grounds shall not be accepted.”

On the basis of these provisions of the Ukrainian Code of Commercial Procedure, the
Respondent submits that Ukrainian courts’ subsequent acceptance of the refiled statement
of claim did not infringe the res judicata principle, for as a matter of Ukrainian civil
procedure, res judicata does not attach to the dismissal of a statement of claim in a case
that was never opened.* Accordingly, a ruling under Article 62 which refuses to accept
a statement of claim is a procedural decision which does not conclusively determine any
of the issues in dispute; but if a claim has been accepted for consideration and is later

dismissed under Article 80, that claim cannot be reconsidered.° In addition, the

Respondent submits that this is consistent with international practice, for only final

judgments have preclusive effect.>™

273. The Respondent further submits that the Ukrainian courts properly exercised
jurisdiction over the dispute between the University and B&P. Article 13(1) of the 2003
Contract provided that: ‘All disputes between the Parties in connection to which no
agreement has been reached shall be settled in accordance to the Ukrainian legislation.’
Article 15(1) further provided that: ‘In cases provided for in this Contract, the parties are

governed by the current legislation of Ukraine.’ 365

274. The Respondent notes that under Article 12 of the Code of Commercial Procedure,
the Kiev Commercial Court’s subject-matter jurisdiction includes ‘cases on disputes
arising out conclusion, amendment, denunciation and execution of commercial
contracts’,* and as the 2003 Contract was found by the Kiev Commercial Court to be a
‘commercial contract’, the University’s application for termination of the 2003 Contract
is naturally within the jurisdiction of the Kiev Commercial Court. As has been noted
above, the Respondent rejects the Claimants’ submission that the dispute between B&P
and the University was falling within the scope of the BIT, and accordingly subject to the
jurisdiction of ICSID, as ‘absurd’, for the BIT does not provide for the Respondent, as
host State of the investment, to commence a claim against the Claimants. Rather, the
BIT, like the vast majority of investment treaties, confers a right on the investor to bring a
claim against the host State of the investment in international arbitration.**’ The
Respondent also notes that the Claimants’ insistence on pursuing their argument that the
Kiev Commercial Court lacked jurisdiction through the various proceedings and appeals
in the Ukrainian courts, and their own strategic decision not to address the merits of the
University’s termination of the 2003 Contract ‘serves to undermine all of their [fair and
equitable treatment] claims regarding the conduct of the Ukrainian court proceedings.’***

The Respondent further notes that, for the same reason, the Claimants cannot maintain

any claim for breach of the ‘effective means’ obligation in Article II(7) of the BIT,

whether in support of their claim for breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard,

or as a stand-alone claim.*°

In the Respondent’s submission, the Claimants failed to
avail themselves fully of the remedies available before the Ukrainian courts, and that, in
the absence of a denial of justice (which the Claimants have not substantiated), the

Tribunal should not revisit the findings of the Ukrainian courts.*”°

275. Finally, the Respondent rejects the Claimants’ suggestion that representatives of the
Ministry of Justice ‘abetted’ the Ukrainian courts in any breach of Article II(3)(a) of the
BIT is unsustainable, because the Ministry of Justice representatives ‘did not in any way
prevent B&P from presenting its case before the Ukrainian courts or otherwise dictate the

outcome of the termination proceedings.” al

3. Determination of the Tribunal

276. The Tribunal notes that the Claimants’ claim concerning the conduct of the Ukrainian
courts and the Ministry of Justice in relation to the termination proceedings before the
Ukrainian courts essentially concerns whether the initiation by the University of fresh
proceedings on 2 November 2007, and the Kiev Commercial Court’s acceptance of those
fresh proceedings, amounted to a violation of the res judicata principle and consequently
a breach of the obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment contrary to Article

11(3)(a) of the BIT.

277. The Tribunal accepts the Claimants’ submission that res judicata is a general

principle of law.*” The Respondent does not seek to contest this.

278. The principle of res judicata also is contained in the Ukrainian Code of Commercial
Procedure. That Code draws a distinction between a ruling of a Ukrainian court that, for
instance, ‘the statement of claim is not subject to consideration by the commercial courts
of Ukraine’ (Article 62), in which case the court’s ruling does not have the effect of
opening a case, and the ruling does not have any preclusive effect; and a decision of a

Ukrainian court that terminates proceedings (Article 80), to which res judicata would

attach. Professor Luts’ expert report in support of this position was not challenged by the

Claimants.

279. The Tribunal accepts the testimony of Professor Luts, and finds that the Kiev
Commercial Court’s acceptance of the University’s statement of claim, filed on 2

November 2007, did not violate the res judicata principle under applicable Ukrainian law.

280. The Claimants deny the relevance of Ukrainian law on the basis that ‘the issue is

governed by international law.’°73

However, the Tribunal considers that in order to
determine whether the Respondent is in breach of the fair and equitable treatment
standard, the Tribunal is required to assess, inter alia, whether the law applicable to the
proceedings before the Ukrainian courts to which B&P was a party (namely Ukrainian
municipal law) was properly and fairly applied. The Tribunal considers that this
primarily is a question to be determined under Ukrainian law. It is only in a situation
where those proceedings would ‘[offend] a sense of judicial propriety’ that it would be
open to the Tribunal to find that those proceedings did not meet international standards.*”*
However, to apply a provision of Ukrainian law in a non-discriminatory fashion will
rarely give rise to a breach of an international standard, such as the fair and equitable
treatment obligation in Article II(3)(a). In this regard, the Tribunal is not assisted by

Article II(7) of the BIT, which contains a separate substantive standard of protection.

281. The Tribunal has no reason to reject the testimony of Professor Luts. The application
of the res judicata principle in Ukrainian civil procedure may or may not differ from that
in other jurisdictions, but it does not at all reach the threshold for offending a sense of
judicial propriety. Equally, the fact that certain legal systems recognise that it is only
final judgments that attract the status of res judicata, rather than all procedural decisions

made by a court or tribunal, also does not offend such a principle.*”°

282. For these reasons, it does not appear to the Tribunal that it has any ground to reject the
decision of the Ukrainian courts as correctly stating the position under Ukrainian law on

the res judicata issue.

575 As was submitted by the Respondent: Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 87.

283. The Tribunal does not find that the Claimants were in any way denied due process in
the various proceedings before the Ukrainian courts. To the contrary, B&P had every
opportunity to present its case. Its submissions to jurisdictional defences that the
subsequent proceedings were inconsistent with Judge Kovtun’s Ruling of 29 October
2007 and the principle of res judicata, and its claim that the dispute arising out of the
2003 Contract was subject to ICSID jurisdiction, and was outside the jurisdiction of the
Ukrainian courts. It might also have presented defences on merits issues, but elected not

to do so.

284. In this regard, it seems to the Tribunal that the Claimants are bound by their litigation
strategy and its consequences. The Claimants made a conscious election not to raise non-
jurisdictional defences. Indeed, that position was maintained before the Tribunal and in
post-hearing submissions. Having elected to proceed in that way, the Claimants cannot

now contest the result.

285. Finally, the Tribunal observes that the evidence does not establish that the
representatives of the Ministry of Justice in any way ‘abetted’ the Ukrainian courts in any
breach of the BIT. The representatives of the Ministry of Justice did not hinder B&P’s
ability to appear and make submissions in the Ukrainian court proceedings, and even if
they advanced a position consistent with that presented by the University, the Claimants
have failed to demonstrate that this was a breach of Ukraine’s obligation under Article

11(3)(a).

286. Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects the Claimants’ claims for breach of Article II(3)(a)

arising out of the Ukrainian court proceedings.

Vill. COSTS

287. The BIT does not contain a rule on the allocation of costs. The ICSID Convention

provides in Article 61(2) that:

84

‘In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties
otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the
proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and
expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities
of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.’*

288. This provision, together with Rule 28(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, gives the
Tribunal broad discretion to decide on the allocation of costs. It does not contain a rule
that ‘costs follow the event’, in the sense that the unsuccessful party is required to pay the
successful party’s costs; nor does the broad body of arbitral practice suggest that this is

the approach which should be followed in ICSID arbitration proceedings.

289. The Respondent’s stated costs, apart from ICSID fees of $303,945, amount to USD
914,920 and UAH 17,331 (which the Tribunal understands to amount to $2,101). The
Claimants’ costs are in the order of USD 1,322,770 (exclusive of ICSID fees). It appears
to the Tribunal that it may regard the costs of each party as having been reasonably

incurred.

290. In the result, the Respondent has prevailed in this dispute. The Claimants’ claims
have been rejected in their entirety. The Respondent has requested that the Tribunal order
that the Claimants bear all of the costs incurred by the Respondent in this arbitration. It
makes this request in view of the costs incurred in, inter alia, arranging better English
language translations of exhibits referred to by the Claimants; the two delays in the
scheduling of the hearing which were occasioned by the Claimants’ requests for extension
of time to complete their Reply, and the Claimants’ subsequent change of counsel; the
Claimants’ insistence that the hearing take place in Washington DC when most of the
witnesses were located in Europe; and the work involved in preparing defences to various
claims and arguments advanced by the Claimants which were later abandoned. For their
part, the Claimants request that, in the event that their claims are dismissed, the parties

should be ordered to bear their own costs.
291. The Tribunal notes that in some cases, where the unsuccessful claimant has engaged

in some form of abusive conduct, arbitral tribunals have ordered that the claimant pay all

376 ICSID Convention, Art 61(2).
85

or a significant part of the respondent’s costs.°77

The Tribunal does not consider,
however, that the present case falls into this category. The Claimants had serious and
credible claims under the BIT that were not presented in a way which raised questions of
procedural propriety, and the Claimants’ counsel represented their clients in a
professional manner at the hearings. The Tribunal therefore rejects the Respondent’s

request that a ‘costs follow the event’ approach be applied in a blanket way in this case.

292. The Tribunal is conscious, however, that certain costs were incurred by the
Respondent in responding to the Claimants’ case as the arbitration progressed, as has
been noted above, and that the substantive hearing in this arbitration had to be delayed
twice due to requests from the Claimants. In all the circumstances, the Tribunal considers
it is appropriate to order the Claimants to make a contribution to these additional costs
that would not have been incurred but for the actions of the Claimants. The Tribunal
determines that a reasonable sum in this respect, excluding the Respondent’s share of

ICSID’s fees, is one-sixth of the Respondent’s costs, rounded to the sum of USD 150,000.

IX. DISPOSITIVE PART

The Tribunal determines as follows:

1. Each of the Claimants’ claims is within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, and
the Claimants’ claim under Article I1(3)(c) is admissible.

2. The conduct of the Ukrainian Courts, the CRO and the Ministry of Justice is
attributable to Ukraine, but the conduct of the University that is the subject
of these proceedings is not attributable to Ukraine.

3. With regard to the Claimants’ claims:

a. the Respondent has not breached its obligations under Article I1(3)(a)
or Article III of the BIT by the conduct of the CRO.
b. the Respondent has not breached Article II(3)(a) of the BIT through
the conduct of the University.
c. the Respondent has not breached Article 11(3)(c) of the BIT through
the conduct of the University as regards the 2003 Contract.
the Respondent has not breached Article II(3)(a) of the BIT through

&

the conduct of the Ukrainian courts and the conduct of the Ministry of
Justice.
4. On the issue of costs, the Claimants are ordered to pay to the Respondent the
amount of USD 150,000.
