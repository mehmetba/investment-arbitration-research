Global Telecom Holding S.A.E. v. Canada (ICSID Case No. ARB/16/16)
Procedural Order No. 9

L BACKGROUND

1. On 1 June 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, which set forth the Tribunal’s

decision on each of the Parties’ respective requests for document production.

2. Since the issuance of Procedural Order No. 3, the Tribunal has issued Procedural Order

Nos. 4, 5, 6 and 8, addressing the Parties’ disputes on issues of legal privilege.

3. On 18 March 2019, GTH wrote to the Tribunal, challenging the completeness of the
Respondent’s document production pursuant to Procedural Order No. 3. Together with its
letter, GTH submitted Appendices A to M and exhibit C-257. GTH informed the Tribunal
that, in July 2016, its Canadian counsel had submitted a request to the Ministry for
Innovation, Science and Economic Development (“ISED”)! pursuant to Canada’s Access
to Information Act. In November 2016, GTH’s Canadian counsel challenged ISED’s
response with the Information Commissioner. According to GTH, the Commissioner found
the complaint to be well founded, and “noted that over 500,000 pages of documents have
been identified as potentially relevant, but had not yet been reviewed.”* Then, on 8 March
2019, GTH’s Canadian counsel received 625 pages (55 documents) from ISED (the “ATI
Documents”). GTH alleges that “at least 15 of the newly received ATI documents had not
been produced to GTH in the Arbitration despite their obvious relevance to several of the

issues in dispute,” and considers this “clear evidence that Canada’s productions were

deficient.”
4. In light of this issue, GTH requests the following relief:

In the first instance, GTH respectfully requests that the Tribunal
order Canada to confirm the following:

i. That Canada’s document collection efforts to comply with its
obligations under PO 3, involved the collection and review of the

' ISED was formerly known as Industry Canada.

2 GTH’s Letter of 18 March 2019, p. 3 and Appendix A, Letter from Information Commissioner of Canada to Aird
& Berlis, 14 December 2018, pp. 5-6.

> GTH’s Letter of 18 March 2019, p. 3.

Global Telecom Holding S.A.E. v. Canada (ICSID Case No. ARB/16/16)
Procedural Order No. 9

500,000 pages identified by ISED as potentially responsive to Ms.
Backman’s ATI requests.

ii, That Canada undertook good faith efforts to ensure that all
relevant documents responsive to PO 3 were collected and reviewed,
and to detail the procedure used, including the steps undertaken to
collect and review electronic records and to preserve the parent-
attachment relationships in both electronic and hard copy records.

iii. That Canada has produced all draft documents responsive to PO
3, where the draft is not an exact duplicate of a document already
produced.

In the event Canada is unable to confirm the above (or its
confirmation is unsatisfactory), GTH respectfully further requests
that the Tribunal order Canada to immediately remedy the
deficiencies in its disclosure, undertake a review of any documents
not yet reviewed that could be responsive to GTH’s document
requests, and produce such documents as soon as possible. If Canada
fails to do so, the Tribunal should be willing to adopt the appropriate
adverse inferences with respect to any such failures.

(.... ) in the interest of procedural fairness and propriety, as well as
parity of arms, in the event that Canada produces additional
documents as a result of its earlier failure to satisfy its disclosure
obligations, GTH respectfully requests permission to submit
additional factual exhibits on the record either as part of the post-
hearing submission process (if any) or as standalone exhibits.*

5. Upon receipt of GTH’s letter, the President of the Tribunal wrote to the Parties to encourage
them to confer together with an aim to reaching a consensus on the matters outlined in
GTH’s letter. In the event the Parties were unable to agree, the President invited Canada to

provide its response by open of business on 22 March 2019 (Washington, D.C. time).

6. By email of 22 March 2019, Canada informed the Tribunal that the Parties were still
consulting in an attempt to resolve the matters addressed in GTH’s letter, and requested a
one-day extension to file its response. Canada noted that GTH had consented to the
extension request. On the same day, the President of the Tribunal informed the Parties that

the extension was granted.

IL.

Global Telecom Holding S.A.E. v. Canada (ICSID Case No. ARB/16/16)
Procedural Order No. 9
By letter of 23 March 2019, Canada informed the Tribunal that the Parties had been unable
to resolve their disagreement and set out its response to GTH’s letter of 18 March 2019.
Together with its letter, Canada submitted Appendices A and B. Appendix A contained a
Schedule of both Parties’ positions on each of the 15 ATI Documents that GTH had
identified as being wrongly withheld from Canada’s document production (separated into
ten categories). That Schedule is contained as Annex A to the Order, together with the

Tribunal’s determinations in respect of each document.

In its letter, Canada acknowledged that two of the ATI documents should have been
produced, but denied that this could be considered evidence that Canada had carried out a
flawed approach to its document production. Canada stated that “[i]f anything, the

Claimant received more documents than what it was entitled to, not less.”*

In addition, Canada responded as follows to GTH’s request that Canada confirm it has

reviewed the 500,000 pages referenced by the Information Commissioner:

Contrary to what GTH implies in its letter to the Tribunal, ISED has
not yet collected half a million pages of documents. That number is
merely an estimate of the number of pages that may have to be
collected and reviewed by ISED in response to GTH’s access to
information request. As such, Canada is unable to confirm, as GTH
requests, that it has collected or reviewed the documents that ISED
has collected to respond to GTH’s access to information request.
Moreover, GTH’s access to information requests are broader than
its document production requests in this arbitration.°

ANALYSIS

As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal notes that GTH’s request is admissible. Whilst
Canada’s alleged deficiencies in complying with Procedural Order No. 3 go back at least
to 26 November 2018 when Canada asserted that it conducted the necessary search for

responsive documents, it is only when GTH received the ATI Documents on 8 March 2019

Procedural Order No. 9
that it was able to determine that the production was incomplete.’ In its letter of 23 March
2019, Canada admits that two wrongly withheld documents should have been produced as

being responsive to the document production order issued in Procedural Order No. 3.°

Regarding GTH’s request for relief in Section B of its letter of 18 March 2019, the Tribunal
does not consider it appropriate to require Canada to provide the confirmation requested
by GTH in Section B(i) when Canada underscores that the universe of 500,000 potentially
responsive documents is yet to be collected, and therefore to exist. Said differently, the
benchmark against which the Tribunal is asked to decide on Canada’s compliance, or lack
thereof, is yet inexistent. In light of this fact, the Tribunal notes with satisfaction Canada’s
unqualified statement of compliance with all of its document production obligations stated
in its letter of 15 March 2019 and finds no compelling reason further to require an
additional statement of Canada that mirrors the terms of the relief set out by GTH in Section

B(i).2

Likewise, the Tribunal determines that Canada’s unqualified statement of compliance with
all of its document production obligations as set out in its letter of 15 March 2019 satisfies
GTH’s request for relief in Section B(ii). The Tribunal does not consider it necessary to
require a different, more formal, statement absent evidence of a delinquent withholding of
responsive documents or of a flawed search process for responsive documents. The onus
on evidencing that Canada’s unqualified statement its letter of 15 March 2019 is incorrect

or utterly misleading falls on GTH.

Concerning GTH’s request for relief in Section B(iii), the Tribunal has been presented with
no evidence that the Parties agreed that drafts of responsive documents shall not be
produced where the final responsive document is produced. Canada could have sought
confirmation of its purported understanding of the Parties’ agreement as narrated in

footnote 9 of its letter of 23 March 2019. Absent an evidence of a consensus between the

7 GTH’s Letter of 18 March 2019, Appendix C, Letter of 13 March 2019 from Mr. Rahim Moloo to Ms. Sylvie Tabet.

* Canada’s letter of 23 March 2019, p. 3.

° GTH’s Letter of 18 March 2019, Appendix G, Letter of 15 March 2019 from Mr. Jean-Francois Hébert to Mr.
Rahim Moloo (“we reiterate that we have fully complied with all of our document production obligations in this
arbitration.”).

Global Telecom Holding S.A.E. v. Canada (ICSID Case No. ARB/16/16)
Procedural Order No. 9
Parties on that issue, the Tribunal notes that its document production order in Procedural
order No. 3 does not differentiate between drafts and final documents. Any responsive
document must be produced, whether it is in a draft or a final version. Canada cannot
arrogate the right to determine which drafts do not substantially differ from the final
version that has been produced, and therefore be legitimately withheld. Accordingly,
Canada is ordered to produce forthwith on a rolling basis all responsive documents that are
available in a draft version regardless of the materiality of the difference between the draft

and the produced final version.

GTH’s request for leave to produce additional evidence after the hearing is dismissed
absent a sufficiently particularized application that would warrant such an extraordinary
measure happening after the end of the unique evidentiary hearing scheduled in this

arbitration.

Finally, as noted above, the Tribunal’s observations with regard to each of the 15 ATI
Documents alleged by GTH to have been wrongly withheld are contained in the Schedule
at Annex A to this Order and constitute an inseparable part thereof.

DECISION

For the reasons stated above, the Tribunal decides as follows:

a. GTH’s request for relief in Section B(i) of its letter of 18 March 2019 is dismissed.

b. GTH’s request for relief in Section B(ii) of its letter of 18 March 2019 is dismissed.

c. In respect of GTH’s request for relief in Section B(iii) of its letter of 18 March 2019,
Canada is ordered to produce forthwith on a rolling basis all responsive documents that
are available in a draft version regardless of the materiality of the difference between

the draft and the produced final version.

d. GTH’s request for leave to produce additional evidence after the hearing is dismissed

absent a sufficiently particularized application.
