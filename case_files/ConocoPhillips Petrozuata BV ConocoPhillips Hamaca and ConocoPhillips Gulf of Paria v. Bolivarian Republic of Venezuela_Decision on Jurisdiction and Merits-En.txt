L INTRODUCTION

1. This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on the basis of (a) the Venezuelan Law on the
Promotion and Protection of Investments (Decreto con Rango y Fuerza de Ley de Promocion y
Proteccion de Inversiones) published on 22 October 1999 (the “Investment Law”);! and (b) the
Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom
of the Netherlands and the Republic of Venezuela signed on 22 October 1991 (the “BIT” or the
“Treaty”),” and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and

Nationals of Other States, dated 18 March 1965 (the “ICSID Convention”).

2. The dispute concerns the interests of Claimants in two extra-heavy oil projects located in
the region in Venezuela known as the Orinoco Oil Belt (Faja Petrolifera del Orinoco) — the
“Petrozuata Project” and the “Hamaca Project”, and in an offshore project for the extract of

light to medium crude oil — the “Corocoro Project”.

3. The Petrozuata Project was conducted through the Petrozuata Association, which was
granted the rights to engage in the exploration, development, production, exploitation,
transportation and upgrading of extra-heavy crude oil, and the marketing of the resulting crude

oils and products, in the Zuata area of the Orinoco Oil Belt.?

4. The Hamaca Project was conducted through the Hamaca Association, which held the
tights to engage in the exploration, development, production, exploitation, blending,

industrialisation, transportation, refining and upgrading and commercialisation of extra-heavy

crude oil, and the transportation and use or disposal of by-products, in the Hamaca area of the

Orinoco Oil Belt.*

5.

The Corocoro Project was one of eight joint ventures for the exploration and production

of conventional crude oil under Profit Sharing Agreements.” The Corocoro Project was

conducted through the Corocoro Development Consortium, which had the rights to explore,

discover, evaluate, develop and exploit commercial hydrocarbons reservoirs within the Gulf of

Paria West, including the handling of any production from such reservoirs and the

transportation of production.®

6.

The principal events on which the Claimants base their claims for compensation under

the Investment Law and the Treaty include the following:’

Venezuela through various actions increased the effective royalty rate applicable
to the extra-heavy oil production of the Petrozuata and Hamaca Associations from

one percent to 33.33 percent.

Venezuela amended the tax law so that the tax on income derived from extra-

heavy oil production was raised from 34 percent to 50 percent.

Venezuela by Decree Law (i) mandated PdVSA to assume operational control of
oil projects, including the Petrozuata, Hamaca and Corocoro Projects, and
(ii) provided for cancellation of the exploration, production and
commercialisation rights of the Associations and the Corocoro Project, and the
transfer of such rights to mixed companies controlled by PaVSA — “Empresas
Mixtas” — on terms to be agreed by 26 June 2007. The compensation provided

for in the Decree Law was a minority interest in the Empresas Mixtas.

On | May 2007, a PdVSA subsidiary took control over operations at the Projects.

On 26 June 2007, the four-month period for reaching agreement set in the Decree

Law expired and Venezuela nationalised ConocoPhillips’ interests in the Projects.

The factual context and details of these measures are discussed further at Section IV.F below.

9. The Claimants and the Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the

“Parties”. The Parties’ respective representatives and their addresses are listed above.

Ill. . PROCEDURAL HISTORY

10. On 2 November 2007, the Claimants submitted to the Centre a Request for Arbitration

against Venezuela pursuant to Article 36 of the ICSID Convention.

11. The proceeding was brought under (a) the Venezuelan Law on the Promotion and
Protection of Investments (Decreto con Rango y Fuerza de Ley de Promocién y Proteccién de
Inversiones) published on 22 October 1999; and (b) the Agreement on Encouragement and
Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic

of Venezuela signed on 22 October 1991.

12. On 13 December 2007, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for
Arbitration in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and Rules 6(1)(a) and
7(a) of the Institution Rules. Pursuant to Rule 7(d) of the Institution Rules, the Secretary-
General invited the Parties to proceed as soon as possible with the constitution of the tribunal in

accordance with Articles 37 to 40 of the ICSID Convention.

13. By letter dated 12 February 2008, the Claimants requested that — in the absence of an
agreement on the procedure for constitution of the tribunal —the tribunal be constituted in
accordance with Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. By separate letter to the
Respondent, the Claimants nominated, Mr L. Yves Fortier, CC, QC, a national of Canada, as
arbitrator and proposed the appointment of Mr Emmanuel Gaillard, a national of France, as

President of the Tribunal.

14. By letter dated 20 February 2008, the Centre notified the Parties that Mr Fortier had
accepted his appointment as arbitrator and provided a copy of Mr Fortier’s declaration made in

accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2).

15. By letter dated 11 March 2008, the Respondent agreed that the tribunal would be

composed of three arbitrators, the first two to be appointed by the parties and the president to be

5

appointed by agreement of the parties, in consultation with the two party-appointed arbitrators.
The Respondent noted that it did not agree with the proposed appointment of Mr Gaillard as
president of the tribunal, and requested additional time to designate its party-appointed

arbitrator.

16. By letter dated 13 March 2008, the Claimants objected to the Respondent’s request for
the extension of the deadline for appointment of its party-appointed arbitrator. The Claimants
also indicated that they did not consent to the Respondent’s proposed procedure for
appointment of the president of the tribunal and requested that, in accordance with Article 38 of
the ICSID Convention, the Chairman of the Administrative Council appoint an arbitrator on

behalf of the Respondent and a president of the tribunal.

17. By letter dated 14 March 2008, the Centre informed the Parties that, pursuant to Article
38 of the ICSID Convention, they would soon be consulted with respect to the appointment of
the remaining arbitrators. The Centre also confirmed that, until the process for appointment
under Article 38 was completed, the missing arbitrators could be appointed in accordance with

Article 37(2)(b) of the Convention.

18. On 31 March 2008, the Respondent designated Sir Ian Brownlie, CBE, QC, a national of
the United Kingdom, as arbitrator. By letter dated 3 April 2008, ICSID informed the Parties
that Sir Ian Brownlie had accepted his appointment as arbitrator and provided a copy of Sir Ian
Brownlie’s declaration and accompanying statement made in accordance with ICSID

Arbitration Rule 6(2).

19. By letter dated 15 April 2008, the Respondent stated that it was hopeful that the Parties
would reach agreement on an appointee for president of the tribunal and suggested that ICSID
refrain for a reasonable period of time from proposing a candidate. On 16 April 2008, the
Claimants objected to any further delay in the appointment of a president of the tribunal and
urged the Chairman of the Administrative Council to proceed with that appointment. On 2 May
2008, each Party informed the Centre that no agreement had been reached for the appointment

of a presiding arbitrator.

20. By letter dated 8 May 2008, the Centre informed the Parties that the Permanent Court of
Arbitration would be asked to provide the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council with

a recommendation on the appointment of the presiding arbitrator.

21. On 29 May 2008, the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration invited the
Parties to provide their views regarding the profile of an appropriate presiding arbitrator. Each

Party provided its observations on 5 June 2008.

22. By letter dated 13 June 2008, the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of
Arbitration informed the Parties of its intention to recommend to the Chairman of the
Administrative Council that Judge Kenneth Keith, a national of New Zealand, be appointed as

presiding arbitrator, and invited them to make comments on this proposal.

23. On 1 July 2008, the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration
recommended to the Chairman of the Administrative Council that he appoint Judge Keith as the
presiding arbitrator. On 11 July 2008, the Centre informed the Parties that the Chairman of the
Administrative Council had appointed Judge Keith as the president of the tribunal. By letter

dated 18 July 2008, Judge Keith accepted his appointment as the presiding arbitrator.

39. Having considered the Parties’ observations, the Tribunal, by letter dated 7 May 2009,

54. By letter dated 12 April 2010, the Tribunal denied the Claimants’ Second Request for the
Production of Documents and also convened a telephone conference to be held on 15 April

2010 to discuss the Claimants’ Exhibit Submission of 31 March 2010.

Tribunal, following Ms Yannaca-Small departure from ICSID’s Secretariat.

68. On 4 October 2011, Mr Fortier wrote to the Secretary-General of ICSID to make the
disclosure that the firm of which he was a partner, Norton Rose OR LLP, had announced that it
would merge with the firm Macleod Dixon LLP, with effect from 1 January 2012. Mr Fortier
stated that it had been brought to his attention as a result of conflict checks that had been
conducted that Macleod Dixon LLP had provided and continued to provide legal services to
ConocoPhillips Company, and was also acting adverse to the interests of the Respondent in
other matters, including in a separate ICSID arbitration. On the same day, the Centre

communicated Mr Fortier’s disclosure to the Parties.

69. By letter dated 5 October 2011, the Respondent proposed the disqualification of
Mr Fortier pursuant to Article 57 of the ICSID Convention.

70. On 6 October 2011, the Centre informed the Parties that the proceeding was suspended in

accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6).

71. On 12 October 2011, the President of the Tribunal, having consulted with Professor Abi-
Saab, set a timetable for the Parties to submit observations and Mr Fortier to furnish

explanations as provided for under Arbitration Rule 9.

72. On 13 October 2011, the Respondent made a further submission and provided details of

the legal authorities upon which it relied in support of its disqualification proposal.

73. On 14 October 2011, the Parties were requested by Judge Keith and Professor Abi-Saab
to submit any observations that they wished to make within the framework of the existing

briefing schedule.

74. On 18 October 2011, Mr Fortier informed Judge Keith, Professor Abi-Saab and the
Parties of his decision to resign from the firm Norton Rose OR LLP effective as of 31
December 2011. Mr Fortier confirmed that, as of that date, his relationship with the firm would

cease entirely.

75. By letter dated 19 October 2011, the Claimants asserted that, in light of Mr Fortier’s 18
October 2011 letter, no basis remained for the Respondent’s proposal to disqualify Mr Fortier

and invited the Respondent to confirm the same.

76. On 19 October 2011, the Respondent stated that it was considering the issue and

requested responses to the questions raised in its 13 October 2011 submission.

77. By letter dated 24 October 2011, the Respondent stated that it continued to propose the

disqualification of Mr Fortier as an arbitrator.

78. The Claimants submitted their Reply to the Respondent’s Disqualification Proposal on 25
October 2011.

79. On 27 October 2011, in view of the Parties’ correspondence of 26 October 2011, the
Parties were requested to make their further submissions within the timetable established by

Judge Keith and Professor Abi-Saab on 12 October 2011.

80. On 28 October 2011, Mr Fortier requested an extension of the date for submission of his
explanations. On 31 October 2011, Judge Keith and Professor Abi-Saab granted the extension

requested.

81. On 18 November 2011, Mr Fortier submitted his further explanations in connection with

the Respondent’s disqualification proposal.

82. On 1 December, 2011, the Respondent submitted its final observations in response to the
Claimants’ submission of 25 October 2011 and Mr Fortier’s explanations of 18 November

2011.

83. Claimants submitted their Additional Observations Concerning the Respondent’s

Disqualification Proposal on 2 December 2011.

84. In their decision dated 27 February 2012, Judge Keith and Professor Abi-Saab rejected
the Respondent’s proposal for disqualification of Mr Fortier. By letter of even date, the Centre

informed the Parties that the proceeding was no longer suspended and had resumed.

85. The challenge and the process leading to its determination had as a consequence a further

delay in the deliberation of the members of the Tribunal.

86. On 28 February 2012, the Respondent submitted evidence regarding recent developments
that it claimed had a bearing on issues in the case relating to quantum. On the same day, the
Claimants requested the Tribunal to rule that the Respondent’s submission was inadmissible and
otherwise to have an opportunity to respond. Later that day, the Respondent made observations
regarding the Claimants’ request to declare the Respondent’s submission inadmissible. By
letter dated 2 March 2012, the Tribunal admitted the Respondent’s submission and invited the
Claimants to submit observations on the recent developments that the Respondent’s submission
addressed. On 16 March 2012, the Claimants submitted observations on the Respondent’s
submission. On 18 March 2012, the Respondent submitted further observations on its
submission. On 19 March 2012, the Claimants objected to the Respondent’s most recent
observations and requested an opportunity to respond. By letter dated 20 March 2012, the
Tribunal invited the Claimants to provide any further comments that they might have. On 27

March 2012, the Claimants filed their supplemental observations. On 28 March 2012, the

17

Respondent indicated that it would be ready to conduct a further hearing on quantum issues

should the Tribunal have questions regarding the materials that it had submitted.

87. By letter dated 25 May 2012, the Claimants requested permission from the Tribunal to
submit new information. By letter dated 8 June 2012, the Respondent submitted its
observations on the Claimants’ request. On 4 July 2012, the Tribunal granted the Claimants’
request and set a timetable for the Claimants to submit the relevant evidence and for the
Respondent to submit a response to that evidence. The Claimants filed their new evidence on
11 July 2012. On 25 July 2012, the Respondent provided its responsive observations. On 3
August and 5 August 2012, the Claimants and the Respondent, respectively, submitted further
observations. By letter dated 7 August 2012, the Tribunal indicated that it did not at that time

require additional information but would revert to the Parties should the need arise.

88. On 22 October 2012, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it had made significant

progress in its decision-making and envisaged issuing findings early in 2013.

89. On 21 November 2012, Mr Gonzalo Flores was re-appointed as Secretary of the

Tribunal, following Ms Janet Whittaker’s departure from ICSID’s Secretariat.

90. By letter of 27 December 2012, Respondent brought to the Tribunal’s attention a decision
on liability issued on 14 December 2012 in ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5 (Burlington Resources,
Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador). Claimants’ submitted observations to Respondent’s letter on 3

observations to Respondent’s letter on 18 February 2013 and, on that same date, Respondent

submitted a brief reply.

made with respect to its deliberation, informing the parties of a medical proceeding undergone

by Professor Georges Abi-Saab and of the impact of such proceeding in the progress of the

Tribunal’s work.

IV. THE FACTUAL BACKGROUND TO THE DISPUTE

93. This summary provides a general outline of the facts relevant to those aspects of the
Parties’ dispute that are considered in this Decision. '© The facts relevant to the remaining issues
for consideration by the Tribunal will be addressed in the context of future findings by the

Tribunal.

94. Additionally, this summary is not intended to address all of the factual issues of potential
relevance. Specifically, it does not exhaustively cover all factual matters arising from the
testimony of witnesses given at the hearing. The Tribunal may address additional facts from

that testimony or otherwise in the course of its analysis of the Parties’ claims.

A. THE VENEZUELAN OIL INDUSTRY AND THE PRE-EXISTING LEGAL
FRAMEWORK
95. Venezuela is home to one of the world’s largest oil reserves, located in the Orinoco Oil
Belt in Eastern Venezuela, north of the Orinoco River.'” The deposits are of extra-heavy oil,
which “is a tar-like substance that acts as a dense liquid underground, but solidifies once
brought to the surface, and contains large amounts of sulfur and other impurities”. '*
96. The Venezuelan petroleum industry is a strategic sector of vital importance to the
national economy. '® article 302 of the Venezuelan Constitution gives special recognition to the

petroleum industry:”°

The Tribunal notes that certain materials have been submitted by both the Claimants and the
Respondent. In such instances, no significance should be attached to the Tribunal’s citation to
one or other of the Party’s exhibits.

the Industry and the Trade of Hydrocarbons (the “Nationalisation Law’), nationalising its
hydrocarbons sector. Pursuant to Article 1 of the Nationalisation Law, which superseded the

1971 Law of Reversion, the State reserved to itself:?°

out activities in the Venezuelan petroleum industry largely on their own, without the equity

participation of private parties, for about the next 15 years.*°

B. THE OIL OPENING

102. Due, inter alia, to a lack of the technology required for exploiting heavy and extra-heavy
oil and the high investment costs, Venezuela was unable properly to commercialise its large oil

reserves in the Orinoco Oil Belt,”!

or to explore oil production in new areas. In order to
improve Venezuela’s oil production, it was considered necessary to: (a) encourage private
investment in the oil sector; (b) rejuvenate existing fields; (c) develop Venezuela’s oil resources

of extra-heavy crude oil; and (d) explore new fields of light and medium crude.*?

103. The Apertura Petrolera — or “Oil Opening” — was intended to pursue these objectives
by enabling foreign investors to invest in the Venezuelan oil industry. The exception for
associations in “special cases” in Article 5 of the 1975 Nationalisation Law provided the

opening for foreign companies to enter the industry.**

104. Accordingly, to facilitate investment in the Venezuelan oil industry and to make it more
internationally competitive, various economic reforms were made.*> As set forth below, these
reforms included: (1) the reduction in the income tax rate such that participants in vertically

integrated heavy and extra-heavy oil projects would be subject to the general corporate tax rate

rather than the rate applicable to other oil activities; and (2) the temporary reduction of the

royalty rate applicable to such projects.*°

105. With respect to the income tax rate, in 1991, the Venezuelan Congress enacted
amendments to the income tax law, reducing the applicable tax rate for vertically integrated
heavy and extra-heavy oil projects in the Orinoco Belt. Accordingly, projects involving both
extraction and refining of petroleum would be subject to the corporate income tax rate (then 30
percent) rather than the rate applicable to upstream projects involving the extraction of light and

medium crude oil (67.7 percent). *”

Cc. THE PETROZUATA PROJECT
(wD Overview of the Petrozuata Project

106. The Petrozuata Project was a vertically integrated project in the Orinoco Belt involved in
the extraction, transportation, refining of extra-heavy crude oil, and the marketing of the
upgraded crude oil (known as “syncrude”).*® ConocoPhillips held a 50.1 percent interest in the
Petrozuata Project, with the remaining 49.9% held by a PdVSA affiliate. The Petrozuata
Project was designed to extract about 120,000 barrels per day (“BPD”) of extra-heavy crude and
to upgrade it into 104,000 BPD of syncrude. The Project’s term was 35 years. Petrozuata
syncrude was sold to ConocoPhillips under an offtake agreement for further refining at its Lake
Charles refinery, which ConocoPhillips reconfigured to process Petrozuata syncrude.*” Further

details about the Petrozuata Project are set forth below.

(2) The Senate and Bicameral Reports

107. In September 1990, Conoco sent a letter to PdVSA expressing interest in conducting
feasibility studies on oil projects.*° In early 1991, a Strategic Associations Unit was established
to oversee the commercialisation of the Orinoco Belt.*! Following various meetings in 1991
between Conoco representatives and the Strategic Associations Unit,” on 17 November 1991,
Conoco and PdVSA executed letters of intent indicating their interest in examining the
feasibility of developing an extra-heavy oil project in the Orinoco Oil Belt using Conoco
Delayed Coking Technology.** The letters of intent envisaged three phases of project

development, all of which would involve sharing costs.

108. A Joint Steering Committee comprising Conoco and Maraven representatives negotiated
and concluded a Joint Study Agreement with respect to the proposed project.** In August 1992,
Conoco and Maraven produced a report on the “Venezuela Heavy Oil Feasibility Study”.

109. In April 1993, the Venezuelan Senate’s Permanent Environmental and Land Use
Planning Committee issued a report with respect to the proposed Petrozuata Project (“Senate
Report”).“° The Senate Report was submitted to the Venezuelan Congress in May 1993.” The
Senate Report stated that PdVSA had “decided to promote the creation of ... ‘Strategic
Associations’ between operating subsidiaries and some foreign companies. ... Making this

incentives for a certain period of time ... could make the projects economically viable by
improving their competitiveness in comparison with other options that the companies might

have internationally”.“” The Senate Report stated that the Petrozuata Project “represents a

“special case’ and is in the public interest” under Article 5 of the 1975 Nationalisation Law.*°

110. In August 1993, the Bicameral Commission of Energy and Mines of the Senate of the
Republic — a standing congressional committee — issued a report (the “Bicameral Report”).*!
The Bicameral Commission recommended the Petrozuata Project (referred to in the Bicameral
Report as the “Maraven-Conoco Project”) for approval by Congress in accordance with Article

5 of the 1975 Nationalisation Law.”

111. The Bicameral Report provided a description of the legal framework governing and the
technical aspects of the Petrozuata Project, as well as a summary of the basic aspects of the
potential association agreement, including: (1) “a protection mechanism for foreign
shareholders in the case that discriminatory actions take place through laws or administrative
actions by national, state or municipal authorities that establish a discriminating unfavourable

treatment ... which translate into significant economic damage”; and (2) a term of no longer

than 35 years from the first commercial load. The Bicameral Report also recommended that

Maraven hold a minority interest in the project.*°

112. The Bicameral Report recommended that the strategic associations under consideration
should be exempt from the income tax rate usually applicable to hydrocarbons exploitation
(67.7 percent),” such that the lower income tax rate introduced in 1991 (as subsequently
amended) would apply.** The Bicameral Report also stated that “the Associations will process,
through the respective institutional channels, possible incentives for the first years in the royalty

99 59
segment”.

(3) The Congressional Authorisation

113. On 10 August 1993, the Venezuelan Congress, having reviewed the Bicameral Report,”
authorised the strategic association between Conoco and Maraven. The congressional
authorisation (“Petrozuata Authorisation”) confirmed that “this authorization shall be exercised
within the legal framework of the ‘terms and conditions’ stated exhaustively in [the Bicameral]
Report”.*!
114. The Petrozuata Authorisation set forth the terms and conditions for the proposed
association agreement between Maraven and Conoco. The Petrozuata Authorisation approved

up to 35 years of commercial production for the Petrozuata Project,°* and stated that it would be

115. Further, the Sixteenth Condition stated:

Provisions shall be included in the Association Agreement that enable Maraven to
compensate the other parties, on equitable terms, for significant adverse economic
consequences directly resulting from decisions made by national, state or municipal
administrative agencies or any changes in the law that, because of their content or
purpose, result in an unjust discriminatory treatment of the Company or such other
parties, always understood in their Capacity as such and as parties to the
Association Agreement, all without prejudice to the sovereign right to legislate
inherent in the very existence of the national, state and municipal legislative
branches.

116. The Eighteen Condition stated:

The Association Agreement to be signed, the commercial company that will be
created and the activities of various sorts based on such legal acts, in particular
commercial activities, are operations and businesses that are within the jurisdiction
of, or obligate, Maraven, or Petréleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PdVSA) only, to the
extent of the guarantees that it grants under Condition Ten [sic, the Spanish version
refers to the Seventeenth Condition]; in no case do they alone bind the Republic of
Venezuela, which can occur only in the event that such responsibility were to be
assumed by the valid express legal act of its representatives.

(4) Further Amendments to the Income Tax Law

117. On 11 August 1993, the Venezuelan Congress passed an enabling law authorising the
President to amend the income tax law to provide that the strategic associations should be
“excluded from the tax regime applicable to taxpayers that are engaged in the production of
hydrocarbons and related activities and instead, are included within the ordinary tax regime

established in the [income tax] law for corporations and taxpayers similar to such”.°7

similarly to the 1991 Income Tax Law, that entities involved in “‘vertically-integrated projects in
the field of producing, refining, emulsification, transportation or marketing of extra-heavy crude
oil” would be subject to the general corporate income tax rate.°* In 1994, the general corporate

income tax rate was set at 34 percent.”

(5) The Petrozuata Association Agreement

119. After Congress issued the Petrozuata Authorisation, negotiations ensued among Conoco
and Maraven with respect to the potential terms of the Association Agreement.” On 31 May
1995, Conoco and Maraven signed an Agreement in Principle confirming the parties’
concurrence on the terms that would govern the joint venture and stating their intention to

conclude an Association Agreement within the year.”!

120. On 10 November 1995, Maraven and a Conoco subsidiary, Conoco Orinoco, Inc.,
concluded an Association Agreement to develop a part of the Zuata region of the Orinoco Oil

Belt through a corporation known as Petrozuata (the “Petrozuata Association Agreement”).
121. The Association’s purpose was as follows:

F. THE FACTS GIVING RISE TO THE DISPUTE
184. The factual context and details of the principal measures taken by Venezuela on which
the Claimants base their claims for compensation under the Investment Law and the Treaty are
elaborated below.

(wD Election of President Chavez and Promulgation of the Investment
and New Hydrocarbons Laws

(a) Election of President Chavez

185. Mr Hugo Chavez Frias was elected President of Venezuela on 6 December 1998 and

assumed the presidency in February 1999.

186. On 22 October 1999, President Chavez promulgated the Investment Law. Article 1 of the

Investment Law states that its objective is: 2

[T]o provide investments and investors, both domestic and foreign, with a stable
and predictable juridical framework whereby the former and the latter may work in
a secure environment, by regulating the actions of the State towards these
investments and investors.

The Investment Law contains obligations to treat investments fairly and equitably and not to

expropriate investments without prompt, fair and adequate compensation. 13
187. Article 22 of the Investment Law provides as follows: 4

Disputes arising between an international investor whose country of origin has in
effect a treaty or agreement for the promotion and protection of investments with
Venezuela, or any disputes which apply the provisions of the Convention
Establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) or the
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals
of other States (ICSID), shall be submitted to international arbitration under the
terms provided for in the respective treaty, should it so provide, without prejudice
to the possibility of using, when applicable, the systems of litigation provided for in
the Venezuelan laws in force.

(c) Promulgation of the New Hydrocarbons law and Execution of the
Procedure for Payment of Exploitation Tax (Royalty
188. On 13 November 2001, exercising powers delegated to him to legislate changes to the
hydrocarbons laws in force, President Chavez issued a new Organic Law of Hydrocarbons
(“New Hydrocarbons Law”).! Under the New Hydrocarbons Law, private companies were

only allowed to participate in oil projects through mixed enterprises in which the State held a

189. In January 2002, the Ministry executed an agreement with the Petrozuata Association
reaffirming that the one percent royalty would remain applicable to its production in accordance
with the Orinoco Belt Royalty Agreement (“Procedure for Payment of Exploitation Tax
(Royalty)”).!77 The Procedure for Payment of Exploitation Tax (Royalty) further stipulated that

thereafter the royalty rate would be 16% percent.'”

(2) Measures Taken to Increase the Applicable Royalty Rate

(a) Amendment of the Orinoco Belt Royalty Agreements
190. Minister Ramirez, in a letter to PAVSA dated 8 October 2004, referred to the increase in
Brent crude oil prices that had taken place and indicated that the changed economic
circumstances meant that the reduced royalty rate of one percent could not be justified. On
10 October 2004, President Chavez announced that the government would increase the royalty

rate applicable to the Orinoco Belt extra-heavy oil projects from one percent to 16% percent. '*°

191. ConocoPhillips objected to the increased royalty rate including by letter to the Ministry
of 22 November 2004, stating that the royalty rate increase on the commercial production of the

Petrozuata and Hamaca Associations was not in conformity with the Orinoco Belt Royalty

206. Among the issues discussed at meetings and in related communications was the question
of compensation for ConocoPhillips’ rights in the Projects. According to the Claimants, any

unlawfully expropriating and/or taking measures equivalent to expropriation
with respect to ConocoPhillips’ investments in Venezuela;

and

(ii) Articles 1 and 6 of the Foreign Investment Law and Article 3 of the Treaty
by failing to accord ConocoPhillips’ investments in Venezuela fair and

in Venezuela;

(b) ORDER Venezuela to pay damages to ConocoPhillips for its breaches of the

(c) AWARD such other relief as the Tribunal considers appropriate; and

(d) ORDER Venezuela to pay all of the costs and expenses of this arbitration,
including ConocoPhillips’ legal and expert fees, the fees and expenses of any

to ConocoPhillips Company under the Foreign Investment Law. Venezuela has
also violated its obligations to the Dutch subsidiaries of ConocoPhillips Company —
CPZ, CPH and CGP — under the bilateral investment treaty between the
Netherlands and Venezuela.

214. With respect to their request for damages, the Claimants stated that:7!

[...] ConocoPhillips respectfully turns to this Tribunal to vindicate its rights and
award it redress in an amount provisionally quantified at US$30,305,400,000.

215. More specifically, in their Memorial and Reply, the Claimants claimed the following

compensation: 220

(a) Damages for the lost income to the Claimants as a result of the fiscal
overpayments required of the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects prior to June 26,
2007, in an amount to be determined as at the date of the Tribunal’s Award.

(b

Damages for the lost income to the Claimants that would have accrued from

between June 26, 2007 and the date of the Tribunal’s Award, in an amount to
be determined as at the date of the Tribunal’s Award.

(c

Damages for the total loss to the Claimants of their interests in the Petrozuata,
Hamaca and Corocoro Projects, in an amount equal to the fair market value of
those interests, to be determined as at the date of the Tribunal’s Award.

B. THE RESPONDENT’S REQUESTS

216. In its Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, the Respondent asserts that:77!

With respect to the jurisdictional objections, the claims set forth in the Request
should be dismissed in their entirety inasmuch as: (i) Article 22 of the Investment
Law does not provide a basis for finding “consent” on the part of the Republic to
arbitration of this dispute; (ii) ConocoPhillips does not qualify as an “international
investor” as defined in the Investment Law Regulation, and thus would not be
entitled to bring claims under the Investment Law concerning the Projects even if
Article 22 did constitute a consent to jurisdiction; (iii) Claimants CPZ, CPH and
CGP are merely corporations of convenience created for the purpose of obtaining
ICSID jurisdiction in this case in an abuse of the corporate form and therefore
jurisdiction under the Dutch Treaty should be rejected; and (iv) the interests held by
Claimants CPH and CGP in any event are indirect investments which do not qualify
for protection under the Dutch Treaty.

217. The Respondent, in its Counter-Memorial reiterated that “[f]or the reasons set forth above
and in the Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, the claims should be rejected in their entirety

for lack of jurisdiction”.” The Respondent further stated that:?7

In the event that the Tribunal were to find jurisdiction on any of the claims asserted,
those claims should nevertheless be dismissed for the substantive reasons set forth
above. In the event that the claims are not rejected in their entirety for lack of
jurisdiction or on the merits, the aggregate amount of compensation in respect of
the three Projects should not exceed US$583 million, with simple interest. In
addition, Claimants should be ordered to reimburse Respondent for all reasonable
costs and expenses, including legal fees, relating to this Arbitration.

218. In its Rejoinder, the Respondent repeated its requests in its Memorial on Objections to
Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial that the Claimants’ claims be dismissed for lack of
jurisdiction and on the merits. Further, the Respondent stated that, if the claims are not rejected
in their entirety, “the aggregate amount of compensation in respect of the three Projects should

not exceed US$570.5 million, with simple interest”.?7*

VI. JURISDICTION
A. INTRODUCTION

219. The preamble to the ICSID Convention declares that a Contracting State by the mere fact
of ratifying, accepting or approving the Convention is not under any obligation to submit any
particular dispute to conciliation or arbitration. Under Article 25 of the Convention, the
jurisdiction of the Centre extends to a legal dispute arising directly out of an investment
between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State that the parties to the

dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.

220. On the adoption of the Convention, the Executive Directors of the World Bank in their

report of 18 March 1965 affirmed that “[c]onsent of the parties is the cornerstone of the

25

jurisdiction of the Centre”.”*> That consent of the two parties they said and, as subsequent

decisions have confirmed, need not be expressed in a single instrument: in particular, “‘a host
State might in its investment promotion legislation offer to submit disputes arising out of certain

classes of investments to the jurisdiction of the Centre, and the investor might give his consent

by accepting the offer in writing”.””°

221. The Claimants gave their consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre over their claims,
which are the subject of this proceeding, in their letter of 31 January 2007 advising the Minister

of Energy and Petroleum, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney-General of

Venezuela of the existence of a dispute arising in relation to the measures taken by

222. The Claimants submit that Venezuela gave its consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre

under:
a. Article 22 of the Investment Law;?8 and

b. Article 9 of the Netherlands-Venezuela BIT.”

223. In their Memorial, the Claimants invoke:?°°

e the Investment Law as the basis for jurisdiction over the claims made by
ConocoPhillips Company, a national of a State Party to the Convention (the
United States of America), and Venezuela, also a State Party to the
Convention; and

e the BIT as the basis of jurisdiction over the claims made by the three Dutch
Claimants.

224. The Respondent objects to both the Investment Law and the BIT as bases for jurisdiction.

B. ARTICLE 22 OF THE INVESTMENT LAW

225. Article 22 of the Investment Law provides as follows:

Las controversias que surjan entre un inversionista internacional, cuyo pais de
origen tenga vigente con Venezuela un tratado o acuerdo sobre promocién y
proteccién de inversiones, o las controversias respecto de las cuales sean
aplicables las disposiciones del Convenio Constitutivo del Organismo Multilateral
de Garantia de Inversiones (OMGI — MIGA) o del Convenio sobre Arreglo de
Diferencias Relativas a Inversiones entre Estados y Nacionales de Otros Estados
(CIADI), serdn sometidas al arbitraje internacional en los términos del respectivo
tratado o acuerdo, si asi este lo establece, sin perjuicio de la posibilidad de hacer
uso, cuando proceda, de las vias contenciosas contempladas en la legislacién
venezolana vigente.

The translations into English provided by the Parties differ in detail. Venezuela’s

oe - x
translation is as follows:”*!

Disputes arising between an international investor whose country of origin has in
effect with Venezuela a treaty or agreement on the promotion and protection of
investments, or disputes to which are applicable the provisions of the Convention
Establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (OMGI-MIGA) or the
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals
of Other States (ICSID), shall be submitted to international arbitration according to
the terms of the respective treaty or agreement, if it so provides, without prejudice
to the possibility of making use, when appropriate, of the dispute resolution means
provided for under the Venezuelan legislation in effect.

The Claimants’ translation is to this effect:?*

Disputes arising between an international investor whose country of origin has in
effect a treaty or agreement for the promotion and protection of investments with
Venezuela, or any disputes to which apply the provisions of the Convention
Establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) or the
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals
of other States (ICSID), shall be submitted to international arbitration under the
terms provided for in the respective treaty or agreement, should it so provide,
without prejudice to the possibility of using, when applicable, the systems of
litigation provided for in the Venezuelan laws in force.

While there are small differences between those translations the Parties do not see them

as significant.” Nor does the Tribunal.

226. The Claimants contend that Venezuela gave its consent to jurisdiction through Article 22;
Venezuela rejects that interpretation. Venezuela also submits that, wholly apart from the
question of consent, jurisdiction over the claims made by ConocoPhillips Company is lacking
because it does not qualify as an “international investor’ under the Investment Law and

therefore is not within the scope of Article 22.2 The Claimants reject that contention.

227. The Parties agree, as indeed Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention, reflecting a long and
well established principle, makes clear, that “the Tribunal shall be the judge of its own

competence”.

228. The Parties disagree, however, on the following matters relating to the interpretation of

Article 22 of the Investment Law:

a. the starting point: must Article 22 state the consent of Venezuela clearly and

unequivocally, or is the provision to be interpreted objectively and in good faith?

b. the applicable law: is Article 22 to be interpreted in accordance with Venezuelan
law or international law or on some other basis? If international law is applicable,
is it the law relating to the interpretation of treaties or some other area of

international law that is to be applied?

c. the text of Article 22: in the light of the answers to the two preceding questions,

what is the meaning of the text?

229. In relation to the third issue, the Parties addressed: the words and structure of Article 22,

its plain or ordinary meaning, its object and purpose, its context, both immediate and over a
longer period, including the Respondent’s attitude to international arbitration and to arbitration
generally; the opinions of commentators, including those said to be involved in the preparation
of the Investment Law; and the discussion of those issues in decisions of tribunals in other
ICSID cases holding that Article 22 did not incorporate a unilateral consent by Venezuela to
ICSID arbitration.”

230. The Tribunal will now address those issues and, in the light of its conclusions on them,

particularly the third issue, to which the Parties gave most attention, determine whether the

Respondent, by enacting Article 22 of the Investment Law, has given its consent to ICSID

jurisdiction.

(wD The Starting Point

231. The Respondent contends that to satisfy the requirement of consent in Article 25(1) of the
ICSID Convention, the statement of consent must be “clear and unequivocal” and not merely
arguable from ambiguous language.”*° In support of that proposition, it cites ICSID decisions
and ICSID commentaries including a statement by the drafters of the ICSID Model Clauses
recording consent: “[t]he one basic requirement that any consent clause must fulfil is that it
should unequivocally show submission to the jurisdiction of the Centre of a particular dispute or
class of disputes”.?*” It also refers to a statement by the International Court of Justice to the
effect that the consent to the jurisdiction of that Court must be “voluntary and indisputable”,”**

and to commentators similarly urging the Court to be cautious in assuming jurisdiction.?”

232. The Claimants reject the Respondent’s starting point: “the only issue before this Tribunal
is whether, as a matter of international law, the language included by Venezuela can be
reasonably construed in good faith to constitute consent to arbitrate certain claims within Article
25 of the ICSID Convention”.”° In support of that approach the Claimants also cite ICSID

decisions.

(2) The Applicable Law

233. The Respondent contends that the Investment Law, as part of the law of Venezuela, must
be interpreted in light of principles of Venezuelan law.”4' It is well established under that law
that consent to arbitration must be clear and unequivocal?” As will appear, it also contends

that the plain language of Article 22 does not, in any event, provide for consent.

234. The Claimants submit that the question whether the Respondent consented to ICSID
arbitration under Article 22 is a matter of international law: “[b]y referring to consent under the
ICSID Convention, Venezuelan law incorporates a renvoi to international law in relation to that

+» 243

question”. The question whether Venezuela consented to ICSID arbitration in its national

law, the Claimants continue, is a matter to be determined within the meaning of Article 25 of
the ICSID Convention and, thus, under international law, not Venezuelan law. In support of

its contentions, each Party has referred the Tribunal to decisions of ICSID Tribunals.

235. An ICSID Tribunal reviewed the range of ICSID decisions on the issue of the governing

law when consent is claimed to have been given in the national law. It provided this summary:

From this review of ICSID case law, it results that in four cases, the question was
not dealt with. In SPP v. Egypt, the tribunal decided to apply ‘general principles of
statutory interpretation,’ ‘taking into consideration relevant rules of treaty
interpretation and principles of international law applicable to unilateral
declarations.’ In CSOB v. Slovak Republic, the Tribunal took its decision only on
the basis of the latter principles. In Zhinvali v. Georgia, it opted for domestic law
‘subject to ultimate governance by international law’.*

236. It commented that, in those cases, the States’ (claimed) consent to arbitration “was not
contained in a treaty to be interpreted according to the Vienna Convention on the Law of
Treaties ... but in a unilateral offer made by that State in one form or another”. 4° “[T]hat very

problem”, it continued, arose when the International Court of Justice interpreted unilateral
declarations accepting its jurisdiction under Article 36(2) of its Statute. Those international
instruments, according to the Court, “must be interpreted by reference to international law”.47

That Tribunal said that it shared this analysis:*"*

Unilateral acts by which a State consents to ICSID jurisdiction are standing offers
made by a sovereign State to foreign investors under the ICSID Convention. Such
offers could be incorporated into domestic legislation or not. But, whatever may be
their form, they must be interpreted according to the ICSID Convention and to the
principles of international law governing unilateral declarations of States.
237. That Tribunal then considered “the rules of interpretation” as fixed by the International
Court when interpreting unilateral declarations accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the

Court under Article 36(2) of its Statute.” It concluded in these terms:7°°

[T]he International Court of Justice interprets ‘the relevant words of a declaration
including a reservation contained therein in a natural and reasonable way, having
due regard to the intention of the State concerned.’ The Court does so by starting
with the text and, if the text is not clear, by giving due consideration to the context
and examining the ‘evidence regarding the circumstances of its preparation and the
purposes intended to be served.’ Thus the intention of the declaring State must
prevail.

(3) The Text of Article 22

238. The task of the Tribunal in this case is to determine whether Venezuela in enacting
Article 22 has given its consent to ICSID jurisdiction. Has it made a standing offer to foreign
investors under the ICSID Convention? It is only when that question has been answered that

the need to determine the extent of the consent might arise.

239. Accordingly, the Tribunal now addresses the question just asked by reference to the
words and structure of Article 22, its ordinary meaning, its object and purpose and its context,

both immediate and long term, along with the other matters mentioned in paragraph 237 above.

240. The Claimants make their submissions relating to the words and structure and ordinary
meaning of Article 22 by emphasising two different versions of the article. In the first, they

address the following parts of the provision:

... disputes to which are applicable the provisions of ... the Convention on the
Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States
(ICSID), shall be submitted to international arbitration according to the terms of the
respective treaty or agreement, if it so provides ... .
241. In relation to that text, the Claimants’ first contention was that the express reference in
Article 22 to the ICSID Convention is significant. Under the principle of effective
interpretation, “‘a fundamental principle of interpretation”, a legal text should be interpreted in

such a way that a reason and a meaning can be attributed to every word in the text>"!

Second,
the Claimants emphasise the mandatory wording of the provision: certain categories of dispute
“shall be submitted to international arbitration”. That mandatory wording, they say, is to be
contrasted with the permissive terms of the provision at the end of Article 22 relating to
litigation in Venezuelan courts and of Article 23 about Venezuelan national courts and arbitral

. 252
tribunals.

The third argument relates to the final phrase of the provision as quoted above —
the arbitration is to be carried out “under the terms provided for in the respective treaty or
agreement, should it so provide”.*? There is no question, according to the Claimants, that the
ICSID Convention provides for arbitration, as well as the rules for conducting the arbitration.
In answer to the Respondent’s argument that “if it so provides” means “if the respective treaty
or agreement establishes, by its terms, that the dispute shall be submitted to international
arbitration”, the Claimants contend that the essence of such an interpretation would be that

Article 22 is pointless from start to finish.24 That argument returns to the effectiveness

argument.

242. The Respondent, in answer to the Claimants’ first point about the principle of effective
interpretation, contends that that principle does not permit the reading out of the statute words
that are there or reading in words that are not there. The Claimants’ reading would deny effect
to the words “if it so provides”. In the opinion of the Respondent, those words, to move to the
second and third submissions made by the Claimants, state a condition which has to be satisfied
and which has not been: Article 25 of the ICSID Convention requires that the Parties to the
dispute consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre and Venezuela has not given that consent.
Moreover, submits the Respondent, Article 22 does serve a useful purpose in making clear that
Venezuela intended to honour all existing international commitments it had undertaken for
international arbitration. In the context of “the traditional Venezuelan hostility to international

arbitration” that affirmation was significant.”

243. Before it considers those contextual matters to which the Parties gave considerable
attention and the opinions of commentators on the Investment Law, including those said to have
been involved in the preparation of the Law, the Tribunal sets out the second way in which the
Claimants present Article 22 in support of their argument that, by that provision, Venezuela has

consented to ICSID jurisdiction:

... disputes to which are applicable the provisions of ... the Convention on the
Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States
(ICSID), shall be submitted to international arbitration ... .

244. The Claimants’ contention that Article 22 should be read in this abbreviated way is based
in significant part on the use of the words “treaty or agreement” both at the beginning of the
Article and towards its end, by contrast to the word “Convention” which is used twice in
relation to identified texts, one of them being the ICSID Convention. The submission is that the
words “treaty or agreement” are used as abstract categories, to be distinguished from the two
specified Conventions, and, in the context of Article 22, do not include those two Conventions.
Accordingly, the Claimants continue, in terms of the version of Article 22 set out above,
disputes to which the provisions of the ICSID Convention apply “shall be submitted to

international arbitration”. There is no need to read on. Indeed it would be “nonsense” if the

25s Resp. Rej. 1 36.

65

words “if it so provides” were “supposed to reach back to modify the ICSID Convention. It
would be foolish to ask whether the ICSID Convention provides for arbitration. That is what

the ICSID Convention is all about”.°°

245. It is convenient to consider at this stage the Claimants’ argument based on the
abbreviated text (as set out in paragraph 243) — an argument, which was not made in the two

earlier cases on Article 22 and that was mainly developed in the oral hearings.

246. It is true that the argument gains some support from the literal terms of Article 22 and its
possible distinction between treaties and agreements on the one side and the two specified
Conventions on the other. It does, however, face what, in the opinion of the Tribunal, is an
insurmountable hurdle when the provisions of those two Conventions dealing with disputes are
considered. The MIGA Convention establishes procedures for the settlement of four different

types of disputes:?*”

a. questions of interpretation and application of the Convention arising between the
Agency and a member State or between members: they are to be decided by the
Board of the Agency, with a right of appeal by any member to the Council of the
Agency (Article 56);

b. disputes arising under a contract of guarantee or reinsurance between the Agency
and the other Party: they are to be submitted to final arbitration in accordance

with the rules in the contract of guarantee or reinsurance (Article 58);

c. disputes between the Agency as subrogee of an investor and a member: they are
to be settled in accordance with the procedure laid down either in Annex II to the
Convention or in an agreement between the Agency and the member for an
alternative method or methods of dispute settlement. Annex II provides for

negotiation, and, if it fails, for arbitration on the submission of either party, or for

26 See Tr. Day 1:87-89.

Ex. R-62, Convention Establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, October 11,
1985, 24 I.L.M. 1605 (1985).

66

conciliation if they agree; the conciliation and arbitration processes are regulated
in some detail, by reference to the parallel provisions in the ICSID Convention

(Article 57(b)); and

d. any dispute other than those in (a), (b) and (c) above between the Agency and a
member or former member (or an agency thereof): they are also to be settled in

accordance with Annex II (Article 57(a)).

247. The detail of those processes, including the use of arbitration in some cases but not in
others, indicates plainly that “disputes to which are applicable the provisions of the [MIGA]
Convention ... shall be submitted to international arbitration” only “according to the terms of
the respective treaty or agreement [here the MIGA. Convention]”.?** That final phrase, omitted
in the Claimants’ abbreviated version, cannot be ignored in considering the reference to that

Convention in Article 22. Those words are not to be read out of the text.

248. The same is true when the provisions for the settlement of disputes included in the ICSID
Convention are considered. The first point is that investment disputes to which are applicable
the provisions of the Convention may be submitted to conciliation under its Chapter III rather
than to arbitration under Chapter IV. Second, “[a]ny dispute arising between Contracting States
concerning the interpretation or application of the Convention which is not settled by
negotiation shall be referred to the International Court of Justice by any party to the dispute

7259 As with the provisions

unless the States concerned agree to another method of settlement
of the MIGA Convention, those provisions make it clear that it is not enough, as the abbreviated
version of Article 22 would have it, to say that “disputes to which are applicable the provisions
of ... [the ICSID Convention] shall be submitted to international arbitration. The submission
has to be ‘according to the terms of the respective treaty or agreement [here the ICSID

Convention, Chapter IV]

249. The Claimants’ argument based on the abbreviated version of Article 22 must therefore
fail.

258 Ex. C-1 and Ex. 12, Investment Law, Art. 22 (emphasis added).
°° ICSID Convention, Art. 64.

67

250. The Tribunal accordingly returns to the fuller version of Article 22 set out in paragraph
225 above on which the Parties placed their primary emphasis. As already indicated, in
addressing the meaning of that text, they gave considerable attention to the context, especially
Venezuela’s attitude to international arbitration over the last 100 or more years and more

recently.

251. The most immediate context to the parts of Article 22 being considered is the final phrase
of that provision and Article 23 and Article 1. The final phrase saves the existing rights of the
investor or the State to bring proceedings under Venezuelan Law. Article 23 similarly
recognises the right of the investor to submit a dispute arising in connection with the application
of the Law, once it has exhausted administrative remedies, to national courts or arbitral tribunals
of Venezuela, that is to say to bring proceedings unilaterally. The clear grant or recognition of
those unilateral powers to initiate proceedings under national law provides a sharp contrast to
the provisions of Article 22 relating to international arbitration, according to the Respondent.
The Claimants comment in respect of Article 23 that it uses the permissive word may as
opposed to the mandatory shall that is used in Article 22.7 The reply of the Respondent is that
this is a misreading of Article 23, which provides for national, not international, arbitration at
the option of the investor; the permissive “may” becomes mandatory once the investor exercises

that option.”*!

252. It is the Claimants who emphasise Article 1 of the Investment Law:

This Decree-Law is intended to provide investments and investors, both domestic
and foreign, with a stable and predictable legal framework whereby the former and
the latter may work in a secure environment, by regulating the actions of the State
towards these investments and investors so as to bring about the increase,
diversification and harmonic complementarity of investments in favour of the
national development goals.”

ad Cl. Reply {| 267.

68

Article 22, they submit, must be interpreted with the purpose of realising the goals,

expressed in Article 1, of promoting and protecting foreign investment.”

The Respondent
submits that it is the final phrase of Article 1, with its emphasis on advancing the objective of
national development, which expresses the purpose of the Investment Law. Further, such a
purposive provision does not itself have substantive effect.?

253. The Parties’ submissions on the external context, beyond the terms of the Investment
Law itself, addressed traditional and more recent Venezuelan attitudes toward arbitration, both
national and international, and the particular background to the enactment of the Investment
Law. In respect of that last matter, they gave close attention to the opinions of a number of
commentators including some said by the Claimants to be the drafters, or involved in the
drafting, of the Law. The Tribunal has not found this material helpful. It does not lead to a

265

clear result. What is critical for the Tribunal is the wording of Article 22 read in the

immediate context in accordance with accepted principles of interpretation which appear to be
the same in international law and Venezuelan law.*°°

254. Against that background, the Tribunal returns to the terms of Article 22 to determine their
meaning. It begins with the difference between the Parties about the question whether the
consent of Venezuela must be stated clearly or unequivocally or the provision is to be
interpreted objectively and in good faith. Given that States are subject to binding third party
dispute settlement procedures only if they so consent and, given the weight of authority referred
to earlier, particularly as found in decisions of the International Court of Justice and in the

particular ICSID context, the Tribunal considers that its approach should be cautious. In the

263

* Cl. Reply {ff 267-68.
See Tr. Day 2:366.

With respect to the history of the drafting of the Investment Law and, in particular, the lack of
clarity that Venezuela, in adopting Article 22, intended to give its consent to ICSID arbitration in
the absence of a bilateral investment treaty, efc., see Mobil { 131 (“[T]he Tribunal cannot draw
from this general evolution in favour of BITs the conclusion that Venezuela, in adopting Article
22, intended to give in advance its consent to ICSID arbitration in the absence of such BITs”.).

265

See, e.g., Resp. Rej. {[ 25 (stating that the Investment Law “bears no resemblance to any of the
other consents to arbitration in any of Venezuela’s treaties or to the model ICSID clauses for
consent to arbitration.”).

69

words of the International Court of Justice in considering the very first challenge made to its

jurisdiction, the consent must be “voluntary and indisputable”,”°”

and in the words of both
ICSID tribunals “clear and unambiguous”.”°* The necessary consent is not to be presumed. It
must be clearly demonstrated. As will be seen, the difference on this issue may not be

significant.

255. That also appears to be the case with the Parties’ initially different positions on the
applicable law. By the end, they were in broad agreement that the meaning of Article 22 was to
be determined by considering its terms in context and in the light of their purpose.””” The
Tribunal is of the same opinion. No significant difference is to be seen between Venezuelan
law as found in Article 4 of the Civil Code and decisions of the Supreme Court of Venezuela,
the law reflected in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and the
statements to be found in relevant decisions of international courts and tribunals. They all call
for particular attention to be given to the text, along with the other matters. The question
remains: did Venezuela in Article 22 of the Law give its consent to international arbitration

under ICSID?

256. So far as the text is concerned, the Respondent, it will be recalled, gave particular weight
to the phrase “according to the terms of the respective treaty or agreement, if it so provides”.
The final four words, it said, state a condition. The treaty — in this case the ICSID Convention
— does not, according to the Respondent, itself “provide” for international arbitration. On the
contrary, in its Article 25, the ICSID Convention expressly requires that the State consent to
jurisdiction. That condition has not been satisfied. For the Claimants, that contention was
answered by the fact that ICSID does provide for international arbitration: it regulates all the

necessary elements.

70

257. The Tribunal considers that those four words — if it [the treaty or agreement] so provides
[should it so provide] — present the essential issue to be determined. They do state a condition
— as indeed the Claimants’ expert on Venezuelan law accepted. In the Tribunal’s opinion, that
condition has not been satisfied. It is not enough, as the Claimants contend, that the ICSID
Convention provides for international arbitration. That treaty must itself manifest Venezuela’s
consent to arbitration; but that treaty does not do that, as its Article 25 and preamble make clear.
The ordinary meaning of the terms of Article 22, and especially of the condition, leads the
Tribunal to the conclusion that Venezuela does not by that means consent to international

arbitration under the ICSID Convention. Other considerations support that conclusion.

258. If the Claimants’ position was correct, it would follow that, if Venezuela in a future
investment treaty were to accept the possibility of international arbitration but not to consent to
it in that treaty, the Investment Law, by way of Article 22, would provide for that consent
notwithstanding the deliberate choice of the State Parties to the treaty and the absence of
reciprocity that that reading would introduce. That cannot be correct. A further possible
difficulty with the Claimants’ reading of Article 22 is that the consent of the investor would also
apparently not be required: the State would have a unilateral right to initiate the process against
the investor and the investment dispute “shall be submitted to international arbitration’,

270

notwithstanding the plain terms of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.”"” If that is not a direct

consequence of the “mandatory” reading, then Article 22 leaves the investor with an option.

259. The Claimants, it will be recalled, invoke the principle of the effective interpretation of
treaties: a reason and meaning is to be attributed to every word in the text. In their view, the
Respondent’s interpretation would deprive the reference to ICSID in Article 22 of all effect.
The Respondent submits, to the contrary, that the Claimants’ proposed interpretation would
deprive the expression “if it so provides”, also included in Article 22, of all effect. The
principle of effective interpretation does not enable a court or tribunal to rewrite the provision
that it is interpreting, in particular, by writing words out of the text. The Respondent also
submits that, on its reading of Article 22, the reference to ICSID, along with the reference to the

other treaties and agreements, does have a useful purpose: it made it clear that Venezuela

270 Resp. Rej. 1 32.

71

intended to honour all existing international commitments that it had undertaken for
international arbitration, including those in particular BITs in which it plainly had already
accepted that investors had the option to bring international arbitration proceedings against it.
In the context of the traditional Venezuelan hostility to international arbitration, that
affirmation, it says, was significant.?”! The Respondent points out that other provisions of the
Investment Law, relating to sectors of economic activity reserved by law to the State or to
Venezuelan investors, and the law and policy regulating the entry and stay of foreigners and
labour legislation,” are not necessary as a matter of Venezuelan law: they do no more than
replicate provisions of the constitution and other laws, and appear in a general law which gives
a more comprehensive sense of the law applying to investments made by national investors and
foreign investors. The Claimants’ expert agreed.?” There is the further consideration, to quote
from the ICSID decision in the Biwater Gauff case, that a provision such as Article 22 may have
some effect by clearing the way for the State to conclude specific types of dispute resolution
agreements without internal issues such as ultra vires arising and as such it provides a sense of

certainty for investors.?4

260. Given its broad scope and general nature, the 1999 Decree is not, in the opinion of the
Tribunal, the kind of law to every provision of which distinct legal effect is necessarily to be
given. In that respect it differs from legal instruments with a single purpose such as
declarations accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice under
Article 36(2) of its Statute. Accordingly, on the matter of effective interpretation, the Tribunal

agrees with the contentions made by the Respondent.

261. As the Tribunal has already indicated, the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article 22
leads it strongly to the conclusion that Venezuela has not consented to ICSID jurisdiction by

enacting that provision. The immediate context provided by the proviso to Article 22, by other

72

provisions of the Investment Law, particularly Article 23, point in the same direction. The
broader context, along with the commentaries, does not affect that conclusion. Nor do the
contentions based on the principle of effective interpretation; if anything that principle supports

the conclusion.

262. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that it does not have jurisdiction under Article 22 of
the Investment Law. It follows that it need not consider the Respondent’s contention that the
Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over ConocoPhillips Company’s claims on the basis that

ConocoPhillips Company is not an “international investor” under Article 22 of the Law.

263. Another consequence of the ruling that Venezuela by way of Article 22 does not consent
to international arbitration is that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the claim made by
ConocoPhillips Company based on its loss of future tax credits. It will be recalled that only
ConocoPhillips Company and not the Dutch companies made that claim and_ that
ConocoPhillips Company is not able to claim under the Dutch BIT. In any event, after the
present Tribunal has issued its Award, ConocoPhillips Company will be at liberty to consider
any measure which Venezuela may adopt with respect to any element of the Award that has a
bearing on US tax credits of ConocoPhillips Company and then decide whether such measures

give rise to any claim before an appropriate forum.

Cc. ARTICLE 9 OF THE BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY BETWEEN THE
NETHERLANDS AND VENEZUELA

264. Article 9, paragraphs (1), (3), (4) and (5) of the Treaty provide as follows:

1. Disputes between one Contracting Party and a national of the other Contracting
Party concerning an obligation of the former under this Agreement in relation to an
investment of the latter, shall at the request of the national concerned be submitted
to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, for settlement by
arbitration or conciliation under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment
Disputes between States and Nationals of other States opened for signature at
Washington on 18 March 1965.

3. The arbitral award shall be limited to determining whether there is a breach by
the Contracting Party concerned of its obligations under this Agreement, whether

73

such breach of obligations has caused damages to the national concerned, and, if
such is the case, the amount of compensation.

4. Each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission
of disputes as referred to in Paragraph 1 of this Article to international arbitration in
accordance with the provisions of this Article.

5. The arbitral award shall be based on:

- the law of the Contracting Party concerned;

the provisions of this Agreement and other relevant Agreements between the
Contacting Parties;

- the provisions of special agreements relating to the investments;

- the general principles of international law; and

- such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties to the dispute.

265. The three Dutch claimants contend that Venezuela has consented to ICSID arbitration

under Article 9(1) in respect of their claims:

(1) CPZ, CPH and CGP are Dutch nationals within the definition of “nationals”
in Article 1(b) of the BIT:

[t]he term “nationals” shall comprise with regard to either Contracting Party ... (ii)
legal persons constituted under the law of that Contracting Party.

(2) The dispute concerns qualifying investments of the three companies in
Venezuela within the meaning of Article 1(a) and 9(1). “Investments” include
“rights derived from shares, bonds and other kinds of interest in companies and
joint ventures”.

(3) A dispute in relation to an investment as defined in Article 9(1) is present
here. The claims in the arbitration concern Venezuela’s obligation under the Treaty
and international law in relation to the investments of CPZ, CPH and CPB in the
Venezuelan hydrocarbons sector.?”°
266. The Respondent contends that the three companies cannot gain access to ICSID under the

Dutch Treaty for two reasons:

qd) the claimants are “corporations of convenience” created in anticipation of
litigation against the Respondent for the sole purpose of gaining access to ICSID;
and

27 See Cl. Mem. {ff 284-88.

74

(2) the investments relied on by CPH and CGP are indirect investments and
fall outside the definition of an investment, which does not extend to investments in
Venezuela owned or controlled indirectly by Dutch nationals through one or more
intermediaries.°”°
267. The Respondent also contends that, even if those arguments do not succeed, several of
the claims would fail because, at the time the particular measure that was at the basis of the
claim was taken, the Dutch claimants were not in existence or had not been inserted into the
corporate chain of ownership.” It will be seen that the facts relating to this argument and the

argument about “corporations of convenience” overlap.

(wD “Corporations of Convenience”

268. The Respondent cites a number of ICSID decisions in support of its argument that,
notwithstanding that the claimants in those cases technically met the nationality requirements of
the relevant treaties, the tribunals refused, or considered refusing, the claims. The basis for such
refusals was, in the Respondent’s terms, abuse of the corporate form and blatant treaty or forum
shopping, which should not be condoned. On the facts, it says that ConocoPhillips had no valid
business purpose for this corporate restructuring and the Tribunal should find that it has no

jurisdiction under the BIT.

269. The Claimants have two responses. The first relates to the facts, including the timing of
the restructuring of their investments in Venezuela which, they say, occurred before the dispute
arose. They made those investments before the changes were made in the tax law and before
the investments were confiscated. Second, there is no principle of law, they contend, which
precludes a corporation from altering its form, by creating subsidiaries or reincorporating to

benefit from the protection of another country’s laws.”

270. That last contention of the Claimants is supported, in their view, by the relevant part of
the definition of “nationals” — they are “legal persons constituted under the law of that

Contracting Party [the Netherlands]”. The Parties in determining the personal scope of the BIT

276

did not include any additional element of control, as provided in subparagraph (iii) of the

definition of nationals for legal persons constituted under the law of a third State, a test which is

elaborated in the Protocol to the Treaty but only in respect of that specific part of the definition
of a national.?”

271. Four of the cases cited by the Parties share two significant features. The first is that the
definition, or its relevant part, of “investors”, “legal persons” and “companies” is essentially to
the same effect as the definition of nationals in Article 1(b)(ii) of the BIT:*?

a. an “investor” includes an entity established in the territory of the Ukraine in

conformity with its laws and regulations.”*!

b. “nationals” include legal persons constituted in accordance with the law of that
2

Contracting Party ... 28
c. “investor” includes “legal entities incorporated or constituted in accordance with
Israel’s laws and having their permanent seat in the territory of the State of

Israel."
d. definition applicable in this case, in the Mobil case.

272. The second significant feature is that, in those cases, the tribunals deciding the challenges

to jurisdiction did not dismiss the challenges simply on the basis that those formal requirements

284

were met — as they were, and, as the Respondent accepts, they were here. The tribunals

went on to consider whether the objection to jurisdiction should be upheld on a distinct broader
basis. In the third case, the tribunal did in fact uphold that challenge. In another case, Autopista
Concesionada de Venezuela, C.A. (“Aucoven”) v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,” which
turned on the definition of “national of another Contracting Party State” in Article 25(2)(b) of
the ICSID Convention itself, the tribunal similarly did not limit itself to the parties’ definition of
foreign control in their concession agreement — the expression used in Article 25(2)(b). While

accepting that it could not discard the criterion which the parties had established, it did qualify

> 286

that proposition in the event that the criterion proved “unreasonable”. It then considered

matters of fact similar to those considered in the other four cases mentioned and those which are

taken up later in this Decision.

273. The principal reason that tribunals have given for not treating compliance with formal or
technical requirements as being sufficient is to avoid the misuse of power conferred by law.

The Mobil tribunal observed that “in all systems of law, whether domestic or international, there

o> 287

are concepts framed in order to avoid misuse of the law It referred to good faith,

détournement de pouvoir and abuse of right. In support of that proposition, it referred to

decisions of the International Court of Justice, the Appellate Body of the World Trade

288

Organisation, other international tribunals and other ICSID tribunals. A decision related

those broad principles to the ICSID process itself?

The Tribunal is concerned here with the international principle of good faith as
applied to the international arbitration mechanism of ICSID. The Tribunal has to
prevent an abuse of the system of international investment protection under the
ICSID Convention, in ensuring that only investments that are made in compliance

with the international principle of good faith and do not attempt to misuse the
system are protected.

274. It may be observed that, apart from the ICSID cases, the authorities cited concern claims
that States have abused their powers or acted in bad faith. In the present context, the doctrine is
being invoked in relation to the actions of a corporate body, not of a State, but it is a corporate
body seeking to make use of a procedure of an international character to settle a dispute with a
State, set up by States which drafted, concluded and accepted the Convention. That Convention
has as its purpose to establish a “Centre ... to provide facilities for conciliation and arbitration
of investment disputes between Contracting States and nationals of other Contracting States in
accordance with the provisions of the Convention.” There is jurisdiction only if the parties to
the dispute have each consented and throughout the process each is treated on an equal footing,
as indeed the principles of due process and natural justice require. That equality of position in
the present context is, in this Tribunal’s view, a further factor supporting the growing body of
decisions placing some limits on the investor’s choice of corporate form, even if it complies

with the relevant technical definition in the treaty text.

275. Whether those limits have been breached must turn on a close examination of all of the
circumstances of the case, circumstances to which the parties in this arbitration have given
particular attention. The Tribunal now turns to that examination. It will do that bearing in mind
how rarely courts and tribunals have held that a good faith or other related standard is breached.

The standard is a high one.

276. The facts relating to the incorporation of the Dutch companies and their placing in the

chain of ownership of the projects appear earlier in this Decision. In brief:

a. The three projects began in the 1990s. The Petrozuata and Hamaca projects were
set up through US companies in 1995 and 1997 and, although the Corocoro
project was undertaken initially in 1996 through a Dutch company (Conoco
Venezuela BV), those interests were transferred three years later to a Venezuelan

company (Conoco Venezuela CA).
20 ICSID Convention, Art. 1(2).

78

277.

b. The Dutch companies were incorporated and took interests in the projects as

follows:

e CPZ was incorporated on 26 July 2005 and the relevant ownership interest
was transferred to it on 27 July 2005;7"!

e CGP was incorporated on 26 July 2005 and the relevant ownership interest
was transferred to it on 11 August 2005;7? and

e CPH was incorporated on 17 July 2006 and the relevant ownership interest
was transferred to it on 22 September 2006.73

c. The record includes notifications to the Venezuelan Mercantile Registry in respect
of CPZ on 3 November 20057" and on 9 January 2007,” and to PAVSA on 25
September 2006;7° and in respect of CGP on 11 January 2007.97

Those steps and their timing are to be related to the elements of the claims and other

significant events as follows:

k. February to June 2007: negotiations took place concerning ConocoPhillips’

interests in the projects.

1 1 May 2007: PdVSA took physical control of the projects.
m. 26 June 2007: the four month period for reaching agreement under (j) above

expired and Venezuela took ConocoPhillips’ interests in the projects.

278. Against that chronology and bearing in mind the matters weighed by other tribunals
considering objections to jurisdiction made on the basis of “treaty abuse”, this Tribunal makes a
number of observations. The first is that the transfers of ownership in 2005 and 2006 did not
attempt to transfer any right or claim arising under ICSID or a BIT from one owner to another.
Indeed, at the time of the transfers, ConocoPhillips had withdrawn its only claim of breach and
had done that in the clearest of terms. It was not until May 2006 that the first of the actions,
which were later to be the subject of the letters from ConocoPhillips notifying the Venezuelan
government of a dispute, was taken. The Tribunal later considers the significance of the date of

that measure and of 29 August 2006 for the CPH claim.

279. It is the case, to turn to a second matter, that the only business purpose of the
restructuring, as acknowledged by the Claimants’ principal witness on this matter, was to be
able to have access to ICSID proceedings.” But as against that, as already noted, no claim had
been made at the time of the restructuring and, subject to the qualification made in respect of the
claims by CPH about the two measures taken in 2006, none was in prospect at the times of the

restructurings.

280. One major factor indicates that ConocoPhillips wished to continue to carry out the
projects and that proceedings under the BIT were not in prospect at that time. That factor, a
very weighty one in the Tribunal’s opinion, is ConocoPhillips’ continuing expenditure on the
projects. According to its evidence, which was not challenged, ConocoPhillips invested

approximately U.S.$ 434 million on the three projects after the decision to restructure was made

8 Tr. Day 3:552:4-9 (Goff).

81

in mid-2005.° The total ConocoPhillips’ expenditure after the enactment of the Investment
Law was U.S.$ 5.3 billion.*"! For the Tribunal, this continued substantial involvement in the
development and operation of the projects is evidence telling strongly against any finding of

treaty abuse.
281. Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects that challenge to jurisdiction.

(2) Indirect Investment

282. The Respondent contends that because two of the Dutch companies — CPH and CGP —
have only indirect investments held through subsidiaries, their claims under the Treaty must be
dismissed. The Respondent points out that several bilateral investment treaties concluded by
both Venezuela and the Netherlands expressly cover both direct and indirect investments,
language not used in the Netherlands-Venezuelan BIT. To read the present non-express BIT
wording as covering indirect investments would make that careful elaboration unnecessary and
ignore the limit arising from the ordinary meaning of the words of the Treaty, taken in light of

its object and purpose.*

283. The Claimants invoke “the plain language of Article 1 of the Treaty [which] contains the

broadest definition of investment possible: every kind of investment”.*”?

Both the Respondent
and the Claimants refer in support of their contentions, in addition to other treaty practice, to

decisions of other ICSID tribunals.

284. The Tribunal remarks in respect of treaty practice that this demonstrates that there is no
single way of drafting definitions. Different formulations may have precisely the same effect.
Drafting practice varies. While, as the Respondent notes, some of the Dutch bilateral

investment treaties use a different formula, its model bilateral investment treaty, along with very

many others, uses exactly the wording to be found in the treaty with Venezuela. The one case

D6, >> 304

which is directly in point — Fedax — also supports the Claimants’ “plain meaning”.

285. For the Tribunal the words of the definition are clear beyond question. They are written
in broad terms, as indeed the Respondent accepts. *°° In the words of Vattel, there is no need to

interpret that which has no need of interpretation.*
286. Accordingly, this objection to jurisdiction in respect of the claims of CPH and CGP fails.

(3) Ratione Temporis

287. The Respondent contends that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the claims made by
CPH in respect of the extraction tax that was enacted in May 2006 and the amendment to the
Income Tax Law enacted in August 2006 before that company was inserted in September into
the corporate chain relating to the Hamaca project. The Claimants and CPH in particular do not
challenge the principle that the Dutch companies have no claims in respect of actions taken by

Venezuela before they had acquired the relevant interest.

288. The law increasing the extraction tax to 334 percent came into force on 24 May 2006

and, accordingly, CPH can make no claim in respect of it.

289. While the income tax increase was enacted before CPH was inserted into the chain of
ownership in the following month, September 2006, the increase did not come into effect until 1
January 2007.°°’ Which date is decisive? The date of the enactment of the law providing for
the increase or the date it took effect in the law? In principle, the Tribunal considers that a

breach of obligation does not occur until the law in issue is actually applied in breach of that

obligation and that cannot happen before the law in question is in force. In this particular

context the relevant date was | January 2007, some months after CPH acquired its ownership

interest. Accordingly the Respondent’s objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over CPH’s

claim based on the increase in income tax must be rejected.

290.

D. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons the Tribunal decides that:

a. It does not have jurisdiction under Article 22 of the Investment Law and that

accordingly the claims by ConocoPhillips Company are dismissed; and
b. It has jurisdiction under Article 9 of the Bilateral Investment Treaty over:

i. the claims brought by ConocoPhillips Petrozuata BV, ConocoPhilips Hamaca
BV and ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria BV in respect of (1) the increase in the
income tax rate which came into effect on 1 January 2007 and (2) the

expropriation or migration; and

ii. the claims brought by ConocoPhillips Petrozuata BV and ConocoPhillips Gulf
of Paria BV in respect of the increase in the extraction tax in effect from 24

May 2006.

The Tribunal recalls that one consequence of its decision above relating to Article 22 of

the Investment Law is that it does not have jurisdiction over the claim by ConocoPhillips

Company based on its loss of future tax credits.*°°

MERITS

A. CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF THE OBLIGATION OF FAIR AND EQUITABLE

TREATMENT: ARTICLES 3 AND 4 OF THE NETHERLANDS- VENEZUELA TREATY

(dd) Introduction

The Claimants base their claims of breaches by the Respondent of its obligation to accord

their investments fair and equitable treatment on the requirements to that effect included in the

Investment Law and the Treaty. Since the Tribunal has held that it has no jurisdiction over the

claims brought under the Investment Law, this section of the Decision is concerned only with

the obligations owed to the Dutch companies and arising under the Treaty.

292.

Article 3 of the Treaty places an obligation on each Contracting Party to ensure the fair

and equitable treatment of the investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party. It is in

3
these terms:*!°

310

(1) Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment of the
investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair, by
arbitrary or discriminatory measures, the operation, management, maintenance, use,
enjoyment or disposal thereof by those nationals.

(2) More particularly, each Contracting Party shall accord to such investments
full physical security and protection which in any case shall not be less than that
accorded either to investments of its own nationals or to investments of nationals of
any third State, whichever is more favourable to the national concerned.

(3) If a Contracting Party has accorded special advantages to nationals of any
third State by virtue of agreements establishing customs unions, economic unions,
monetary unions or similar institutions, or on the basis of interim agreements
leading to such unions or institutions, that Contracting Party shall not be obliged to
accord such advantages to nationals of the other Contracting Party.

(4) Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered
into with regard to the treatment of investments of nationals of the other
Contracting Party. If the provisions of law of either Contracting Party or
obligations under international law existing at present or established hereafter
between the Contacting Parties in addition to the present Agreement contain a
regulation, whether general or specific, entitling investments by nationals of the
other Contracting Party to a treatment more favourable than is provided for by the

Ex. C-2 and Ex. R-13, Treaty, Art. 3.

85

present Agreement, such regulation shall to the extent that it is more favourable
prevail over the present Agreement.
In a Protocol to the Treaty signed on the same day as the Treaty as “an integral part” of it,

the Contracting Parties agreed to the following:*"!

2. Ad Article 3(1):

The Contracting Parties agree that the treatment of investments shall be considered

to be fair and equitable as mentioned in Article 3, paragraph 1, if it conforms to the

treatment accorded to investments of their own nationals, or to investments of

nationals of any third State, whichever is more favorable to the national concerned,

as well as to the minimum standard for the treatment of foreign nationals under

international law.
293. That detailed specification of the fair and equitable treatment standard constitutes one
departure from the model Netherlands BIT, a model followed in scores of other Dutch treaties.
A second departure is the use of the word “arbitrary” instead of “unreasonable” in the second
limb of Article 3(1): the obligation not to impair, by arbitrary or discriminatory measures, the
operation ... of the investments by the nationals of the other Party. There is also a third
departure, namely, the specification of the applicable law included in paragraph (5) of Article 9
on applicable law beginning with the law of the Contracting Party concerned, an addition to the
model. It does not appear to have a particular significance in this case, but it is to be related to

the general position of Venezuela in the negotiation of the BIT, discussed in the next paragraph.

294. The reporting by both Contracting Parties to their legislatures, when seeking approval of
the ratification of the Treaty, makes it clear that these changes were made at the request of the
Venezuelan negotiators and to respond to their concerns. The letter from the Netherlands’

Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Dutch Parliament explained that:*!?

The Venezuelan delegation had problems with the [usual] formulation of [the
general article for the treatment of investors]. Because the carrying out of
obligations under this article can also be the subject of disagreements between an
investor and a host country which can be presented for international arbitration, the

Id. Protocol, Section 2 (Ad Article 3(1)).

Ex. R-151, Note to Dutch Parliament accompanying the Netherlands-Venezuela BIT dated 3 June
1992.

86

Venezuelan delegation feared that under the wording of this article the scope of the

international arbitration provision was not narrow enough and thus opened the

possibilities for misuse. To appease these objections, the word ‘arbitrary’ has been

substituted for ‘unreasonable’. Also, a protocol-text (section 2) has been laid down

in which the basic treatment is further defined as containing either national

treatment, or most-favored-nation treatment, depending on which of the two

treatments is the most favorable for the investor. Apart from that, the treatment

must fulfill the minimum standard under international law for the treatment of

foreigners.

The letter goes on to explain that the paragraph about applicable law was added in
response to “fundamental objections” initially presented by Venezuela to international
arbitration, based on the Calvo doctrine. The agreed text “can be seen as a break-through”.*">

The Explanatory Statement to the Venezuelan Congress is to the same effect:

Treatment not inferior to the minimum required by International Law for the
treatment of foreign nationals. This is, by definition, a pre-existing obligation of
the Parties, independently of the Agreement. Its express inclusion in the Protocol
which is an integral part of the Agreement has, however, a great importance
because it specifies expressions such as ‘fair and equitable treatment,’ and thus
limits the discretion of eventual arbitrators when examining the behaviour of any of
the Parties. *'

(2) The Relationship between Articles 3 and 4

295. The claims based on Article 3 were at first put in terms of what the Claimants saw as
guarantees of fiscal stability given by the Respondent in respect of their investments in the three
projects. Later, as will appear, the submissions emphasised what the Claimants saw as breaches
by the Respondent of their reasonable or legitimate expectations based on regulatory

frameworks, breaches caused by various increases in income tax and royalties or extraction tax.

296. The Respondent disputes the factual and legal bases of the contentions advanced by the
Claimants under Article 3. The Respondent also submits that, as a matter of interpretation of

the BIT, the various changes in tax and royalty rates that it introduced do not fall within the

313 Td.

a Ex. R-152 and Ex. R-229, Explanatory Statement for the Dutch Treaty presented to the Congress
of the Republic of Venezuela, dated November 19, 1991.

87

scope of Article 3; rather they are to be assessed by reference to Article 4. As a matter of

convenience and logic that submission is considered first.

(3) The Effect of Article 4

297. The Respondent contends that the “fair and equitable” treatment obligation imposed by
Article 3 of the Dutch Treaty does not apply to tax and fiscal measures. Article 4, it says, sets

out a specific standard of treatment with respect to tax and fiscal measures.*!°
Article 4 reads as follows:

With respect to taxes, fees, charges, and to fiscal deductions and exemptions, each
Contracting Party shall accord to nationals of the other Contracting Party with
respect to their investments in its territory treatment not less favourable than that
accorded to its own nationals or to those of any third State, whichever is more
favourable to the nationals concerned. For this purpose, however, there shall not be
taken into account any special fiscal advantages accorded by that Party:

a) under an agreement for the avoidance of double taxation; or

b) by virtue of its participation in a customs union, economic union, or similar
institutions; or

c) on the basis of reciprocity with a third State.

Under those express terms, the Respondent’s argument continues, “foreign investors in
Venezuela are entitled to be treated in the same manner as Venezuelan nationals and nationals of
third States”.*!° So long as its tax and fiscal measures were applied to the Dutch companies in a
non-discriminatory manner, which is undisputed in this case, there is no violation of its

obligations under the Treaty in relation to such measures.*!”

298. The Claimants reply that the Respondent is not relieved of liability by Article 4 of the
Treaty. It is not, they contend, a tax “carve-out” provision. The Respondent, they continue,
misconstrues the clear language of Article 4 to suggest that the Dutch Claimants may not bring

a fair and equitable treatment claim with respect to any tax and fiscal measures under the

as Resp. C-Mem. 217.
ae Resp. C-Mem. 218.
a7 Resp. C-Mem. {ff 217-18.

88

Treaty. According to the Claimants, Article 4 simply states that a foreign investor cannot bring
a claim for discrimination under either the national treatment or most favoured nation (MFN)
treatment standards due to more favourable provisions in tax treaties or economic unions that

either the Netherlands or Venezuela has entered into with third States.*'*

299. The Respondent further submits that the special treatment of tax and fiscal measures in
the Dutch Treaty is consistent with the overwhelming authority discussed in its Counter-
Memorial, recognising that taxation is a quintessential sovereign right. It is not unusual,
according to the Respondent, for investment treaties to exclude taxation matters from the fair
and equitable treatment standard. It cites a number of examples and tribunal rulings applying

provisions making such exclusions.

300. The Claimants respond that a true tax carve-out provision, as in issue in a number of
those cases, would exempt tax measures from the protection afforded by a treaty in terms such

as the following included in Article X of the US-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty:>"°

qd) With respect to its tax policies, each Party should strive to accord fairness
and equity in the treatment of investments of nationals and companies of the other
Party.

(2) Nevertheless, the provisions of this Treaty, and in particular Articles VI and
VII [concerning dispute settlement], shall apply to matters of taxation only with
respect to the following: (a) expropriation, pursuant to Article III; (b) transfers,
pursuant to Article IV; or (c) the observance and enforcement of terms of an
investment Agreement or authorization as referred to in Article VI(1) (a) or (b), to
the extent that they are not subject to the dispute settlement provisions of a
Convention for the avoidance of double taxation between the two Parties, or have
been raised under such settlement provisions and are not resolved within a
reasonable period of time.

That provision was in issue in Duke Energy, one of the cases discussed by the Parties.”

(4) The Ordinary Meanings and Purposes of Article 3 and Article 4

301. The Tribunal begins with the ordinary meanings of the terms of Article 3 and Article 4.
It gives particular attention to the differences between them. Article 3 is the more general in
scope being concerned with the “treatment of investments”; Article 4 deals with more specific

matters: “taxes, fees, charges, and ... fiscal deductions and exemptions”.

302. Paragraph (1) of Article 3 begins by requiring each Contracting Party to “ensure fair and
equitable treatment of the investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party”. That
obligation is the subject of the Protocol to the Agreement in which the Contracting Parties agree
that the treatment of investments shall be considered to be fair and equitable if the treatment
conforms to national treatment and to MEN treatment, as well as to the minimum standard for
the treatment of foreign nationals under international law. Paragraph (2) of Article 3 “more
particularly” requires that such investments be accorded full physical security and protection
which is not to be less than that accorded on a national or MEN basis. Paragraph (3) provides
for exceptions to the MEN treatment obligation, the details of which the Tribunal considers
later. Finally, paragraph (4) of Article 3 requires compliance with any other obligations a
Contracting Party may have with regard to the treatment of investments of nationals of the other
Party, if those obligations require treatment more favourable than that provided in the Treaty.

Like the Parties, the Tribunal does not see that final paragraph as relevant in this case.

303. Article 4 requires each Contracting Party “with respect to taxes, fees, charges, and to
fiscal deductions and exemptions” to accord the nationals of the other Contracting Party
national or MEN treatment; however, by contrast to Article 3, it says nothing about “fair and
equitable treatment”. That more specific obligation is subject to three particular exceptions, two

of which are not included in Article 3(3) and which are also considered later.

304. To summarise, there are three significant differences between Article 3 and Article 4, as

follows:

S.A. v. Republic of Ecuador, CSID Case No. ARB/04/19, Award dated August 18, 2008 at {{{]
171-89).

90

a. Article 3 imposes obligations relating to the treatment of investments of nationals
of the other Contracting Party in general, while Article 4 imposes obligations
“with respect to taxes” and related charges imposed on the nationals of the

Contracting Party.

b. Article 3 requires fair and equitable treatment and national and MEN treatment
(the latter repeated in the Protocol), while Article 4 requires only national and

MEN treatment.
c. Article 4 includes exceptions not included in Article 3(3).

305. The Claimants point out that the Treaty makes no explicit link between Article 3 and
Article 4. Thus the fair and equitable treatment obligation of Article 3(1) is not expressly made
“subject to Article 4” nor does Article 4 begin with the words “notwithstanding Article 3(1)’,
(only) national and MEN treatment is to be accorded in respect of taxes and charges. Article 4
is not, in their opinion, a tax “carve-out” provision such as that which they quoted from other

BITs.*™!

306. According to the Respondent, the drafters in this case did not use a “carve-out” approach
because they did not need to. Rather they dealt in successive provisions with the general case in
Article 3 and the specific case in Article 4. The specific provision must, its argument continues,
within its area of operation, exclude the general one. What role could the specific provision
play if the matters that it regulates were also to fall within the broader terms of Article 3(1) with
its more extensive obligations, notably the obligation to ensure fair and equitable treatment?
The Respondent also emphasises the significance in this context, as in others, of the care the
Parties to the Treaty, and especially the Respondent itself, had taken in the drafting of Article 3
and the Protocol to prevent a broad reading being given to the obligation to accord fair and

equitable treatment.*?

32 See supra J 300.
a See Resp. Rej. {| 377-380.

91

307. The Claimants respond that Article 4 does have a role while standing alongside and
independently of the fair and equitable treatment obligation in Article 3. The overlap which
they see relates only to discriminatory treatment on grounds of nationality in respect of taxes; in
that case alone Article 3(3) would defer to Article 4. Article 4 does not occupy the field with

respect to all Treaty issues relating to taxes.

(5) The Exceptions to Article 3 and Article 4

308. The Tribunal now addresses the detail of the two sets of exceptions included in Article
3(3) and in Article 4 to the obligations which each of those articles imposes. Article 3(1), when
read with the Protocol, requires, among other things, national and MFN treatment. Article 3(2)
also requires such treatment. Article 3(3) then makes the following exceptions to the MFN

treatment obligations:

If a Contracting Party has accorded special advantages to nationals of any third

State by virtue of agreements establishing customs unions, economic unions,

monetary unions or similar institutions, or on the basis of interim agreements

leading to such unions or institutions, that Contracting Party shall not be obliged to
accord such advantages to nationals of the other Contracting Party.

That list is to be compared with that included in Article 4, which sets out exceptions to
the non-discrimination obligations that it imposes in respect of taxes and fiscal matters. In
addition to the exceptions in respect of customs unions, economic unions or similar institutions,
Article 4 contains a further exception: it excludes from the effect of the non-discrimination
obligations special fiscal advantages accorded to a third Party by agreements for the avoidance of

double taxation or on a reciprocal basis.

(6) Effective Interpretation

309. If paragraph (1) of Article 3 (read with the Protocol) and paragraph (2) of that article
applied generally to taxation measures, the MFN treatment requirements of the provisions
would require that the benefit of those tax agreements with third States or that reciprocity be

accorded to the other Party to the BIT. As noted, the Claimants, recognising that point,

See Tr. Day 14:3824:18-22 (Claimants’ Counsel); Cl. Reply 473.
See supra { 307.

92

contend that to that extent but to that extent only Article 4 would override Article 3(3). But, on
that reading, the remainder of Article 4 would have no effect at all and the provision would
impose no obligation. That would be so notwithstanding the expressly mandatory terms of
Article 4: each Contracting Party, it declares, “shall accord” national and MEN treatment. It
would unnecessarily repeat those obligations that are already to be found in Article 3 along with
the related provisions of the Protocol. It is a well-established principle for the interpretation of
provisions of a treaty that they should if possible be interpreted so that they do not become

devoid of effect.*”*

Further, if the drafters had intended the reading proposed by the Claimants,
the direct way of achieving that would have been simply to include the double taxation
exception in Article 3 and not to have included Article 4 at all. The Claimants’ interpretation
would transform a provision, which on its face places defined obligations on the Contracting
Parties with carefully stated exceptions when they exercise their powers to impose taxes and
charges, into nothing more than a provision adding further exceptions to an obligation imposed
by another article which itself already contains specific exceptions, also included in the tax

provision. That would be remarkably awkward drafting.

(7) The Broader Context

310. The improbability of the Claimants’ proposed reading of Article 4 as merely providing
further limits on the Parties’ non-discrimination obligation additional to those already to be
found in Article 3(3) is increased by two contextual matters: the first specific to one of the
Contracting Parties to the Treaty; and the second more general. The first is that the
Netherlands’ model bilateral investment treaty includes Article 3 and Article 4 in essentially the
same form as they appear in the Netherlands-Venezuela Treaty, with the qualifications, already
noted, of the inclusion of the Protocol relating to Article 3(1) and the replacement of the word
“unreasonable” by “arbitrary”. Further, that format and wording is adopted in the majority of
the almost one hundred bilateral investment treaties which the Netherlands has signed. In a

number of those Netherlands’ bilateral investment treaties that do not have a separate provision

* See, e.g., Corfu Channel Case (Merits), Judgment, 9 April 1949, I.C.J. Reports 1949, p. 4 at p.
24; Case Concerning Ap} ion of the I 1C ion on the Elimination of all Forms
of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v. Russian Federation), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, 1
April 2011, {| 133.

93

about taxation along the lines of the standard Article 4, such as those with Chile, the People’s
Republic of China, the Czech Republic, Hungary, India, Lebanon, Mexico, Mongolia, the
Russian Federation and Slovakia, the double taxation agreement exception is included in the

general provision requiring fair and equitable protection and non-discrimination which in other

6

respects otherwise takes the standard Article 3 form.*”° That drafting is one direct way of

achieving the result which the Claimants seek.

311. The second contextual point is that, in at least five model bilateral investment treaties

which have no separate taxation provision, double tax agreements are expressly excluded from
the application of the non-discrimination obligations; see, for instance, the model bilateral
investment treaties of the People’s Republic of China (Article 8(3)), France (Article 4),
Germany (Article 3), India (Article 4), and the United Kingdom (Articles 3 and 7).*?”

312. The Parties referred the Tribunal to a number of decisions in which investors made
claims which the host State said were related to taxation and in terms of the relevant bilateral
investment treaty fell outside the scope of its protection. Some of the decisions confirm the
proposition, which both Parties accept, that the power to tax is in principle within the customary

regulatory or sovereign powers of the State.

313. That proposition is reflected in many treaties by the exclusion from their coverage of
matters of taxation, sometimes with exceptions to that exclusion, for instance when taxation
measures amount to an expropriation. Such exclusions are to be found for instance in the model
bilateral investment treaties of Canada (Article 16), the United States (Article 21), the US-
Ecuador Treaty quoted earlier (Article X), the Energy Charter Treaty (Article 21) and the North
American Free Trade Agreement (Article 2103).°78 The exclusions are also to be related to the
very extensive body of treaties dealing specifically with the issues of taxation — a separate,
large and highly technical field. All of the cases to which the Parties referred, as they also
acknowledge, essentially turn on the specific way in which tax matters are regulated by the
investment treaty in question. Those provisions are all markedly different from those in issue in
this case. In particular, they all expressly address the relationship between the Parties’
undertakings and matters of taxation by providing, for instance, that nothing in the Agreement
in question applies to taxation or that only certain provisions, especially the prohibition on
expropriation, apply. The Claimants emphasise the express terms of those provisions by
contrast to the silence on that matter of Articles 3 and 4 of the Dutch Treaty. That silence, they

contend, indicates that the two provisions are to operate alongside one another.

314. Because of the different formulations of the taxation provisions at issue in those cases to
the provisions in issue in this case, the Tribunal does not find them helpful except for their

recognition of the special character of the State power of taxation.

(8) Conclusion Regarding the Scope of Article 3 and of Article 4

315. What is critical for the Tribunal is the wording and structure of Article 3 and Article 4.
The wording and structure lead the Tribunal to the conclusion that matters of taxation, fees,
charges and fiscal deductions and exemptions are subject only to the obligations stated in
Article 4 and not to the more generally worded fair and equitable treatment obligation included
in Article 3. This conclusion, in summary, follows from three features of the provisions. First,

Article 3 imposes an apparently general treatment obligation in respect of investments, but is

328 Ex. R-143, 2004 Canada Model BIT; Ex. R-142, 2004 US Model BIT; Ex. R-146, Treaty
between the United States of America and the Republic of Ecuador Concerning the
Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment, 27 August 1993, Ex. R-140, Energy
Charter Treaty; Ex. R-141, NAFTA.

95

immediately followed by a provision, Article 4, specifically dealing with taxation and related
measures in respect of investments. Second, Article 3 imposes the broad and absolute
obligation of fair and equitable treatment (although qualified by the Protocol), while Article 4
imposes only the contingent obligations of national and MEN treatment, obligations already
included in Article 3 along with the fair and equitable treatment standard. That repetition by
itself indicates that each provision stands alone. That also appears from the third feature of the
two Articles. While Article 3(3) excepts from the MEN treatment obligation stated in Article 3
special advantages accorded to nationals of a third state by virtue of agreements establishing
customs unions, economic unions, monetary unions and similar bodies, it does not, by contrast
to Article 4, exclude “special fiscal advantages” accorded under double taxation agreements or

on the basis of reciprocity with a third State.

316. The determination of the meaning of the provisions must also have regard both to the
evident concern of Venezuela to limit its obligations under Article 3 and to the special character
of the power of a State to impose taxation. Other significant contextual matters supporting the
interpretation are, first, the near consistency of the wording of the Venezuelan Treaty with that
of many of the Netherlands’ bilateral investment treaties.” A second contextual matter is the
way in which the model bilateral investment treaties of a number of other States deal with
taxation — some expressly exclude matters of taxation largely or entirely. If they do not make
that express exclusion, but rather leave matters of taxation within the scope of general fair and
equitable treatment and MEN treatment obligations, they make express exceptions for double

taxation and other fiscal agreements.

317. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the changes made to the Venezuelan law
challenged by the Claimants “with respect to taxes, fees, charges, and to fiscal deductions and

°° the Claimants do not

exemptions” do not fall within the scope of Article 3. As already note
contend that any of those changes breach the non-discrimination prohibitions included in Article

4.

329 See supra J 310.
330 See supra J 307.

96

(9) Do the Measures Adopted by Venezuela Relating to Taxes and
Royalties Fall Within Article 4 of the BIT?

318. One of the measures challenged by the Claimants, namely, the Law Partially Reforming
the Income Tax Law dated 29 August 2006,**! amends the Income Tax Law by increasing the
applicable rate of income tax from 34 percent to 50 percent. There cannot be any doubt that that
is a measure with respect to “taxes”. But are royalties, such as those changed in the Law
Partially Reforming Decree No. 1,510 with Force of the Organic Hydrocarbons law of 16 May
2006,**? to be seen differently? That question would also arise in respect of the proposed

333.

increase in royalties announced on 10 October 2004,””“if that were relevant notwithstanding the

Claimants’ withdrawal of its reservation of its rights on 14 January 2005.°*

319. The Tribunal considers, first, the relevant provisions of the Venezuelan law, the
agreements made in terms of it and the adherences of participants to those agreements, second,
the ways in which the Claimants presented their claim relating to those two measures and,
finally, its understanding of the phrase at the beginning of Article 4: “taxes, fees, charges, and

... fiscal deductions and exemptions”.

(a) The Relevant Provisions of Venezuelan Law and Related
Agreements
320. Article 1 of the Hydrocarbons Law, as added in 1967,°°5 under the Part heading “Taxes”,
fixed the “production tax” at 16% percent. The Executive Branch was given the authority both
to lower the tax to make commercial production possible and to raise the previously lowered

production tax to the original rate when it deemed that the reasons for lowering it no longer

existed. Article 41 and all of the other provisions in that Part use the word “tax” to refer to the

regulation and calculation of the royalty, as well as to refer to other taxes.

321. Article 1 of the Royalty Agreement of the Strategic Associations of the Orinoco Oil Belt
between the Ministry of Energy and Mines**° and PdVSA of 29 May 1998 provides as

follows:**”

The object of this Agreement is to set the basis for the calculation of the

exploitation tax contemplated in Article 41 of the Hydrocarbons Law (hereinafter

the “Royalty”) and applicable to the exploitation of extra heavy crudes from the

Orinoco Oil Belt by Participants, in the above associations or projects (hereinafter

the “Association’”), pursuant to Article 5 of the Organic Law that Reserves for the

State the Industry and Commerce of Hydrocarbons, in the areas determined to that

effect by the Ministry.

The covering letter from the Ministry to PAVSA of 11 June 1998, (enclosing 11 copies of
the Agreement) states that the Agreements “will apply in the Strategic Associations approved by
the Sovereign Congress of the Republic for the exploitation and upgrading of crude from the
Orinoco Oil Belt”. The letter concludes by saying that “‘it is important that the participants of the

associations indicate in writing their ‘intention to adhere to such Agreements’”. The Royalty

Agreements were to be in force for up to nine years.***

322. The formal adherences of Petrozuata and in respect of Hamaca accept the May 1998
Agreement “for the calculation of the exploitation tax” set out in Article 1 of the Hydrocarbons
Law. The letters refer to the fact that the entity is a party to the relevant Association Agreement

approved by the Congress of the Republic of Venezuela in 1993 and 1997, respectively.**°

The name of the Ministry of Energy and Mines was changed in 2005 to the Ministry of Energy
and Petroleum and again, in 2007, to the People’s Ministry of Energy and Petroleum. See Cl.

323. A further agreement establishing “the procedure for Payment of the Exploitation Tax
(Royalty) for extra heavy crude produced and sulphur extracted by Petrozuata, C.A.” and
referring to the May 1998 Agreement was signed on 14 January 2002.*° Conoco Venezuela on
29 April 2002, when informing the Ministry of its intention to adhere to the relevant agreement

in respect of the Corocoro area, referred to the “Exploitation Tax (‘Royalty’)” owed to the

Nation in respect of crude oil developed by the company. *™!

324. The Tribunal sees those consistent references to “tax” in the documents relating to the
royalty as significant. The Venezuelan legislation, the agreements and the adherences all treat

the royalty payments as a tax.

(b) The Presentation of the Claimants’ Case With Respect to the
Relevant Measures

325. The Tribunal now considers the section of the Claimants’ Request for Arbitration headed

as follows:

In 2005 And 2006, Venezuela Abrogated Its Commitments With Respect
To The Fiscal _ Regime Applicable To The Petrozuata And Hamaca
Associations (Emphasis added.)

It specified the breaches in this way:*?

[...]. Most significantly, on May 16, 2006, the Venezuelan National Assembly
implemented an ‘extraction tax’ of one-third of the value of all hydrocarbons
extracted. This extraction tax functions in a manner identical to a royalty. Indeed,
the law specifically provides that royalty payments could be credited against
amounts owed for the extraction tax. Thus, whereas Venezuela had originally used
the promise of a nine-year royalty of one percent and a maximum royalty of 16.66
percent to induce ConocoPhillips to invest in Venezuela, the extraction tax required

that ConocoPhillips pay in substance a royalty of 33.33 percent for all extra-heavy
oil produced.

The dismantling of the fiscal regime promised to ConocoPhillips was completed
shortly thereafter when, on August 29, 2006, the National Assembly approved a
change in the income tax law that increased the tax rate for the extra-heavy oil
projects, including the Petrozuata and Hamaca Associations, from 34 to 50 percent,
effective January 1, 2007.

326. In the relevant part of their Memorial, headed “Total Abrogation by Venezuela of its
Fiscal Commitments to ConocoPhillips in 2005 and 2006”, the Claimants, after referring to the

increase in the income tax rate,*?

referred to “the next confiscatory ‘step’: The Extraction
Tax”. In their description of that measure, they mention the announcement by the
Venezuelan President of a new “Extraction Tax” and the National Assembly’s prompt approval

of it. The Memorial then says the following: **°

The new Extraction Tax effected a de facto increase in the existing production tax
(royalty) regime. The new tax functioned in a manner identical to the royalty
required under the production tax because; (a) it was calculated on the value of
liquid hydrocarbons extracted; (b) the taxpayer had the right to deduct any amount
paid as royalty from the amount of Extraction Tax owed; and (c) the calculation
method was the same as that set out in the New Hydrocarbons Law for calculating
royalty payments in cash. Minister Ramirez , Vice Minister Mommer and
President Chavez have all affirmed that the introduction of the Extraction Tax
raised the effective royalty rate to 33 1/3 percent. For the Petrozuata and Hamaca
Projects, this meant that within a period of 18 months, the applicable royalty rate
had been taken from one percent to 33 1/3 percent.

The Claimants conclude this part of the Memorial by quoting from a speech of 29 July
2007 by the Venezuelan President in which, in their words, he described “the Extraction Tax as
another ‘step’ in his administration’s plan to confiscate the interests of ConocoPhillips”.*“° The
Memorial, referring again to the Income Tax increase, states that, with that change, “Venezuela

accomplished the full and final dismantling of the fiscal regime guaranteed to ConocoPhillips in

respect of the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects”. The Memorial then refers to the letter of protest
of 29 November 2006 sent by ConocoPhillips to the Hydrocarbons Vice-Minister.*” That letter

included this passage:*“*

In particular, we note that in recent months, the government of Venezuela has (i)
amended the Hydrocarbons Law (amendments published in the Official Gazette on
May 24, 2006), creating an extraction tax of 33.33% applicable to all hydrocarbons
extracted by ConocoPhillips, (ii) increased the income tax from 34% to 50%,
effective January 1, 2007; and (iii) adopted Orders Nos. 313 and 314 of the
Ministry of Energy and Petroleum (published in the Official Gazette on November
14, 2006), which involve the imposition of royalties of 30% on associated gas,
condensate, liquid hydrocarbons, sulphur and coke produced by ConocoPhillips in
Venezuela.

These changes, among others, negatively affect and will continue to negatively

affect ConocoPhillips’ legitimate expectations, based on the guarantees offered by

the Venezuelan State.
327. In their Reply, the Claimants continued to treat the taxation and royalty rates together, as
“fiscal incentives” or as parts of a “fiscal regime” or as “fiscal guarantees”.*"” They quote from
the 1993 Bicameral Commission the recommendation that the Petrozuata Project had to be

subject to reduced income tax and royalty rates in order to attract investment.*°°

328. In their oral argument, the Claimants similarly grouped the income tax and royalty rates
together. The changes made to those rates in the 1990s, following the recommendations of the
1993 Bicameral Commission, are referred to as the “fiscal incentives” or the “fiscal regime”
necessary to induce them to make the major investments needed for the projects; in particular,
the royalty changes are referred to as “fiscal” measures and the Claimants assert that it was

those fiscal measures and that fiscal regime that was “dismembered” in 2005-2006.**!

329. The Respondent in its argument similarly treated the changes to the tax and royalty rates
in terms of the provisions of the BIT without distinguishing between them. Given the way that
the Claimants presented their claims, the Respondent had no reason to make any distinction.
The Respondent contended that those changes were “tax and fiscal measures”, which, if
governed by Article 4, were not in breach of that provision since the changes were not

2

discriminatory.** In its opinion, stated in its Rejoinder, “as Claimants’ fair and equitable

treatment claims relate solely to the changes in the tax and royalty rates, the provisions of

Article 4 govern”.>*?

It argued in the alternative that if the measures were not exclusively
governed by Article 4, the “tax and fiscal measures” did not in any event breach the fair and
equitable standard set forth in the BIT.*** That is to say the Respondent, on its view of Article
4, does not argue that the royalty payments are “taxes” according to some specific definition of

the word.

(c) The Tribunal’s Conclusion That the Relevant Measures Fall
Within Article 4
330. The positions of the Parties as presented by the Parties during the course of the arbitration
indicate that the tax and royalty measures constitute a “fiscal regime”. That understanding of
the opening phrase in Article 4 is supported by the first meaning of “fiscal” in the Oxford

English Dictionary:

“of or pertaining to the fisc or treasury of a State or Prince; pertaining to the public
revenue”.

To go to the noun, the applicable definition of “fisc” is the State treasury. Royalties such
as those in issue here are payable to the State. The royalties, along with the taxes, are part of the

public revenue.

331. It may also be noted that in terms of standard legal definitions of tax, such as those
in Black’s Law Dictionary and Thomas M Cooley’s writings on taxes and constitutional law,
royalties such as those here may well qualify as taxes. Those definitions involve a charge
levied by the State by virtue of its sovereignty to yield public revenue for the support of
government and for all public needs. The Tribunal need not, however, decide that issue since
royalties appear without any question to fall within the compendious phrase used at the

beginning of Article 4 and in particular within “fiscal deductions”.

332. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the measures taken in May and August 2006 do
not fall within the scope of Article 3. It follows that the Tribunal need not go on to consider
whether those measures breached the fair and equitable treatment standard set out in that
provision and elaborated in the Protocol to the BIT. As already noted, the Claimants accept that

the measures did not breach Article 4.

B. CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF THE OBLIGATION NOT TO EXPROPRIATE UNDER
ARTICLE 6 OF THE NETHERLANDS- VENEZUELA TREATY

333. The Tribunal has determined in the previous section of this Decision that the Dutch
Claimants are unable to base their claims on the fair and equitable treatment standard included

in Article 3 of the BIT. It accordingly now turns to Article 6 of the BIT which the Claimants
contend has also been breached by the Respondent. It provides as follows:
“Article 6
Neither Contracting Party shall take any measures to expropriate or nationalise
investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party or take measures having an
effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation with regard to such investments,
unless the following conditions are complied with:
(a) the measures are taken in the public interest and under due process of law;
(b) the measures are not discriminatory or contrary to any undertaking which the

Contracting Party taking such measures may have given;

103

334.

(c) the measures are taken against just compensation. Such compensation shall
represent the market value of the investments affected immediately before the
measures were taken or the impending measures became public knowledge,
whichever is the earlier; it shall include interest at a normal commercial rate until
the date of payment and shall, in order to be effective for the claimants, be paid
and made transferable, without undue delay, to the country designated by the
claimants concerned and in the currency of the country of which the claimants are
nationals or in any freely convertible currency accepted by the claimants.”

The Parties’ submissions and evidence relating to this provision raised several issues. At

this stage, the Tribunal proposes to make rulings on four of them:

335.

(1) the date of the valuation it is to make; is it the date of the taking, 26 June 2007, or
the date of the Award?

(2) were the measures taken by the Respondent expropriating or nationalizing the
investments unlawful as a breach of Article 6(b) because they were contrary to any
undertaking which the Respondent gave?

(3) did the measures taken by the Respondent between 2004 and 2007 amount to a
single taking and, as a consequence, was the taking unlawful, with the valuation of the
investments being measured by applying the original royalty rate and income tax rate?

(4) did the Respondent in the negotiations with the Claimants concerning the
compensation payable in respect of the taking of the Claimants’ investments negotiate in
good faith in accordance the standard stated in Article 6(c) of market value of the
investments immediately before the measures were taken or the impending measures
became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier, and were its actions accordingly

lawful?

The Claimants, to quote their Memorial, have not challenged and in the arbitration do not

challenge, the Respondent’s sovereign prerogative to nationalize. But, they continue, the

Respondent must exercise that prerogative lawfully.>>. They contend, in brief, that the takings
were unlawful for one or more of the reasons indicated in questions (2)-(4) in paragraph 334
above, and that because of that unlawfulness the value is to be determined at the date of the
Award. The Respondent submits that the takings were lawful and that, whether the taking is

lawful or not, it is the date of taking that is the date of valuation.

336. It is convenient to consider the issue of the valuation date ahead of the three issues of
lawfulness: if the date of the taking is the valuation date whether the taking is lawful or not, the

Tribunal would not need to consider those three issues.

(wD The date of valuation of the investment taken by the Respondent

337. The Claimants contend, on the basis of principle and the authorities, that if the taking is
unlawful then the date of the award and not the date of the taking is in general the date of
valuation.**° That submission is supported by the fact that “as a result of improving market
conditions in the energy sector, the [three projects] have increased in value since the final act of
confiscation by Venezuela on June 26, 20077357. The Claimants submit that the Treaty is silent
on the standard of reparation for takings carried out other than in accordance with the conditions
specified in Article 6 of the BIT; “in these circumstances,” they continue, “it is well settled that
tribunals must look to customary international law for the applicable standard of reparation”>**,

They cite a number of authorities in support of this submission. The first in time is the

Judgment of the Permanent Court of International Justice in Chorzow Factory (Merits) PCI

Pubs A17, where the taking in issue was unlawful; it was in breach of Poland’s obligations:

The action of Poland which the Court has judged to be contrary to the Geneva
Convention is not an expropriation — to render which lawful only the payment of
fair compensation would have been wanting; it is a seizure of property, rights and
interests which could not be expropriated even against compensation, save under the
exceptional conditions fixed by Article 7 of the said Convention. As the Court has
expressly declared in Judgment No. 8, reparation is in this case the consequence not

105

of the application of Articles 6 to 22 of the Geneva Convention, but of acts contrary
to those articles. (A No. 17, p. 46.)

The Court continued in terms of principle:
The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act — a principle
which seems to be established by international practice and in particular by the
decisions of arbitral tribunals — is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out
all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in
all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind,
or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a
restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained
which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it — such

are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation due
for an act contrary to international law. (A No. 17, p. 47; see also p. 29.)

At an earlier stage in the case, it had said this:
It is a principle of international law that the breach of an engagement involves an
obligation to make reparation in an adequate form. Reparation therefore is the

indispensable complement of a failure to apply a convention and there is no necessity
for this to be stated in the convention itself. (A No. 9, p. 21.)

338. The Claimants seek support from decisions to the same effect of other ICSID tribunals,
the Iran-US Claims Tribunal, the European Court of Human Rights and ad hoc international
tribunals, scholarly writing and the International Law Commission’s Articles on the
Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (2001). Article 31 (1) of that text,

headed Reparation, provides that:

The responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury
caused by the internationally wrongful act.

339. In support of that provision, the Commission cited passages from the Chorzéw judgment
including those quoted above. “Full reparation” may take the form of restitution, compensation
and satisfaction either singly or in combination (Article 34). Under Article 36(2) “The
compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as
it is established.” Those ILC Articles, supported in their commentaries by reference to the

authorities, have been regularly referred to in subsequent decisions, including ICSID awards

106

and decisions, as codifying or declaring customary international law, e.g. ADC v. Hungary*,
LG&E vy. Argentine Republic; CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic*';
and Siemens AG v. Argentine Republic*”, and other decisions and awards summarised in the
UN Secretariat Reports A/62/62, paragraphs 103-115, and A/65/76, paragraphs 28-43). A
number of those cases, in addition to citing the ILC articles and Chorzéw Factory, refer to a
363

consistent body of earlier decisions including Texaco v. Libya (1977)

(1987).3%,

and Amoco v. Iran

340. The Respondent emphasizes the terms of Article 6 of the BIT: that provision requires
compensation for expropriation to be made according to the market value at the date of the
taking*®. From the Chorzéw Factory case it refers particularly to the proposition that “in the
normal case, failure to pay compensation does not change the valuation date”*, That, it says,
is the teaching of basically all the decisions. It cites the Tribunal in the LIAMCO case which,

after discussing Chorzéw Factory, said this:

in a lawful expropriation where the only wrongful act was the failure to pay the just
price of what had been expropriated, the compensation due should be the value of the
undertaking at the time of dispossession.”

341. It also refers to the ICSID Tribunal decision in Santa Elena v. Costa Rica®®, in which the
Tribunal determined the value of the property expropriated as at the date of its taking. The
Claimants, in response, submit that the Santa Elena and LIAMCO cases involved lawful takings,

while the takings in this case were unlawful (referring also to Vivendi v. Argentina).*°

342. The Tribunal, coming back to the terms of the BIT, does not consider that the extent of
the compensation payable in respect of an unlawful taking of an investment, for instance
because it is in breach of an “undertaking” in terms of Article 6(b), is to be determined under
Article 6(c): that provision establishes a condition to be met if the expropriation is in all other
respects in accordance with Article 6. So, in the Chorzdw case, the Court did not determine
reparation in accordance with the provisions of the Convention before it, because it was
concerned with a dispossession in breach of those provisions. It decided in accordance with
“the essential principle” quoted earlier, that is a principle of customary international law, not
dependent on the Convention provisions. The other cases cited are also to be understood in that
way. Next, the cases cited by the Respondent in which the Tribunal fixed the compensation by
reference to the value of the property at the time of the taking are cases where the taking was
lawful and the only allegedly wrongful act was the claimed failure to pay the value of the
investment to be fixed, either in terms of the relevant treaty or customary international law, at

0,

the time of the taking;*” in Santa Elena, the valuation submissions by the Parties and the

tribunal’s assessment related only to the date of taking; the Respondent also refers to Mondev v.

343. The Tribunal, on the basis of principle and the authorities reviewed above, concludes that
if the taking was unlawful, the date of valuation is in general the date of the award. The
Tribunal accordingly turns to the contentions of the parties about the lawfulness of the taking of

the investments, as listed in paragraph 334 (2)-(4) above.

(2) Did the Respondents taking of the Claimants’ investments breach an
“undertaking” in terms of Article 6(b) of the BIT?

344. The Tribunal recalls that Article 6 provides that neither Contracting Party shall take any

measures to expropriate or nationalize investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party

unless, among other things,

(b) “the measures are not discriminatory or contrary to any undertaking which
the Contracting Party taking such measures may have given.”

345. In the final stage of the hearings the Claimants’ argument had moved away from the
submissions made in the written pleadings and at the opening of the hearings that the
Respondent had abrogated fiscal guarantees*””. Even in the absence of express stabilization,
their counsel contended, international law provided protection for “commitments made by a
State to induce an investment where the commitment is relied upon by the Investor”*”’,
Counsel cited investment arbitration cases as demonstrating that the State did not have a magic
eraser that could erase the terms on the basis that there were no legitimate expectations unless
there exists a stabilization agreement. Several cases were cited in support of the proposition

that

where there is a relationship, a specific relationship and negotiated relationship
between the State and a foreign investor on the strength of which investment occurs,
the foreign investor changes its position, commits itself to the State, makes an
investment in the territory of the State, the consequence is not a treaty, not a reversal
of the principle of sovereignty, but a legitimate expectation entitled to respect.°”4

See Tr. Day 13:3497.
See Tr. Day 13:3499.

374

109

346. Counsel for the Respondent submitted that those cases did not support the Claimants’
position in law and in fact. He also cited other cases which in his view supported the

Respondent’s position.*”°

347. The cases in which the particular claimants alleged breaches of their legitimate or
reasonable expectations turned on fair and equitable treatment obligations included in the
relevant treaty or on provisions requiring decisions in accordance with “international law”
among other sources. Given the ruling which the Tribunal has already made that the claims in
respect of the tax measures do not fall within the scope of the FET provision of Article 3 but
within Article 4 concerned with taxation and related matters, no breach of which is alleged,
those cases are not relevant. Rather what has to be determined in this case is whether

Venezuela has given “an undertaking” which it has breached by its taking of the Claimants’

assets.

348. The Tribunal understands the word “undertaking” to bear its ordinary meaning of a
promise. In the context of a binding international agreement, the promise is one which is
binding in law on the person who has made it. That meaning gains further support from the
careful particularity of the statements of obligation included in the substantive provisions of the
agreement and its protocol both of which, as already noted, depart in important ways from the

Netherlands model investment treaty.

349. Have the Claimants demonstrated on the basis of the evidence presented to the Tribunal
that the Respondent gave undertakings to the Claimants or their predecessors in respect of the
tax and related measures which were breached by the changes made to those measures and by

the taking of the Claimants’ assets?

350. The Claimants, through their counsel at the final stages of the hearing, effectively
provided the answer, a negative one, to that question. Their argument, as noted, was no longer
in terms of guarantees or express stabilization provisions but was made by reference to

legitimate or reasonable expectations, with at best passing and unsupported references to
375

See Tr. Day 13:3667-3671.

110

“commitments”.*”° But such expectations cannot themselves establish a commitment of the
kind contemplated by Article 6(b). At best, they might fall within the scope of the fair and
equitable cause in Article 3, but, for the reasons already given that is not available to the

Claimants in this case.

351. In any event, as the cross-examination of the Claimants’ witnesses by reference to the

documentary record so clearly showed, no undertaking can be found in that record.*””.

352. Accordingly, this part of the claim fails.

(3) Did the measures taken by the Respondent between 2004 and 2007
amount to a single taking and, as a consequence, was the taking
unlawful, with the valuation of the investments being measured by
applying the original royalty rate and income tax rate?

353. The Claimants contend the Respondent must compensate them for the value of their
investments excluding the effect of all of its unlawful and expropriatory measures.*”* The
“single taking”, they submit, is established as a matter of fact by statements made by President
Chavez on 29 July 2007 and by Minister Ramirez on 8 February 2008. Each of the five
progressive steps, consisting of incremental breaches of the promised fiscal regime, was
interconnected by design. The interconnected nature of the Respondent’s actions was detailed
by none other than President Chavez in that speech in which he revealed the plan put in place

9

years before the projects went into commercial operation.*” The Claimants conclude their

discussion of the facts in this way:

In asking the Tribunal to consider Venezuela’s measures from 2004 to 2007 as a
single taking, ConocoPhillips has asked the Tribunal to consider those measures in
the very same manner as President Chavez and Minister Ramirez have publicly
described them: as progressively giving Venezuela a greater take of ConocoPhillips’
investments until it finally “buried” them. Venezuela would understandably prefer
that the Tribunal only consider ConocoPhillips’ investments at the burial stage so

that it may be rewarded with a discount for expropriating ConocoPhillips’
investments.**°

354. On the law, the Claimants contend that the cases they cite stand for the proposition that a
tribunal does not merely look at the last and final act in order to assess liability and the nature of
the expropriation.**! Because the measures were interconnected, the value of the confiscated
interests of the Claimants must be measured according to the value of the investments applying
the royalty rate and income tax rate the Respondent had guaranteed to induce the

. 382
investments.

355. The Respondent contends that none of the 10 cases which the Claimants cite in support of
their “novel theory” do in fact support it? A detailed review of each of the cases, it says,
demonstrates the extent to which the Claimants have distorted precedent in their effort to
manufacture a legal basis for their claims.*** A number of the cases indeed support the opposite
conclusion, with damages being calculated at the date of the taking in accordance with the
amended law. In its Rejoinder, the Respondent points out that the Claimants in their Reply did
not even try to rehabilitate or justify their inaccurate portrayal of the cases they cited.*** In the

Rejoinder the Respondent provides a further review of the cases cited by the Claimants.**°

356. The Respondent further submits that the Claimants hope by this argument to impose

liability for measures which were themselves entirely lawful.**” All of those measures taken

from 2004 to 2006, were non-discriminatory and non-confiscatory, and none of them deprived

the Claimants of the “fruits” of their investment or forced them to abandon their interests.°***

357. The Respondent also contends that the Claimants’ “single taking” theory has no basis in
fact. The speeches they cite were not some sort of confession of a single plan in existence years
before the February 2007 Decree. Rather, they were simply a review of the measures taken.
The history shows the opposite of what the Claimants submit. It was not until January 2007 that

the decision was made to require migration:

Until then, the policy had been to correct what the Government considered to be
irregularities in the associations and to ensure fairness in the royalty and tax regime.
Claimants’ pure speculation that the Government had something else in mind all
along flies in the face of the entire record in this case.*?

358. At the opening of the hearings, counsel for the Claimants played a video of President
Chavez’ speech and recalled the speeches of Minister Ramirez >" he also referred to the cases
cited in the pleadings, but without responding to the Respondent’s review of those cases.**!
Counsel for the Respondent referred to that review and its understanding of the cases; he also
contended, citing relevant authorities, that government officials are presumed to be acting in
good faith.°? The Respondent came back to the good faith issue in the final rounds,*?? when

the matter was otherwise the subject of only limited attention.

359. The Tribunal recalls that it has decided that the challenges by the Claimants to changes in
the tax and royalty law fail. These changes were not taken in breach of Article 4 which
excludes the application of Article 3 in its field of application. Accordingly, for that reason
alone, the single taking contention, insofar as it would characterise those changes as unlawful

and make them relevant to the calculation of quantum, must fail.

360. It follows that the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to resolve the other issues of

fact and law presented by this submission.

(4) Did the Respondent in the iati about

in good faith by reference to the standard in Article 6(c) of the BIT?

361. Article 6 provides that neither Contacting Party shall take any measures to expropriate or

nationalise investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party unless, among other things:

(c)the measures are taken against just compensation. Such compensation shall
represent the market value of the investments affected immediately before the
measures were taken or the impending measures became public knowledge,
whichever is the earlier; it shall include interest at a normal commercial rate until
the date of payment and shall, in order to be effective for the claimants, be paid
and made transferable, without undue delay, to the country designated by the
claimants concerned and in the currency of the country of which the claimants are
nationals or in any freely convertible currency accepted by the claimants.

362. The requirements for prompt payment and for interest recognise, in accordance with the

general understanding of such standard provisions, that payment is not required at the precise
moment of expropriation. But it is also commonly accepted that the Parties must engage in
good faith negotiations to fix the compensation in terms of the standard set, in this case, in the

BIT, if a payment satisfactory to the investor is not proposed at the outset.

(a) The submissions of the Parties

363. The Tribunal begins with the Parties’ submissions which were based on the evidence they
presented about the negotiations by way of documents and written testimony by witnesses who
were subject to examination before the Tribunal. It then examines and assesses that evidence in
detail. The evidence relates to two overlapping periods, the first, from 2006 to early 2007,
concerning the proposed migration of the projects into empresas mixtas and the second from
early 2007 concerning the negotiations both before the taking of the investments, in June 2007,

and beyond.

364. The witnesses who testified about the negotiations were Mr A. Roy Lyons, President of

ConocoPhillips Venezuela from 2005 to June 2008 called by the Claimants; and

114

Dr Bernard Mommer, the Venezuelan Vice-Minister of Hydrocarbons from January 2005 to
June 2008, called by the Respondent*™*, The documentary evidence consists of the
Respondents’ non binding term sheets of August 2006 relating to the migration of the
Petrozuata and Hamaca Associations*”», the Respondent’s draft contracts of 17 and 22 January
2007 for the migration of the three Associations, the three ConocoPhillips “trigger” letters of 31

7°, its three letters of 12 April 2007 responding to oral proposals made on 29 and

January 200
31 March 2007°**”, three requests by the Ministry in May 2007 for comments by ConocoPhillips
on a draft contract for the conversion of Hamaca to an empresa mixta which was attached to the
first request, but which was not included in that exhibit submitted to the Tribunal*’*, the two
written proposals made by ConocoPhillips in June and August 2007°*,and_ various public
statements made in 2007 and 2008 by ConocoPhillips officials and Venezuelan Ministers. The
limited extent of the documentation may be explained by a confidentiality agreement referred to

in the proceedings, but not documented or given any precision*” or by the fact that offers stated

expressly that they were made without prejudice, or both.

365. The Claimants submit that in late 2006, at the time of the proposed “migration”,

ConocoPhillips negotiated in good faith about the possible relinquishment of its rights in

ee Gregory Goff testified very briefly that he was heavily involved in the compensation negotiations,

that he had signed a confidentiality agreement and that the negotiations went on for a long time;
(See. Tr. Day 3:684). He was based in Venezuela in 2004-2005. Jeff W Sheets testified that he
was aware of discussions within senior management in 2005, 2006 and 2007 about the
Association Agreements and their compensation provisions but was not involved in them (See.
Tr. Day 6:1547:13-20).

and Petroleum and Eulogio Del Pino, President of CVP and Director of PdVSA Petréleo, S.A.,
dated August 17, 2007.

exchange for fair, prompt and adequate compensation, but Venezuela refused to offer
compensation representing more than a fraction of the value of those interests; further it insisted
that ConocoPhillips execute a waiver of rights including the right to have recourse to
international arbitration, as a condition for any compensation.*”! According to the Claimants,
under the August 2006 term sheets for the migration of the Petrozuata and Hamaca Associations

into empresas mixtas,

[t]he compensation proposed by Venezuela for this planned expropriation was
limited to offering ConocoPhillips reduced and unprotected minority stakes in the
new empresas mixtas, without the right of recourse to international arbitration. In
fact, ConocoPhillips would have to pay a bonus in order to participate in the new
empresas mixtas, and would also have to waive all claims arising from the
expropriation.

366. On 16 January 2007 Rafael Ramirez , the Minister of Hydrocarbons, was reported as
saying that the Government was initiating a new phase in discussions on the partnership
agreements for companies operating in the Orinoco Oil Belt through a nationalization law. In

2006 it had not been possible to reach agreements with the foreign oil companies:

The Minister said that once the nationalization law is issued, we can provide details
on the time frames. For now, we are calling on all partners to discuss separately
what their future will be in these strategic partnerships.

367. Mr Lyons, in his testimony, said that the August 2006 terms were unacceptable to
ConocoPhillips and that with his colleagues he made that clear in discussions with Mr Del Pino,
a PdVSA executive, and Dr Bernard Mommer, Vice-Minister of Hydrocarbons. On 17 and 22
January 2007, ConocoPhillips received copies of draft contracts for the conversion of each of
the three Associations into an empresa mixta. Under their terms ConocoPhillips would,
according to the submissions, in relation to the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects, (1) have a
reduced stake in the new empresa mixta, (2) contribute an extra amount to the capital of the

empresa mixta, (3) transfer all assets to the body, (4) receive no compensation, and (5) waive all

claims. In the case of Hamaca, ConocoPhillips was also to pay a bonus*”, According to the

Claimants:

[i]Jn sum, the migration comprised expropriation, minimal compensation in the form
of a reduced participation in the resulting empresa mixta and waiver of all claims
arising from the expropriation. But for the waiver requirement (which was
unacceptable), ConocoPhillips might have been able to accept the terms of the
migration in order to mitigate damages, knowing that it could sue to obtain further
compensation for the expropriation. However, Venezuela never relented with respect
to its waiver demand.

368. The Respondent flatly denies the last point about the bonus to be paid in respect of the

Hamaca project, by reference to the Hamaca contract with Chevron. *°5

369. Dr Mommer also testified that under the proposals the projects were to be doubled in

area.‘

370. On 31 January 2007, representatives of CoconoPhillips, including Mr Lyons, met
representatives of the Venezuelan Ministry of Hydrocarbons, including Vice-Minister Mommer,
and of PAVSA. Mr Lyons said that the Venezuelan officials were informed that the terms they
proposed were inadequate. Accordingly, the waiver of all legal claims to additional
compensation was plainly unreasonable. But, he says, Dr Mommer made it clear that the
government did not intend to modify the terms. “In the circumstances, as a potential measure,
we provided to the government trigger letters invoking our rights under the Foreign Investment

Law and the applicable bilateral investment treaty.”“°”

371. Following the making of the “Nationalization Decree” on 26 February 2007

ConocoPhillips says that its executives attended a number of meetings with the President of the

PdVSA subsidiary, Minister Ramirez and Vice-Minister Mommer among others. The
Claimants considered that the latter made it clear that Venezuela had no intention of
compensating ConocoPhillips adequately for the forced transfer of the projects. ConocoPhillips
informed Venezuela that it would not relinquish its rights and interests without adequate
compensation.“°* At a meeting held on 29 March 2007, Venezuela, ConocoPhillips says, made
offers in respect of its interests in the Petrozuata and Hamaca projects but not in respect of
Corocoro. These offers, according to the Claimants, came nowhere close to reflecting the fair
market value of those interests. On 12 April 2007 Mr Lyons wrote letters in respect of each of
the three projects to the Minister, the Vice-Minister and the President of the PdVSA subsidiary
referring to that meeting and another held on 31 March. In those letters, ConocoPhillips stated
it “would like to continue efforts to negotiate in good faith the possibility of an agreement with
respect to the terms on which ConocoPhillips will participate in the migration of [each] Project

with a mixed company . . . pursuant to [the 26 February 2007] Decree...”. There remained,
however, fundamental differences between ConocoPhillips and the Government about the terms
for nationalization. In that context the letters referred to two verbal compensation proposals
made at a meeting of 29 March 2007. Mr Lyons asked for confirmation of the proposals in

several respects.“

372. Mr Lyons in his testimony says that from March to June 2007 he participated in further
meetings with Ministry and PdVSA officials, in which, together with other ConocoPhillips
personnel, he attempted to engage in good faith negotiations for fair compensation. He referred
in particular to the meeting of 29 March and the ConocoPhillips responses to the offers made by
the PdVSA official. The last meeting, of at least nine held since January before the final
deadline of 26 June 2007 fixed in the February 2007 Decrees, was held on 20 June. On 26 June,
Venezuela, he says, took the three ConocoPhillips investments in their entirety without

providing any compensation at all.

373. The Respondent submits that

4s Cl. Mem. at 238.
” Ex. C-241, supra fn. 397.

118

In an attempt to reach agreement on an orderly and amicable migration,
representatives of the ConocoPhillips companies were called to several meetings to
discuss drafts of the documents for conversion of the associations to mixed
companies. However, unlike the other companies, including its own partners in the
Hamaca Project (Chevron) and the Corocoro Project (Eni), ConocoPhillips refused to
participate in the negotiation process in any meaningful manner. The meetings did
proceed with the other companies, and, in most cases, reached a successful
conclusion, much like the earlier process for the migration of the Operating Service
Agreements.*"”

The indispensable fact remains that ConocoPhillips is one of only two exceptions and
that virtually the entire international oil industry continues to do business and seek
new business opportunities in Venezuela*!!

374. The Respondent continues that although ConocoPhillips refused to participate in any
meaningful way in the migration process, the Venezuelan Government agreed to discuss
reasonable compensation. As reported in the press, “those discussions proceeded in good faith
on an amicable basis for some time”. It quoted the ConocoPhillips CEO, Mr Mulva, speaking
in early 2008:

We continue our discussions with PdVSA and the Venezuelan authorities .. I
believe that we are making progress. It will take time. I would like to see and hope
that we can come to some sort of solution to this in 2008...

We’re going to do this in a very deliberate way[;] the objective is to reach an

amicable solution so as not to follow the (arbitration) process though for a number of
412

years.

375. It refers to the two written proposals made by ConocoPhillips on 15 June 2007 and 17
August 2007 referred to in Dr Mommer’s evidence. He says of the second of those proposals, a
modification of the first, that it was completely unrealistic because it gave no consideration to
the compensation formulas negotiated at the outset and applicable to the Petrozuata and Hamaca
Projects and did not refer the true value of the interests at issue without considering those
formulas. Dr Mommer refers to the settlement discussions in these terms: “we were always
“10 Resp. C-Mem. {{ 112.

open to paying reasonable compensation, but ConocoPhillips from the beginning insisted on
exorbitant sums that made settlement impossible”.“° The Respondent says of the
ConocoPhillips proposals that they were based on unrealistic assumptions regarding both
valuation and legal issues and totally disregarded the express limitations of liability provided for
under both the Congressional Authorizations and the Petrozuata and Hamaca Association
agreements. Those elaborate compensation provisions were negotiated at great length more
than a decade earlier. In short neither the amounts sought then or in this case has ever been a

414

serious compensation demand. It emphasises, especially in its Rejoinder, the Claimants’

failure to call attention to the compensation provisions.*!>

376. The Respondent, later in its Counter-Memorial, develops its argument that the claims of
the Claimants relating to the two major projects, Petrozuata and Hamaca, have to be dismissed
in any event because they fall foul of the carefully structured compensation provisions of the
Congressional Authorizations and the Association Agreements governing those projects.*!®
Non economic measures, such as the change of operatorship, were not covered and “significant
economic damage” had to be caused. The structure flowed from the condition of the
Congressional Authorizations reserving the State’s sovereign right to take action affecting the
Projects but allowing Maraven and Corpoven to provide compensation in certain circumstances.

Further, the February 2007 Decree was non-discriminatory in nature.

377. The Claimants, in their Reply, in response to the Respondent’s contention that they were
uncooperative in the compensation negotiations, quote public statements by Minister Ramirez
in August 2007, February 2008 and September 2008 indicating that the Parties were in fact
continuing to seek an amicable solution.*!”

378. The Claimants also submit that the Association Agreements cannot alter Venezuela’s

obligations to the Claimants under international law and that the compensation provisions are

irrelevant to their claims.*'* The Tribunal’s interest at this stage is not with the substance of this
difference between the Parties but rather with the role that the compensation provisions did or

did not play in the negotiations from mid-2006 to 2007 and beyond.
379. At the end of the hearings the Claimants submitted that:

Now, if Venezuela had actually made a good faith offer of compensation and then
provided a reasonable opportunity for the Parties to resolve their dispute, we accept
that that would have been a lawful expropriation, sub modo, subject to the actual
payment of compensation and interest. But that’s not what happened.*””

380. They recalled, from the migration period, Venezuela’s failure to make any written
compensation offer, its oral offers as set out in Mr Lyons’ testimony, an account not
contradicted by Venezuela, Mr Lyons’ three April 2007 letters to which Venezuela did not
reply, and Mr Lyons’ evidence that Vice-Minister Mommer stated that compensation would not
be based on fair market value; and, from the settlement negotiations period, when

ConocoPhillips had decided not to migrate, the two proposals which ConocoPhillips made. #20

381. The Respondent countered by recalling that Dr Mommer had testified that it had offered
and did discuss compensation in terms of market value in good faith and mentioning the impact
of the compensation provisions. Further, the Respondent contrasted the claim of $30 billion
made in the arbitration with the $6 or $7 billion offered by the Claimants. Further, there was
over a year of intensive negotiations — a fact that in itself indicates a negotiation in good faith

involving serious offers.*?!

(b) The Tribunal’s assessment of the evidence relating to the
negotiations
382. The Tribunal now sets out the evidence more fully and makes its assessment of it. It

begins with the evidence given by Mr Lyons and Dr Mommer. Mr Lyons states that he and his

colleagues made it clear to Mr Del Pino of PdVSA and to Vice-Minister Mommer that the

proposals made in the August 2006 term sheets for the migration were not acceptable.

Although the terms of the proposed transition were not fully spelled out in the two-
page term sheets, they clearly showed that Venezuela intended to take the existing
interests of ConocoPhillips in those Projects, and offer in return a diminished stake
and rights in the new empresas mixtas. The term sheets also demanded that we
waive any claims in relation to the nationalization.*”

383. Although called as a witness, Mr Lyons was not cross-examined on this statement or
indeed on any part of his written testimony about the negotiations from August 2006 until June
2007. (He held his position in Venezuela until June 2008.) Following the receipt of the draft
contracts of 17 and 19 January 2007, Mr Lyons testifies that with a colleague he attended a

meeting with Vice-Minister Mommer and several PdVSA officials:

At that meeting, we made clear that the terms being offered to compensate
ConocoPhillips for relinquishing its rights in the existing Projects and migrating to
the empresas mixtas regime were inadequate. Vice Minister Mommer made clear,
however, that the government did not intend to modify these terms. In the
circumstances, as a protective measure, we provided to the government trigger letters
invoking our rights under Venezuela’s Foreign Investment Law and applicable
bilateral investment treaty.”~

384. Those “trigger letters” contained this passage:

In light of Venezuela’s stated intention not to negotiate the terms of its expropriation
with ConocoPhillips, ConocoPhillips reserves the right to submit the dispute to
international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty and the
Foreign Investment Law at any time necessary to protect its legal interests. In this
context, ConocoPhillips accepts Venezuela’s offers to submit this dispute to ICSID
arbitration, as set forth in the Treaty and the Foreign Investment Law.**4

385. Dr Mommer in cross-examination said that he did not think that that was the breakpoint

in the negotiations. The blanks in the model contracts remained negotiable as the success of the

negotiations with the other Parties to the Association Agreements showed.*> Dr Mommer’s

testimony becomes specific, in terms of the sums proposed, only in respect of the proposals

made by ConocoPhillips in June and August 2007, considered later?®, In respect of the

migration proposals of the second half of 2006 he says that he had various meetings with the

project participants about restructuring with expansion opportunities but “ConocoPhillips was

not interested in these concepts”.*?7 In cross-examination, in response to the proposition that

ConocoPhillips did seek to negotiate in that period, he said that they were less interested than

the other two companies, but he would never say they were not interested.

428

he makes this general statement about the negotiations:

426

427

429

ConocoPhillips’ argument that the Republic never offered to discuss reasonable
compensation in connection with the migration is also untrue. At first, we hoped that
the ConocoPhillips companies would join the migration. When they refused, we
tried in good faith to reach an amicable settlement, as we had done successfully
before with other companies. I was present in the settlement discussions with the
ConocoPhillips representatives. We were always open to paying reasonable
compensation, but ConocoPhillips from the beginning insisted on exorbitant sums
that made settlement impossible. 29

He also says:

Of all the companies involved in the associations, ConocoPhillips exhibited the least
interest in discussing migration. I had to call representatives many times to request
their participation and comments. However, to my recollection, ConocoPhillips is
the only company not to send a mark-up of the draft agreements for any of the three
projects involved in this case. By contrast, the other partners in the Hamaca and
Corocoro Projects (Chevron in the Hamaca Projects and Eni in the Corocoro Project)
participated constructively, providing mark-ups of the documents and negotiating the
terms and conditions of the migration. Both successfully completed the migration
and now participate as shareholders in new mixed companies for those projects under
the 2001 Organic Hydrocarbons Law. There was no migration of the Petrozuata
Project because a ConocoPhillips subsidiary was the only foreign party participating

in that project. In addition to ConocoPhillips’ former partners, Chevron and Eni, the
other companies successfully participating in the migration process for the
associations included Total, Statoil, BP and Sinopec.**°

387. In his supplemental testimony he does not address the negotiations and in particular Mr
Lyons’ testimony about ConocoPhillips’ response to the August 2006 migration proposals or
the positions ConocoPhillips took in January 2007 and in its letters of 12 April 2007, including
the question asked by ConocoPhillips in respect of the position of the Venezuelan Government

on book value.

388. Mr Lyons testifies that in March and April 2007, in further meetings, the ConocoPhillips

representatives

attempted to engage in good faith negotiations for fair compensation for the interests
in the three Projects that would be taken away. While the Venezuelan side always
acknowledged that the Petrozuata, Hamaca and Corocoro Projects (and the
underlying contracts) were fully legal and binding, they declined to offer anything
approaching fair value for the investment interests that Venezuela would be taking.
We made equally clear that ConocoPhillips would not relinquish its investments
without fair compensation.**

389. He gives the example of a meeting on 29 March 2007 in which Mr Del Pino was

accompanied by Vice-Minister Mommer.

At a meeting on March 29, 2007 ... Mr Del Pino, accompanied by Vice-Minister
Mommer, made verbal offers for the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects. In each case,
these offers included one amount (US$100 million for Petrozuata. US$370 million
for Hamaca) if ConocoPhillips accepted an unprotected minority interest in the new
empresas mixtas (40 percent for Petrozuata; 22.85 percent for Hamaca); or in the
alternative, a higher amount (US$1.1 billion for Petrozuata, US$1.2 billion for
Hamaca); if ConocoPhillips entirely relinquished its interests in the Projects. The
offers also sought a full waiver from ConocoPhillips of its right to bring claims for
adequate compensation. Venezuela made no offer at all with respect to the Corocoro
Project.

We told Mr Del Pino and Vice-Minister Mommer that these offers were far below
the fair market value of our interests in the Projects. Vice-Minister Mommer
responded that compensation would not be based on fair market value.

390.

In three letters (one for each Project) to Minister Ramirez , Vice-Minister Mommer
and Dr. Del Pino dated April 12, 2007, ConocoPhillips restated the fundamental
differences between the parties in the negotiations for compensation. We noted that
any valuation based upon book value would neither adequately compensate
ConocoPhillips for ... Venezuela’s unilateral changes in commercial terms (royalty
and taxes) over the past several years, nor for the additional changes resulting from
the Nationalization Decree. Moreover certain critical provisions were missing from
the proposed migration contracts, including, among others, adequate minority
governance rights and the right to recourse to international arbitration. 32

In their Memorial the Claimants state that the 29 March verbal offer represented no more

than 5 % of the real value of their investments and, therefore was totally inadequate. ***

391.

Following that and other meetings ConocoPhillips wrote on 12 April 2007 to the

Minister, Vice-Minister and PdVSA Official in respect of each project (see supra J 371). The

letters said that at the meeting of 29 March 2007:

432,

ConocoPhillips received two verbal compensation proposals based upon book value
less depreciation for its interests in the Petrozuata Project. The first compensation
proposal, which contemplated ConocoPhillips holding a 40% interest in the
Petrozuata Project post nationalization, was in the amount of U.S.$100,000,000. The
second compensation proposal in the amount of U.S.$1,100,000,000 contemplated a
complete exit of ConocoPhillips from the Petrozuata Project. We were informed
during this meeting that the Bolivarian Government of Venezuela would not
compensate ConocoPhillips for the fair market value of its interests in the Petrozuata
Project. Please confirm that our understanding of the Bolivarian Government of
Venezuela’s compensation proposals as stated above is accurate and complete and
further that the Bolivarian Government of Venezuela is willing to consider
alternative compensation proposals as discussed in the March 31, 2007 meeting. As
noted by Mr Mulva on March 31, 2007, any valuation based upon book value does
not adequately compensate ConocoPhillips for the Bolivarian Government of
Venezuela’s unilateral changes in commercial terms (royalty and taxes) over the past
several years nor for the additional changes resulting from the Nationalization
Decree.

In addition to prompt, adequate and effective compensation for the unreduced fair
market value of all losses, damages and other diminutions in value suffered by
ConocoPhilips, in order to agree to participate in the migration of the Petrozuata

Project ConocoPhillips will require that it be afforded adequate governance rights for
a minority interest owner and the right to resolve disputes by international arbitration
in a neutral forum, among other customary terms and conditions for these types of
transactions.“

Neither the Venezuelan Government nor PdVSA replied to these letters.

392. Dr Mommer in cross-examination twice testified, in response to Mr Lyons’ testimony,
that he did not think he had said to the ConocoPhillps representatives that compensation would

not be based on fair market value.***

393. Against that general denial, made only at the hearings and not in the two rounds of
written testimony, the Tribunal notes the contrary written testimony of Mr Lyons who was not
cross-examined on this point. The Tribunal considers most significant in this respect the written
account which the three letters give of the meetings of 29 and 31 January 2007, with their
precise questions about the basis for valuation. The letters make it clear that ConocoPhillips
rejects a valuation based on book value. That would not adequately compensate it. The
Tribunal recalls that the Venezuelan authorities, which had received the trigger letters just 12
days earlier in which ConocoPhillips reserved all its legal rights under the Investment Law and
the BIT, made no reply to those letters, they did not challenge the account the letters gave of the
course of the meetings, and, in particular, they did not reject the position attributed to them that
any compensation would not be based on fair market value. The Tribunal does of course
recognise, in terms of the ruling made earlier in this decision that the royalty and tax changes
are not in its view in breach of the BIT. But that was not known to the Parties at that stage of

their negotiations.

394. Considering the situation after 12 April 2007, the date of those three letters, the Tribunal,
on the basis of the evidence before it, concludes that Venezuela at that time was not negotiating
in good faith by reference to the standard of “market value” set out in the BIT. It had not
responded in any meaningful way to the points made about those negotiations, in particular in

those letters. Two further important features of the negotiations support that conclusion. The

a Supra fn. 397.
8s See Tr. Day 7:1858, Tr. Day 7:1861-62.

126

first is that Venezuela had not yet made a proposal for compensation in respect of the Corocoro
Project. The second is that there is no evidence at all that the compensation formulas played

any part in the negotiations between the Parties.

395. The Tribunal now turns to the evidence concerning the negotiations from April 2007
before and after the taking of the assets. As already noted, Dr Mommer makes specific
reference to the two ConocoPhillips proposals for compensation. The following paragraphs
follow his general assessment of the course of the negotiations quoted earlier ({{J 385 and 386

supra):

ConocoPhillips at first sought as compensation an asset exchange pursuant to which
(a) the ConocoPhillips subsidiaries would relinquish all of their interests in
Petrozuata , Hamaca and Corocoro Projects and (b) ConocoPhillips would receive
the interests of PdVSA subsidiaries in a refinery in Lake Charles, Louisiana and a
joint venture with ConocoPhillips at the Merey Sweeney refinery in Texas. At the
time, the entire appraised value of the interests to be transferred to ConocoPhillips
under this proposal was approximately US$8.2 billion. This proposal was made in a
June 15, 2007 draft Memorandum of Understanding which is attached hereto as
Appendix 4.

Just two months later, by letter dated August 17, 2007 (a copy of which is attached
hereto as Appendix 5), ConocoPhillips made a new proposal. While the assets to be
exchanged remained the same, this proposal included a cash payment of
US$1.5 billion from ConocoPhillips to the Republic in recognition that the value of
the refinery interests to be transferred by the PdVSA subsidiaries far exceeded the
value of the ConocoPhillips subsidiaries’ interests in Venezuela. The value of this
proposal was approximately US$6.7 billion. Even though that amount is far below
US$30billion that the ConocoPhillips entities are seeking in this Arbitration, it was
nonetheless completely unrealistic because it gave no consideration to the
compensation formulas that had been negotiated and agreed at the outset of the
Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects and did not even reflect the true value of the
interests at issue without considering those formulas.**°

396. Except for the final sentence, these paragraphs do no more than purport to summarise the
substance of the two proposals which appear as Appendices to Dr Mommer’s testimony. He
was not cross-examined on them. It will be observed that his comment in the final sentence is

not presented as an account of a reason given by the Venezuelan authorities in June and August

436

Supra fn. 399 at {[ 21-22.

127

2007 to ConocoPhillips for rejecting the proposals. That comment was not the subject of cross-

examination.

397. ConocoPhillips in its covering note to the first proposal said that it was making it without
prejudice to its existing legal rights in continuance of its good faith efforts to reach an amicable
solution with Venezuela. It reserved the right to change the terms of the proposal and its rights
under, inter alia, the BIT and the Investment Law. The covering letter to the second proposal
“appreciates the verbal compensation offer made to Roy Lyons on Monday August 13, 2007”;
that offer does not appear anywhere else in the evidence. After consideration, the letter

continues, ConocoPhillips submitted the counterproposal attached and concluded:

We trust you will understand that the terms of this proposal reflect significant
movement from ConocoPhillips’ previous position and are made in a good faith
effort to resolve our differences and reach agreement amicably and without the
necessity of third party dispute resolution.

398. Mr Lyons in his evidence says only this about that final period, stopping short of the

period after 26 June 2007 when the taking occurred:

Negotiations continued throughout May and June 2007, but without producing an
agreement. At a meeting that I attended on June 11, 2007, we again reiterated that
the compensation being offered was a fraction of the true value of our investment
interests, which we could not accept. Mr Del Pino made clear, however, that the
nationalization process was nonnegotiable and would move forward on the
government’s terms, with or without ConocoPhillips.

Our last meeting before the final deadline established in the Nationalization Decree
took place on June 20, 2007. At that meeting, Vice Minister Mommer informed us
that no new offer of compensation would be forthcoming prior to the June 26, 2007
deadline. He added that after that date, ConocoPhillips would no longer own any
interest in the three Projects. Consistent with his statement, on June 26, 2007,
Venezuela took our three investments in their entirety, without providing any
compensation at all.4°7

399. The only other evidence before the Tribunal about the later phase of the negotiations
appears in reports of public statements made by the ConocoPhillips CEO on 12 February 2008

quoted earlier (supra 374) and the Venezuelan Minister of Hydrocarbons on 8 and 14 February

“7 Supra fn. 422 at {J 18-19

2008. In the first, the Minister said that they were in a negotiating process with ConocoPhillips

in spite of having entered into the process of arbitration; currently teams for both countries are

8

establishing the terms to approach a friendly agreement in this dispute.** In the second

statement, a detailed account given in an address to the National Assembly, the Minister said

this:

There are two remaining arbitrations pending, two U.S. multinational corporations.
Conoco-Phillips has filed an arbitration against the Republic but unlike Exxonmobil,
it has requested and has maintained communications to an extent that makes it
possible to reach an amicable solution to our dispute. We are working on that, and,
as the Global CEO of Conoco-Phillips expressed in past statements, we are on our
way to reaching an agreement.

[...]

 

And we, the Republic, as the United Nations declarations state [the Minister had
earlier quoted from General Assembly resolution 1803 (XVII) of 1962], and in the
spirit of our legislation, have not refused to indemnify the companies that withdraw
from the country, but, of course, we should indemnify the book value of those assets,
values that can be fully examined, values that are auditable, values that are
transparent, so that there is no possibility whatsoever of a settlement between the
parties beyond what is justified.

This is an action of nationalization, a sovereign act of the Venezuelan State.
Accordingly, we are working with Conoco to resolve our controversy in these
matters, and are closing the gap between our numbers.**”

400. The Tribunal does not have before it any evidence at all of the proposals made by
Venezuela in this final period. It observes that whatever confidentiality agreement there was
has not prevented the submission to it by the Respondent of the ConocoPhillips proposals of
June and August 2007. There is no evidence that Venezuela moved from its insistence on book
value, a standard confirmed by its Minister’s statement in early 2008 at a point when the
arbitration had begun. Nor is there any evidence that in this period, the Venezuelan
representatives brought the compensation formulas in the Petrozuata and Hamaca Association

Agreements into the negotiations. Finally, at this stage too there was no proposal for

compensation in respect of ConocoPhillips’ assets in the Corocoro Project as Dr Mommer
appeared to confirm in cross-examination; he was not re-examined on the course of the

negotiations. *”°

401. The Tribunal accordingly concludes that the Respondent breached its obligation to
negotiate in good faith for compensation for its taking of the ConocoPhillips assets in the three
projects on the basis of market value as required by Article 6(c) of the BIT, and that the date of

the valuation is the date of the Award.

402. The Tribunal emphasises that it does not at this stage make a finding in respect of the
relevance, if any, of the compensation formulas included in the Petrozuata and Hamaca
Association Agreements to the determination of the quantum of compensation payable in this
case. What it does find in respect of those formulas is that they were not, on the evidence
before it, brought into the negotiations about compensation, in particular by the Venezuelan

authorities.

Vill. COSTS

403. The costs are reserved for consideration at the conclusion of a later phase of this

arbitration proceeding and there shall accordingly be no order as to costs at this time.
