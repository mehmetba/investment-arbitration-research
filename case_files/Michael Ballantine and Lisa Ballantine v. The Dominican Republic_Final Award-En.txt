“Contracting Parties”).

On September 11, 2014, the Claimants submitted, on their own behalf and on behalf of their
Enterprises, their Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim (the “Notice of Arbitration”),

During the Hearing, information emerged regarding the funding of the Claimants’ legal costs by
a third party.° The Tribunal then heard the Parties’ submissions on the relevance and consequences
arising from the fact that the Claimants’ claims were being funded by a third party. After reflecting
on the Parties’ positions, the Tribunal ordered the Claimants to disclose only to the Tribunal and

the PCA the agreement that the Claimants had concluded with the third-party funder.

After reviewing the agreement, and at the Respondent’s request, the Tribunal ordered the
Claimants to disclose to the Respondent the identity of the third-party funder, and the date of the
agreement, to discard any conflicts of interest. On October 2, 2018, the Tribunal issued
Procedural Order No. 16 to address the issue of the third-party funder. Among other things, the
Tribunal informed the Parties that, to the best of its knowledge, the third-party’s involvement in

the arbitration did not raise conflicts of interest for any of the Tribunal’s members.

At the end of the Hearing, the Tribunal asked the Parties several questions, which were replied
orally by the Parties’ counsel. Additionally, the Tribunal made the Parties aware that the

submission of post-hearing briefs would not be expected.

Il. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
A INTRODUCTION

55. In 2000, Michael Ballantine, Lisa Ballantine and their children travelled to the Dominican
Republic to work as Christian missionaries and to undertake humanitarian work, including the
distribution of water filters through a non-profit entity created by Lisa Ballantine.’ While they
returned to Chicago in 2001, they continued their work in the Dominican Republic, “visiting the

country each year to further support the communities they had begun to serve” §

56. In the early 2000s, the Claimants noticed that in the mountains around Jarabacoa there was no
successful luxury real estate development with shared infrastructure and amenities, even though

they considered it an ideal place for such a project.’

57. Thus, the Claimants began purchasing mountain property in the area of Palo Blanco in Jarabacoa.
The Claimants distinguish two phases in the development of Jamaca de Dios,'” phase 1 — which
focused on the lower portion of the property and was commenced in 2005!! — (“Phase 1”), and
phase 2 — which was intended to expand the project towards the upper part of the mountain and

was commenced in 2009 (“Phase 2”).'7

58. In 2003, the Claimants bought their first tract, 218,552 square meters, from Francisco Sanchis.
Between 2004 and 2008, they bought additional land rights, primarily from the family of Carlos
Manuel Duran. By 2009, all of the land in Phase 1 of Jamaca de Dios was titled to the Claimants’
name, as well as, 140,835 square meters of Phase 2. By September 2010, the Claimants owned
194,500 of the 283,000 square meters of Phase 2.'? On January 7, 2011, 45,036.40 square meters

were purchased from Ramon Amable Rodriguez.'* On January 14, 2011, 9,905.78 square meters

were acquired from Maria Consuelo Rodriguez.'* On February 9, 2011, 15,130 square meters
were bought from Miguel Serrata Rodriguez.'° Lastly, on March 29, 2011, 18,582.99 square
meters were purchased from Ana Lidia Rodriguez Serrata.'? Until the initial denial of their

expansion request in 2011 they continued to acquire lands for Phase 2.'*
The Claimants hold that it was their plan to create a community

where private individuals could purchase land and build luxury mountain homes, and where
domestic and international tourists could stay in a boutique spa hotel high on the mountain,
while enjoying recreational and other activities, such as hiking trails, organic gardens, parks
and common areas. The Ballantines intended that homeowners and local citizens could also
enjoy first-class dining with striking views of the valley."

Jamaca de Dios was intended to have at least two development phases. In Phase 1, the lower
portion of the property would be developed to create the infrastructure necessary to develop the
entire mountain and more than 90 individual parcels would be sold to private buyers to build

>> 20

luxury homes and a restaurant, which would be “a focal point of the complex” :

In Phase 2, the Project would be expanded by extending the road further up the mountain and by
subdividing the upper portion of the property.”! The Claimants also planned for the construction
of a luxury hotel and spa with a second restaurant, mountain-lodge style apartments, and a larger

apartment complex closer to the base of the property.”

By the summer of 2009, after Phase 1 was approved and more than 90 individual luxury parcels

were subdivided, the Claimants owned “more than 162,000 square meters of titled property

further up the mountain” and were in the process of acquiring an additional 220,000 square meters

for further development.”*

The Baiguate National Park was created by Presidential Decree No. 571-09, published on August
7, 2009 (the “National Park Decree”), to protect the Salto Baiguate or Baiguate waterfall, the

endangered walnut trees and the forests along the river (the “National Park”). By the time the

National Park Decree was published, less than half of the land associated with Phase 2 had been

purchased by the Claimants.”

The enactment of the National Park Decree was the culmination of a nation-wide environmental
protection initiative which began in October 2004.*° From August 2008 to August 2009,
Prof. Eleuterio Martinez led a team of government officials, scientists and cartographers in
identifying new areas for environmental protection, by relying on existing information and
comparing it with information obtained from field visits, to see whether the area should be
recommended for protection to a high-level advisory panel. The National Park Decree established

32 new protected areas, including the National Park.”°

The Respondent explains that the area where the National Park is located was important for two
reasons. First, because it has a sensitive and highly-fragile flora and fauna biodiversity. Second,
“for the preservation of ecosystemic services, especially in relation to the production and
protection of water in order to avoid potential landslides, given the intense annual dry and rainy
seasons”?’ Additionally, the Baiguate waterfall was also protected for being a bathing site and
holding special rituals, known to the native Taino culture. For the same reasons, the river source
and tributaries were included within the National Park’s boundaries. According to Prof. Martinez,
protecting the river source and tributaries would not only protect the Baiguate waterfall but also
the biodiversity in the neighboring Mogote mountain system.”* During that time, the team did not

consider who owned the land or what they intended to do with it.”

In addition, the Respondent does not agree with the distinction proposed by the Claimants, since
the Phase 1/Phase 2 dichotomy both confounds and oversimplifies the issues at stake.” According
to the Respondent, the Phase 1/Phase 2 contrast is sometimes used by the Claimants to make a
geographic distinction, while at other times it is used to make a temporal one.*! Thus, the

Respondent rejects the Claimants’ proposed nomenclature, and instead identifies five projects

(each, a “Project”), distinguishable according to where the Projects are located and at what time

they were pursued.*?

67. According to the Respondent, Project 1 was supposedly a reforestation project, for which
permission was sought on December 28, 2004, to build an access road.* Project 2 was the
construction of the restaurant Aroma de la Montajfia, a housing development on the lower portion
of Jamaca de Dios.™ Project 3 included plans to extend Project 1’s road, expand Jamaca de Dios
further up the mountain, sell at least 70 additional lots for luxury private homes, and the
construction of a boutique hotel. However, when the Claimants sought permission from the
Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (the “MMA”) for the project, it was described
as the construction of 10 cabins and 19 villas.*° This is the project that the Claimants twice sought
reconsideration for, and, as a result, they received three denials.** In the last of these denials, the
MMA finally referred to the existence of the Baiguate National Park.*” Project 4 is the mountain
lodge that the Claimants sought to build above the restaurant Aroma de la Montafia.** Lastly,

Project 5 refers to an apartment complex for which the Claimants never sought permission.”

B. SEEKING APPROVAL FROM THE MINISTRY OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL
RESOURCES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF PHASE 1

68. The Claimants sought to acquire the approval from the MMA for the Project. However, before
that, in October 2004, the Claimants signed an agreement with PROCARYN, a German non-
profit, to plant 50,000 trees across the property to stabilize the environment and create a “more
enticing setting for the home sites they intended to create”. In this sense, the Claimants sought
permission from the MMA’s Forestry Department to build a road to facilitate the reforestation
plan. It was the Claimants’ opinion that the road was critical for the Project, and they attempted

to build one never before done by a private enterprise in the Dominican Republic.*!

69. On December 28, 2004, the Claimants wrote to the MMA seeking permission to build an access

road for the reforestation plan.”

70. On January 18, 2005, the MMA granted permission to cut a road and plant the trees.** The MMA.
added that it had no objection as long as no trees were cut, removed and/or transplanted, nor any
sand or gravel was extracted or transported.* The road was completely built within the Claimants’
development to be a service entrance for Jamaca de Dios. The Claimants allowed the landowners
to the west of Jamaca de Dios to use this road until 2011, as it was much safer and more convenient

than the historic pathway, which did not allow the passage of vehicles.**

71. During the road construction, the Claimants spent significant sums of money on heavy equipment,
fuel and earth moving, which involved finding “/arge deposits of rock and road grade material
in varying place[s] throughout the mountain” and then using “[t]his material [...] for backfill,
engineered support structures, road base, and drainage channels”.*° According to the

Respondent, these kind of actions were in violation of the conditions set out in the permit.‘”

72. The Claimants sough the permit from the MMA in accordance with the procedure established in
the Ley General sobre Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (Ley No. 64-00)
(the “Environmental Law”). To this effect, the Claimants hired Antilia Environmental

Consultants, a Dominican environmental company, to assist them with the permit request.**

73. In short, the procedure to request an environmental permits is divided into six steps. First, the
applicant must obtain a “no objection” letter from the municipal government where the proposed
project is to be located. Second, this letter must be provided to the MMA, and the MMA would
provide “terms of reference” for the submission of a Declaracién de Impacto Ambiental (the
“Envir 1 Impact ”). The Envi 1 Law does not contain a
comprehensive list of all the factors that must be taken into account for the Environmental Impact
Statement.” Third, to provide the terms of reference, the MMA must conduct a technical visit to

the site of the proposed project. Fourth, the applicant must draft and submit the Environmental

Impact Statement. Fifth, the MMA reviews the Environmental Impact Statement and prepares a
technical report on the proposed project through its Comité Técnico de Evaluacién (the
“Technical Evaluation Committee”). Lastly, based on the technical report, the Environmental
Impact Statement, and any stakeholder or public comments, the MMA issues a decision granting

or denying the permit for the proposed project.*”

74. Thus, the Claimants requested a “no objection” letter from the City Council of the Municipality
of Jarabacoa. On February 7, 2005, the “no objection” letter was later provided to the MMA, and
the Claimants requested the terms of reference for the Environmental Impact Statement.*! The
MMA conducted a technical visit to Jamaca de Dios and some MMA technicians observed, inter
alia, the irregular topography of the land, with steep slopes increasing land erosion, and the fact

that a road was under construction. The last issue was investigated and flagged for further review.

 

The ici ded that the Envir | Impact should focus on the

topographic survey of the access road.*?

75. On August 18, 2006, the MMA issued the terms of reference for the Claimants and invited them
to submit the Environmental Impact Statement within a year.*? The Claimants submitted the
Environmental Impact Statement with the MMA in mid-February, 2007, for 82 home sites and a
restaurant.™ After being reviewed by the MMA, it was considered to be deficient, missing many
important details. In June 2007, the MMA asked the Claimants to redo it, and for which Antilia

Environmental Consultants committed to develop a more thorough study.

76. In August 2007, the Claimants submitted a revised study. The Technical Evaluation Committee
completed its technical report of the proposed Project. On December 7, 2007, the MMA issued
the permit No. 0649-07 for the development of the lower portion of the Project. The permit
included an obligation to submit an environmental compliance report every six months (each,
an“EC Report”) and the assumption of liability for any penalties due to causing any

environmental harm. The permit also stated that a new Environmental Impact Statement would

be required for any substantial modification or addition, or for any construction site.*° At the time,

the Claimants were living in the United States and managing the process from there.*”

During this process, the Claimants allege that the MMA did not indicate that the slope in the
mountain of the Ballantine’s property was an issue of concern, “or that any portion of the land in
Phase 1 could not be developed because it exceeded the slope limitations set forth”** in the
Environmental Law. The Claimants and the MMA had a “constructive relationship” during the

establishment and initial development of Jamaca de Dios.*?

After the approval of Phase 1, the MMA conducted annual inspections on Jamaca de Dios to
ensure environmental compliance, reviewed the semi-annual reports submitted by Jamaca de Dios

in with Domini law, and

ions on several topics.”

THE CLAIMANTS’ ALLEGED COMMERCIAL SUCCESS OF PHASE 1 OF THE PROJECT

The Claimants developed the infrastructure necessary to support Phase | and the future Phase 2:
networks to supply electricity, high-speed Internet, and potable water throughout the property;
they hired 24-hour security and maintenance; created recreational and other common areas.°! The
Claimants invested in designing and building a “high-quality, environmentally sound road

>> 62

throughout the complex”:

The Claimants explain that mountain roads are difficult to build and maintain. Since the Claimants
understood the importance of a quality road for Jamaca de Dios, they invested time and money to
create “the finest private mountain road in the Dominican Republic”.© They cleared and fully
surveyed the mountain, analyzing potential routes with physical and computer modelling. Their
claimed intention was to build a road that would avoid significant steepness, while still gaining
altitude and allowing “exploitation of the flattest areas of the mountain for the development of

premier home sites”.°* The Claimants argue that they were “well-situated to make a simple

extension of the road into Phase 2”.®° They contend that much of the machinery necessary to build
the road had been purchased and they also had in the mountain the raw material necessary for the

road bed.

According to the Claimants, despite the MMA’s refusal to allow the expansion based on the
slopes, the slopes in Phase 2 are more gradual than in Phase 1, thus, “the engineering necessary

to duplicate the quality of the Phase 1 road would be less intensive” ®’

After having established the necessary infrastructure during Phase 1, the Claimants subdivided
the property into individual lots and began selling them to private purchasers through a standard
sales contract. The landowners had the right to construct their own homes, subject to certain
limitations imposed by Jamaca de Dios. The private purchasers were required to start constructing

within two years of purchase and to finish in the following two years.

The Claimants also developed their restaurant, Aroma de la Montaiia. Since its establishment in
May 2007, the Claimants state that Aroma de la Montajia has increased in popularity as a dining

destination for the residents of Jarabacoa and visitors from elsewhere.”

According to the Claimants, in less than five years, Jamaca de Dios became “the most popular
and prosperous mountain tourism and residential project in the Dominican Republic”, selling 75
lots between 2007 and 2011. By the time of the Statement of Claim, all of the lots had been sold
and “the small remaining inventory consists of reacquisitions by Jamaca’.”° The Claimants hold
that more than 300 people were directly or indirectly employed in Jamaca de Dios, making it the

largest development company in Jarabacoa.”!

THE CLAIMANTS’ PLANS FOR PHASE 2 OF THE PROJECT

In 2009, the Claimants commenced Phase 2 of their investment. Their intention was to sell at least
70 lots on the upper portion of Jamaca de Dios, which would have been more valuable that the

properties in Phase | because of, inter alia, the views, the temperature, the enhanced privacy.

Phase 2 would be accessed through an extension of the road that ended at the top of Phase 1. The

Claimants also intended to build luxury homes in Phase 2.”

86. At the beginning of 2011, the Claimants conducted an expansion of Aroma de la Montaiia,
from 90 to 225 available seats. They also installed a rotating floor in the main dining room,
something unique in the Caribbean. The Claimants allege that the expansion was undertaken
solely because they anticipated an increasing number of owners and visitors which Phase 2 would
attract.’> The Respondent argues the expansion was in 2012 and that it was unauthorized, violating

the terms of the Project 2 permit. The only license the Claimants had received for Aroma de la

Montajia was a restaurant operating license, granted in May 2014 by the Ministry of Tourism.

This license still obliged the Claimants to seek the other permits, licenses and authorizations.”

87. The Claimants claim that they also intended to construct a boutique hotel in Phase 2. They
engaged an architect to design it and a Taino Indian expert to ensure the cultural appropriateness
of the hotel design and decoration.” Additionally, they also planned to construct a mountain lodge
at the top of Phase 1. ProHotel, one of the Claimants’ consultants, undertook an analysis of the
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the project. Among the threats, they identified
the disruption of the flora and fauna and to the environment. ProHotel recommended to first obtain
financing and the permits for the mountain lodge. Only then would a marketing and sales plan be
developed, a construction company be hired, and advertising be conducted.” Instead — the
Respondent points out — the Claimants hired a Dominican architect to design the lodge, began a

marketing campaign, and even took client deposits for units at the mountain lodge.”

88. The Claimants explain that they also planned to build an apartment building to host larger
families, near the base of the complex. As a result, they had established a management company

to oversee rental programs for these apartments.”*

ISSUES WITH THE ROAD

By 2011, at the end of the road the Claimants added gates for their property. Immediately after
the gates’ construction, the Claimants offered the Rodriguez family, the ones using the road built
in 2005, to instead drive through the main Jamaca road.” According to the Claimants, the
Rodriguez family was not happy with being unable to keep using the road that the Claimants built
in 2005. Thus, the Rodriguez requested the District Attorney to have the gates opened.*’ However,
the Respondent asserts that the Claimants built the gates at the end of a historic, public, unpaved
road that had been used by the Palo Blanco townspeople for more than 80 years. In August 2011,
the Palo Blanco townspeople requested the local District Attorney to have the gates to the

historical road opened.*!

In September 2011, the District Attorney rejected the request to demolish the gates.*? The
Respondent alleges that the District Attorney decided in favor of the Claimants because they
offered the townspeople to use their road to access their land.** Despite this ruling, the Claimants
continued allowing residents to use the main Jamaca road but requiring them to register the first
time they entered the development. The Claimants state that night-time traffic was dissuaded for

security reasons, but with advanced permission evening access was allowed.**

On April 17, 2013, the to ple raised a laint at a Municipality of Jarat town hall

 

meeting, which was also attended by Jamaca de Dios’ representatives. At the end of the meeting,
another meeting was proposed for the next day to be held at the site of the gates before the

historical road. However, Jamaca de Dios’ representatives were not present.*>

On April 22, 2013, the Municipality of Jarabacoa decided to ask the Claimants to open the gates
and have the Commission of Public Works and the Prosecutor’s Office work with Jamaca de Dios’
representatives, and the area’s dwellers and landowners.*° On the same day, the Municipality of

Jarabacoa passed a resolution granting public access to a private road to Jamaca de Dios and

authorizing to tear down the Jamaca de Dios’ gates.*” The Claimant’s contend that the resolution
was passed only for Jamaca de Dios, and that they were not informed of it.** The Municipality
had been previously informed that passing the resolution would be unlawful because it is the

federal Lands Tribunal which has authority over real property disputes.*°

93. On June 17, 2013, a group of local people, led by the former Director of Maintenance in
Jarabacoa, stormed into Jamaca de Dios and tried to forcibly tear down the three gates.
According to the Claimants, a city truck was used to transport the local people and the police only

dispersed the crowd after the Claimants’ lawyer arrived at La Vega.°!

94. On the same day, according to the Respondent, the Claimants sought the immediate closure of the
historical road before Jarabacoa’s Lands Tribunal. The townspeople contested the petition, yet the

historical road was closed pending the petition’s resolution.”

95. On July 31, 2013, the Claimants managed to obtain a preliminary injunction from the Lands
Tribunal, prohibiting the Municipality of Jarabacoa from entering the Claimants’ property and
ordering to rebuild the gates.°* When the Claimants began the judicial process, the Claimants state
that the crowd returned, tore down the provisional gates and made death threats against Mr.
Ballantine. Although the police was called, it allegedly refused to come without authorization
from the City of Jarabacoa.” Despite the injunction, Dominican court officials have declared the

Claimants’ road to be public.*

96. On October 1, 2013, the Claimants requested from the Municipality of Jarabacoa a “no objection”
letter for the mountain lodge in Phase 1. The Claimants state that that Municipality of Jarabacoa

has refused to act on this request.”°

97. On October 5, 2015, a new judge assigned to the case ruled against the Claimants, without holding
any hearings on the matter.”” As a result, public access has been granted to the Claimants’ private
Jamaca road.°* However, the Respondent states that the Dominican Government never declared

Project 1 road to be a public road.”

98. The Claimants also denounce the fact that the Jarabacoa City Council officials acted against them
because they expected local businesses to pay the taxes directly to the councilors. The Claimants
refused to do so, and instead paid their taxes to the Municipality of Jarabacoa.'” The Claimants
add that the City of Jarabacoa has refused to pay for the streetlights within Jamaca de Dios, even
though the federal Government reimburses the City of Jarabacoa for such costs, and it pays for
the streetlights in Dominican-owned projects. Likewise, since 2005, the City of Jarabacoa has

refused to provide any maintenance on the public road that leads to Jamaca de Dios.'!

F. THE CLAIMANTS’ REQUEST TO THE MINISTRY OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL
RESOURCES FOR A PERMIT FOR PHASE 2

1. The First Phase 2 Inspection by the MMA

99. On May 22, 2009, MMA officials conducted an environmental inspection at Jamaca de Dios,
including men carrying weapons. The Claimants state that they and their employees were treated
in a harassing and hostile manner.'? Mr. Ballantine was allegedly threatened with criminal action
for allegedly violating environmental laws. The MMA officials contended that by creating access
to Jamaca de Dios, flattening a small space on three lots and removing several small trees,

environmental regulations had been violated.'”* Mr. Ballantine recalls that Ms. Francis Santana,

the then-MMA local director, said that this type of unannounced, militaristic inspection was
unprecedented and unique. Also, Mr. Ballantine claims that Ms. Santana told him that she had no
knowledge of any complaint having been lodged against Jamaca de Dios. According to
Mr. Ballantine, Ms. Santana stated that the inspection had been ordered by the Minister of the
MMA, Mr. Jaime David Mirabal.!°*

100. While the Respondent confirms the inspection occurred, it explains that the visit was not
unannounced because the Project 2 license gave the MMA the right to sanction any violations
thereof. Thus, it contends that the MMA also had the power to monitor the license’s compliance.
Several weeks before the inspection, the Claimants were invited to the MMA’s office in Jarabacoa
to discuss unauthorized work conducted in connection with Project 2. During the meeting, the
Claimants stated that they intended to comply with the principles of environmental protection and
not to violate the Environmental Law.'°> The Respondent does not consider the visit to be
unprecedented because it characterizes the evidence as purely hearsay, denied by Ms. Santana
herself, and the Environmental Law obliges permit-holders to allow the monitoring by the
relevant authorities.'°° Nor does the Respondent consider the inspection to have been militaristic
because it is common for the National Service for Environmental Protection (“SENPA”) to
accompany MMA officials during their site visits. They wear distinctive green uniforms and carry
non-automatic weapons. Although the Respondent cannot confirm whether the SENPA officials

were present during the inspection, it does not consider it surprising if they were.!°”

101. In the inspections conducted on May 22, 2009, it was discovered that the Claimants (i) had failed
to submit the EC Reports, (ii) had cut certain tree species without authorization, (iii) had engaged
in unauthorized ground excavations which interfered with the waterways, and (iv) had divided

the lots in a manner different to the development plans the MMA had authorized.

2. Imposition of the Fine and Meetings between the Parties

On November 19, 2009, on the basis of this inspection, the MMA imposed a fine of almost one
million Dominican Pesos on Jamaca de Dios.'® According to the Claimants, this has been the
largest fine the MMA has ever imposed in the region to a property owner, and local MMA officials
allegedly confessed to them that they considered it “excessive and arbitrary”.''° The Respondent
denies this. According to the Respondent, the fine was imposed within the scope of the MMA’s
authority since the Project 2 permit reserved the MMA the right to impose fines for breaches of
the permit.!!! The MMA also required that the Claimants comply with environmental regulations,
undo the environmental damage, suspend work on Project 2 until the fine had been paid, and

submit reports proving their compliance every six months.'!?

The Respondent explains that the quantity of a fine can be up to 3,000 times the minimum wage
applicable at the time of the violation.''? The Respondent notes that the fine, even before it was
reduced by 50%, was not the largest one imposed in the region. In 2013, Aloma Mountain, for

example, received a fine of 1.7 million Dominican Pesos.!"4

The fine also included an order to complete an EC Report twice every year, which the MMA
asserted to be required by law. The Claimants contend that they have submitted the EC Reports
for all 15 semi-annual periods but that no Dominican-owned project has been required to do so.!'°
The Claimants allege that the only EC Reports submitted to the Respondent — other than those
submitted by the Claimants — were three from Paso Alto between 2008 and 2009, and one from
Quintas del Bosque in 2014.''® The Respondent states that the obligation to submit EC Reports
can also be found in environmental permits granted to other entities, and that fines have been

imposed on other developments for not submitting the required EC Reports.!!7

105. The Claimants contend that they immediately requested a meeting with the MMA Minister Jaime
David Mirabal to discuss the fine. However, the MMA did not respond to the meeting request and
refused to discuss or reconsider the fine.''* The Claimants refused to pay it and kept requesting a

meeting.'!

106. In August 2010, before seeking permission, the Claimants applied for tax-free status for Phase |
and 2, in accordance with CONFOTUR Law No. 158-01, which intends to promote tourism in
the Dominican Republic. On N ber 10, 2010, the R dent approved the provisional tax-

 

exemption request.'”° The Claimants point out that this approval was signed by the Dominican
Ministries of Tourism, Culture, and Tax, and the MMA, the latter without mentioning the slope
restrictions or the establishment of the National Park.'?! The Respondent explains that this process
has nothing to do with the environmental permit process and CONFOTUR informed so to the

Claimants in the approval.'?

107. On September 22, 2010, the environmental consultant working with the Claimants on the planned
expansion told them that some of their land was within the National Park, a category II protected
area.'?5 Mr. Ballantine asked what that would mean for their expansion plans. The consultant
confirmed that Dominican law allowed projects of low-impact tourism, such as nature tourism or
ecotourism, within the protected areas, and specifically referred to the Claimants’ project as one
of those allowed. While the consultant recognized that the issue of the roads and the management
of sewage and waste would have to be discussed, she recommended the Claimants request the
terms of reference for their expansion and allow the MMA to visit the development to provide an
opinion on technical and legal matters and on the projects’ viability. Although — in the opinion of
the consultant — the project was considered a permitted activity within a category II protected

area, the consultant clarified that MMA would still decide which project would or would not be

been recognized as ecotourism by the MMA."
On October 7, 2010, Minister Mirabal allowed for the fine to be reduced by a 50%.'7°
On November 30, 2010, the Claimants request permission for the so-called Project 3.!?7

On December 13, 2010, the Claimants received a “no objection” letter from the City Council of
Jarabacoa, regarding the expansion plans for the hotel and the subdivision of lots. There was no
mention of the slope restrictions or the National Park.'?* At the same time, the Claimants requested

the MMA to provide the “terms of reference” for the expansion.'”

On December 21, 2010, the Claimants received approval from CONFOTUR for their request for
certain tax benefits for Jamaca de Dios. The approval included a signature and seal from the
MMA, which made no reference to any slopes in Phase 2.'*° The Respondent points out that
CONFOTUR’s granting of the tax benefit is unrelated to the Claimants’ compliance with
environmental regulation.'*! The resolution granting the tax benefits states that it “does not

On January 26, 2011, the Claimants’ request for an environmental permit was lodged at the

On February 1, 2011, the Claimants decided to pay the fine, since the MMA previously stated that

it would not provide the requested terms of reference until the fine was paid.'**

3. First Reconsideration by the MMA at the Claimants’ Request

On February 14, 2011, the Claimants were granted a meeting with the MMA Minister, Mr. Jaime
David Mirabal, the Vice Minister of Protected Areas, Mr. Bernabé Majfion, and the Management
Director of Protected Areas, Mr. Ekers Raposa.'** In the meeting, Mr. Ballantine expressed his
opinion that the fine was unjustified but he still was looking forward to working with the MMA
regarding Phase 2.'*’ According to the Claimants, Minister Mirabal promised to send another
inspection team to Jamaca de Dios to investigate the issue and provide a response on the requested
expansion. However, there was no mention of the planned expansion being within the boundaries

of the National Park.'** Mr. Omar Rodriguez was also present at the meeting.'”

According to the Claimants, on mid-February, 2011, an inspection team from the MMA visited
Jamaca de Dios. The team was welcomed by Mr. Ballantine and Mr. Eric Kay, the expert who
helped design and construct the road of Phase | and the development of Phase 2. The Claimants
contend that the team was “overwhelmingly positive about the prospects of expansion, never
mentioning any issue about slopes or the fact that Phase 2 purportedly” was inside the National
Park.'° The lead inspector of the MMA team, Mr. César Sena, allegedly recommended seeking

permission to expand the road into Phase 2.'*!

According to the Respondent, during the February, 2011, site visit the MMA officials took
contemporaneous notes that the land was over 40% steep, that the earth movements that would
be carried out were major, and that the area provided for the disposal of removed materials was
“Ti]nadequate/harmful to the environment”. The MMA officials further noted there were risks that
(i) the project would significantly contaminate the soil and subsoil, (ii) during the construction

phase the primary or secondary forest would be cleared, (iii) the project would have “a very strong

adverse visual impact on the landscape”, and (iv) a slope greater than 60% had been observed.'*
The Respondent relies on Mr. Zacarias Navarro to explain that the construction of the road was
dangerous and complicated, as it was planned to be done at an area located between 900 to 1200
meters above sea level, in the northern face of the Cordillera Central mountain range, where the
precipitation levels exceed 1,600 millimeters per year. Also, there would have been a significant
“risk of periodic and irrecoverable environmental harm”.'* The MMA, its inspectors, and the
Claimants agreed that because the Claimants’ intention was to develop towards the top of the
mountain and “it is virtually impossible to make the subdivision map without first cutting the

road’, the Claimants should first request permission for the construction of the road."

117. On February 24, 2011, the Claimants wrote a letter to the Vice Minister of the MMA, Ernesto

Reyna, seeking permission to begin the expansion of the road immediately.'*°

118. On March 18, 2011, there was an inspection on Jamaca de Dios, conducted by an MMA official,
Mr. Socrates Nivar, who purportedly drafted a report dated March 21, 2011.!4° The MMA officials
recommended declaring the project “not viable” because of the “environmental fragility of the
area and natural risk, the land topography and slope, which is over 60% in much of the area,
...natural run-offs, the characteristics of the buildings being built in the Project area, and a
possible violation of Art. 122, Law 64-00”.'*" According to the Claimants, a copy of the report

was never provided to them until the Respondent’s Response to the Notice of Arbitration.'“*

119. On April 21, 2011, the Claimants wrote to the MMA regarding the terms of reference. According

to the Claimants, they did not receive an answer.'””

12 Notes from February 17, 2011 Site Visit, Exhibit R-108. The Respondent explains that slope incline, referred
in Article 122 of the Environmental Law, is a technical term that refers to the distance between two points at
different height but along the same horizontal plane. It can be expressed in degree or percentage. The percentage
corresponds to the vertical distance over the span of 100 horizontal units, while the degree is calculated by applying
an inverse tangent trigonometric function.

On May 18, 2011, the recommendation by the MMA official in the March 21, 2011, report was
accepted by the MMA’s Technical Evaluation Committee.'*° According to the Claimants, local
MMA Director Mr. Graviel Pefia was not invited to the committee meeting, contravening MMA

policy standards.'*!

On May 27, 2011, Mr. Pefia wrote to his regional supervisor reporting on non-authorized
development in Aloma Mountain. The Claimants contend that his letter was ignored and that the

development in Aloma Mountain was not affected.'*?

On June 9 and 10, 2011, Mr. Kay reached conclusions similar to those reached by the MMA
official during his site visit to Jamaca de Dios on March 18, 2011. He was also concerned about
the “sof soil conditions” and the water running at the outside edge of the road, increasing water

saturation in the soil. He also recognized the existence of a problem with the steep slope areas.'**

On July 15, 2011, the Claimants wrote to the MMA again regarding the status of the report. Once
more, they received no response, even though the MMA was visited by Jamaca de Dios’ workers

and by the environmental company Empaca Redes.'*4
On August 22, 2011, Mr. Ernesto Reyna replaced Mr. Jaime David Mirabal as MMA Minister.

On September 1, 2011, the Claimants sent a letter to Minister Reyna, personally congratulating
him on his new position, inviting him to Jamaca de Dios, and seeking a response to the expansion

request.'°°

On September 12, 2011, the MMA rejected the expansion request on the grounds that the slopes
on the upper portion of the property exceeded the 60% permitted under Article 122 of the
Environmental Law and because it was considered an environmentally fragile area, creating a
natural risk. Yet, the MMA was willing to assess the viability of any other areas that the Claimants

would provide for Project 3.!°° The Respondent points out that the Claimants failed to propose an

the MMA, even though the land approved in Phase | had slopes in excess of 60%.'**

127. Nevertheless, after this rejection, the permit for Jarabacoa Mountain Garden and Mirador del Pino
were approved, even though both developments would have slopes in excess of 60%.'*? The
Claimants contend that in those two projects the MMA worked with the owners “to modify their
plans to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements”.'© The Respondent explains that the
Claimants oversimplify the issue when solely comparing the slopes of the properties. Other
factors must be taken into account such as concentration, altitude and environmental impact. The
other projects are located in lower altitudes, the access to exploitable land is much easier there

and the concentration is much lower than in Project 3.'°!

Permit Request

128. As a result of the first denial, the Claimants ceased purchasing land and negotiations on the

purchase of Paso Alto.

129. The Claimants state that they acquired the MMA’s own maps for Phase 2 in a public meeting held
in Jarabacoa in December 2014. The map would show that the proposed development area does
not have any slopes exceeding the 60% limit, revealing the denial’s lack of substantive scientific
support.'®> However, the Respondent denies this, as five different site visits were conducted for

the Project 3’s permit, and measuring tools were used to analyze the slopes.’ By applying these

factors, even Project 2 and 3 are different, albeit both have slopes exceeding 60%. The former is

at a lower altitude and thus, there is lower risk of massive landslides.'°*

On November 2, 2011, the Claimants requested the MMA to reconsider its decision, stating that
no slope in Phase 2 of any area designated for home construction would exceed the 60 degree
limit, and asking for another inspection team to visit the project. According to the Claimants,
MMA did not provide any reports, findings or technical data supporting its rejection and no further
inspection of the project was conducted.’ The Respondent points out that Mr. Ballantine’s letter
states that no slope would exceed 60 degrees, while acknowledging that the slope where the road

would be constructed would be equivalent to 34 degrees.'"

In contrast to the Claimants’ allegation that no further site visit was performed, the Respondent
contends that on January 23, 2012, the MMA’s officials conducted another site visit.'°° On
February 22, 2012, the MMA organized a Technical Evaluation Committee meeting to support
the rejection. Mr. Graviel Pefia attended the meeting and stated that no technical issues were not

discussed, instead only Zacarias Navarro’s opinion was requested.'°

On March 8, 2012, the Claimants’ request for reconsideration was rejected. '"? The MMA
explained that the project was located in lots with slopes between 20 and 37 degrees, which would
in turn mean slopes of 36% and 75%, respectively. The Environmental Law prescribes a
maximum slope of 60%, not 60 degrees.'”! Also, the MMA asserted that the project would modify
the area’s natural runoff and the local hydrological and the micro basin’s condition, affecting the
mountain’s ecosystem. Additionally, the type of soil found on the site could only be used for
certain purposes. The MMA had considered the Claimants’ initial proposal improper, however it
became concerned after finding out that their plan was even more ambitious and large than before.

Thus, the MMA informed the Claimants that their application file had been closed.'”

140. On July 4, 2013, Empaca Redes submitted to the MMA an extensive engineering and geological
report, showing that the slopes in Phase 2 complied with all applicable slope restrictions and other
environmental requirements.'** As alleged by the Claimants, the MMA ignored the report and has

not answered to the factual contentions included in it.

He explained to the Claimants that even setting aside the slope and earth movement issues, the

area for Phase 2 was within the National Park limits, and so the Project could not move forward.'*?

146. On October 1, 2013, Mr. Ballantine sought redress from President Danilo’s office. His requests
for assistance were rejected.'*° The Claimants note that an appeal made by Jarabacoa Mountain
Garden to the President’s office was treated differently: the Presidency directly intervened in the
permitting process and the approval was granted for the entire process. '°' However, the
Respondent explains that the Presidency reviewed and forwarded the letter to the MMA on

by the Claimants through Empaca Redes.!*” The letter stated that the Claimants could not develop
Phase 2 because it was located within the National Park, which had been designated as a protected
area. The Claimants point out that the designation took place in August 2009 by the National Park
Decree, '** yet the letter of January 2014 was the first one relying upon the existence of the
National Park to deny Phase 2. Between 2009 and 2014, the Claimants and the MMA exchanged
many written and oral communications, in which the National Park was never mentioned. In fact,
the Claimants point out that the MMA extended the duration of the permit in Phase 1, despite the
fact that a significant portion of it was inside the National Park.'*? The Respondent explains that
the final rejection was not based on the creation of the National Park, but rather that the National
Park was an additional reason. The application had already been formally rejected on September
12, 2011 and the file was formally closed on March 8, 2012, when the Claimants opted to contest
the decision rather than to choose an alternative location.*” The letter also reminded the
Claimants that pursuant to Article 40 of the Environmental Law and to the environmental
authorization regulations, any construction, extension, and/or renovation activities of a project

cannot be performed if the corresponding environmental authorization has not been granted.?"!

The Claimants responded to the MMA’s letter, dated January 15, 2014, asking the MMA the
reasoning behind the National Park’s boundaries, as there did not seem to be “any coherent
environmental, geological, geographic, or altitude-related reason for it to have located the park
lines through the middle of their development”.*®? They also asked the MMA to explain the
reasons why the National Park Decree was now being applied to reject the Claimants’ expansion

permit, after being in force for more than four years.”

In November 2014, the Claimants met with Ms. Katrina Naut, Foreign Trade Director, and Ms.
Patricia Abreu, Vice Minister for International Cooperation, to discuss the possibility of

suspending the current proceeding.”

153. On December 11, 2014, a meeting was held with the City of Jarabacoa. The City Council officials
explained that they knew that the MMA was concerned about Jamaca de Dios’ expansion and
thus, they had asked the MMA for further information. The moment they received it, they would
contact the Claimants to inform them of the City Council’s position.” During the meeting, the
Respondent asserts that Ms. Leslie Gil Peja, a representative of the Claimants, verbally withdrew
their request for a “no objection” letter, stating that it was unsuitable.” The Claimants deny this,
relying on the minutes of the meeting. According to the Claimants, Ms. Gil Pefia explained that
they were seeking first a conditional “no objection” letter, in order to continue pursuing the rest
of the necessary permissions for the Mountain Lodge, and later they would request the definitive

“no objection” letter.

154. On December 19, 2014, the MMA’s Coordinator for Public Areas, Mr. Pedro Arias,

160. In its Statement of Defense and its Rejoinder, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal grants

the following relief:

a. That the Tribunal dismiss all of the Ballantines’ claims, on the basis of lack of jurisdiction,
inadmissibility, and/or lack of merit;

V. THE PARTIES’ ARGUME!

 

IN JURISDICTION
A. THE RESPONDENT’S ARGUMENTS
1. The Dominican Republic’s Consent

161. The Respondent argues that the Claimants bear the burden of establishing the jurisdictional
ground for their claims, including the Dominican Republic’s consent.”” Its scope is defined in
Article 10.17 of DR-CAFTA, which states that each Contracting Party “consents to the submission
of a claim to arbitration under this Section [B] in accordance with this Agreement”.

162. Article 10.16 explains which types of claims can be submitted to arbitration, by whom, and how.
It provides that

(a) the claimant, on its own behalf, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim
(i) that the respondent has breached
(A) an obligation under Section A,
(B) an investment authorization, or
(C) an investment agreement; and

(ii) that the claimant has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that
breach; and

(b) the claimant, on behalf of an enterprise of the respondent that is a juridical person that the
claimant owns or controls directly or indirectly, may submit to arbitration under this Section
aclaim

(i) that the respondent has breached
(A) an obligation under Section A,
(B) an investment authorization, or
(C) an investment agreement; and

(ii) that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that
breach.”!
163. The Respondent focuses on two aspects. First, that only a claimant, as defined by DR-CAFTA
Article 10.28 has the right to submit a claim to arbitration under Chapter 10, Section B. Second,

that the only type of claim that can be submitted by a claimant is one according to which a

respondent has breached an obligation under Articles 10.1 to 10.14. Accordingly, there is no
consent if either the party submitting a claim to arbitration is not a “claimant” as defined by DR-
CAFTA, or the claims asserted are not connected to the obligations set out in Articles 10.1 to
10.14. The Respondent argues that in this case neither the Ballantines are “claimants” under the
purposes of the DR-CAFTA, nor do their claims involve any obligations under Articles 10.1 to
10.14, due to the fact that neither at the time they submitted their Notice of Arbitration, nor at the

time of the alleged violations, their dominant and effective nationality was that of the U.S.?

2. The Ballantines Do Not Qualify as “Claimants” Under DR-CAFTA

The Respondent contends that the Claimants must demonstrate that at the time of the submission
of their Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, on September 11, 2004, they qualified as
“claimants” under the DR-CAFTA.*3

Under Chapter 10 of the DR-CAFTA, “claimant” is understood as “an investor of a Party that is
a party to an investment dispute with another Party”.*4 Therefore, in this case, the claimant must

be an investor of a Contracting Party other than the Dominican Republic. An “investor of a Party”:

means a Party or state enterprise thereof, or a national or an enterprise of a Party, that attempts
to make, is making, or has made an investment in the territory of another Party; provided,
however, that a natural person who is a dual national shall be deemed to be exclusively a
national of the State of his or her dominant and effective nationality.”?>

The Respondent points out that the Claimants acknowledge that they have to comply with the
definition of “claimant” under the DR-CAFTA, that the issue of whether they are “claimants” is
connected to the question of their dominant and effective nationality, and they did not contest that
September 11, 2014 was the day on which their claims were submitted to arbitration.”° However,

the Claimants do question whether the date of submission is relevant in the first place.??”

The Respondent emphasizes the importance of the date of submission.” First, it argues that

should DR-CAFTA be silent on the relevant timing for the question of nationality, the Tribunal

would be required to decide the issue on the basis of international law, in accordance with Article
10.22. Under international law, one of the relevant dates for purposes of jurisdiction is the date
on which “the moving party avails itself of a remedy”. Accordingly, jurisdiction must exist at
the time the claim was filed, and at the time of the alleged treaty breach, and a State cannot be
subject to claims raised by its own dominant and effective nationals before an international

forum.?*°

Second, it contends that in fact DR-CAFTA is not silent on this issue, but rather that it is connected
to the issue of consent. The question is whether the Claimants were allowed to submit their claim
at the time they did so. Thus, one would examine the state of affairs on the date of submission.?*!

232

Third, the Respondent rejects the Claimants’ assertion*** that the issue of dominant and effective
nationality only becomes relevant if the investor holds dual nationality at the time of making the
investment in the host State. The definition of “claimant” in Article 10.28 would support the
position that the relevant time period cannot be earlier than the time when the investment dispute

arose.”

Fourth, the Respondent alleges that even if the Tribunal were to focus on DR-CAFTA’s definition
of “investor of a Party”, it would not find any support for the Claimants’ claim that the question
on the nationality refers to the date the investment was made. Article 10.28’s definition of
“investor of a Party” has two cumulative requirements: (i) there must be a “national of a Party”;
and, (ii) the national must attempt to make, is making or has made an investment in the territory
of another Party. The notion of dominant and effective nationality is only related to the first
requirement. The Respondent does not contest that the second requirement is disjunctive, since it
allows for three different options to define someone as an investor.’** However, if one would
follow the Claimants’ arguments not all the options would be relevant. Therefore, the Claimants’

assertion must be rejected.?*>

Fifth, the Respondent considers the Claimants’ assertion that the “7ribunal should not merely take

a snapshot in time and, at any specific date, attempt to weigh [as of that date] the Ballantines’

connections to the US against their connections to the DR”, (Emphasis added by the
Respondent) is misguided. Further, it points out that the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal’s Malek

decision the Claimants are relying on does not support such a contention.?*”

172. The Respondent contends that because the Claimants held dual nationality at the time of the
submission of their claims to arbitration, on September 11, 2014, the question is which nationality
was the dominant and effective one at that time.?** The effective nationality refers to whether
there is a genuine connection between the person and the State.” The Respondent does not
dispute the genuine connection between the Claimants and the United States, nor between them

and the Dominican Republic. The dominant nationality refers to which nationality is stronger.”

173. Since the DR-CAFTA does not include any standard for determining it, the Respondent proposes
to approach the question applying international law. The Respondent relies on case law from the
International Court of Justice (the “ICJ”), the Italian-United States Conciliation Commission and
the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal to argue that the adjudicator must take into account several factors,
such as the State of habitual residence, the circumstances in which the second nationality was
acquired, the subject’s personal attachment for the country, and the center of a person’s economic,
social and family life.*! The Respondent notes that in Procedural Order No. 2 the Tribunal

recognized these factors.”

174. The Claimants argue that other factors should also be included, inter alia, the country of residence

of their immediate family, where the Claimants went to college, where their children were born,

243

the primary language spoken at home or, their religious faith and practice.*** The Respondent

states that no jurisprudential, doctrinal or logical support has been offered for the consideration

of these factors.*4*

When it comes to their immediate family, the Claimants point out that their children went for
college to the United States.*** However, the Respondent argues that the fact that the Claimants
chose to stay in the Dominican Republic shows a greater commitment and allegiance to the
Dominican Republic.” The Respondent considers it irrelevant that the Claimants went to college
in the United States before they visited the Dominican Republic for the first time. However, the
fact that Ms. Lisa Ballantine went back to Northern Illinois University after she had visited
Jarabacoa is relevant, mainly for the studies she decided to undertake.’ Ms. Lisa Ballantine
decided to study ceramic filter manufacturing and the Dominican Republic’s history to “create a
social entrepreneurial startup that would focus on clear water” in Jarabacoa.** Instead of

indicating a connection with the United States, this fact points to the Dominican Republic.”

The Respondent considers it entirely irrelevant where the children were born, because the
youngest one was born six years before they visited the Dominican Republic for the first time.
Regarding the language being spoken at home, the Respondent considers it irrelevant that it was
English, because the Claimants do not provide any authority to support their conclusion. In fact,

the same can be said of their religious faith and practice.”

The Claimants also raise two additional factors, the laws regarding dual nationality in the United
States and the Dominican Republic, and how both States viewed the Claimants.?*! Yet, the
Respondent argues that these factors do not support their position.” Regarding their first factor,
the Claimants supposedly argued that the Dominicans laws do not matter because Dominican
authorities do not respect Dominican citizens and in any case, their Dominican naturalization only
represented a “‘enuous” connection since their citizenship could be taken away. ** The
Respondent rejects these arguments stating that the laws apply irrespective of the private citizens’
perceptions of them and their connection was anything but tenuous, thus the circumstances under
which naturalization can be taken away are irrelevant here.*“ Regarding the second factor, the

Respondent argues that each State’s opinion on which nationality was considered dominant is

irrelevant, since neither of the two States had any knowledge that the Claimants had dual

nationality.?>>

Accordingly, and considering the factors mentioned by the Claimants, the Respondent concludes
that the Claimants’ dominant and effective nationality was Dominican at the relevant times.”*°
The Claimants held their habitual residence in the Dominican Republic, they voluntarily applied
for the Dominican citizenship, they had a deep personal attachment with the country and it was

the center of their economic, social and family lives.?°”

As mentioned above, Mr. Michael Ballantine and Ms. Lisa Ballantine were born in the United
States and lived there until 2000, when they moved to the Dominican Republic for a year to work
as missionaries.” In 2001, they returned to Chicago but they continued to visit the Dominican
Republic every year.” In 2005, Mr. Ballantine announced to Ms. Ballantine his intention to sell
his business in the U.S. and to invest all of their life savings to develop a tropical mountain in the
Dominican Republic. The following year, they sold their home and many of their possessions and
they moved to the Dominican Republic.*° On the same year, the Claimants acquired the

“permanent resident” status, which was renewed in June 2008.6!

To be perceived as Dominicans by the Dominican government and their clients, the Claimants
voluntarily decided to live in Jamaca de Dios and to become Dominican citizens.” While the
Claimants downplay this fact to a simple pledge to uphold the Dominican laws and constitution,”
the Respondent emphasizes their obligation to be faithful to the Dominican Republic. The
Respondent argues that when a person voluntarily decides to acquire a second nationality, it is in
itself an indication that the voluntarily acquired nationality has become the dominant one.” As

[nJaturalization is not a matter to be taken lightly. To seek and to obtain it is not something
that happens frequently in the life of a human being. It involves his breaking a bond of
allegiance and his establishment of a new bond of allegiance.

181. The Claimants applied for Dominican citizenship in September 2009.*°° They had to submit
several documents, such as a sworn statement that their domicile was in the city of Jarabacoa and
a declaration from their attorney stating that the Claimants “identify closely with Dominican
sentiment and customs given their long standing respect for, and period living in, our country, for
which reason they would be happy to confirm, legally, their Dominican sentiment”.?"" They also
had to pass an assessment on their written and oral proficiency in Spanish, on their knowledge of

Dominican history and culture, and a standard naturalization interview.”°*

182. On December 30, 2009, their applications were approved and thus, the Claimants became
naturalized Dominican citizens in 2010. Thereupon, the Claimants exercised their newly acquired
nationality in various ways, such as: for travelling, for exercising their right to vote,?” for filing
claims in Dominican courts, or for legal documents, such as contracts or powers of attorney.7”!
They also attended church in the Dominican Republic and sent their children to school there.”
They even used their Dominican nationality in 2010 to request the Dominican nationality for their
youngest children.” Although their children moved back to the United States for college, the

Respondent relies on Ms. Tobi Ballantine’s social media postings to show that she had a stronger

Respondent rejects the Claimants’ contention that they never acted, felt or were ever perceived as
Dominicans or that they were never politically, culturally or socially connected to the Dominican

Republic.?”

183. The Claimants argue that their U.S. bank accounts kept more funds than their Dominican ones.
Yet, this reflects activity in the Dominican Republic and the United States. Moreover, they had a
separate U.S. bank account for Jamaca de Dios.””° The Respondent points out that the Claimants
assert that they had invested all of their money in the Dominican Republic.””” Although the
Claimants had opened a U.S. retirement and college savings accounts, the accounts were barely
used.”’* Furthermore, other sources confirmed that from 2006 onward, their assets were primarily
located in the Dominican Republic.?” Their non-profit organizations, “Jesus for All Nations” and
“Filter Pure”, mainly operated in the Dominican Republic.’ Their U.S. tax returns stated the
Claimants did not have a salary or earn wages during the relevant time period. If they earned
income at that time, 70% came from their activity in the Dominican Republic, like interest
payments from Jamaca de Dios.”*! Thus, the Respondent states that the center of their economic

life was the Dominican Republic.

184. At the time of September 11, 2014, the Claimants had lived for eight years in the Dominican
Republic, their permanent residence in law and spirit. They had their own community there, which
they designed to promote their vision of social life.’ At some point, they came to consider

themselves as Dominican.”**

In fact, when the Claimants moved back to the United States in the
summer of 2015, they stated that they “have been gone for so long that I feel out of touch with
american [sic] society. The culture is so different than when I left 10 years ago. I feel such a
culture shock coming back” .*** Indeed, the Claimants ended up claiming moral damages to the
Dominican Republic in this arbitration for allegedly forcing them to sell their home and leave

their friends and colleagues.”

185. According to the Respondent, U.S. law, case law and doctrine support a similar conclusion: that
the Claimants’ dominant and effective nationality at paramount times was the Dominican. In the
Sadat v. Mertes case, the court held that the plaintiffs voluntary naturalization indicated that his
dominant nationality was the one he acquired. Additionally, the fact that the plaintiff did not take
all reasonable steps to avoid or quit his status as a U.S. national, was sufficient evidence of his
continued, voluntary association with the U.S. and his intention to remain there.”*° The U.S. State

Department embraced the Sadat decision in the U.S. Digest on International Law (1991-1999).?87

186. The state of habitual residence is considered one of the most important factors in the analysis.”**

According to the Respondent, although the Claimants were born and lived most of their lives in
the United States, their connection to the United States did not remain unbroken for the entirety

of the Claimants’ lives.” As Ms. Lisa Ballantine confessed in June 2015, she had spent almost

187. Although the Claimants argue in their Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim that the
United States was the State of their dominant and effective nationality,” the Respondent alleges
that the evidence provided does not match with the latter statement.””* The Claimants state that
they have always maintained one or two residences in the United States and they provide a list of
five different addresses.” They even contend that their contact details are the following “Michael
and Lisa Ballantine[,] 951 Grissom Trail[,] Elk Grove Village, [Illinois, USA] 60007”.*%°
Nevertheless, the Respondent states that there was no evidence that the Claimants lived on any of

those five locations, since they acquired their Dominican nationality and until they submitted their
claims to arbitration.”° Since 2006, their permanent residence was in the Dominican Republic.”
Furthermore, the house at 951 Grissom Trail, belongs to Mr. Michael Ballantine’s mother and her

husband.?°*

188. Accordingly, the Respondent considers it irrelevant whether the Claimants were born in the
United States and kept their U.S. nationality when they decided to acquire the Dominican

nationality.°? The relevant question is which nationality has been indicated for their residence

3. The Ballantines’ Claims Do Not Involve Obligations Under Articles 10.1 to 10.14 of
DR-CAFTA

The Respondent contends that the second takeaway from Article 10.16 of the DR-CAFTA is that
an arbitration is only permissible under the DR-CAFTA if the claim refers to obligations breached
under Articles 10.1 to 10.14. The Claimants contend that the Respondent has breached its
obligations under Articles 10.3 (National Treatment); 10.4 (Most-Favored-Nation Treatment);
10.5 (Minimum Standard of Treatment); 10.7 (Expropriation and Compensation); and 10.18

(Transparency).*”?

As a threshold matter, the Respondent points out that Article 10.18 is titled “Conditions and
Limitations on Consent of Each Party” — not “Transparency”. The Respondent presumes that the
Claimants refer to Article 18 but in that case, the claim exceeds the scope of the Respondent’s
consent to arbitration.* The Claimants have amended their claims and state that it actually refers
to a violation of Article 10.5 with Chapter 18 as a guide.*”’ The Respondent argues that the
contents of Chapter 18 cannot be imported to Chapter 10 if the Contracting Parties did not provide
for it. To do so would be going against the interpretative principle expressio unius est exclusio

alterius °°

According to the Respondent, almost all of the claims are based on alleged State actions that
supposedly took place between November 30, 2010 — when the Claimants requested permission
from the MMA to expand Jamaca de Dios —, and March 11, 2014 — six months after the events
giving rise to the claim occurred.*” These claims exceed the scope of the Dominican Republic’s
consent because (i) its consent only applies to claims that hold that the Respondent breached an
obligation under Articles 10.1 to 10.14; (ii) a State action can only be deemed to have breached
an international obligation if the State is bound by it at the time the breach occurred; and (iii) at
the time of the acts alleged by the Claimants, the Dominican Republic was not bound by the

obligations invoked by the Claimants.*”

192. All the DR-CAFTA provisions invoked by the Claimants apply only to “covered investments”
and “investors of another Party”. The term “covered investment” is defined in Article 2.1 as an
investment in the territory of one of the Contracting Party owned by an investor of another
Contracting Party.*"” In the present case, “the investor of another Party” is a person attempting to
make, making or who has made an investment in the Dominican Republic and whose dominant
and effective nationality is the U.S. nationality. Therefore, the Claimants have to demonstrate that
their U.S. nationality was their dominant and effective nationality at the time the alleged illegal

State conduct took place, in order to establish the Dominican Republic’s consent to arbitration.*!!

193. The Respondent contends that the Claimants’ dominant and effective nationality through the
relevant time period was Dominican. As a result, they cannot be considered U.S. investors; their
investment does not comply with the definition of “covered investments”; the obligations invoked

by the Claimants do not apply; and, therefore the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction.*'*

194. Again, the Claimants argue that the Tribunal must look at the nationality the Claimants held at

313

the time they made their investment in the Dominican Republic.*!’ The Respondent rejects this

allegation on the basis of the same arguments raised in the previous section. *!4 Previous
investment arbitration tribunals have concluded that the date of an alleged treaty violation is a
fundamental jurisdictional requirement.*"* In Pac Rim, the tribunal held that under DR-CAFTA
the nationality requirements must be fulfilled at the time of the alleged breach.*!° Furthermore,
Article 44 of the Articles on State Responsibility states that “[t]he responsibility of a State may

not be invoked if: (a) the claim is not brought in accordance with any applicable rule relating to

the nationality of claims” 3\"

B. THE CLAIMANTS’ ARGUMENTS
1. The Claims Were Submitted in Accordance With DR-CAFTA

195. The Claimants do not debate the Respondents’ arguments on the DR-CAFTA framework and “its
foundation upon consent of the parties”*'* They acknowledge that they have to comply with the

DR-CAFTA definition of “claimant” in order to pursue relief for their claims.*"”

196. Their claims were submitted (i) on their behalf under DR-CAFTA Article10.16(1)(a); and (ii) on
behalf of their enterprises incorporated in the Dominican Republic, directly or indirectly owned
or controlled by the Claimants under DR-CAFTA Article 10.16(1)(b). The Claimants own or
control several Dominican enterprises such as Jamaca de Dios SRL, Aroma de la Montana,
E.LR.L., Pino Cipres Investments SRL, Pina Aroma Investments SRL, and Upper Dreams
Investments SRL but they also have other ownerships and concessions.*”” These investments

qualify as such under Article 10.28.*7!

2. The Ballantines Qualify as “Claimants” Under the DR-CAFTA

197. The Claimants argue that they have always been dominantly and effectively U.S. citizens.** As
mentioned above,*”’ they acknowledge that they have to comply with the DR-CAFTA definition
of “claimant”. As a result, they have to be investors of a Contracting Party, other than the
Dominican Republic, attempting to make, making or who have made an investment in the
Dominican Republic. The Claimants consider this a disjunctive definition and so, any of the three

tenses can be used to determine who can be defined as a claimant.**

198. Accordingly, the Claimants argue that the Tribunal should only look at the nationality of the

9 325

Claimants “as of the time that they made their investment in the Dominican Republic’
(Emphasis omitted) According to the Claimants, the reference to “dominant and effective
nationality” only becomes relevant if the investor has dual nationality at the time the investment

was made. Since a great part of the land at issue in this arbitration was acquired by the Claimants

well before they became Dominican citizens, they conclude that they have the explicit right under

the DR-CAFTA to make their claims. Thus, these jurisdictional objections should fail.*°

Even if they have to establish that they were dominantly U.S. citizens at the time of submission
of their Notice of Arbitration, the Claimants argue that they still would not be required to
demonstrate that they were dominantly U.S. citizens during the time their claims arose. This
would not be specifically required by DR-CAFTA and the provisions on dual nationality would
be silent on the time frame of the evaluation. In any case, the Claimants consider it unnecessary
to decide on the appropriate time frame for the evaluation of the dominant nationality, since the

Claimants at all times have been dominantly and effectively U.S. citizens.*””

The Claimants agree with the Respondent that for the purposes of Article 10.28 there is no test to
decide which of the two nationalities should be considered dominant. DR-CAFTA Article 10.28
simply sets out a non-exhaustive list of qualified investments. The Claimants claim that their
investments are listed in Article 10.28.5?8 By contrast, to determine which of the two nationalities

should be considered dominant the Tribunal should resort to international law.*”?

The Claimants hold that the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal’s decisions the Respondent relies upon
relate to entirely different circumstances and arise under an entirely different treaty. Thus,
although they can provide guidance on the factors that should be considered in order to decide on
the dominant nationality, they should not serve as precedents.**° The Claimants contend that the
Respondent’s interpretation of the factors is incomplete and too narrow in their timespan. In
Malek v. Islamic Republic of Iran, the tribunal interpreted the A//8 decision as requiring it to look
at “the entire life of the [c]laimant, from birth, and all the factors which, during this span of time,
evidence the reality and sincerity of the choice of national allegiance.”**' (emphasis added by the
Claimants) Accordingly, the Claimants argue that the tribunal “need not merely take a snapshot
in time and, at any specific date, attempt to weigh the Ballantines’ connections to the US against
their connections to the DR” ** The Tribunal should not only look at the time period between

2010 and 2014 —i.e. after the Claimants acquired the Dominican citizenship —, but their entire life

to determine whether they are more closely aligned with the United States or the Dominican

Republic.*%

The Claimants recognize™ that the Tribunal held in Procedural Order No. 2 the relevance of
certain factors such as, “the State of habitual residence, the circumstances in which the second
nationality was acquired, the individual’s personal attachment for a particular country, and the
center of the person’s economic, social and family life.”**> Additionally, the Tribunal should
consider other factors, inter alia: (i) the country of residence of the Claimants’ entire family; (ii)
where the Claimants went to college; (iii) where their children were born; (iv) the primary
language spoken at home; (v) their religious faith and practice.** In their Reply Memorial, the
Claimants state additional factors: (i) the Claimants’ motivation to become dual nationals, (ii)
their entire life; which includes but is not limited to the facts at the relevant times; (iii) how they
viewed themselves; (iv) how the United States and the Dominican Republic and their nationals

viewed the Claimants; and (v) the laws regarding nationality in the two states.**7

The Claimants argue that this is not a treaty-shopping situation. The Claimants have always been
USS citizens, yet they acquired Dominican citizenship six years after they made their investment
because they realized how Dominican officials treated foreigners. They maintained a residence in
the Dominican Republic to supervise and develop their investment. However, they moved back
permanently to the United States when they suffered the treaty violations by the Respondent.**
Since the Tribunal acknowledged, “that the same facts would necessarily have a bearing or would
be relevant for both the procedural and the sub ive determination” (emphasis added by the
Claimants) the Claimants contend that the differential treatment received by the Claimants,
compared to the treatment received by other Dominican investors, should be relied on when

deciding whether they are dominantly U.S. or Dominican citizens.”

The Claimants reject the Respondent’s approach to determine which nationality is the dominant
and effective one. According to them, the Respondent’s approach is legally and factually

unsubstantiated. The Nottebohm opinion concerned the issue of diplomatic protection and

whether one could rely upon a nationality which had been granted “in exceptional circumstances
of speed and accommodation” and without a substantial bond, or the nationality with which it had
a long-standing and close connection. The Respondent’s reliance“! on the U.S. State Department
report would also be incorrect because the case cited by the report supports the Claimants’
position.*” The applicant in that case was found to be a U.S. national — despite residing in Egypt
— because of his continued, voluntary association with the United States and his wish to remain a

US. citizen.“ Yet, in this case the Claimants argue that there is no doubt about the Claimants

genuine and lifetime U.S. citizenship.**

According to the Claimants, the Sadat v. Mertes case was relied on by the Respondent to contend
that the Claimants’ voluntary naturalization in the Dominican Republic is proof of the dominant
nationality by itself.**° However, the Sadat case is inapplicable because in that case the subject
renounced any allegiance to foreign states when acquiring U.S. citizenship. In the Claimants’
case, there was no such requirement to become Dominican citizens. Even if they did swear faith

to the Dominican Republic, they did not renounce their U.S. citizenship.*"°

The Claimants obtained Dominican citizenship six years after making their initial land purchase
in Jarabacoa in July 2004. Although at the beginning they intended to manage their investment
from Chicago, later it became apparent that they needed to be present and they started to reside
in the Dominican Republic from August 2006 onwards.™” For the Claimants, their choice to apply
for the Dominican nationality was a business decision made as a result of the discriminatory
treatment given by Dominican officials to foreigners, because of Jamaca de Dios’ market

conditions and to demonstrate their commitment to their investment.*“*

The Claimants state that the Respondent attempts to equate residency with dominant nationality.
However, the Claimants contend that this is not the test. While the Claimants lived in the
Dominican Republic, they always maintained at least one residence, or even two, in the United

States:

208. The Claimants disagree with the Respondent’s use of the word “permanent” to describe the
Claimants’ move to the Dominican Republic.* The jurisdictional attestation in the Notice of
Intent plainly stated that the Claimants maintained their permanent residence in Chicago.**! The
mail-forwarding facility was established to ensure the arrival of important mail to a single
location.** Also, the Claimants informed Mr. Ballantine’s parents’ address for the purposes of
this arbitration because they were unsure where to live and they wanted to ensure they would be

notified of any procedural events in these arbitration proceedings.***

209. The personal attachment of an individual for a particular country is one of the factors to be

considered by the Tribunal. The Claimants emphasize their deep connection to U.S. culture and

society, ** while they were only connected with the Dominican Republic for commercial

reasons.**

account since 2009, U.S. health insurance cover since 2010 and separate credit cards issued in
1992 for Mr. Michael Ballantine and in 2012 for Ms. Lisa Ballantine.*** Additionally, they
established college savings accounts for their children’s college education.*” Regarding their
U.S. non-profit organizations, the Claimants explain that “Filter Pure” was created in February
2008 and was directed by Ms. Lisa Ballantine until 2015.* In contrast, the “Jesus for All
Nations” was managed by them while they were Dominican nationals and they raised money and

filed U.S. tax returns since at least 2010.7

While the Claimants recognize that they used the Dominican nationality as the Respondent states,
the Claimants conclude that they were still at all times dominantly U.S. citizens.* Between 2010
and 2014, the Claimants were in the United States 30 different times. Moreover, the Claimants
assert that they solely used their Dominican passports when entering the Dominican Republic but

they used their U.S. passports to enter elsewhere.***

The Claimants reject the Respondent’s count
of how much time the Claimants spent in the Dominican Republic and in the United States
between 2010 and 2014. The amount of days in the Dominican Republic does not compare to the

Claimants’ personal, cultural, familiar, and social attachment to the United States.**

The Claimants recognize that they built a house to promote their development and they lived there
while they were in the Dominican Republic. However, the Claimants decided to put their home
for sale in September 2012, to reduce the amount of time they were spending in the Dominican

Republic.*®°

The Claimants also resort to the educational paths taken by each of their four children to show
the dominant connection between the Claimants and the United States. All of the Claimants’
children attended college in the United States, even though at the time the Claimants were living

in the Dominican Republic. Furthermore, while their youngest children attended school in the

Dominican Republic, said school was supported by a U.S. non-profit institution. The students

were taught in English by U.S. citizens.*°

The Claimants argue that they also attended an American church in Jarabacoa, which was on the
campus of the Caribbean Mountain Academy, a Christian reform high school, attended
exclusively by U.S. students and where instruction was provided exclusively by U.S. teachers.

The church services were conducted in English.*”

The Claimants rely on the testimony of their American friends and colleagues in the Dominican
Republic, to confirm their strong and continuing connection to the American community in and
around Jarabacoa. In their testimonies, they confirm that the Claimants referred to Chicago as
their “home” and that they almost exclusively socialized with Americans. ** In their
communications with friends, the Claimants stated how they wanted to leave the Dominican

Republic or how they felt like outsiders there.*”

The Claimants admit that they voted on the 2012 Dominican election. However, they also voted
on the 2008 U.S. Presidential election and the 2014 midterm U.S. elections, while residing in the

Dominican Republic.”

The Claimants assert that despite Ms. Lisa Ballantine’s and Ms. Tobi Ballantine’s social media
postings quoted by the Respondent, they considered themselves U.S. citizens. The postings have
been taken out of context, especially Ms. Tobi Ballantine’s, which are casual, flippant or sarcastic.
In any case, the Claimants wonder how her youngest daughter social media postings are relevant
to determining their dominant and effective nationality.*”! Regarding Ms. Lisa Ballantine’s
Facebook postings, the Claimants complain that the Respondent only submitted the ones she
refers to the Dominican Republic, while ignoring the many others in which she talks about the
United States as her home or her connection to it. Although the Claimants do not consider these
social media postings relevant, they refer to several between 2010 and 2014 that show her

connection to the United States.*””

The Claimants consider themselves foreign investors in the Dominican Republic and dominantly
USS. citizens. And equally important, the Respondent also considered them to be foreign investors

and dominantly U.S. citizens.*”?

The Claimants explain that the dominant and effective nationality
rule contained in the DR-CAFTA is a codification of the existing rule of customary international
law on effective nationality for dual nationals in the context of diplomatic protection.*”* The test
of dominant and effective nationality was created to prevent “treaty shopping” and looking for
diplomatic protection from a stronger state, while there is no genuine link of nationality between

the individual and the state.*”°

The Claimants recall certain moments in which they were considered foreigners. In 2010, shortly

after becoming naturalized Dominican citizens, the Claimants commenced the proceedings to

 

have Jamaca de Dios regi: das a foreign i under the Dominican Foreign I

Law 16-95. Although they did not proceed with the application, the registration would have
allowed to submit the Jamaca de Dios’ profits to the United States.3° In May 2013, Mr.
Rodriguez, the Executive Director of the CEI-RD, considered the Claimants to be foreign
investors and attempted to intervene on their behalf before the MMA.*” In July 2013, Mr. Michael
Ballantine became an associate member of the American Chamber of Commerce in the
Dominican Republic.*” On the same month, the Claimants met with U.S. Embassy officials to
seek assistance in their appeal against the decision on the permit.*” The U.S. Embassy wrote to
the MMA on behalf of the Claimants, as they were allegedly considered predominantly U.S.
citizens. In May 2014, Mr. Rodriguez wrote to the American Chamber of Commerce, confirming

the Dominican government’s view that the Claimants were foreign investors.**°

The Claimants contend that if the U.S. officials had viewed the Claimants as dominantly and

effectively Dominicans, they would not have advocated for them. It would make no sense for U.S.

THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA’S NON-DISPUTING PARTY SUBMISSION

The United States cites DR-CAFTA Articles 10.16 and 10.28 to explain who is considered a
claimant and an investor and when a claim is deemed to be submitted to arbitration under the DR-
CAFTA. Accordingly, if the investor is a natural person and holds at the time of submitting the
claim as the dominant and effective nationality the one of the respondent State, then the investor
would not be considered at that time a party to the dispute. Thus, the investor must be from another
Contracting Party at the time of the alleged breach, in order for a breach under Chapter 10, Section

A to arise.**°

Relying on the doctrine of the continuous nationality, if the investor does not have a different
nationality than the host State’s at the relevant time, the respondent State will not be considered
to have consented to the submission of a claim to arbitration and the tribunal will lack jurisdiction

ab initio under Article 10.7.**”

THE OBJECTIONS TO ADMISSIBILITY

The Respondent objects to the admissibility of several claims because the documentation
produced as a result of Procedural Order No. 5 shows that the Claimants knew in September 2010
about the creation of the National Park and the restrictions it would impose on Jamaca de Dios.
Therefore, the Respondent considers the claims of violation of DR-CAFTA Articles 10.7, 10.5,
10.3 and 10.4 inadmissible, on the basis of the restrictions imposed by the National Park, since

they would fall outside the three-year limitation period established by Article 10.18.1.58

The Claimants argue that the Respondent is omitting key information of the e-mail exchange in
September 2010, specifically that ecotourism was allowed within the National Park. The
Claimants considered their project to be ecotourism and they were told that it was allowed within
the protected area of the National Park. Additionally, the Claimants argue that the creation of the
National Park was never mentioned in the denial of permits, until the fourth one on January 2014.

Thus, until January 2014 they never had knowledge of having suffered a loss.”

THE RESPONDENT’S ARGUMENTS

The Respondent argues that this is an admissibility claim because it affects the claim itself, instead
of the ability of the tribunal to hear the case.*” Since the objection is not one of jurisdiction, it is

not governed by Article 23(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules.*”!
As a result, the Respondent contends its objection is timely because

(i) it was raised as soon as practicable after the evidence and facts underlying the objection
came to light, and (ii) it is in any event an objection of admissibility rather than jurisdiction,
and therefore not subject to Article 23(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules.*””

However, if the Tribunal would consider it a jurisdictional objection, the Respondent argues that
it should still be admitted because it was submitted as soon as practicable, after the Respondent
became aware of the evidence and facts underlying the objection. The Respondent only acquired

the e-mail exchange on August 2, 2017, after it had submitted its Statement of Defense. Therefore,

the exception in Article 23(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules should apply. The Respondent relies on a
leading commentary of the UNCITRAL Rules and arbitral jurisprudence to explain that late pleas
due to the discovery of new evidence fall under the definition of “justifiably late pleas” under
UNCITRAL Rules Article 23(2).* Additionally, the Respondent argues that admission of the
objection would not cause any prejudice to the Claimants, as they would have ample opportunity

to respond.

229. Finally, the Respondent reminds the Tribunal that it has an ex officio obligation to ascertain that
the claims are admissible and within its jurisdiction. The Tribunal’s power under UNCITRAL
Rules Article 23(2) allows it to establish its own jurisdiction, deciding which issues can be
addressed before it and which cannot, while giving the Parties a fair and sufficient opportunity to

put forth their cases.**

230. In their witness statements, Mr. Michael Ballantine and Ms. Leslie Gil Pefia stated that he first
learned of the creation of the National Park on September 13, 2013, and about the restrictions
imposed on Project 3 lands on January 15, 2014.*°> However, two sets of produced documents

show that in fact both knew about the National Park much earlier.*°°

231. According to the Respondent, these documents show that the Claimants as of September 29, 2010,
at the latest, were aware of: (i) the creation of the Baiguate National Park; (ii) the fact that Project

3 was within the National Park; (iii) the restrictions imposed by the National Park on the lands

within it; and (iv) the effects of the latter on Project 3.”

232. On September 22, 2010, Ms. Arcia informed Mr. Ballantine by e-mail that lots 67 and 90 of
Jamaca de Dios were within the National Park, through the submission of a map.*”* The map also
shows that the area where the Claimants were hoping to develop Project 3 was within the National

Park’s boundaries. Ms. Arcia also explained that the use of lands was restricted to “scientific

areas.*”°

On the same day, Mr. Michael Ballantine acknowledged the existence of the Baiguate National
Park and asked whether this was pursuant to the Environmental Law. The next day, Ms. Arcia

replied that the boundaries had been created by the National Park Decree.*”°

On September 29, 2010, Mr. Mario Mendez confirmed that the land use was restricted. He stated
that low impact ecotourism projects such as the Claimants’, would be allowed, but the roads, and
management of sewage and other waste would have to be discussed.*?! Thus, Mr. Michael
Ballantine had been warned that it was uncertain whether the construction of roads and the waste
management facilities would be allowed within the National Park. Notwithstanding the previous
e-mail exchange, the Claimants proceeded with the construction of a high-impact luxury

complex.*”?

DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1 states that

[nJo claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section if more than three years have
elapsed from the date on which the claimant first acquired, or should have first acquired,
knowledge of the breach alleged under Article 10.16.1 and knowledge that the claimant (for
claims brought under Article 10.16.1(a)) or the enterprise (for claims brought under Article
10.16.1(b)) has incurred loss or damage. ‘°>

The Respondent holds that to decide whether the claims submitted to arbitration are within the
time limit, the Tribunal must determine (a) the date on which the Claimants first acquired actual
or constructive knowledge of the alleged breach; and, (b) the date on which the Claimants first
acquired actual or constructive knowledge of the damages caused by such breach. According to
the Respondent, if either one of the two dates is more than three years before the date on which

the claims were submitted to arbitration, they will be time-barred.“

The Claimants’ claims for expropriation, breach of fair and equitable treatment, breach of
obligation of national treatment and most-favored-nation treatment were all based on the creation

of the Baiguate National Park.“ Furthermore, they were all submitted on September 11, 2014,

pursuant to the Notice of Arbitration of the same date. Thus, since the e-mail exchange shows that
the Claimants already had knowledge on September 2010, the claims are time-barred and

dismissed.

DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1 envisages two types of knowledge of breach and loss or damage:
(a) actual knowledge, which would be what the Claimants did in fact know at a given time; and,
(b) constructive knowledge, which is what they should have known at a given time. The Claimants

have to acquire either one of the two.”

Two decision under the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) have addressed the
implications of the terms “knowledge of the breach”. For the UPS v. Canada tribunal, the relevant
question is “when [claimant] first had or should have had notice of the existence of conduct
alleged to breach NAFTA obligations and of the losses flowing from it.”*°’ (emphasis added by
the Respondent) The tribunal in Grand River held that its task was to decide if the record showed
that the claimant had knowledge “of the measures complained of as breaches of relevant Articles
of NAFTA.” (emphasis added by the Respondent) The Claimants conclude that the relevant
question is actually if and at what point the claimant became aware of the measure itself, instead

of, if and at what point it became aware that that the measure would constitute a treaty breach.“!°

In the present case, the e-mail exchange shows that as of September 29, 2010, the Claimants knew
of the creation of the Baiguate National Park, its restrictions and their effects on Project 3 lands.

Thus, they knew of the measure that allegedly breached the DR-CAFTA.

In the DR-CAFTA case Spence v. Costa Rica, the tribunal held that the constructive knowledge
test is an objective standard.*!! Previous tribunals have confirmed that constructive knowledge

“entails notice that is imputed to a person, either from knowing something that ought to have put

242. Accordingly, since the creation of the National Park would impose restrictions on Project 3 lands,
the Claimants as prudent investors, should have known on September 29, 2010 the underlying
facts on which they based their claims of expropriation, breach of national treatment and most-

favored-nation treatment, and fair and equitable treatment.*"?

243. Particular knowledge of the treaty rights is not deemed relevant in order to assess the existence
of actual or constructive knowledge.*'* However, even if it was required, the Respondent explains
that as of September 2010, it had for several years been conducting a solid media campaign for
the civil society and the business community about DR-CAFTA and its investment chapter.*'°
Furthermore, the Claimants had legal counsel advising them, on their investment in Jamaca de
Dios on September 2010. Thus, they should have known of the relevant treaty rights and the
alleged breach thereof, by September 29, 2010, at the latest.4!

244. The Respondent contends that by September 2010, the Claimants had actual knowledge of the
restrictions imposed by the National Park and actual knowledge of the purported damage or loss

incurred as a result thereof."!”

In order to comply with the “knowledge of the loss or damage” requirement, the Claimants do not
need to have known the exact amount of injury or loss suffered but just that some was caused.*"*
As another DR-CAFTA tribunal held, “[i]¢ is the first appreciation of loss or damage in

consequence of a breach that starts the limitation clock ticking.”*’°

Since the Claimants have argued that the restrictions imposed by the creation of the National Park
deprived them of “significant commercial value” and “reasonable commercial use”, they should

have been able to appreciate this loss or damage on September 29, 2010, at the latest.’”°

As a result, the Claimants’ expropriation, fair and equitable treatment, national treatment, and
most-favored-treatment claims based on the creation of the Baiguate National Park and the
restrictions it imposed, fall outside the time limit pursuant to DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1 and are

therefore inadmissible.!

 

A ding to the Respondent, in their Admissibility Response, the Claimants argue that first, they
have not based any claim in the creation of the Baiguate National Park and second, that any such
claim would suffer from conceptual flaws.’ The Respondent denies the first part, and points out
to several paragraphs in the Amended Statement of Claim which evidence otherwise.*?? The

Respondent interprets thereof that the Claimants abandon these claims and assumes so.

However, if the Claimants raise these claims again, the Respondent states that it does not accept

 

their legal, procedural or factual arguments on the issue of admissibility or the merits underlying
these claims, and that unless otherwise stated, nothing in its Rejoinder should be construed as

acceptance thereof."

THE CLAIMANTS’ ARGUMENTS,

The Claimants rely on two DR-CAFTA cases, one of which against the Dominican Republic, in

which the respondent States argued that the tribunal lacked jurisdiction over the case because the

claims were time-barred pursuant to Article 10.18.1.4 Even NAFTA tribunals have always

considered the question as one of jurisdiction, not admissibility.*”°

251. Accordingly, the Claimants argue that the Respondent’s objections are jurisdictional and thus,
time-barred. *”’ A leading commentary of the UNCITRAL Rules contends that untimely

jurisdictional objections can only be admitted in very rare circumstances.*”*

252. The Claimants recognize that the Respondent did not have this evidence when it filed its
Statement of Defense. Nevertheless, it does not add anything new to the Respondent’s knowledge
because, pursuant to Article 10.18.1, the Claimants only have to show when they acquired or
should have first acquired knowledge of the breach and of the loss or damage. The Claimants
argue that along its Statement of Defense, the Respondent contends that the Claimants should
have known by 2009 that the Baiguate National Park would be created. As a result, there is no
such situation of grave injustice because the e-mail exchange does not show that Mr. Michael

Ballantine knew of a breach or of a loss or damage.*”?

253. As a result, the Respondent cannot claim that the e-mail exchange provided information that it
did not have before for the purposes of an objection under DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1. The
Respondent had enough information to make such an objection earlier. Simply having new
evidence is not sufficient to grant this late jurisdictional objection.“ Therefore, the Claimants

argue that they are not responsible for the Respondent’s late objection.**!

254. The Claimants contend that the Respondent must show that the Claimants had knowledge of the
breach and of the loss, and not either one of them.*** Thus, the relevant date is shifted further to
the one in which the Claimants — both of them — had knowledge of the breach and the loss or

damage.

Final Award
3 September, 2019

According to the Claimants, the e-mail exchange in September 2010, between Mr. Michael
Ballantine and the Empaca Redes consultants did not amount to the required knowledge of a
breach — much less for Ms. Lisa Ballantine who was not even copied on the e-mails — because:
(i) the e-mail explained that in the National Park ecotourism was allowed and the Claimants’
Phase 2 was considered as such; (ii) other projects were freely developing in category II national
parks, some even in the Baiguate National Park; (iii) the possibility that the National Park would
be an impediment to develop Jamaca de Dios was not raised by the Respondent until September
2015; (iv) the three denials of the permit did not mention the National Park or the restrictions
imposed by it; and (v) CONFOTUR approved Phase 2 after Mr. Michael Ballantine learned about
the National Park.

Therefore, the Claimants argue that the Respondent did not breach DR-CAFTA obligations
because it had not used the National Park as a basis to deny the Claimants’ permit, nor had it
imposed restrictions on their development based on the National Park, until September 2013.
Although the Claimants consider the manner in which the project was created discriminatory,
since Dominican-owned projects were excluded, they recognize that the drawing of the National

Park’s boundaries is not a breach by itself.*™

Additionally, the Claimants contend that the e-mail exchange in September 2010 did not amount
to knowledge of having suffered loss or damage at that point in time. The Respondent cannot
argue that the Claimants suffered any loss in September 2010 because (i) the Claimants had been
reassured by their environmental consultants that the National Park allowed ecotourism and the
Phase 2 expansion was such; (ii) the Claimants could see other land owners developing in national
parks; (iii) the National Park was not used to deny the permit or to impose restrictions on Jamaca
de Dios until 2014.*** In fact, the Respondent does not deny that ecotourism is allowed within the

National Park because its Management Plan made on 2017 allows for it.*°

The Claimants argue that having knowledge of an offending measure is not the same as having
knowledge of a breach, or of loss or damage, as was raised in the Spence v. Costa Rica case.**7

The tribunal held that “[w]hile the Claimants’ knowledge at the time of purchase may be material

for purposes of any assessment of the value of the properties in question, it is not ultimately

determinative either of issues of jurisdiction or of liability”.** (emphasis added by the Claimants)
The Spence tribunal held, same as the Corona tribunal, that the relevant date is when the claimant
first acquired knowledge of the breach and of the loss or damage as a result thereof. In this case,
the Claimants argue that they would not have had a basis to know in September 2010 that they
might be subject to expropriation and other significant restrictions. Even if they had known, it

would still not raise the time bar.

Other tribunals have held that measures that take place before the time bar limit commences, can
be relevant for purposes of merits, even if they do not start the time bar clock.” In this case, the
Claimants bring to the attention of the Tribunal the discriminatory circumstances surrounding the
creation of the National Park, which only arose in 2014, when the permit was denied based on

them.“

Regarding the Respondent’s interpretation that the Claimants have abandoned their claims, the
Claimants explain that they argued that the creation of the National Park did not give rise to a
claim by itself because there was no indication that the National Park would prohibit the
development.” If a person does not notice that it has suffered a loss, then the claim has not yet
arisen. Therefore, the Claimants did not abandon their claims, but they simply did not have them

until the permit was denied on the basis of the National Park.“

 

DISPUTING PARTIES’ SUBMISSIONS
1. Costa Rica

Costa Rica, as non-disputing Party in these arbitration proceedings analyzes the statute of
limitations under DR-CAFTA Article 10.18. The tribunal’s jurisdiction is derived from the
consent of the parties to arbitration. Article 10.18 sets out a series of conditions and limitations

on consent. The statute of limitations as a provision reinforces legal certainty by requiring

“diligent prosecution of known claims and insuring that claims will be resolved when evidence is

 

bly available and fresh, therefore to protect the } ial debtor from late actions”.“*

262. DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1 sets out a relevant question for the tribunal: “What is the date on
which the claimant first acquired knowledge of the breach that is being alleged?”** (Emphasis
in original) There are two alternatives to answer this question: (i) determining the date on which
the claimant first acquired knowledge of the alleged breach; or, (ii) determining the date on which
the claimant should have first acquired knowledge of the alleged breach. For the first alternative
there is enough evidence to identify the specific moment in which the knowledge was first
acquired. For the second alternative, the focus is on a set of circumstances surrounding the
claimant that should have allowed it to acquire knowledge of the alleged breach. The facts must
have been evident, made public and notorious, or there must have been a situation in which it was

the claimant’s duty and responsibility to know them.“*

263. According to Costa Rica, the two alternatives provide the Tribunal with a range of possibilities to

draw a line on its jurisdiction regarding ratione temporis.“”

2. United States of America

264. According to the United States, a tribunal must find that a claim satisfies the requirements set out
in Article 10.18.1 to establish the Contracting Party’s consent to the claim. Thus, there is a ratione
temporis jurisdictional limitation on the tribunal’s authority to act on the merits of a dispute in
this Article.“* And since the claimant bears the burden of proof, it has to demonstrate the

necessary and relevant facts to prove that the claims fall within the three-year limitations period.”

VI. MERITS

A THE RELATION UNDER DR-CAFTA BETWEEN THE RESPONDENT’S ENVIRONMENTAL
PROTECTION OBLIGATIONS AND ITS INVESTMENT PROTECTION OBLIGATIONS

1. The Respondent’s Arguments

266. The Respondent states that protection and conservation of the environment are important
considerations under DR-CAFTA.*® Its Chapters 10 and 17 establish certain environmental
obligations for the Contracting Parties. In particular, DR-CAFTA Article 10.11 provides that

[nJothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting, maintaining, or
enforcing any measure otherwise consistent with this Chapter that it considers appropriate to

ensure that investment activity in its territory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to
environmental concerns.***

267. According to this provision, the Contracting Parties preserve their right to apply their
environmental policies without breaching their substantive obligations, notwithstanding the
protections offered to investments under Chapter 10.*°* Thus, the Respondent emphasizes that
protection of the environment and promotion of open trade should be reconciled and be made

mutually supportive.**°

268. The Respondent compares NAFTA Article 1114 with CAFTA Article 10.11.47 NAFTA Article
1114 was interpreted to allow the adoption of regulatory measures to protect the environment
without breaching investment obligations unless such measures were discriminatory. **
According to the Respondent, this would apply mutatis mutandis to DR-CAFTA, given the parity

between the two provisions.**?

The Respondent also refers*’ to paragraph 4(b) of Annex 10-C to DR-CAFTA which provides
that
[e]xcept in rare circumstances, nondiscriminatory regulatory actions by a Party that are

designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as public health,
safety, and the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriations.*°!

Accordingly, the Respondent holds that a high threshold applies when claiming that an
environmental measure was discriminatory, and thus in breach of DR-CAFTA Chapter 10.4? The
Respondent summarizes the Claimants’ allegations to the adoption of two measures: the

Environmental Law and the National Park Decree.‘

The first one is a general application law
establishing the environmental protection framework for the Dominican Republic, while the
second one is a general application norm which created 32 protected areas, including the Baiguate
National Park.*“* The Respondent defends the creation of the National Park as reasonable, to
fulfill the Respondent’s international commitments related to biodiversity and environmental

protection and in reliance of Mr. Sixto Inchaustegui’s Expert Report.“

Accordingly, the Respondent concludes that the Claimants have not met the high threshold
established by DR-CAFTA, when it comes to prove that an environmental measure has resulted
in a DR-CAFTA violation. C quently, the and of the Envir 1

Law and the National Park Decree cannot be considered DR-CAFTA violations.4°

2. The Claimants’ Arguments

The Claimants explain that the exception in Article 10.11 will only apply if the measures are
consistent with DR-CAFTA Chapter 10. Thus, if the measures are expropriatory or violate
national treatment they will still result in a DR-CAFTA violation, despite being related to

environmental concerns.”

In this sense, the Claimants argue that the Respondent has not applied these two measures
transparently and non-discriminatorily.*°* The manner in which they were applied and the
circumstances surrounding the creation of the National Park would be inconsistent with Chapter

10, and so the exception in DR-CAFTA Article 10.11 does not apply.”

3. Costa Rica’s Non-disputing Party Submission

According to Costa Rica, DR-CAFTA addresses the Contracting Parties’ common interest of the
protecting of the environment, as reflected in the treaty’s Preamble.*” Through Article 10.11 the
Contracting Parties ensure that the obligations in Chapter 10 are interpreted in conjunction with
the intentions manifested in the Preamble.*”! As a result, Costa Rica considers that Article 10.11
allows a Contracting Party to take measures necessary to address its environmental concerns and
acknowledges the host State’s general prerogative to regulate and enforce environmental

measures.‘”*

In this sense, Costa Rica highlights the importance given by DR-CAFTA to investments and the
environment, which can be appreciated when Article 10.11 is read in the context of Chapter 10,

the rest of DR-CAFTA, and its implementation.

Costa Rica contends that to ensure the effectiveness of a treaty’s objective and purpose, tribunals
need to analyze the intention of the contracting parties by looking closely into the ordinary
meaning of their words in their context. In the case of DR-CAFTA Article 10.11, the host States
have the right to regulate, with a special focus on environment. As a result, this clause shows that

the Contracting Parties’ intention was to maintain a balance between both elements.*”

In sum, according to Costa Rica DR-CAFTA Article 10.11 reflects the Contacting Parties’
determination to develop their policies on environmental protection without substantially
breaching their DR-CAFTA obligations. That should be considered its point of effectiveness, in

accordance with the principle of effet utile, which stems from the principle of good faith. As a

result, when analyzing a claim, Costa Rica considers that there should be a balance between the

investment protection and the maintenance of domestic environmental policies.*”

‘WHETHER THE RESPONDENT BREACHED ARTICLES 10.3 AND 10.4 OF THE DR-CAFTA
1. The Claimants’ Arguments

The Claimants contend that the Respondent has breached its national treatment and most-favored-
nation (“MFN”) obligations under the DR-CAFTA, which apply to “investors” and “investments”
equally. Thus, according to the Claimants, the Respondent has an obligation to treat the investors
as favorably as it treats nationals and every foreigner and another obligation to treat investments

“in the same no less favorable manner” 4”

(a) National Treatment

The Claimants explain‘”* that the purpose of the national treatment provision is to “ensure that a
national measure does not upset the competitive relationship between domestic and foreign
investors”.*” Conversely, the MEN provision establishes the duty to treat U.S. investors and

investments no less favorably than investors and investments from other foreign countries.**°

Relying on the decision by the Pope & Talbot tribunal,"*! the Claimants allege that the Respondent
is obliged to provide them with the treatment equivalent to the “best” treatment accorded to the
domestic investors or investments in like circumstances.*** Thus, “no less favorable” treatment

means come to the best ded to the comp not better nor worse.*** The

 

difference in treatment can amount to a violation of the national treatment obligation, unless it
has “a reasonable nexus to rational government policies that (1) do not distinguish, on their face

or de facto, between foreign-owned and domestic companies, and (2) do not otherwise unduly

undermine the investment liberalizing objectives of NAFTA”. Thus, the Claimants conclude that

the focus must be set on the treatment, rather than on the policy.***

281. The Claimants resort to Cargill v. Mexico,**° which lays out the basic requirements of these

obligations, as follows:

[I]t must be demonstrated first that the Claimant, as an investor, is in “like circumstances”
with the investor of another Party or of a non-Party, or that the Claimant’s investment is in
“like circumstances” with the investment of an investor of another Party or of a non-Party.
And second, it must be shown that the treatment received by Claimant was less favorable
than the treatment received by the comparable investor or investment.**”

282. Relying on several commentators the Claimants state that they only have to show that one
single domestic comparator received more favorable treatment.**? The Parties agree on the three-

part test applied to determine whether the host State breached the national treatment clause:

(1) whether the domestic investor is an appropriate comparator to the disputing investor or
covered investment; (2) whether the disputing investor was in fact accorded a less favorable
treatment than its domestic comparator; and (3) whether any differential treatment that may
have existed was justified on the basis of legitimate policy and/or legal reasons.‘

283. For the Claimants, the concept of “like circumstances” must be assessed on a case-by-case

basis.*°! The Claimants rely on the decision by the Pope & Talbot tribunal,” which explained

that “ ‘circ ‘are context dey and have no meaning across the spectrum

of fact situations” The “like” examples must be the most “apt comparators where possible” °*

In that sense, the Claimants note*® that the tribunal in Methanex stated that “it would be as

perverse to ignore identical comparators if they were available and to use comparators that were

less ‘like,’ as it would be perverse to refuse to find and to apply less ‘like’ comparators when no

identical comparators existed”.°°

284. The Claimants explain that the first step in analyzing whether the Respondent violated the DR-
CAFTA provisions is to identify the comparators in “like circumstances”. There are three principal
factors that must be taken into account, when identifying these comparators: (i) whether the
comparators operate in the same business or economic sector; (ii) whether the comparators

produce competing goods or services; and (iii) whether the comparators are subject to a
comparable legal regime or requirements.*°”

285. Regarding the first one, the analysis “focuses on the commercial operations of the investor, rather
than the scale of operations”.** Special attention is given to the business’ various activities, like
the economics of the service offered, the customers and the logistics and internal administration

of the operations.”

286. Regarding the second factor, the analysis focuses on whether the investor provides the same or
competing goods or services as the proposed comparators. The Claimants rely on the Corn
Products International v. Mexico decision to contend that “where an investor’s product is in direct

competition with that of a comparator, this factor supports a conclusion that the two entities are

in ‘like circumstances” 5°

Regarding the third factor, the Claimants state that the Tribunal’s analysis should be whether the
Claimants and the comparator are subject to the same legal regime.*"' This analysis was conducted

in Grand River (NAFTA) and Merrill & Ring v. Canada

According to the Claimants, the comparators fulfill the requirements under the three categories.*

The Claimants claim to operate in the same sectors as the comparators — i.e. the
resort/restaurant/hotel sector —, and would compete directly with them.* Moreover, their
investment is under the same legal regime than the comparable businesses when it comes to the
permitting requirements and national park restrictions. These comparators are Jarabacoa
Mountain Garden, Mirador del Pino, Aloma Mountain, Paso Alto and Quintas del Bosque, among
505

others.

The Claimants argue that the Resp ’s proposed “envi 1 impact” cc factor
is not a proper and relevant factor to determine the “like circumstances”,*®° though it would be
one of the factors to evaluate when considering whether comparators are in “like
circumstances”.*” The relevant factor “must take into account the regulatory purpose of the
treatment in question and who or what is affected”, and “the appropriate comparator for the like
circumstances analysis cannot be divorced from the reasons for the treatment in question” °°

According to the Claimants, the Respondent’s proposed factor is too narrow and too subjective.°

The Claimants explain that if the Claimants’ and the Dominicans’ projects are compared solely
on their “environmental impact” it would be unnecessarily narrow, since a broad interpretation
would be preferred to fully review the measure under the national treatment clause.*!” Therefore,
the Claimants propose the Tribunal to focus on comparing “the different projects operating in

similar environmentally sensitive areas, such as developments or road projects in mountainous

areas in the DR”, which would be completely compatible with the Respondent’s proposed

factor.*'! (Emphasis added by the Claimants)

Additionally, the Claimants argue that the Respondent’s proposed comparator is too subjective
because the analysis would result in dividing the projects between their positive and negative

impact on the environment, a complicated exercise.*!”

It would allow the Respondent to simply
choose “the comparators by asserting that other projects do not have the same environmental
impact”. Yet, the Respondent would not be a neutral observer and its negative assessment of the

Claimants’ project’s environmental impact should “not be taken at face value” >

Nevertheless, if the Tribunal were to use the “environmental impact” factor as a comparator, the
Claimants state that their experts, Mr. Potes and Mr. Richter, provide enough evidence to assert
that there are other projects more environmentally sensitive than Jamaca de Dios’ Phase 2, such
as Jarabacoa Mountain Garden, Mirador del Pino, Paso Alto and Quintas del Bosque I and II.5'*
In any case, the “environmental impact” factor would be misplaced. According to the Claimants,
“the ‘like circumstances’ analysis must be based on an objective criterion which can easily be

9 515

assessable by a neutral observer”.

Furthermore, the Claimants claim that this comparator has never been applied by investment
arbitration tribunals. *'° The Claimants refer to the analysis in S.D. Myers on the “like
circumstances” test,>"’ in which the tribunal held that the general principles of NAFTA must be
taken into account,

including its concern with the environment and the need to avoid trade distortions that are

not justified by environmental concerns. [...] [A]lso take into account circumstances that

would justify governmental regulations that treat them differently in order to protect the
public interest.*!*

The Claimants state that the S.D. Meyers tribunal adopted an objective comparator and focused
on the assessment of the same business or economic sector to decide on the less favorable

treatment claim.*!°

295. The Claimants allege that the comparison must be between the planned Phase 2 of Jamaca de
Dios and any other project planned or completed in the mountains or in an environmentally
sensitive area, in particular in Jarabacoa or Constanza, such as: Quintas del Bosque I and II,
Jarabacoa Mountain Garden, Aloma Mountain, Paso Alto, Mirador del Pino, Sierra Fria, La
Montafia, Rancho Guaraguao, Alta Vista, Monte Bonito, Los Auquelles and Ocoa Bay. *”°

According to the Claimants, all these projects would be environmentally significant, include

luxury housing, have slopes in excess of 60%, and be in mountainous areas.*”! If any of these

projects is found to be a comparator and the Respondent cannot reasonably justify the disparate

treatment, the Respondent would have breached DR-CAFTA.*

296. The Claimants allege that since the Respondent has identified Aloma Mountain to be in “like
circumstances” with Jamaca de Dios,**? the conditions for establishing the first part of the “three-

part test” regarding this comparator should be considered to have been fulfilled.**

(b) Less Favorable Treatment

297. Having identified the analysis the Tribunal has to follow and the comparator to focus on, the
Claimants discuss the “no less favorable” standard.* According to the Claimants, it means
“equivalent to, not better or worse than, the best treatment accorded to the comparator” .°*° There
are two different types of nationality-based discrimination which can result from government
measures: de jure or de facto. A de jure discriminatory measure will directly treat certain entities
differently, while a de facto discriminatory measure are at the outset neutral but they still result in

a differential treatment.*?’

298. In this case, the Claimants contend that although the slope restrictions, national park regulations
and other measures would also apply to the comparators, they have been applied in a much less

favorable manner to the Claimants.*°

299. While the Respondent denies that the Claimants received a different treatment than Aloma
Mountain,*” the Claimants allege that there was in fact differential treatment between the two

projects.**’ Compared to other projects in the area, the Respondent would have treated Jamaca de
531

Dios’ Phase 2 less favorably.

300. The Claimants add that the Respondent has failed to satisfy its burden of proving that the less
favorable treatment afforded to Jamaca de Dios was justified.** In this sense, the Respondent
would have had to show that the differential treatment towards the Claimants “bears a reasonable
relationship to rational policies not motivated by” nationality-based preferences. *** The
Claimants allege that this reasonable relationship to rational policies must be shown at the time
when the Claimants were not allowed to develop for having slopes over 60%, while other
properties with the same slopes were allowed to; or when the Claimants’ private road was

534

nationalized, while other private roads were allowed to remain private.

301. The Claimants contend that a State will not be able to meet the burden if it could have achieved

its objective with non-discriminatory measures,*** as stated in the S.D. Meyers award.**°

302. According to the Claimants, when assessing whether a State’s treatment towards an investor bears
a “reasonable relationship to a rational policy”, the tribunals have identified two elements

required to justify the measures. First, there must be a rational policy and second, an “appropriate

correlation between the state’s public policy objective and the measure adopted to achieve it”**"

Regarding the first requirement, the rational policy must have been implemented “following a
logical (good sense) explanation and with the aim of addressing a public interest matter” .***
Regarding the second, the correlation must be “reasonable, proportionate, and consistent” to be

considered reasonably related to a rational policy.*”

The Claimants contend that in this case the measure was not consistently applied, as only the
Claimants were prevented from developing Phase 2 of Jamaca de Dios, have been placed inside
a park and have lost their private road. By contrast, other projects with the same slopes exceeding
60% were allowed to develop, even without permits.*“° Also, the Claimants contend that these
circumstances show that the Respondent intended to discriminate against the Claimants, and yet
even if the differential treatment was purely accidental or an administrative mistake, “this would
not cure or ameliorate the violation”! According to the Claimants, there would be no reasonable
relationship between the Respondent’s measures and the rational policy alleged by the

Respondent.*”

The Claimants hold that the legal standard of “like circumstances” and less favorable treatment
does not require that the investor prove that the less favorable treatment was caused by the
investor’s nationality, but only that the elements of the test are met.*4* The Claimants state that
tribunals have recognized that proving nationality-based discrimination can be an
“insurmountable burden” .*“ For that reason, a claimant is not required to prove discriminatory

intent.“

2. The Respondent’s Arguments
(a) National Treatment

The Respondent argues that it has not violated its obligation to provide national treatment to the
Claimants, as set forth in Article 10.3 DR-CAFTA, based on four arguments: (i) the scope and

meaning of Article 10.3; (ii) that the Dominican comparators suggested by the Claimants are not

in “like circumstances” as Jamaca de Dios; (iii) that the Dominican Republic accorded the
Claimants a treatment no less favorable compared to Dominicans; and (iv) that there are

reasonable justifications to explain any differences in such treatment.**°

The Respondent contends that Article 10.3 intends to protect foreign investors and investments
against discrimination by comparing them with domestic investors in “like circumstances”.4” The
Parties agree on the three-prong test used by investment arbitral tribunals to assess the host State’s

national treatment obligation.*“*

As a result, the Claimants have a double burden: first, they must identify at least one Dominican
comparator in “like circumstances”; and second, they have the burden of proving that the
Dominican Republic has actually treated the Dominican comparator more favorably than the

Claimants. However, the Respondent concludes that the Claimants have failed to satisfy either

requirement.*?

According to the Respondent, the Claimants have challenged nine measures**° under Article 10.3:

(i) the denial of permission to develop their property on grounds that the area has slopes over
60%; (ii) the denial of permission to build a road and sell property that is within the
boundaries of the Baiguate National Park; (iii) the requirement of environmental permits to
construct a road and buildings; (iv) the inclusion of the Ballantines’ property in the Baiguate
National Park; (v) the rejection by the President of the Dominican Republic of the appeal
against the permit denial; (vi) the non-issuance of a non-objection letter required from
municipal authorities to proceed with a proposed mountain lodge project; (vii) the loss of
control or dominion over the roads in the Ballantines’ project; (viii) inspections and fines
imposed on the Ball: and (ix) the i on the ofa to
submit environmental compliance reports every six months.**!

 

Additionally, the Claimants identified several Dominican comparators.*-? The Respondent argues
that these alleged comparators are not in “like circumstances” compared to Jamaca de Dios.**
The Respondent contends that the three factors identified by the Claimants for the “like

circumstances” test have not been applied by the tribunals as part of a three-part test.°*°° In Pope

& Talbot, Corn Products and Grand River cases, the tribunals applied one of the three factors,
based on their appropriateness to the circumstances of each case, rather than applying all of them

at once.*°

While the Respondent acknowledges the relevance of the factors set forth by the Claimants, they
should not be considered the only factors to be taken into account. In particular, in the present
case the Respondent argues that primary consideration should be given to the environmental

557

impact of each of the projects.

The Respondent mentions that the Claimants’ Project 3 posed risks to the surrounding water
resources, possibly causing erosion and mudslides, negatively impacting the ecosystem’s
biodiversity, and affecting the Cordillera Central’s endemic species.** Thus, except for Aloma
Mountain, the rest of the comparators are not comparable to Jamaca de Dios based on the

environmental impact and risks that each posed.**°

The Responder holds that the location of each project indicates its environmental value.*® Jamaca
de Dios’ Project 3 is located at an altitude of between 900 and 1260 meters above sea level on
Loma La Pefia, part of a set of mountains known as “El Mogote System”, with a unique
environmental value and requiring special protection because of its altitude, water sources and
biodiversity. The Respondent states that all the projects identified by the Claimants are outside
the El Mogote System and at a much lower altitude, between 600 and 800 meters above sea

level!

Thus, except for Aloma Mountain, the Respondent argues that the rest of the comparators cannot
be considered to be in “like circumstances” regarding the projects’ location.*® In addition, the
Respondent states that it has not been proven that any of the comparators provide or intend to
provide competing goods or services.** Although the Claimants still argue that Aloma Mountain

is appropriate as a comparator — because even though it was fined, it kept developing —, the

Respondent rejects the comparison for relying on largely anecdotal evidence*™ which “proves
very little on its own”*® The aerial footage would show that construction of a road took place
between 2002 and 2006, and further development occurred between 2006 and 2011. However,
from then on, there is no additional construction until 2017, since Aloma Mountain was fined in
2013 for building without a permit.** Furthermore, Aloma Mountain’s environmental permit

request was rejected.°”

Additionally, the Respondent claims that the alleged comparators and Jamaca de Dios are not
under the same legal regime.** While some comparators are located in other protected areas, the
Respondent explains that such protected areas’ classification is different. In a category IV area,
for example, more human activities are allowed than in a category II area such as Baiguate

National Park.*®

Moreover, the Respondent argues that the comparators and Jamaca de Dios were not subject to
the same regulatory measures under the same jurisdictional authority.*” Many of the alleged
comparators did not have an environmental permit, nor had they requested one.*”! If the Claimants
seek to compare the fine imposed on them and the lack of fines in the other projects, the
Respondent points out that in that case, the claim would be time-barred under the DR-CAFTA
three-year limit, since the fine was imposed on November 19, 2009.*” In any case, the claim
would be unfounded because even if it was based on the amount of the fine, it still would not
demonstrate discrimination, let alone nationality-based discrimination. Notably, the MMA has

imposed fines on eight of the projects mentioned by the Claimants.*”*

The Respondent complains about the Claimants’ assertion that the Respondent is not a neutral
observer in this case. The MMA’s assessments of the projects are well-documented and pre-date
the present arbitration proceedings. The Respondent disputes the contention that an agency
created to protect the environment would go against its principles to win the present case. If the

MMA did not really care about the environment, it would have been much easier to allow the

Claimants’ request for a permit. However, the Respondent’s concerns for the environment are
genuine and — based on Mr. Booth’s and Mr. Deming’s Expert Reports — Project 3 would have

had a greater negative impact on Jamaca de Dios and on the National Park than Project 2.57

Accordingly, the Claimants have failed to establish that the comparators are in “like
circumstances” with Jamaca de Dios, and thus, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to dismiss

their national treatment claim.°”>

(b) Less Favorable Treatment

The Respondent denies that the Dominican Republic accorded a less favorable treatment to the
Claimants than it did to Dominican nationals. According to the second part of the “three-part test”,
the Respondent explains that the Claimants have to show that the investor or the covered
investment was treated less favorably than a domestic comparator. To do so, the Claimants have
the burden of proving a de jure or de facto discrimination.*”° To demonstrate a de facto

discrimination, the Claimants have the burden of proving that “the practical effect of the measures

 

is to create a disproportionate benefit for nati over ie 7 577

Although the Claimants allege that they have been subject to deliberate measures to destroy their
investment and favor Dominicans, the Respondent contends that these measures have not

benefited the Dominican competitors, taking into account that they are considered —according to
the Claimants*”* — commercially and financially unviable.”

The Respondent complains that the Claimants have denounced the measures individually or only
parts thereof, distorting the facts. Thus, the Respondent explains in a table the principal measures

with respect to which the Claimants raise discrimination claims.**°

As a result, the Respondent divides the different projects shown in the table into two groups. One
group consists of projects at a lower altitude, such as Jamaca de Dios’ Project 2, Jarabacoa

Mountain Garden, Quintas del Bosque, Mirador del Pino and Paso Alto. While all these projects

projects within the Baiguate National Park, such as Aloma Mountain and Jamaca de Dios’ Project

system,**? and were thus accorded similar treatment.**?

The Respondent further notes that with regards to the imposition of fines, Dominican-owned
projects, similarly to Jamaca de Dios, received fines for violating environmental regulations. The
MMA even suspended work on Dominican-owned projects and Jamaca de Dios for violating these
regulations.*** Thus, the Respondent asserts that the treatment given to the Claimants and Jamaca

de Dios was not less favorable than to Dominicans and their projects.**°

Lastly, the Respondent contends that it had valid justifications for whatever differential treatment
the Claimants received. The differential treatment was justified because it was based on objective
distinctions between Jamaca de Dios and the other comparators.**° The Respondent relies on
GAMI to argue that a differential treatment has been justified when a host State has proven the
existence of legitimate policy or legal reasons for the measures at issue.**’ The Respondent recalls
the nine forms of disparate treatment claimed by the Claimants, and states that each form of

disparate treatment was grounded on such legitimate policy or legal concerns.***

First, regarding the denial of the environmental permit for Project 3 because of the slopes
exceeding 60%, the Respondent explains that the permit was denied because in their request for
terms of reference the Claimants did not clearly express that they would not build on slopes
exceeding 60%. The Respondent recognizes that if project owners undertake not to build in areas
with slopes exceeding 60%, it grants the permit. However, since the Claimants did not mention
in their letter requesting reconsideration the possibility of changing the location or pledging not

to develop in any area with slopes exceeding 60%, the Respondent denied the permit.

Second, regarding the differential treatment between the Claimants and the comparators on
conducting activities in the Baiguate National Park, the Respondent explains that there is either
no differential treatment, or the differential treatment is based on environmental considerations.*”
There are different types of legal regimes concerning environmental protected areas that affect
Jamaca de Dios and the comparators. While Jamaca de Dios is located within a category II
National Park, which prohibits a wider range of project development activities; others are located
in category IV National Parks, which are less restrictive on business activities.’ Regarding
Aloma Mountain, the Respondent emphasizes that construction was not allowed. Aloma
Mountain’s first permit request was denied, and a reconsideration request confirmed the first
denial. Furthermore, the Respondent points out that Aloma Mountain was fined due to

unauthorized construction.*””

Third, regarding the requirements to obtain an environmental permit not imposed on other
developers, especially Aloma Mountain and Los Auquelles, the Respondent rejects the Claimants’
allegations. Aloma Mountain’s permit was denied twice, and a fine on the project was imposed.*”
For Los Auquelles, the Respondent states that the project was never granted a permit, and was

similarly fined for unauthorized construction.*™*

Fourth, regarding the inclusion of Jamaca de Dios within the Baiguate National Park and the
exclusion of other projects, the Respondent relies on its experts and witnesses to explain the
legitimate environmental reasons behind the National Park’s borders.*”° If the discrimination had
been the real reason, the Respondent contends that in that case the Aloma Mountain project would
have been completely excluded by the National Park boundaries. Yet, since it shares

environmental and height characteristics with Project 3’s land, it was included.°**

Fifth, regarding the discriminatory rejection of the Claimants’ request for reconsideration, the
Respondent argues that the claim does not give factual basis. The Claimants’ argument that

Presidency, is considered hearsay by the Respondent.*”’ The Respondent asserts that Jarabacoa
Mountain Garden is different to Jamaca de Dios because — while the initial proposal by the

promoters was denied — the project accepted the slope restrictions imposed by the MMA.**

Sixth, regarding the discriminatory non-issuance of the non-objection letter by the Municipality
of Jarabacoa, the Respondent considers this a rational reaction, considering that the Claimants
only requested a “no objection” letter after the MMA had expressed its concerns on the viability
of the project.*” In addition, the Respondent holds that the Municipality of Jarabacoa replied to
the Claimants, explaining that it could not issue it since they were aware of the MMA’s
concerns. According to the Respondent, the Municipality acted in the most diligent way
possible, in concert with other government bodies and avoiding causing false expectations on the

foreign investors."

Seventh, regarding the alleged governmental pressure to turn the Claimants’ private road into a
public one, once a residential community is legally created, the roads are automatically yielded

602

to the public domain.” Furthermore, the Respondent argues that any circumstances related to the

road were caused by the Claimants and thus, they are estopped from blaming the Dominican

°°3 Since the Claimants were the ones who decided to

open the road to the public, the Claimants cannot claim discrimination on the private or public
nature of the road. In any case, the Respondent adds that it never forced the Claimants to turn
their private road into a public one, however since they were blocking the long-standing public

easement, the Palo Blanco community had no choice but to use their road.“

332. Eighth, regarding the inspections and fines imposed on the Claimants but not on other projects,
the Respondent denies this assertion because inspections have been carried out, and fines have

been imposed, on other projects as well. Thus, there would be no differential treatment.°

333. Ninth, regarding the requirements imposed on the Claimants to submit the EC Reports, the
Respondent contends that the same obligation was imposed on other developers who requested
an environmental permit. Furthermore, the MMA has imposed a fine on businesses which have
not submitted the required EC Reports.” The Claimants cannot consider this an added burden
because the requirement was already imposed on their Project 2 permit. Lastly, the Respondent

reminds the Tribunal that the fine related to the EC Reports submission was imposed after the

Claimants had violated several other environmental regulations.°*

334. In relation to the Claimants’ overall discrimination claim,” the Respondent states that the MMA.
invited the Claimants twice to propose alternative sites for their project. According to the

Respondent, it would not be reasonable for the MMA to offer its limited time and resources to a

project that it has no intention to approve in the end, simply because of its owners.°!”

enforcement of environmental law is not inherently consistent because certain factors, such as the

particular circumstances of each subject and project, affect its application.*"!

Respondent affirms that the Claimants have not been able to demonstrate a specific treatment
accorded to them or their investment which is less favorable than to the one accorded to another
foreigner or their investments.°! As a result, the Claimants’ MEN claim should be considered

abandoned.°'®

3. The United States of America’s Non-disputing Party Submission

The United States explains that DR-CAFTA Article 10.3 provision forbids nationality-based
discrimination between domestic and foreign investors that are in “like circumstances”. A
claimant has the burden of proving that its investments: (i) were accorded “treatment”; (ii) were
in “like circumstances” with domestic investors; and, (iii) received a “less favorable” treatment

than that accorded to domestic investors or their investments.°!”

The term “like circumstances” will vary according to the facts of each case. The United States
interprets the term “circumstances” as “to denote conditions or facts that accompany treatment
as opposed to the treatment itself’.©'* Thus, consideration must be given to several factors, not
just the business or economic sector but also the regulatory framework and policy objectives,
among others. The foreign and the national investors should be compared in all relevant aspects
but for nationality of ownership. Moreover, whether the treatment has been accorded in “like
circumstances” under Article 10.3, will depend on all the circumstances, including whether the
relevant treatment distinguished between investors or investments on the basis of legitimate

public welfare objectives.°!

Moreover, Article 10.3 does not require to accord the investors or investments of another Party
the best or most favorable treatment, given to any national investor or the investment of any

national.°°°

WHETHER THE RESPONDENT BREACHED THE FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT
STANDARD

1. The Claimants’ Arguments

The Claimants contend that the Respondent’s actions constitute a violation of the “fair and
equitable” treatment (“FET”) obligation of Article 10.5 of the DR-CAFTA.®! Through a
comparable analysis, the Claimants conclude that DR-CAFTA Article 10.5 is identical in
substance to NAFTA Article 1105.°” The Claimants state that NAFTA tribunals have held that a
State will be deemed to have violated the minimum standard of FET towards a foreign investor if
it has violated the investor’s legitimate expectations on which the investor relied when making
the investment, if it failed to act in good faith or with evident discrimination, or if it engaged in

arbitrary conduct.

The Claimants argue that the Respondent’s measures were discriminatory and arbitrary, and they
lacked transparency and due process. These measures would include the creation of the National

Park and its effect on the Claimants.

The Claimants hold that the investor need not demonstrate the existence of bad faith to prove the
State’s international responsibility.© In this sense, the tribunal in Mondev v. United States stated
that “a State may treat foreign investment unfairly and inequitably without necessarily acting in

bad faith.”°°

The Claimants rely on Mondev, and ADF v. United States to contend that the minimum standard
of treatment (the “MST”) is a standard under customary law that can evolve.’ According to the
Mondev tribunal, bilateral investment treaties include the standard of FET to try to incorporate
customary international law, evidencing state practice and opinio juris.°°* The Claimants quote

the Glamis Gold tribunal,°” which stated that treaty arbitration decisions “serve as illustrations

of customary international law if they involve an examination of customary international law, as

opposed to a treaty-based, or autonomous, interpretation.”

The Claimants disagree with the Respondent’s reliance on the Neer decision."! First, because the
decision issued in 1926 does not reflect the current state of the law on the protection of foreign
investors, which in the Claimants’ opinion has significantly evolved since the Neer decision.**”

Second, because the Neer decision would stand in contrast to general state practice.°*

The Claimants request the Tribunal to reject the Respondent’s argument that the standard of
protection should be the one set out in the Neer decision.** The Claimants argue that the Neer
case did not deal with the question on the appropriate level of protection that should be granted
to foreign investors, as the tribunals in Mondev and Windstream explained.*** According to the
Claimants, several scholars have noted the limited relevance of the Neer decision, since it does
not discuss the protection of investments, but rather a host State’s obligation to arrest and punish

perpetrators of crimes against aliens.°7

Regarding the second reason, the Claimants argue that even if the Neer decision was considered
relevant to assess the content and scope of the MST for foreign investors, the standard of
protection accorded to them has undeniably changed since 1926.°* For the Claimants, the

decision’s general statements stand “in contrast to state practice”.°° The Claimants rely on

remained fixed in time.

347. The Claimants find the Respondent’s reliance on Pope & Talbot, Eli Lily“ and Glamis Gold,“
three NAFTA decisions, to defend the applicability of the Neer standard to be misleading and
incorrect.“ The Claimants state that the Pope & Talbot tribunal explicitly rejected in a previous
award any requirement on the claimant to show egregious, outrageous or shocking State conduct
to evidence a breach of the FET standard of protection.“ The Claimants add that Eli Lily award
did not address the issue of whether the Neer standard is presently applicable, but rather accepted
in principle the analysis and conclusions reached by the Glamis Gold tribunal on the content of
the FET standard and the liability threshold.” Lastly, the Claimants acknowledge™* that the
tribunal in Glamis Gold stated that “the fair and equitable treatment standard is that as articulated
in Neer”? However, the Claimants note that the Glamis Gold tribunal also held that what is
currently considered “egregious” and “shocking” is different to what it was considered so in the

1920s, acknowledging the evolutionary nature of the FET standard.*°

348. The Claimants rely on the Railroad DR-CAFTA award, in which the tribunal held that the MST
had evolved since the Neer decision, to contend that under the DR-CAFTA the question on the

scope and evolutionary character of the MST should therefore be considered settled.°!

349. The Claimants claim that no DR-CAFTA tribunal has defined the threshold to establish a breach
of the MST as an “extremely high” one.°* The Claimants quote the award in TECO Guatemala
Holdings, LLC yv. Republic of Guatemala, which held that the minimum standard is “infringed by
conduct attributed to the State and harmful to the investor if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly
unfair or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome
which offends judicial propriety.”°* The Claimants state that in the award there was no reference
to an “extremely high” threshold of seriousness that would require “extreme and outrageous” State

conduct,°*

and that the tribunals in Waste Management v. Mexico and Railroad held a similar

opinion.°>

350. Similarly, the Claimants argue that no NAFTA tribunal has applied an “extremely high” threshold,
although the existence of a “high” one has been acknowledged.* The Claimants rely on Pope &
Talbot and Merrill & Ring,®™ the latter of which applied a lower threshold by requiring States to
provide protection to foreign investors “within the confines of reasonableness” .°* According to
the Claimants, the Bilcon tribunal set the threshold of gravity at a much lower level, with only
having to prove the existence of an “injustice” to amount to a violation of the MST under

international law,°® and the Windstream tribunal adopted a similar standard.°

351. The Claimants contend that the minimum standard of treatment relies upon four pillars: lack of

protection against discrimination; arbitrariness; gross unfairness or injustice; and non-

transparency.®! According to the Claimants, the Respondent has violated each of the four

pillars.

(a) The Respondent’s Measures Were Discriminatory

352. The Claimants state that the Respondent discriminated against them, something prohibited under

DR-CAFTA Article 10.5, which also bars discrimination on grounds other than nationality.°

While the Respondent acknowledges that three cases held that the FET provision in DR-CAFTA.
does not in itself protect foreign investors from discrimination, the Claimants add four more

NAFTA cases to the record advancing that argument.°®°

353. The Claimants add that “all CAFTA-DR awards that have dealt with the issue till the present date

Claimants) The awards in Railroad, Waste Management and TECO would endorse the position
that discrimination is one of the conducts that may infringe the MST.°” In addition, the Claimants
refer to other awards — outside of the NAFTA and DR-CAFTA context — that have also held that

discrimination may violate FET clauses.°*

354. The Claimants disagree with the Respondent’s contention that since DR-CAFTA Article 10.5 does
not explicitly refer to discrimination, it does not protect foreign investors from it. The
Claimants state that there is wide consensus amongst scholars that the MST covers specific types
of discrimination, other than nationality.“ The Claimants add that the G/amis tribunal considered

that targeted discrimination was prohibited under the FET standard.*”!

355. The Claimants also quote the Waste Management award, which held that a conduct that is
“discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice’*” violates the FET
standard, a position held by several NAFTA tribunals, as well as by the Railroad tribunal.°” The
Respondent’s reliance on Methanex®" is criticized by the Claimants because although the
Methanex tribunal held that nationality-based discrimination was not covered by the FET clause,
it refused to decide on whether “sectional or racial prejudice” could be considered a prohibited

form of discrimination under NAFTA Article 1105.°7

356. According to the Claimants, the existence of a high threshold for establishing discriminatory
conduct has never been mentioned by a NAFTA or DR-CAFTA tribunal.” In the Eli Lilly award,

quoted by the Respondent,®” the Claimants point out that the tribunal never mentioned the
existence of a requirement to prove an intention to discriminate to establish a FET standard
breach.°’ For the Claimants, to find discrimination there is no need to prove intent,” rather the
tribunal must apply the test proposed by the Sa/uka tribunal that “(i) similar entities are (ii) treated

differently (iii) and without reasonable justification” ©

The Claimants allege that the Respondent has discriminated against them on several
opportunities.®! One of such alleged discriminations is the rejection of the Claimants’ request for
Phase 2’s expansion under Article 122 of the Environmental Law.“ By contrast, the Claimants

state that twelve projects with slopes over 60% were allowed to develop."

Moreover, six projects
were granted a license after the Claimants’ request had been denied, three others obtained a license
before the Claimants were denied one, and another three were allowed to develop without a
permit.** According to the Claimants, the Respondent cannot claim that it was unaware of these
unauthorized developments, because they were “mountainside projects where land was cleared,
roads put in, and structures built”.©° The Claimants hold that the Respondent has not provided

any reasonable justification for the difference in the treatment towards the Claimants.*°

The Claimants also disagree with the Respondent’s contention®” that they are oversimplifying
the facts regarding slope restrictions by simply comparing the projects, since other factors should
be taken into consideration.™* These other factors, however, were not mentioned before the filing
of the Amended Statement of Claim, and were therefore created solely for this arbitration.*” In
addition, the Claimants’ experts set out that Jamaca de Dios’ Phase 2 would be less

environmentally significant than other projects.°”

359. The Claimants claim that it was also discriminatory for the Respondent to deny them the right to
develop any part of their land, even those parts where the slopes were not exceeding the 60%
limit, and yet the Dominican-owned projects were encouraged to resubmit their plans for
approval.®! The Claimants state that only two projects were not allowed to build on the land with
slopes exceeding 60%. By contrast, the Claimants never received such an opportunity, even
though Mr. Michael Ballantine told Dominican officials that he would not build on land where

the slopes were exceeding 60%.°”

360. The Claimants add that the Respondent discriminated against them through the creation of the
National Park.’ The boundaries of the National Park were allegedly drawn to include the
Claimants’ property and exclude Dominican properties which nevertheless affected the Baiguate
Waterfall and its river, the purported justification for the National Park.°™ Jarabacoa Mountain
Garden, Paso Alto or properties owned by prominent Dominicans, were excluded from the
National Park, even if their properties were within the Baiguate Waterfall area. Additionally,
the Claimants state that even if the creation of the National Park itself was not discriminatory, the

way its related restrictions were applied was.°°

(b) The Respondent’s Measures Were Arbitrary

361. The Claimants address the two issues raised by the Respondent after acknowledging that DR-
CAFTA Article 10.5 forbids arbitrary conduct:®” (i) whether there exists a specific threshold of

severity necessary for establishing an arbitrary conduct; (ii) the soundness of the “two-prong test”
to determine whether any conduct should be considered arbitrary.

362. Regarding the first issue, the Claimants contend that several NAFTA tribunals have not affirmed

the existence of a high threshold of severity, referring simply to “arbitrary” conduct.®” Similarly,

the Claimants hold that no DR-CAFTA tribunal has endorsed the existence of a high threshold of
severity.”

363. Regarding the second issue, the Claimants agree with the “two-prong test” put forward by the
Respondent and supported by the Glamis Gold and the Mesa Power tribunals.””' However, the
Claimants point out that this should be one of the methods used by the Tribunal when determining

whether the Respondent’s conduct was “arbitrary” for the purposes of DR-CAFTA generally and

702

the FET provision specifically.’ Similarly, the Claimants argue that the term “measures” should

not be restricted to the Dominican laws or policies but it should also include the Dominican
officials’ actions when enforcing said laws and policies.”

364. For the Claimants, the first point that would have to be addressed is whether “there is any rational
reason or any logical justification behind the policy which was adopted by Respondent”.™ If the
answer to this question is negative, then there would be no “legitimate governmental policy” and
the policy should be considered arbitrary.” If the answer to this first question is positive, one
should ask whether there is any reasonable relationship between the measure adopted by the

706

Respondent and the policy underlying such measure.

365. Although the Claimants agree with the Respondent on the nature and content of the test, they
disagree on how the test should be applied.”” According to the Claimants, there is no basis to
require the measure to be “manifestly unreasonable” to be considered arbitrary and in violation

of the MST standard under DR-CAFTA Article 10.5.7

366. Based on the “two-prong test”, the Claimants contend that the enforcement of slope restrictions

and the creation of the Baiguate National Park were arbitrary in relation to the Claimants.””

The Claimants argue the denial of the permit based on the slopes was arbitrary, because the
Respondent never explained “why an entire area of land is rendered useless because some of that
land purportedly has slopes exceeding 60 percent”.”° Compared to other projects owned by
Dominicans, the Claimants state that they were never asked to adapt their project or to present

alternative plans for Jamaca de Dios’ Phase 2.7"!

To fulfill the first step of the “two-prong test”, the Claimants affirm that they must ascertain
whether there was any rational reason or logical justification behind the Respondent’s policy. The
Claimants state that Article 122 of the Environmental Law is too broad to protect certain areas.”!”

Instead, the Claimants hold that

[i]t would be different if the policy allowed for development on the areas where the slopes
were not in excess of 60%. But that is not the case here. Had the law been written to allow
for development on areas within the property where the slopes did not exceed 60%, this might
be allowable under CAFTA-DR.73

The Claimants add that — even if the policy is not arbitrary in the abstract — there is no reasonable
relationship between the differential treatment accorded to the Claimants and the rest of the

investors, and the purported policy on slope restrictions.’!4

In any event, the Claimants claim that the Respondent’s measures violate DR-CAFTA “under
other measures of arbitrariness”.™° The Claimants assert that the use of other factors by the
Respondent when deciding on slope issues was arbitrary, because when the Claimants first
invested in the Dominican Republic it was their view that there were no slope-based restrictions
on development.’'® Additionally, these others factors cannot be found in the Environmental

Law7!7

Furthermore, the Claimants argue that the way in which the Environmental Law provides

Dominican officials with discretion when deciding the granting of a permit was also arbitrary.”"*

The Claimants further assert that the creation of the Baiguate National Park was arbitrary.’!? The

Claimants do not take issue with the purported reasons behind the policy that created the National

environmental features to be purportedly protected by the National Park can be found in the
Claimants’ property.””! By contrast, other properties that would affect the Baiguate Waterfall and
its river were expressly excluded from the National Park.”” Thus, the Claimants conclude that the
boundaries were drawn arbitrarily, completely disconnected and without any reasonable

relationship to the policy goal underneath the creation of the National Park.’”*

(c) The Respondent’s Measures Violated Due Process

The Claimants allege the following breaches of the “due process” umbrella obligation, contained
in DR-CAFTA Article 10.5(2): (i) the Respondent’s refusal to issue the “no objection” letter; (ii)
the Respondent’s treatment towards the Claimants regarding the slopes; (iii) the Respondent’s
treatment towards the Claimants regarding the Baiguate National Park; (iv) the Respondent’s non-
transparency regarding the slope regulations; and (v) the Respondent’s non-transparency

724

regarding the National Park.

The Claimants state that NAFTA and DR-CAFTA tribunals have consistently recognized the
existence of a due process obligation under NAFTA Article 1105 and DR-CAFTA Article 10.5,
respectively.”?° While two of the above five measures can also be examined as violations of the
Respondent’s transparency obligation, the other three of the Respondent’s measures violate the
due process obligation exclusively: (i) City of Jarabacoa’s refusal to issue a “no objection” letter;
(ii) the Respondent’s failure to provide any reason for the slopes policy specifically adopted with
respect to the Claimants; (iii) the Respondent’s failure to adopt a transparent process of the

creation of the National Park.””°

Regarding the first measure, the Claimants contend that the City of Jarabacoa arbitrarily refused

to act on their request for a “no objection” letter: the Claimants allegedly have neither received

the letter, nor a refusal to issue a letter.””’ The Claimants argue that the due process obligation
imposes on the Respondent the duty to respond to the Claimants’ request and prevent a prolonged
situation of uncertainty that affects their legal rights. The Claimants state that they cannot

challenge a decision if they have not received a refusal.”**

The Claimants further claim that the Respondent acted in a manner contrary to due process when
it denied the Claimants their development request, while other properties in Jarabacoa with the

slopes exceeding 60% were allowed to develop.””

The Claimants hold that the process of creating the National Park was also in breach of the due
process obligation, as it was “an essentially secret process”. The creation of the Baiguate
National Park was further contrary to due process because it purposefully and unreasonably
excluded Dominican-owned properties, while including the Claimants’ property within its
borders.”*! In addition, according to the Claimants’ experts, the National Park Decree did not
define the precise boundaries of the National Park and the boundaries shown in it had no relation

to the boundaries typically drawn.”

The Claimants state that the Respondent has the obligation to explain to investors the reasons for
adopting measures that affect its interests.* Moreover, the Respondent would have failed to
enquire with, and communicate to, all potentially affected owners about the National Park’s
creation, as required by DR-CAFTA.™ The Claimants add that the Management Plan for the
Baiguate National Park was issued seven years after the National Park was created, and yet it is
not complete and it does not provide sufficient information and guidance on the uses allowed

within the National Park.”*

The Claimants emphasize the importance of the National Park to determine whether the
Respondent complied with its due process obligation because it was invoked by the Respondent

as a reason for denying the permit to the Phase 2 road. The Claimants rely on the Metalclad and

TECO awards to argue that a host State may be in breach of its due process obligations when a
permit is denied without reasons, or for reasons unrelated to the specific existing requirements for

the issuance of the permit.”°

(d) The Respondent’s Measures Were Non-Transparent

The Claimants argue that the Respondent has breached DR-CAFTA Article 10.5, if the
Respondent’s transparency obligations under DR-CAFTA Chapter 18 are taken into account and
used as a guidance.’ The Claimants state that NAFTA and DR-CAFTA tribunals have held that

transparency is part of each treaty’s FET provision.”

The Claimants hold that the Respondent failed to comply with this obligation — including failing
to consult the Claimants — when it comes to the creation of the Baiguate National Park.” Neither
the Claimants, nor other landowners were personally notified of the creation of the National Park

on their land, even after it had been created.””

2. The Respondent’s Arguments

The Respondent addresses the Claimants’ FET violation claims in two steps: (i) the analysis of
the applicable legal standard, and (ii) analysis of the particular measures considered to violate the

FET standard.™

According to the Respondent, the applicable standard is the MST under customary international
law.” The Respondent relies’ on the Neer case to contend that a breach of the minimum

an insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that every

reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency”.

384. While the Claimants argue that the MST has evolved since then, the Respondent relies on three
NAFTA decisions which endorsed the Neer standard.” The Respondent concedes that what may
be understood as outrage or insufficient governmental action may have evolved since the Neer
case.”4° However, the Respondent emphasizes that a government breaches the MST only when its
conduct rises to such level of outrage.”4” According to the Respondent, the threshold for showing

a breach of the MST is very high,”* as the Waste Management tribunal stated that

[t]aken together, the S.D. Myers, Mondev, ADF and Loewen cases suggest that the minimum
standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to
the State and harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or
idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or
involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety— as
might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a
complete lack of transparency and candor in an administrative process.”"? (Emphasis added
by the Respondent)

 

 

385. The Respondent argues that this standard was endorsed by the Railroad tribunal — as mentioned
by the Claimants — and by other NAFTA and CAFTA tribunals.” In particular, the GAM/ tribunal
underscored four conclusions from the Waste Management award that show the rigor of the
standard.”*"! The Respondent further grounds its argument in the other standards set out in

Thunderbird and Glamis Gold, and by other non-NAFTA or non-DR-CAFTA tribunals.”

386. Taking into account the cases set out above, the Respondent contends that the threshold is very

high for the Claimants to prove that the Respondent breached the FET standard.”**

387. As to each particular measure, the Respondent understands that there are eight measures that are
allegedly in breach of Article 10.5 of DR-CAFTA: (i) the denial of an environmental permit based
on the slopes; (ii) the creation of Baiguate National Park; (iii) the permit’s denial based on the
National Park; (iv) the inspections conducted on the Claimants’ property; (v) the fines imposed
on the Claimants; (vi) the alleged order to make the Project | road public; (vii) the application of
environmental rules such as the submission of EC Reports; and (viii) the Municipality of

Jarabacoa’s refusal to issue a “no objection” letter.’™*

(a) The Respondent’s Measures Were Not Discriminatory

388. The Respondent explains that the FET provision in the DR-CAFTA does not protect foreign
investors against discrimination because it does not mention the word, nor any related term or
synonym.’» Other articles do refer to discriminatory treatment directly, such as Article 10.3 and
Article 10.4. Thus, following the principle expressio unius est exclusio alterius, the Respondent
concludes that these are the only types of discriminatory treatment covered by DR-CAFTA

Chapter 10.’*° The Respondent adds that arbitral tribunals have reached the same conclusion.”

389. The Respondent holds that even if DR-CAFTA Article 10.5 would prohibit discriminatory
treatment, the threshold would still be high, and it would require proving the host State’s
discriminatory intent.’** In particular, the Respondent raises that while the Claimants argue that

there is no requirement to prove intent, they contend that the Respondent “specifically targeted”

the Claimants.” For the Respondent, one cannot target someone without intending to do so.”

The Respondent argues that the Claimants have failed to prove such an intent.”°!

The Respondent contends that the Claimants have given up on their claim that the creation of the

Baiguate National Park was discriminatory.’

Thus, the only claims left would be the invocation
of Article 122 of the Environmental Law and the National Park for the denial of the environmental

permit.”

Regarding the application of Article 122 of the Environmental Law, the Respondent argues that
the claim is identical to the Claimants’ national treatment claim — and so it should be dismissed
for the same reasons. The Claimants contend that Article 122 of the Environmental Law was
applied discriminatorily because other projects which had slopes in excess of 60% were granted
a permit.’ The Respondent emphasizes that the slopes were not the only reason for rejecting the
Claimants’ permit request. In this sense, the Claimants were notified that the Jamaca de Dios
project in itself was environmentally not viable because the use of the land was restricted by

Article 122 of the Environmental Law.’

The Respondent points out that Article 122 of the Environmental Law forbids any intensive labor
that can increase soil erosion and sterilization on mountainous areas with slopes greater than 60%.
The Respondent contends that it was impossible for the Claimants to cut a road without

undertaking such an amount of work."

Regarding the comparison with other projects holding a permit although they have slopes
exceeding 60%, the Respondent recognizes this fact but explains that those projects and their land
were different from the Claimants, and thus, they are not suited as comparators, since none of
those projects tried to develop within a national park or at the same altitude.”*’ The only project

with an elevation comparable to Jamaca de Dios Project 3 is La Montajfia, and which is why La

Montajfia’s permit restricted any construction beyond 1300 meters above sea level.’ Similarly,
the Respondent affirms that the Claimants cannot compare Jamaca de Dios with unauthorized
projects with slopes greater than 60%, because penalizing an unauthorized activity is not the same

as denying a permit.’

394. For the Claimants, the fact that the permit was rejected in its entirety — rather than only with
respect to the areas with slopes exceeding 60% — shows the Respondent’s discriminatory intent.”
However, the Respondent states the Claimants agreed at the time that, before requesting a permit
for the development itself, they should first request approval for the road.7”! In practical terms,
this meant that if the permit for the road was not granted, the rest of the expansion would be

equally rejected.”

395. On the Baiguate National Park, the Respondent raises the same arguments as it did for the
Claimants’ national treatment claims. The projects used as comparators by the Claimants are not

suitable, either because they did not receive a permit or because if they did, they were not a

mountain project.’

(b) The Respondent’s Measures Were Not Arbitrary

396. The Respondent asserts that it has not acted arbitrarily towards the Claimants.’ While the MST
protects foreign investors from arbitrary State conduct, some tribunals have noted that it has to be
“manifestly arbitrary”. (Emphasis added by the Respondent) The Respondent relies’ on
certain NAFTA and DR-CAFTA awards to conclude that a State conduct is arbitrary when there

is a “lack of reasons”™ or a “manifest lack of reasons”.””* The Respondent quotes the Glamis

Gold tribunal,” which defined “arbitrariness” as a “gross denial of justice or manifest

arbitrariness falling below acceptable international standards”.”*°

The Respondent explains that as long as a measure is reasonable, it cannot be considered
arbitrary.”*' According to Glamis Gold, a State conduct will be reasonable if (i) it is rationally
related to the stated purpose; and (ii) it has been reasonably drafted to address its objectives.”
The Respondent states that the Claimants have to prove either the lack of rationality of the policy
underlying the measures, or that the measure was not reasonably correlated to the policy.” Yet,

the Respondent argues that the Claimants’ arguments challenge neither.”

Regarding the Claimants’ argument that Article 122 of the Environmental Law was not a rational
policy in the abstract,”** the Respondent rejects it on the basis that Article 10.5 of DR-CAFTA
does not allow claims based on the rationality of the law.”*° Because the FET standard focuses on
a treatment given by the host State to the investor, the Respondent states that investors cannot
challenge a law they may find irrational in the abstract. On the contrary, the investors would be

obliged to take the law as found when entering a host State voluntarily.”

The Respondent further contends that the Claimants’ arbitrariness claims fail because the
Respondent’s conduct was reasonable and proportionate.”** The Respondent understands that the
Claimants’ arbitrariness claims are simply a reexamination of their discrimination claims, and so
resorts to its arguments in that regard.”*” However, the Respondent clarifies that it did not establish

a complete bar to the project,””

and that the MMA invited the Claimants at least twice to propose
alternative sites for their project.”' Furthermore, the Respondent states that the other factors

applied by the MMA were not arbitrary, since said factors were of core relevance for assessing

the development restriction under Article 122 of the Environmental Law.’ Lastly, the
Respondent asserts that the di ion afforded to Domini officials in the lication of the

Environmental Law is entirely consistent with international law.”

(c) The Respondent Acted in Accordance With Due Process

400. The Respondent considers the Claimants’ three due process claims are unfounded.” First, with
respect to the alleged non-issuance of the “no objection” letter for Project 4 by the Municipality
of Jarabacoa,’** the Respondent states that that the Claimants were not left in a legal limbo.””°
Under Dominican law, the doctrine of administrative silence creates a presumption of a rejection,
when the government authorities do not respond to a request within a particular amount of time.
As a result, individuals can initiate an appeal before the competent judicial authorities even if a

particular request has not yet been explicitly rejected.”” The Claimants, who had Dominican

798 799,

lawyers,’”* should have known this and could have acted accordingly.

401. The Claimants’ second due process allegation is related to the MMA’s enforcement of Article 122
of the Environmental Law.*” The Claimants contend that the MMA had an obligation to explain
the reasons for adopting specific measures that affected the Claimants’ interests. *°' The
Respondent rejects the Claimants’ arguments by stating that the MMA in numerous opportunities

sent letters to the Claimants explaining why the permit was being rejected, how the applicable

legal regime worked, and replying to the Claimants’ comments.*”?

402. The Claimants’ final due process claim is that the creation of the Baiguate National Park was a
“secret process” .*°° The Respondent puts forward that the National Park Decree was published in
the Official Gazette, the principal official publication instrument for decrees, executive orders,
and laws in the Dominican Republic.** The Respondent argues that the Claimants’ experts
acknowledged the appropriateness of the publication of a decree for stakeholders to participate in

the boundaries definition of protected areas.*”*

403. The Claimants reject the publication in the Official Gazette because they considered it insufficient
in explaining the effect of the National Park’s creation and precise boundaries, and to know its
scope and extent.‘ However, the Respondent points out that Empaca Redes, the Claimants’
environmental consultant, — now alleging lacking the necessary information — was able to explain
to the Claimants in September 2010 the location of the National Park and what its existence

meant.6”

(d) The Respondent Did Not Act in a Non-Transparent Manner Towards the
Claimants

404. The Respondent similarly considers that the Claimants’ transparency claims should fail because
the FET provision does not create a transparency obligation, as stated in Merrill & Ring.8°’ The

Respondent adds that the Claimants cannot import the requirements in Chapter 18 to Article 10.5,
since doing so would violate the interpretative principle expressio unius est exclusio alterius.*”

405. Even if DR-CAFTA’s FET provision included a transparency obligation, the Respondent argues
that the claim would still fail because the Dominican Republic does not have a “secretive”
regulatory system.*'? Regarding the denial of the environmental permit, the Respondent states

that the Claimants were given an opportunity to identify an alternative location.*!! Furthermore,

the MMA took into consideration certain other factors that were environmentally critical, even if
they were not explicitly stated in the Environmental Law.*!? The Respondent contends that
because of the complex nature of issues tackled by governments, not all factors may be
legislatively addressed in advance, and so some degree of regulatory discretion would be
required.*'? Moreover, the Respondent holds that the Claimants’ experts and consultants were able
to identify these very same critically relevant environmental factors that are unmentioned by the

Environmental Law.*'*

406. On the second measure, the Respondent explains that the creation of the National Park was
conducted through a formal decree signed by the President and published in the Official Gazette,
and its promulgation was widely publicized in the media.*!> The Respondent considers that it is
irrelevant that the MMA did not identify the Baiguate National Park in the first denial, since the

boundaries were clear and adequately publicized.*'® Also, the Respondent explains that it had no

3. Non-disputing Parties’ Submission
(a) Costa Rica

408. Costa Rica argues that DR-CAFTA Article 10.5 sets out the conditions of the MST that each
Contracting Party must accord to DR-CAFTA-covered investments.** Costa Rica emphasizes the
instructions in Article 10.5’s first paragraph to accord investments treatment in accordance with
customary international law, including FET, and the second paragraph’s directive not to give a
treatment beyond the one required by the MST.**5 Costa Rica further relies on DR-CAFTA Annex
10-B to contend that FET consist of the MST under customary international law.‘”° For Costa
Rica, the obligation of FET is breached when there is a situation of extreme denial of justice or

manifest injustice, resulting in a lack of due process.*?”

409. Costa Rica argues that if a claim is brought due to a breach of DR-CAFTA Article 10.5, the
claimant has the burden of proving that the standard was breached under customary international
law, relying on general and consistent State practice and opinio iuris.*°8 According to Costa Rica,
this shall be the main source of interpretation for the MST.*” This standard was also confirmed
under NAFTA Article 1105 by the NAFTA Commission.**” Additionally, Costa Rica also relies

on the test as set out in Waste Management and Cargill for the infringement of the MST.**!

with the objectives of its laws and regulations should be taken into account by tribunals when

deciding whether international law was violated.**

411. Costa Rica notes that in Mercer International, the tribunal found that the MST provision does not
cover discrimination, which is addressed in the national treatment and most-favored-nation

treatment provisions.**

412. While some awards have interpreted FET as an autonomous standard with a broader and more
ambiguous interpretation, Costa Rica considers that such an interpretation would not be consistent
with DR-CAFTA, which has linked the provision to customary international law. Therefore, when
alleging a breach of DR-CAFTA Article 10.5, Costa Rica puts forward that the claimant must
prove that (i) there is a customary international law rule; (ii) the host State engaged in conduct

that breached such rule; and (iii) the host State’s conduct caused loss or damage.*™

(b) United States of America

413. The United States agrees with Costa Rica that it was the Contracting Parties’ intention to establish
the MST as defined under customary international law, as the applicable standard under DR-
CAFTA Article 10.5.5%° The obligation to provide FET includes certain obligations, such as not
denying justice; affording due process; not expropriating covered investments in violation of

Article 10.7’s conditions; and providing full protection and security.**°

414. The United States notes that DR-CAFTA Annex 10-B establishes the methodology for
interpreting customary international law rules covered by DR-CAFTA, namely, State practice and
opinio iuris.8*’ The ICJ noted in a recent decision that national court decisions, domestic
legislation dealing with a particular issue alleged to be the norm of customary international law
or, official declarations by relevant State actors on the subject at issue can serve as evidence of

State practice.***

415. However, the United States does not consider the element of “transparency” part of FET under
customary international law.** It states that it is not aware of any general and consistent State
practice and opinio iuris which establishes a transparency obligation on a host State under the
MST.™° Moreover, a tribunal under Chapter 10 does not have jurisdiction to address matters that
arise under Chapter 18. The jurisdiction of the tribunal is limited to claims based on a host State’s
breach of an obligation under Chapter 10, Section A, an investment authorization, or an
investment agreement.™! Furthermore, Chapter 18 is subject to the State-State dispute resolution

provisions in Chapter 20."

416. Additionally, the United States argues that the concept of legitimate expectations is not part of
FET under customary international law giving rise to an independent host State obligation. The
United States recognizes that an investor may develop its own expectations about the legal
framework governing its investment but those will not impose any obligations on the host State.
Also, the United States is not aware of any general and consistent State practice and opinio iuris

establishing an obligation under the MST not to frustrate the investor’s expectations.“

417. The United States adds that the MST standard in DR-CAFTA Article 10.5.1 does not include a
prohibition on economic discrimination against foreigners or a general obligation of non-
discrimination.*“ A State can treat foreigners and nationals differently, even foreigners from
different States.“ The customary international law MST incorporated in Article 10.5 prohibits
discrimination, yet only in the context of other established customary international law rules.
Moreover, investment claims on nationality-based discrimination are governed exclusively by the

provisions of DR-CAFTA Chapter 10 that specifically address the subject, not by Article 10.5.1.54°

PCA Case No. 2016-17
Final Award
3 September, 2019

The United States agrees with Costa Rica that the interpretation of autonomous FET and full
protection and security provisions cannot constitute evidence of the customary international law
standard set out in DR-CAFTA Article 10.5. Likewise, decisions of international tribunals and
arbitral tribunals interpreting FET as a concept of customary international law are not State
practice for purposes of evidencing customary international law, although they can be relevant for

determining State practice when they include an analysis of it.”

Accordingly, the United States argues that a claimant has the burden of proof to establish the
existence of an obligation under customary international law. Once the rule has been established,
by virtue of State practice and opinio iuris, the claimant must demonstrate that the State has
engaged in a conduct that has breached the rule. A showing of a breach of the MST “must be made
in the light of the high measure of deference that international law generally extends to the right

of domestic authorities to regulate matters within their borders.”**

WHETHER THE RESPONDENT EXPROPRIATED THE CLAIMANTS’ INVESTMENT
1. The Claimants’ Arguments

The Claimants argue that the Respondent’s actions amount to an illegal expropriation under DR-
CAFTA.*” The Claimants contend that the Respondent has expropriated their investment through
a series of measures that have prevented the Claimants from using their investment and deprived

them of its value.

Under DR-CAFTA, an indirect expropriation takes place when a governmental action or a series
of them have an effect equivalent to direct expropriation but without the formal transfer of title or
outright seizure.**! Thus, the Claimants contend that they do not have to show that the Respondent
formally seized their investments but rather that an indirect expropriation occurred, in accordance

with the three-factor test set out in DR-CAFTA Annex 10-C.8?

422. The Claimants rely on DR-CAFTA Annex 10-C to state that for governmental action or actions
to amount to expropriation, *** there must be an interference “with a tangible or intangible

property right or property interest in an investment”. Three factors must be considered:

(i) the economic impact of the government action [...] (ii) the extent to which the government
action interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations; and (iii) the
character of the government action.**

423. To define indirect expropriation, the Claimants resort to an authority on the matter,*°° which stated

that a

taking of property includes [...] any such unreasonable interference with the use, enjoyment
or disposal of property as to justify an inference that the owner thereof will not be able to
use, enjoy, or dispose of the property within a reasonable period of time after the inception
of such interference.°*”

424. The Claimants contend that the extent of an “unreasonable interference” will depend on the
circumstance of the case.*** In this sense, the Claimants add that indirect expropriation occurs
when a government measure results in “substantial deprivation” of the investor’s economic rights

or of the reasonably-expected economic benefits from its investment, even though the investor

still retains the nominal or legal ownership of its investment.*?

425. The Claimants argue that substantial deprivation of an investment occurs when,*® e.g. an
investment is no longer capable of generating a commercial return;**! the loss, wholly or in part,

of the use or “ ly-to-be” d ic benefit of the i 35° an investment

426. The Claimants reject*®* the Respondent’s argument that indirect expropriation requires a “virtual
taking” such that “the investor no longer [is] in control of its business operation, or that the value
of the business [is] virtually annihilated” .*°° The Claimants rely on customary international law

without the need of virtually annihilating the business.

427. The Claimants claim that the Respondent’s expropriation is illegal because the Respondent has

acted in a discriminatory manner, and because it has failed to pay the Claimants compensation.*

428. Pursuant to DR-CAFTA Article 10.7, a legal expropriation occurs when the governmental taking
is (i) for a public purpose; (ii) non-discriminatory; (iii) on payment of a prompt, adequate and
effective compensation; and (iv) in accordance with due process of law.*” The Claimants note

The Claimants further state that the Respondent has not paid them any compensation, thus it
cannot be assessed whether it is prompt, adequate and effective.*”* Under DR-CAFTA, the

compensation must be
(a) be paid without delay;

(b) be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before
the expropriation took place (“the date of expropriation”);

(c) not reflect any change in value occurring because the intended expropriation had become
known earlier; and

(d) be fully realizable and freely transferable.*”5

As a result, the Claimants hold that the Respondent has not satisfied the requirements to consider

that the expropriation of the Claimants’ investment was legal.'”°

2. The Respondent’s Arguments

The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ direct expropriation claims,*”’ which have, in any event,
been waived by the Claimants.*”* The Respondent similarly rejects the Claimants’ indirect
expropriation claims.*””

The Respondent argues that the Claimants’ overlapping expropriation claims cannot
simultaneously be true since the same investment could not be expropriated multiple times.**°
Furthermore, the Respondent states that any expropriation claims based on the creation of the

National Park are time-barred by DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1, as detailed above.**!

In addition, the Respondent asserts that there was no indirect expropriation because the Claimants
have not established that there was a “substantial deprivation” of their entire investment.**? The
Respondent contends that “substantial deprivation” requires an interference that must be severe

and tantamount to the direct expropriation of the whole investment, as DR-CAFTA and

cannot establish any level of interference.***

435. The Respondent adds that the Claimants’ assertion that their land has lost its value must be
rejected.**° While it is true that the Claimants were unable to develop the purchased land, the
Respondent affirms that they assumed that risk when they purchased that land with slopes
exceeding 60% after the Environmental Law had been passed, and the Claimants could still use

the land for other purposes, such as ecotourism.**°

436. Moreover, according to the Respondent the “substantial deprivation” test examines the investment
in its entirety.’ However, the Respondent alleges that the Claimants have only argued that part
of their investment was expropriated, which means that no expropriation took place if the

investment is analyzed in its entirety.***

437. Furthermore, the Respondent considers that the Claimants allege the expropriation of a right they
did not possess.**? The Respondent explains that the approval of Phase 2 was subject to the
MMA’s approval, and that the City of Jarabacoa has a level of discretion when deciding whether

to issue a “no objection” letter, which means that the development of the land was not an

automatic right the Claimants were entitled to.*”°

such right “does not exist under domestic law.”**? Second, DR-CAFTA Article 10.8 must be

interpreted in accordance with Annexes 10-B and 10-C.5%

439. Regarding indirect expropriation, Costa Rica advances that the Tribunal should read DR-CAFTA
Article 10.7 together with Annex 10-C. Costa Rica notes that Annex 10-C’s paragraph 4(b)
excludes measures of general application and State actions taken in relation to single investments
to enforce public welfare, safety, health, environmental and other legitimate objectives, pursuant
to the Contracting Parties’ agreement. This express desire must be granted a high relevance when
a tribunal has to decide on any indirect expropriation claim.*** Moreover, DR-CAFTA Article 10.7
reflects a customary international law standard as recognized by investment arbitral tribunals.*°°

The exercise of State police powers which are non-discriminatory and in good faith do not

constitute indirect expropriation. Under customary international law, the doctrine of police powers

comprehends a State’s right to enforce existing regulations with respect to an investor. °°

However, the State’s actions must be analyzed to see whether they are a bona fide exercise of

police powers.*””

or series of actions by a Party has an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without formal

transfer of title or outright seizure.”*”

DR-CAFTA Article 10.7 sets out the conditions for expropriation. If an expropriation does not
comply with the requirements set out in Article 10.7, it will be in breach thereof. When an action
is a bona fide, non-discriminatory regulation, it will not ordinarily be deemed expropriatory.
Accordingly, paragraph 4 of Annex 10-C provides guidelines for an action to be considered an
indirect expropriation. Although the analysis should be on a case-by-case basis, certain factors
are included, such as: (i) the economic impact of the governmental action; (ii) the extent to which
that action interferes with distinct, reasonable expectations; and (iii) the character of the

governmental action.”°!

The United States explains that the first factor, an adverse economic impact, does not establish an
indirect expropriation by itself. International law requires that the claimant demonstrate that the
governmental action at issue destroyed all, or virtually all, of the investment’s economic value,
or interfered with it to such an extent and so restrictively that one concludes that the property has
been taken from the owner.” The second factor requires an objective analysis of the
reasonableness of the claimant’s expectations, which may depend on the regulatory framework
existing while the property was acquired, in the particular sector in which the investment was

903

made.””* The third factor considers the nature and character of the governmental action, including

whether it was of a physical or regulatory nature.°*

A THE CLAIMANTS’ ARGUMENTS,

USD 37.5 million,” afterwards re-assed by their expert, Mr. Farrel, to total USD 35.5 million.°°°
Additionally, the Claimants are requesting that the Respondent be liable for moral damages in the

amount of USD 4 million, roughly equivalent to 10% of the Ballantine’s commercial damages.””

1. Direct Damages

444. The Claimants explain that the customary international law standard for the assessment of
damages caused by an unlawful act is set out in the Chorzéw Factory Permanent Court of

International Justice case,’ in which the tribunal noted that:
reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-
establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been

committed.°”

445. The Claimants additionally resort to the Metalclad award and the International Law

 

Commission’s (the “ILC”) Articles on State Responsibility to elaborate on the standard set out

by Chorzéw Factory and argue that damages should also be awarded based on any lost profits.°!

446. The Claimants contend that their investment suffered due to the Respondent’s measures.”!! As to
the Respondent’s argument that the Claimants fail to identify which damages result from which
treaty breaches, the Claimants explain, “the damages [...] do not depend on the specific violation

expectations, and confidence towards the economic prospects of Phase 2.°'* For this reason, the
Claimants hold that the damages requested are not based on a speculative claim but on historic
and economic facts resulting from their investment in Jamaca de Dios’ Phase 1.°'*
The Claimants claim that Mr. Farrel, the Claimants’ expert from Berkley Research Group,
calculated their monetary damages based on:
a. distributable cash flows from Phase 2 land;
b. distributable cash flows from the construction of luxury homes in Phase 2;
c. distributable cash flows from remaining lots in Phase 1;
d. expansion cost of the Aroma restaurant;
e. distributable cash flows from the Mountain Lodge;
f. distributable cash flows from the Apartment Complex;
g. distributable cash flows from the Phase 2 boutique hotel and spa;
h. distributable cash flows from development of the Paso Alto project;
i. loss of future investment and brand diminution;
j. loss of the value of the Phase 1 expropriated road; and
k. prejudgment interest compounded monthly.?'5
The Claimants clarify that the damages set out in Expert Reports of Mr. Farrell would be
“available to the Ballantines irrespective of how this Tribunal characterizes Respondent's
CAFTA-DR violations” °'°
The Claimants criticize the mitigation arguments made by Mr. Hart, the Respondent’s expert,
because such considerations would relate to a legal issue, rather than a question of quantum.°"”
Nevertheless, the Claimants assert that they had no duty to mitigate any loss because — observing
their alleged competitors — they reasonably believed to be allowed to develop.?"*
The Claimants advocate for the use of the discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method. Although the

method requires a certain degree of estimation, the Claimants allege that its primary inputs derive

from Phase 1.°'° Accordingly, the Claimants argue DCF is the best method to uphold the Chorzow

standard and wipe out the consequences derived from the Respondent’s unlawful acts.””°

(a) Lost Profits Due to Phase 2 Lot Sales and Construction

The Claimants assert that they would have been able to develop 70 lots in Phase 2 of Jamaca de
Dios, equivalent to 210,000 square meters.*”' The Claimants claim that Phase 2’s higher altitude
would have allowed them to request a higher price per square meter when compared to the Phase
1 lot sales.°” The Claimants add that they expected additional revenue due to the requirement on
Phase 2 lot purchasers to use the Claimants’ construction division.°”’ Mr. Farrell calculated the
net present value of the loss of Phase 2 lot sales to be USD 12,752,668, and the loss from the
Claimants’ construction division to be USD 5,044,625.°+

(b) Expansion Cost of Aroma de la Montajia Restaurant

The Claimants hold that they expanded the Aroma de la Montafia restaurant in anticipation of the
expansion of the Jamaca de Dios complex, and that if they had known that the permit would be

denied, they would have never expanded the restaurant.°?°

The Respondent objects to the Claimants’ claims for loss due to the Aroma de la Montaiia
restaurant because it belongs to Ms. Rachel Ballantine, who is not a party to the arbitration.°”°
However, the Claimants argue that since Ms. Rachel Ballantine issued a power of attorney to Mr.
Michael Ballantine to rep her o' hip interest in R Aroma de la Montajia,

E.LR.L., this would be an investment controlled by them and therefore covered under DR-

PCA Case No. 2016-17
Final Award
3 September, 2019

The Claimants request USD 1.2 million in compensation for the Aroma de la Montafia expansion

costs incurred.°°*

(c) Lots Profits for the Mountain Lodge and the Apartment Complex, and
Avoided Losses Related to the Boutique Hotel and the Spa

The Claimants affirm that they spent “significant time, effort, and money in developing plans for
the construction of three different multi-unit buildings” °° The Claimants’ intentions were to build
a mountain lodge, an apartment complex,?° and a boutique hotel with a spa, in Jamaca de Dios.°*!

While the Respondent states that the Claimants did not take any positive steps to undertake these

932

developments,’” the Claimants contend that they had produced plans for these expansions, and

even made certain permit requests with the Dominican authorities with showed these planned

developments.”

Mr. Farrell calculates that the non-construction of the boutique hotel saved the Claimants USD
475,164; while the Claimants suffered losses in relation to the other developments, equivalent to
USD 1,293,658 for the lack of sales related to the mountain lodge, USD 477,488 for lost profits
in operating the mountain lodge, USD 847,726 for the lack of sales related to the apartment

complex, and USD 302,419 for lost profits in operating the apartment complex.”™

(d) Lost Profits Associated with the Development of Paso Alto Project

The Claimants argue that they planned on purchasing and developing the Paso Alto project, but

that they did not move forward due to the Respondent’s measures.?*>

The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ damages requests based on the Paso Alto project because
the Claimants’ purchase option expired in April 2011, before the alleged DR-CAFTA breaches.”*°

have been resumed if the Respondent had issued the permit.**”

461. Mr. Farrell’s considers that the lost profits for the Claimants, as a result of the impossibility of

acquiring and developing Paso Alto, to be USD 4,233,081.°*

(e) Loss of Future Investment and Brand Diminution

462. The Claimants explain that their brand and future investment opportunities have been negatively
impacted, financially and reputational.°*? The Claimants reject the Respondent’s argument that

””940 and state that several real

any losses alleged from brand diminution are “pure conjecture’
estate owners had approached the Claimants enquiring as to the possibilities of developing joint
ventures.°4! Mr. Farrell calculates that the loss of future investment and brand diminution is equal

to USD 2,581,826."

monetary policy of the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic, to be compounded monthly.°*°

interest was the method most used by tribunals.”

2. Moral Damages

468. The Claimants argue that the Respondent’ acts have greatly harmed them beyond the economic

damages assessed, and that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to grant them a moral damages award.°*!

469. The Claimants rely on the Desert Line award to affirm that moral damages are appropriate
whenever emotional and mental anguish has been caused.”” The Claimants further invoke Article
31 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts, and its

commentary, to hold that monetary compensation would be an appropriate remedy for moral
damages caused to individuals.°**

of the moral damages they claim.”

B. THE RESPONDENT’S ARGUMENTS

471. The Respondent argues that the Claimants should not be awarded any damages because the
quantum of their claims is speculative, unsupported by evidence, and fails to consider principles

of causation, contributory fault, and mitigation.?*°

1. The Claimants Have the Burden of Proof for any Damages and They Have Failed to
Show Causation

472. The Respondent affirms that in order for the Claimants to be awarded any damages (i) there must
be a loss; (ii) the loss must be suffered by a claimant or its enterprise; and (iii) the loss must have
been caused by the alleged breach.°** The Respondent states that the Claimants have the burden

of proving each of these elements.°*’ Moreover, the damages have to be proven with a reasonable
degree of certainty, and therefore, they cannot be speculative, contingent, or merely possible.”**

473. The Respondent relies on the LG&E decision to argue that the Claimants have not identified each
of the injuries caused by each of the alleged measures.°° This would be an issue of causation:
whether the loss alleged has been caused by the treaty violations claimed.° The Respondent adds
that the causation analysis of the damages caused by expropriatory measures should differ from

that of damages caused by non-expropriatory measures.”°!

474. The Respondent further rejects the Claimants’ damages claim because the Claimants have not

provided any evidence that “but for” the alleged breaches, the Jamaca de Dios’ ventures would

have been successful.°° The Respondent argues that the Claimants’ damages claims and
calculations are unsupported: there is no relevant documentary support for the claimed historical
results, and the limited market data supplied was not directly relevant. The Respondent raises
in particular the failure by Mr. Farrell, the Claimants’ expert, to provide any documents or

information to show the basis of his calculations.“

The Respondent points out that the Claimants — when contending that the Dominican Republic
must compensate them for financially assessable harm — rely on authorities that require that
damages be proven with a reasonable degree of certainty to be recoverable.” Yet, the Respondent
states that the Claimants’ damages claims are based on the speculative assumption that — “but for”
the slopes or Baiguate National Park restrictions — the permit requested for Jamaca de Dios would
have been granted, and the Claimants would have secured profits from various different ventures

for over 25 years with only limited upfront capital investments.”

2. Each Head of Damages Should Be Rejected

Based on the above, the Respondent considers the Claimants’ allegations insufficient and falling
short of the burden imposed on them. The Claimants fail to identify the causal link between the
alleged breaches and the claimed damages.”” Nonetheless, the Respondent also denies each head

of damages in particular.°**

(a) The Appropriateness of the Claimants’ Calculation Approach

According to the Respondent, DCF is not an appropriate method for assessing the quantum

damages because it “can yield an unreliable conclusion as to value when key assumptions are not

disfavor the application of DCF when there is no principled basis for a lost profit assessment.°””

478. The Respondent contends that because several of the Claimants’ Projects were not going

investment amounts, which would reflect market value transactions.”

(b) Lost Profits Due to Project 3 Lot Sales and Construction

479. The Respondent holds that the Claimants are not entitled to any damages based on the alleged
future sales and construction of Project 3 — called Phase 2 by the Claimants.’”* The Respondent
states that these damages claims are speculative because the financial statements of Jamaca de

974

Dios and the Claimants show negligible profits,’’* and because the Claimants had no prior

experience successfully building homes for sale.°”°

480. In any event, the Respondent asserts that should the Tribunal grant the Claimants’ request under
the Project 3’s lost profits head of damages, relief should be granted only with respect to the

amount invested.*”*

(c) Expansion Costs of Aroma Restaurant

481. Regarding the expansion of the Aroma Restaurant, the Respondent contends that the Claimants
do not own or control Restaurante Aroma de la Montajfia E.LR.L. but rather it is solely owned by
Ms. Rachel Ballantine, who is not a party to the dispute.*”” The Respondent states that the power
of attorney granted to Mr. Michael Ballantine by Ms. Rachel Ballantine does not confer on him
ownership rights.*”* Thus, since the alleged damages to the Aroma Restaurant were suffered by a

third party, the Tribunal cannot award any damages in relation to it.””

482. Closely related to the Respondent’s assertion that the Claimants failed to carry their burden of
proof, the Respondent claims that the Claimants have not provided evidence that Aroma de la
Montafia has suffered any loss.°* Relying on the evidence provided by the Claimants, the
Respondent concludes that Aroma de la Montajia had an exponential growth, “almost doubling
its sales between 2012 and 2013, achieving 30% and 34% increases in net income in years 2013
and 2014, and an astonishing 217% increase in net income in 2015 as compared to 2014”°*!
Furthermore, the Respondent submits that the restaurant has been leased to a third-party operator
since June 11, 2015 through an agreement that guarantees the Claimants a USD 120,000 payment

per year, which would be more than 20 times the amount it was making before the expansion.°*?

483. In addition, the Respondent objects to any claims based on the costs incurred in expanding Aroma
de la Montaiia because the vast majority of these expenses were incurred after the Claimants

received the denial of the permit on September 12, 2011.°* The Respondent adds that the

Regarding the Claimants’ claims for lost profits related to the planned mountain lodge and
apartment complex, the Respondent notes that the Claimants have not provided any evidence of
prior experience building and operating such enterprises, and that no significant work was
performed in relation thereto.” Furthermore, the Respondent asserts that the Claimants did not
undertake any steps to obtain a permit for the apartment complex nor did they engage the MMA.

with regards to the mountain lodge.**°

(e) Lost Profits Associated With the Development of the Paso Alto Project

With respect to the lost profits allegedly resulting from the non-pursued Paso Alto project, the
Respondent states that the option to purchase the Paso Alto project was valid until April 18,
2011.°*’ Accordingly, the Respondent argues the Claimants’ decision not to pursue this venture is
unrelated to the denial of the permit, which was first notified to the Claimants on September 12,
2011.°88 The Respondent dismissed the Claimants’ assertion that the negotiations could have been
renewed and the purchase option extended, relying on the lack of documents indicating that
negotiations extended beyond March 2011.%* In any case, the profits from the Paso Alto project

would be speculative and so they could not be subject to compensation.”

(f) Loss of Future Investment and Brand Diminution

On the Claimants’ brand diminution claim, the Respondent states that these claims are based on

the assumption that — “but for” the Respondent’s actions — every 10 years the Claimants would

have acquired property elsewhere and developed additional projects similar to Project 2.°'
However, the Respondent notes that the Claimants merely provided the testimony of several
prospective partners for possible expansion.” The Respondent affirms that had the Claimants
wanted to move forward with these expansion projects, they could have done so since the

Respondent did not impair their ability to do it.°

As to the Claimants’ loss of future investment, the Respondent affirms it consists of residual
earnings on the mountain lodge, the apartment complex and the hotel, and thus — similarly to any

lost profits claims — considers it inappropriate to grant any damages due to lack of certainty.°™*

(g) Claims Related to the Expropriated Road

In relation to the Claimants’ claim due to the expropriated road, the Respondent notes that the
Claimants had no authorization to build the Phase 2 road and were fined accordingly.°” The
principle ex turpi causa non oritur actio would bar them from recovering damages for the Phase

2 road, which the Respondent asserts that the Claimants never built.°°°

As to the Phase | road, the Respondent states that it was not expropriated, but rather automatically
ceded to the public domain, as happens to developments that are submitted to the process of
urbanizacién parcelaria under Dominican law.” Moreover, the Respondent claims that the
Claimants would have no standing to request damages for such road, since they sold off all their
lots in Jamaca de Dios, and indeed would have recouped the costs of the Phase | road from such

sales.°*

(h) Prejudgment Interest

The Respondent argues that the application of an interest rate provided by the Dominican Central

Bank for Dominican Pesos is not appropriate for an award requested in U.S. Dollars, and in any

event the 5.5% interest rate proposed by the Claimant is disproportionate compared to the interest

rates ordered by other investment arbitration tribunals during the last 10 years.”

491. Moreover, the Respondent considers that an interest award compounded monthly would be
unsupported, and overcompensate the Claimants.' Mr. Hart, the Respondent’s expert, explains
that for monthly compounding to be appropriate a claimant must provide evidence of depositing
every month all their profits in an investment vehicle returning 5.5%.'°! Since such evidence has

not been provided, compound interest cannot be awarded.'"

3. Moral Damages

492. The Respondent contends that behind the moral damages claim, the Claimants are seeking

punitive damages which are not recognized under DR-CAFTA Article 10.26.3.!°

493. In any case, the Respondent states that the Claimants are not entitled to moral damages because
they are only awarded in exceptional cases, and relies on the decisions of several tribunals to that

effect.!° The Respondent relies in particular in the Lemire decision,'° which held that

[M]Joral damages [are] not available to a party injured by the wrongful acts of a State, but
moral damages can be awarded in exceptional cases, provided that:

[1] the State’s actions imply physical threat, illegal detention or other analogous situations in
which the ill-treatment contravenes the norms according to which civilized nations are
expected to act;

[2] the State’s actions cause a deterioration of health, stress, anxiety, other mental suffering
such as humiliation, shame and degradation, or loss of reputation, credit and social position
[to the claimant]; and

[3] both [the] cause and effect [of these actions] are grave or substantial. !%

494. The Respondent notes that while the Claimants allege they feared government retribution, it

would be unclear what that feared retribution was, or how the harm caused by the government or

relies on the incident with the Palo Blanco people regarding the road, to demonstrate that the
police intervened in favor of the Claimants, apprehending the individuals threatening Mr. Michael
Ballantine and affording him protection in the form of a restraining order, through the national

courts!

495. The Respondent asserts that while the Claimants present themselves as victims of a Dominican
government bent on boycotting their investment, in fact the Claimants attacked the Dominican
Republic and its officials by using the present arbitration and negative publicity campaigns in the

local media to falsely suggest that corrupt acts were committed.!°

4, The Duty to Mitigate Damages

496. In addition, the Respondent states that the Claimants have contributed to, or have failed to

mitigate, the losses they claim to have suffered.'°!° The Respondent argues that lack of mitigation

or the willful or negligent contribution to the harm affect a claimant’s entitlement to damages. '°"!

The Respondent adds that the reasonable steps to be taken to reduce the loss are a question of
fact, rather than of law.!°!?

to the injury, in relation to Aroma de la Montajia’s expansion,'°'* the continuous acquisition of

land for Project 3,!°'* and the performance of work related to the Project 3 road.'°!5

arbitration-related counsel; (iii) USD 491,898.57 in expert fees and expenses; and

(iv) USD 131,682.21 in additional arbitration expenses. '°!8

Since the Claimants allege that the Respondent’s officials acted in a targeted and corrupt manner
with respect to the Claimants, they assert that the Tribunal should order the Respondent to pay all

of the Claimants’ costs and fees in this Arbitration.'°!°

THE RESPONDENT’S ARGUMENTS

The Respondent claims that it has incurred a total of USD 3,631,570.82, and DOP 2,874,522.29

fees; and (iv) USD 7,670.00 and DOP 2,874,522.29 in other expenses.'°”°

TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS ON WHETHER THE CLAIMANTS ARE INVESTORS OF A

CONTRACTING PARTY AS PROVIDED BY DR-CAFTA

503.

504.

505.

506.

507.

508.

This dispute was brought by the Ballantines, in accordance with DR-CAFTA and the UNCITRAL
Rules. As to the applicable law, the Tribunal recalls that Article 35(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules
establishes that “[t]he arbitral tribunal shall apply the rules of law designated by the parties as

applicable to the substance of the dispute.” (Emphasis added)
In addition, DR-CAFTA Article 10.22 (“Governing Law’) indicates the following:

Subject to paragraph 3, when a claim is submitted under Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(A) or Article
10.16.1(b)(i)(A), the tribunal shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this

Agreement and applicable rules of international law. (Emphasis added)

The Claimants submitted their claims under DR-CAFTA Articles 10.16.1(a) and 10.16.1(b) on

  

their own behalf. The Claimants alleged in their Notice of Arbitration that the Respondent
breached its obligations under Section A of DR-CAFTA Chapter 10.'°” Therefore, pursuant to
Article 10.22, the Tribunal shall base its analysis both on the DR-CAFTA and the applicable rules

of international law.

BURDEN OF PROOF

The Tribunal notes that DR-CAFTA Chapter 10 does not contain any provision addressing the
issue of the burden of proof in an investment dispute that may arise in accordance with its

provisions.

Article 27(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, applicable to this case, establishes that “[e]ach party shall
have the burden of proving the facts relied on to support its claim or defence”. This provision
embodies the principle onus probandi actori incumbit, which is widely recognized and applied

by international tribunals.'°?3

The tribunal in AAPL v. Sri Lanka qualified this principle as an “established international law
rule”, and added that “[a] Party having the burden of proof must not only bring evidence in support
of his allegations, but must also convince the Tribunal of their truth, lest they be disregarded for

want, or insufficiency, or proof”.'°**

1023 Tokios Tokelés v. Ukraine, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Award, (July 26, 2007), § 121. The tribunal stated that
“[t]he burden of demonstrating the impact of the state action indisputably rests on the Claimant. The principle of

onus probandi actori incumbit — that a claimant bears the burden of proving its claims

 

is widely recognized in

practice before international tribunals.”

1024 Asian Agricultural Products LTD (AAPL) v. Republic of Sri Lanka, {CSID Case No. ARB/87/12, Final Award,

140

PCA Case No. 2016-17

509. At the jurisdictional level and in the context of the DR-CAFTA, the tribunal in Pac Rim LLC v.
El Salvador considered that “the Claimant has to prove that the Tribunal has jurisdiction” and “if
there are positive objections to jurisdiction, the burden lies on the Party presenting those
objections, in other words, here the Respondent” .'> The tribunal in Berkowitz v. Costa Rica also
expressly referred to Article 27(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules and considered that “the accepted

principle in international proceedings, at least at a level of generality, is that the burden rests in

the first instance with the party advancing the proposition or adducing the evidence.”'°*°

510. Thus, the Tribunal concurs with the general approach followed by other DR-CAFTA tribunals and
agrees with the tribunal’s opinion in Pac Rim LLC vy. El Salvador that “it is not bound to accept
the facts necessary to support or deny jurisdiction as alleged by the Claimant and the Respondent
respectively, that the Claimant has the burden to prove facts necessary to establish jurisdiction
(as it positively asserts); and that the Respondent has the burden to prove that its positive

objections to jurisdiction are well-founded.”'°”".

B. GENERAL STANDARD OF INTERPRETATION

511. According to the general rule of interpretation set forth in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties (“WCLT”), which regulates the Tribunal’s interpretative

exercise, “[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning

to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose” \°*

proof upon the claimant), the Tribunal explained that “(t]he term actor in the principle onus probandi actori
incumbit is not to be taken to mean the plaintiff from the procedural standpoint, but the real claimant in view of
the issues involved [...] Hence, with regard to ‘proof of individual allegations advanced by the parties in the course

of the burden of proof rests upon the party alleging the fact ”” (Emphasis added).

Salvador also referred to Chevron Corporation (USA) and Texaco Petroleum Company (USA). v. The Republic of
Ecuador as follows: “[a]s a general rule, the holder of a right raising a claim on the basis of that right in legal
proceedings bears the burden of proof for all elements required for the claim. However, an exception to this rule
occurs when a respondent raises a defense to the effect that the claim is precluded despite the normal conditions
being met. In that case, the respondent must assume the burden of proof for the elements necessary for the
exception to be allowed.” Chevron v. Ecuador, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 34877, Interim Award, (December 1,
2008), 4 138.

PCA Case No. 2016-17
Final Award
3 September, 2019

Therefore, the Tribunal begins its analysis with the text of two relevant provisions for the present

dispute: DR-CAFTA Articles 10.16 and 10.28.

Article 10.16 specifies who is entitled to submit a claim to arbitration, i.e. the “claimant”, as well
as the way in which it is entitled to do so (“on its own behalf” or “on behalf of an enterprise of
the respondent [...] that the claimant owns or controls directly or indirectly”). This provision
makes clear that in order to bring an investment dispute under DR-CAFTA a claimant must

exist.

Article 10.28 defines “claimant” as “an investor of a Party that is a party to an investment dispute
with another Party” (Emphasis added). The concept “investor of a Party” is also defined by this
provision as follows:
a national or an enterprise of a Party, that attempts to make, is making, or has made an
investment in the territory of another Party; provided, however, that a natural person who is

a dual national shall be deemed to be exclusively a national of the State of his or her dominant
and effective nationality. (Emphasis added)

The definition comprises, in its relevant part, several requirements that must be fulfilled for a
national or an enterprise to be an investor and in turn, a claimant: (i) a national or an enterprise
of a DR-CAFTA Contracting Party must exist, (ii) such national or enterprise shall “attempt[] to
make, [be] making, or [have] made an investment”, and (iii) the investment must be located “in
the territory of another” DR-CAFTA Contracting Party (Emphasis added). The concept of
“national” is particularly fundamental for the application of an investment chapter and has a
bearing on the issue of jurisdiction. In cases where an individual is a dual national, DR-CAFTA
Article 10.28 establishes which rule must be followed to determine the relevant nationality and

consequently, whether a covered investor exists for the purpose of dispute settlement:

a natural person who is a dual national shall be deemed to be exclusively a national of the
State of his or her dominant and effective nationality. (Emphasis added)

  

The Parties have argued extensively their respective positions. In the Tribunal’s opinion, being
the Claimants’ dual nationals of the Dominican Republic and the United States, this dispute poses
two fundamental questions that inform each other: (i) what are the relevant times in which an
individual shall comply with the nationality requirement?, and (ii) what is the legal standard under

DR-CAFTA to determine dominant and effective nationality. The answer to both questions forms

interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their

"context" and in the light of the treaty’s "object" and "purpose'

. See Plama Consortium Limited v, Republic of

Bulgaria, \CSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on Jurisdiction, (February 8, 2005), {| 117.

1029 DR-CAFTA Article 10.1 complements this provision, stating that Chapter 10 applies to measures adopted or
maintained by a Party relating to: (a) investors of another Party and (b) covered investments. The term “covered
investment” is defined in Article 2.1 as “an investment, as defined in Article 10.28 (Definitions), in its territory of
an investor of another Party”. (Emphasis added).

142

PCA Case No. 2016-17

the basis to determine if the Claimants, in the dispute before us, are covered investors under DR-
CAFTA. First, we will develop both questions and then we will proceed to apply the legal standard

to the facts of the case.

1. Relevant Times for the Compliance of the Nationality Requirement

516. The Claimants argue that, based on Article 10.28, the Tribunal “need only look at the nationality

of the Ballantines as of the time that they made their investment in the Dominican Republic.”
Moreover, they contend that they have “at all times been dominantly and effectively U.S. citizens
[...] from their birth until today”.'°° The Respondent on the other hand, considers that “the
Ballantines (who are dual nationals of the Dominican Republic and the United States) must
demonstrate that, on 11 September 2014 (i.e., the date of their Notice of Arbitration and Statement
of Claim), their dominant and effective nationality was their U.S. nationality”.'°*' Furthermore,

“to establish that consent to arbitration exi

 

s, the Ballantines must prove that their U.S
nationality was their dominant and effective nationality at the time of the alleged State conduct

underlying their claims.”'°?

517. The Parties do not disagree on whether DR-CAFTA Article 10.28 and the phrase “that attempts

to make, is making, or has made an investment in the territory of another Party” is of a disjunctive
nature.'°’ Instead, the disagreement revolves around whether the dual-nationality requirement is
relevant at one particular time, or in other words, whether it should be assessed only in relation

to one of those options in order to qualify as an investor.

518. The Tribunal is of the view that, taking into consideration the rule of interpretation under the

VCLT, Article 10.28 cannot be interpreted in isolation from other provisions that provide a context
specific to DR-CAFTA as to whether there are relevant times in which a potential investor must
comply with the nationality requirement (in the case of the present dispute, in accordance with
the dual-nationality rule). As a starting point the Tribunal recalls the scope and coverage of DR-
CAFTA Chapter 10, which is limited to measures related to investors of another Party, thus
creating obligations strictly linked to that definition.'°“* Consequently, the term “investor” and to

which Party that investor belongs is determinant for the applicability of said chapter. If there is

10§ By definition, the dual-nationality rule pretends to exclude claims brought against a host State when the
dominant and effective nationality of the investor is the one of the host State since in that case there would be no
investment or attempt to invest in the territory of another Party. The term “covered investment” as defined in
Article 2.1 also limits the applicability of this chapter.

no measure relating to an investor of another Party then there is no obligation and thus there can

be no treaty breach.

We recall that the relevant provision indicates that investor of a Contracting Party means “a
national” and thereafter includes the type of actions that may be conducted by such national.
There is a distinction between both even though the two constitute elements that must be fulfilled
to qualify as an investor. The phrase that follows thereafter clarifies what must be understood by
national in the case of dual-nationality, however, the language used does not restrict the time in
which the condition of nationality should be borne, i.e. it does not establish that investor means a
national or an enterprise of a Party which bears such condition when attempting to make, making

or having made an investment.

The terminology used in Section B of Chapter 10 provides a useful context to our interpretation
that the text does not limit the nationality condition to the actions allowed in relation to an
investment in order to come within the scope of Chapter 10. The section begins by referring in
Article 10.15 to the terms “claimant” and “respondent”. “Claimant” is defined as “an investor of

a Party that is a party to an investment dispute with another Party.”'®° (Emphasis added) The

 

incorporation of the specific term “investor of a Party” to the definition of “claimant” provides a

link between what is an investor of a Contracting Party and what is consequently a claimant.

The fact that the necessary requirements for a natural person to be an investor of a Contracting
Party (i.e. (i) the existence of a national, (ii) who has conducted a specific action (attempts to
make, is making, or has made an investment), (iii) in the territory of another Party) are indeed
incorporated in the definition of a claimant would logically suggest that they should be complied
with at the moment of an investment dispute. The Tribunal observes as well that in order to be a

claimant, an investment dispute must also exist.

The moment in which an investment dispute arises depends upon the facts and special
circumstances of each case. However, DR-CAFTA Article 10.15 “Consultation and Negotiation”
presumes the existence of such dispute before the submission of a claim as both parties “should
initially seek to resolve the dispute” through those means. In any event, DR-CAFTA Article 10.16

makes clear that a claimant must exist at the moment of submission of a claim!***. In accordance

105 “Respondent” is defined as “the Party that is a party to an investment dispute”.

1036 DR-CAFTA, Art. 10.16 (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration), Exhibit R-10 (“1. In the event that a disputing
party considers that an investment dispute cannot be settled by consultation and negotiation: (a) the claimant, on
its own behalf, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim [...]; and (b) the claimant, on behalf of an
enterprise of the respondent that is a juridical person that the claimant owns or controls directly or indirectly, may
submit to arbitration under this Section a claim{...].”).

with paragraph 4 and the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, this means the moment the notice of

arbitration along with the statement of claim is received by the respondent.

DR-CAFTA Articles 10.17 and 10.18 on consent reinforce two related issues. First, consent to
arbitration is provided when submission of a claim is made “in accordance” with the treaty. This
means that the requirements examined above (such as the nationality condition) must be complied
with for jurisdiction to exist upon the arbitration. Second, the three-year limit to submit a claim
also provides context of the existence of another relevant time in which the nationality condition
must be fulfilled, i.e. the date in which knowledge of the breach is or should have been acquired.
This is so since, for a respondent to breach an obligation under Chapter 10, Section A, the
measures adopted or maintained must relate once again to “investors” of another Party. In light
of the definition for “investor of a Party”, it is clear that the measures taken by the host State

should not refer to one of its nationals.

In the context of DR-CAFTA’s jurisprudence, the tribunal in Pac Rim Cayman LLC vy. El Salvador
considered that “for the purpose of this Ratione Temporis issue, what CAFTA requires is not that
the investor should bear the nationality of one of the Parties before its investment was made, but
that such nationality should exist prior to the alleged breach of CAFTA by the other Party” and
therefore concluded that it needed to determine the moment when the parties’ dispute arose in

order to establish if the claimant’s nationality was present at the “relevant time” !°""

The text of DR-CAFTA Article 10.28 together with the aforementioned provisions indicate that
the nationality condition as part of the investor qualification is not only relevant at the moment
the investment was made and therefore, such assessment should not be made only in reference to
that time. Although we are also aware that other investment tribunals have addressed the principle
of continuous national identity, in order to solve this matter, this Tribunal is only called upon to
determine whether the Claimants qualified as investors as of the date in which the claim was
submitted to arbitration as well as of the date of the alleged breach, as relevant times. The
existence of an investor, necessarily includes the nationality condition in order for the State to

have been subject to an obligation as well as for a claimant to exist.

The Tribunal finds instructive for its interpretation, the written submissions of other DR-CAFTA

Parties pursuant to Article 10.20.2. The United States indicated that in order to submit a claim, an

District et al. v. United Mexican States, a NAFTA case involving a similar provision defining the term “investor
of a Party”, the tribunal considered that some claimants met the nationality requirement since they were nationals
of the United States and afterwards turned to the question of whether they sought to make, were making or had
made an investment. Bayview v. United Mexican States, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/1, Award, (June 19, 2007),

investor must be an investor of a Contracting Party other than the respondent Party. The United
States further stated that “if the investor is a natural person, and that person had the dominant and
effective nationality of the respondent Party at the time of submission of the claim, then the
investor would not be, at that time, a party to a dispute with another Party.” On the other hand,
Costa Rica refers in its submission to the conditions and limitations on consent and points that
according to Article 10.18, “the Tribunal, when confronted with a set of facts, will have to answer
one main question: What is the date on which the claimant first acquired knowledge of the breach

that is being alleged?”'** (Emphasis in original)

In view of this, the Tribunal does not consider that the examination of dominant and effective
nationality should be circumscribed to the moment the investment was made. The analysis of DR-
CAFTA provisions referred to above indicates that compliance with this requirement is
fundamental at the moment the claim was submitted, in this case, September 11, 2014 and at the
moment of the alleged breach, which, according to the facts of the case and in light of Article
10.18, allegedly took place starting from 2011, when the Claimants were naturalized as
Dominicans. For the Tribunal, the above critical dates provides temporal context in which the

terms of Article 10.28 shall be interpreted in accordance with the VCLT.

Having determined the relevant times to assess the nationality of the Claimants, we proceed now

to analyze the dual-nationality legal standard provided by DR-CAFTA.

2. Dominant and Effective Nationality Standard under DR-CAFTA

As analyzed in the preceding section, DR-CAFTA Article 10.28 expressly provides a rule on dual-
nationality according to which a natural person “shall be deemed to be exclusively a national of
the State of his or her dominant and effective nationality”. Although there is no express reference
made to customary international law in this provision, the inclusion of the phrase “dominant and
effective nationality” clearly suggests the application of a concept that has been used in the context

of customary international law.'° However, before addressing the specific issue before us, the

1038 Submission of the United States, 4 3. The United States also indicates that “the claimant also must be “an
investor of a Party” other than the respondent Party at the time of the purported breach [...] Where the requisite
nationality does not exist at the operative times set out above, the respondent Party has not consented to the
submission of a claim to arbitration at the outset, and the tribunal therefore lacks jurisdiction ab initio under Article
10.17”. It also refers to Article 10.18.1 and its view that “a claimant must prove the necessary and relevant facts
to establish that each of its claims falls within the three-year limitations period”. See Submission of the United
States, 4-5, 8; and Article 10.1 of DR-CAFTA.

Tribunal considers important to make certain preliminary observations regarding the

circumstances of this case.

(a) Preliminary Considerations

530. At the outset, the Tribunal notes that this is a case of first impression related to dual-nationality

531.

provisions in the context of DR-CAFTA. First, the relevant provision seems to presuppose that
in cases of dual-nationality there will be one that will be dominant and effective over the other,
ie., ultimately there will be one answer. Second, the language used allows dual-nationality and
claims by dual nationals so long as their dominant and effective nationality is not that of the host
State. This is confirmed by the inclusion of the phrases: “another Party” as well as “deemed to
be exclusively” in conjunction with the adjectives “dominant and effective”. Third, the treaty does
not prescribe the factors that may be considered to determine dominance and effectiveness.
Fourth, the Tribunal should take guidance from customary international law, taking into account
Article 10.28 particular context, within DR-CAFTA’s general object and purpose. This follows
from Article 10.22 providing that: “the Tribunal shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance
with this Agreement and applicable rules of international law”. (Emphasis added) In turn, this
necessarily entails first, giving effect to the specific context provided for in this instrument as well
as its object and purpose; second, giving effect to the customary rules of international law “as an

applicable rule of international law”.

On this matter, the Tribunal deems appropriate to make certain observations. Unlike substantive
provisions such as, Articles 10.5 (Minimum Standard of Treatment), 10.6 (Treatment in Case of
Strife) or 10.7.1 (Expropriation) '“!, which contain an express reference to customary
international law, the definition in Article 10.28 does not contain such a reference. Nevertheless,
the Tribunal has no doubt that the expression “dominant and effective” is rooted on customary

international law.

532. The Tribunal notes that the Parties have extensively argued on the application of the dominant

1041

1042

and effective standard under customary international law. On one hand, the Claimants indicated
that: “CAFTA-DR does not provide a defined test”, “reference to international law is appropriate
to aid the Tribunal's evaluation of this issue” and that “decisions of the US-Iran Claims Tribunal
provide guidance in describing factors that may be considered in evaluating which of two
nationalities should be deemed ‘dominant’.”'°? (Emphasis added) The Claimants also stated that:

“the decisions from the US-Claims Tribunal [...] relate to an entirely different set of circumstances

See DR-CAFTA, Annexes 10-B and 10-C.

and arise under an entirely different treaty [...] [al/though the [Iran-]U.S. Claims Tribunal cases
are [sic] instructive and can be a guide in some parts, these cases do not obviously control or
provide a precedent in this case. Thus, given the absence of examination of this issue under
CAFTA-DR by other tribunals, this is essentially a case of first impression” '°" (Emphasis added)
On the other hand, the Respondent has argued that “the Tribunal must assess ‘applicable rules of
international law’ since DR-CAFTA does not articulate any standard for determining the

dominant and effective nationality”'°“ (Emphasis added). Neither of the other DR-CAFTA

 

Parties provided its views to the Tribunal on this issue.

Moreover, the inclusion of this phrase on an investment chapter within the broader framework of
a Free Trade Agreement imbues that phrase with a specific meaning. Analyzing the terms of
Article 10.28 without consideration of the context that surrounds it would imply disregarding the
general rule of interpretation that we must apply under the VCLT. The Tribunal considers that the
factors developed under customary international law cases are instructive, although such factors
reflect an interpretation developed in a specific period of time and under different circumstances
from the ones present in this case, i.e. a dual nationality case related to investment protection
provided for in a specific treaty, i.e. DR-CAFTA. In view of this, and while we do take due
consideration of the factors analyzed in prior cases, the Tribunal deems it appropriate to give
specific meaning to the terms used in DR-CAFTA rather than directly incorporating any other
standard, which would disregard the rules of interpretation that we are bound to apply under the

VCLT.

Finally, this case presents a unique fact pattern. Usually, when dealing with nationality issues,
investment tribunals are confronted with the question of whether an investor acquired nationality
in order to gain access and protection through a treaty. However, this case deals with the question
of whether the Claimants — who acquired in addition to their U.S. nationality, the citizenship of
the host State before submitting their claim — “lost” their right to access this mechanism because
they were dominant and effective nationals of the respondent State at the time of the alleged

breach and the submission of their claim.

(b) The Meaning of Dominant and Effective under DR-CAFTA

According to the rule of treaty interpretation established in the VCLT, we begin our analysis with
the text of DR-CAFTA Article 10.28. This provision qualifies the word “nationality” by virtue of

the adjectives “dominant” and “effective”. The use of the connector “and” would indicate that a

148

PCA Case No. 2016-17

nationality has to be both dominant and effective for a natural person to qualify as an investor of
a Contracting Party. The meaning of the word “dominant” means “commanding, controlling, or
prevailing over all others; very important, powerfil, or successful; overlooking and commanding
Jrom a superior position; of, relating to, or exerting ecological or genetic dominance; being the
one of a pair of bodily structures that is the more effective or predominant in action.”!* The

meaning of the word “effective” means “producing a decided, decisive, or desired effect;

 

impressive, striking; being in effect: operative; actual; ready for service or action.”' In

addition, “nationality” is defined as “national character’; “national status specifically: a legal

relationship involving allegiance on the part of an individual and usually protection on the part

of the state; membership in a particular nation” .'°"

536. The Claimants have referred to “strength”!™*, “connections” and “closeness” within the context
of the determination of dominant and effective nationality.'* Although they refer to the dominant
and effective determination, the Claimants’ arguments seem to focus on the concept of dominance
and do not provide clear argumentation on whether these concepts are different or should be
understood as the same.'°° The Respondent has indicated that “effective nationality” refers to
“whether there is a genuine connection between a person and each State of nationality” and that
such an issue is not in play since “the Dominican Republic does not dispute the Ballantines have
a genuine connection with the United States, and there should be no question (given the factors

discussed below) that the Ballantines also have a genuine connection to the Dominican

Republic” .!°°! Moreover, the Respondent has asserted that “dominant nationality” is a question of

“which connection is stronger” or with which country the Claimants are more closely aligned. !°

DR-CAFTA Article 10.28 presupposes the existence of a bond between a natural person and two
countries by virtue of the nationality each one has bestowed upon such individual, i.e. the
existence of that connection is not doubted, it exists. However, for a claimant to be considered as
such, that connection to the non-host State must be of a certain type: it must be dominant and

effective.

The Tribunal agrees that the word “dominant” conveys the notion of strength and precedence of
one thing over another and that closeness between an individual and a State can indicate such
attributes. In turn, closeness with a State and the strength of a nationality bond, could be the result
of several factors in play such as the time spent by the individual in that country, family and

personal work, ic or financial yt i.e. acluster
of elements that make up the life of an individual and that define several connections to a
particular State. We understand “dominance” as referring to the degree or magnitude in which
such connections are stronger than the connections that could have also been built by the

individual in relation to another State that has also bestowed its nationality.

The word “effective” on the other hand seems to refer to something that produces a specific effect,
something that is actually operative or functioning. We understand this concept as requiring this
nationality bond to go beyond a formality with no apparent further effect, to be of substance rather
than merely declaratory. An individual can possess a second nationality but this would not
necessarily mean that such nationality is effective if, for instance, it has never been exercised; if
the individual has never presented himself or herself as a national of that country; if he or she
never visited that country; if he or she holds no personal or professional connection to that
country; or if he or she has never complied with obligations or exercised rights as national of that
country. There must be significance in the fact that Article 10.28 does not simply require
nationality to exist, it requires that nationality complies with two specific qualities that should be

different from the existence of that legal bond.

This does not necessarily imply that the legal standard to assess dominance and effectiveness
should be different or that criteria used to determine if nationality is dominant would be useless
to determine effectiveness. According to the text, the standard is one: “dominant and effective
nationality” and in order to comply with it those two elements must be met. For example, an

individual may hold two nationalities with only one being dominant and effective in view of the

105! Statement of Defense, §] 27.
1052 Statement of Defense, §j 28.

150

fact that the second one has never been exercised or been operational. There could be other cases
in which both nationalities are effective if the individual exercises both of them, presents himself
or herself as national of both countries, complies with both sets of obligations. However only one
of them has to be strong enough so as to take precedence over the legal bond of that same
individual with the other country. It does not seem to be a matter of extinguishing one bond in
favor of another. This is what makes the assessment of determining which nationality is “dominant

and effective” more challenging.

541. Given the fact that Article 10.28 does not provide more guidance for interpreting the meaning of
“dominant and effective” nor on the criteria for such an analysis, the Tribunal, in conformity with
Article 10.22 of DR-CAFTA and Article 31.3(c) of the VCLT, will also explore customary
international law as “other relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between

the Parties”.

(c) Dominance and Effectiveness in the Context of Customary International Law

542. In the area of investment disputes, customary international law on dual-nationality has been
touched upon but the Tribunal considers that such precedents are distinguishable to the case before
us, either because (i) the relevant provision was different than the one contained in DR-CAFTA'™?

or (ii) the factual scenario was different,!°™ or (iii) both.!°5

case is not based on a bar on claims from dual-nationals but on dual-nationality itself.

a Party that was not the Respondent State: The claimant possessed dual-nationality, however, access to arbitral
jurisdiction rested on nationality and not on its dominance and effectiveness. Moreover, none of Mr. Olguin’s
nationalities were that of the host or respondent State.

absence of an explicit rule in the BIT on dual nationality, the tribunal rejected the application of customary
international rules on diplomatic protection to BIT’s in general and to the specific BIT at issue, and thus rejected
the application of the dominant and effective nationality test. This award was partially annulled by the Paris Court
for lack of jurisdiction ratione materiae. However, the Paris Court held that the tribunal had jurisdiction ratione

PCA Case No. 2016-17
Final Award
3 September, 2019

Recently, the tribunal in David R. Aven v. Costa Rica considered the text of Article 10.28 of DR-
CAFTA in the context of its determination of whether the nationality of a dual citizen (of one of
the signatories to the DR-CAFTA) was “effective”, as well as his purpose for initially representing
himself as Italian.'°° However, that tribunal expressly stated that the fact pattern in that case
“[did] not trigger Article 10.28’s mechanism for dealing with dual nationals”'®*’, due to the fact
that the dispute did not involve, as in our case, a claimant who possessed nationalities of two

Contracting Parties to DR-CAFTA.

Although, as mentioned above, dual-nationality has been addressed in the context of investment
arbitration, the Tribunal does not find support as to the meaning of “dominant and effective”

nationality that would allow us to use such precedents as guidance for the dispute before us.

Regarding customary international law and, specifically, in the context of diplomatic protection,
dual-nationality was addressed by the ICJ in the Nottebohm Case, even though the case itself did
not deal with dual-nationality. That case does not use the terminology “dominant and effective”
nationality as Article 10.28 of DR-CAFTA but “real and effective”. The main question to be
decided in Nottebohm was whether the nationality granted to an individual by one State was
binding or enforceable vis a vis a third State, in the context of diplomatic protection. !°*
Nottebohm does not deal with the concept of “dominant nationality”. Nevertheless, the ICJ
reference to certain principles as applied by arbitrators “for determining whether full international
effect was to be attributed to the nationality invoked”'*, which were lately recognized by

international tribunals as relevant criteria to decide dual nationality issues.

In addition, the Italian — United States Conciliation Commission, in the Mergé case, referred to
“the principle of effective” as “dominant nationality” and seemed to equate both concepts while
stating “effective nationality does not mean only the existence of a real bond, but means also the
prevalence of that nationality over the other, by virtue of facts which exist in the case”.'°© On its
part, the Iran — United States Claims Tribunal, in dealing with dominant and effective nationality

expressed that: “the relevant rule of international law which the Tribunal may take into account

1957 David R. Aven and Others v. Republic of Costa Rica, 1\CSID Case No. UNCT/15/3, Award, (September 18,
2018), | 215. The tribunal in Aven did not dissect and apply Article 10.28. However, it did apply directly the
Nottebohm test as it considered it incorporated by reference. For the reasons already expressed, this Tribunal
disagrees to the extent this suggests that the same test directly applies to Article 10.28.

[...] is the rule that flows from the dictum of Nottebohm, the rule of real and effective nationality,
and the search for ‘stronger factual ties between the person concerned and one of the States whose

nationality was involved” °°!

547. The Tribunal is persuaded that customary international law has developed and crystalized relevant
factors to determine, in cases dealing with dual nationality, which is the dominant and effective

one. Next, the Tribunal will deal with those factors.

(d) Factors to be Considered in Assessing “Dominant and Effective” Nationality

548. As to the criteria developed by other tribunals to assess dual nationality cases', the ICJ

recognized that:

“{d]ifferent factors are taken into consideration, and their importance will vary from one case
to the next: the habitual residence of the individual concerned is an important factor, but there
are other factors such as the centre of his interests, his family ties, his in public
life, attachment shown by him for a given country and inculcated in his children, etc.”!°°
(Emphasis added)

 

549. The Court also recognized that these elements do not constitute an exhaustive list of factors. In
the same vein, in the Mergé case, the Italian - United States Conciliation Commission stated: “[i]n
order to establish the prevalence of the United States nationality in individual cases, habitual
residence can be one of the criteria of evaluation, but not the only one. The conduct of the
individual in his economic, social, political, civic and family life, as well as closer and more

effective bond with one of the two states must be considered” .'°4

550. Following the above precedents, the Iran — United States Claims Commission decided that “in
determining the dominant and effective nationality, the Tribunal will consider all relevant factors,

including habitual residence, center of interests, family ties, participation in public life and other

evidence of attachment.” °°

In reference to the critical dates in which dominant and effective nationality should be assessed,
the Italian — United States Commission has determined that “[t]he question of dual nationality
obviously arises only in cases where the claimant was in possession of both nationalities at the
time the damage occurred and during the whole period comprised between the date of the
Armistice (September 3, 1943) and the date of the coming into force of the Treaty of Peace
(September 15, 1947)?! The Iran — United States Claims Commission has adopted identical
criteria concerning relevant factors to be considered from the date in which the claim arose and

January 19, 1981.'0°7

Overall, the decisions referred above indicate the need to examine the connections and the
closeness of the bond that an individual has with two countries by virtue of the nationalities held
at a pre-determined relevant time. As indicated in Procedural Order No. 2, we consider “the State
of habitual residence, the circumstances in which the second nationality was acquired, the
individual’s personal attachment for a particular country, and the center of the person’s
economic, social and family life” as relevant for our analysis.'°°* Such elements seem to be

pertinent to discern both dominance and effectiveness.

(e) The Specific Context of DR-CAFTA for the “Dominant and Effective
Nationality” Test

Chapter 10 of DR-CAFTA protects “investments” and “investors” by providing standards of

treatment and allowing recourse in cases of breach by the host State. Its scope is limited to both

fundamental concepts.'° “Substantially increasing investment opportunities in the territories of

the Parties” is one of the objectives of DR-CAFTA, this is reinforced by the resolve stated by the
Parties in the Preamble to “[e]nsure a predictable commercial framework for business planning
and investment”. The fact that the application of Chapter 10 and the obligations enshrined therein
depend on the existence of “investors” and “covered investments”, and in particular, on
nationality in order to possess the condition of an investor has great meaning. Nationality (and in

the case of dual nationals, dominant and effective nationality) is interrelated to the concept of

investor. There will be no investor within the meaning of Chapter 10 if there is no (dominant and

effective) foreign national.

In this regard, the Tribunal considers that the investment itself, the status of investor as well as
other circumstances surrounding those elements may be relevant factors for assessing nationality
and its dominance and effectiveness within Article 10.28 of DR-CAFTA. A tribunal may need to
examine any factor that may help discern those attributes, for example, the conduct of a particular
State towards the investor, how the investor presented himself or herself, or the reason underlying

the investor’s decision to apply for naturalization.

The Tribunal is of the view that a claimant’s entire life is relevant but not dispositive when
assessing whether nationality is dominant and effective. '°” In cases dealing with double
nationality (with one acquired after the other), it would most likely be evident that a person that
was born and lived in a particular country during a long period of his or her life will have many

attachments, connections and closeness with that country.

For these reasons, a holistic assessment must be performed in order to discern which nationality
was dominant and effective at the relevant time considering all the facts of the case. Taking into
account a claimant’s entire life within the analysis of dominance and effectiveness at a particular
time does not necessarily entail ascribing more weight to one nationality over the other due to the
amount of time each of them has been held. Rather an analysis should be performed to examine
how, at that particular time, the connections to both States could be characterized in terms of

dominance and effectiveness.

According to Article 10.28 of DR-CAFTA, the Tribunal must then determine if at the time of the
alleged breach and ultimately at the time of the submission of the claim, the Claimants’ U.S
nationality was dominant and effective or if their Dominican nationality fulfilled those attributes,
ie. if it was strong enough to take precedence over their U.S. nationality and it was producing
effects or was operative during the relevant time in order to determine whether they were investors

under DR-CAFTA.

APPLICATION OF THE LEGAL STANDARD TO THE FACTS OF THE CASE

The Claimants have argued that they qualified as investors at the moment of the submission of
the claim since they were at all times dominantly and effectively U.S citizens “from their birth
until today”.'°" Overall, the Claimants have taken into account the following factors in support

of their contention: (i) the center of gravity of their contacts, relationships, and commitments, (ii)

their place of birth, (iii) the place where the majority of their lives was spent, (iv) the place of
their permanent residence, (v) their personal and professional relationships and (vi) the origin of
the capital for their investment.'®” In the Tribunal’s opinion, none of those factors exclusively
indicate that a particular nationality was dominant and effective. On the contrary and as mentioned
above, a holistic exercise must be performed in order to discern whether all the relevant factors
analyzed indicate that a specific nationality was effective'”” (i.e. actually operative and producing
effects) as well as dominant (strong enough to take precedence over the other). Although the
factors related to the life of the Claimants before they moved and invested in the Dominican
Republic are relevant, they should be analyzed with a view to determining their connection with

the Dominican Republic and the United States at the relevant times.

559. The Tribunal considers that the factors mentioned by the Parties can be analyzed within the criteria

indicated in Procedural Order No. 2, i.e. (a) habitual residence, (b) the individual’s personal
attachment for a particular country, (c) the center of the person’s economic, social and family life,
and (d) the circumstances in which the second nationality was acquired, bearing in mind the
specific context of this dispute. Additionally, we are called upon to examine the nationality of
each Claimant, Mr. and Ms. Ballantine. While the evaluation must be made in relation to each of
them, the Tribunal considers that it can be addressed in the specific section of each criterion
making the distinction when necessary. We turn now to our examination of the criteria mentioned

above in light of the facts of the case.

1. Habitual Residence

560. Within this factor, the Tribunal addresses some criteria which the Parties have discussed in their

submissions and that relate to each other: In particular: (i) the place of birth, (ii) the place where
the majority of the Claimants’ lives were spent, and (iii) permanent residence. The Tribunal

observes that this factor was considered as an “important factor”! in Nottebohm, and that while

vary from one case to the other.

there had been “no prolonged residence in that country” and “[n]o intention of settling there was

shown” 1075

Place of birth. The place of birth is not contested. The Claimants were born in the United States.
We note that this factor relates to others put forward by the Claimants in order to indicate that
their closeness to the U.S. was stronger when submitting their claim. We see nothing that would
indicate that, particularly in cases involving acquired double nationality, this factor has a special
bearing over other factors in order to determine which nationality is dominant and effective at any

critical date.

Place where the majority of their lives was spent. The Claimants were born in the United States.
They also lived in the Dominican Republic for a year in 2000 while working as missionaries and
continued to visit the country each year after they returned to the United States in 2001 '°"°;
afterwards, they moved to the Dominican Republic in August 2006.'°”’ From 2006 to the moment
the claim was submitted, the Ballantines lived in the Dominican Republic. While this represents
a significant period of time, overall, the Claimants had spent up to that moment the majority of
their lives in the United States. The Tribunal considers that the fact that the Claimants spent the
majority of their lives in the U.S. evidences that such nationality was exercised. The Tribunal is
also aware that during that time span the Claimants created significant connections as a natural
consequence of living in their county of birth, connections related to their way of living, personal
and professional as well as economic. However, the determination of “dominant and effective”
may not be reduced to a mathematical “day counting” exercise. A further examination is required
in order to conclude that such connections remained stronger, at a particular relevant point in time.
Place of permanent residence. The Claimants moved to the Dominican Republic in August 2006.
The Tribunal notes that, initially, the Claimants characterized such move as “permanent”.!°
According to the witness statement of Ms. Ballantine, the Claimants sold two of their homes and
commercial real estate in the United States.'"” The Claimants were permanent residents since
2006, however, Mr. Ballantine testified at the hearing that he was first a temporary resident and

that by 2008 both he and his wife were permanent residents.'°*° Regardless of this discrepancy,

the stream of events not only reflects a change in residence made by the Claimants, but also a
change in the status of such residence to legally reflect permanency. The Tribunal views a

permanent residence as a decision to settle in a specific place, as a long-standing decision.

564. The Claimants have argued that they continuously maintained at least one residence and
sometimes two in the United States.'°*! It seems clear to the Tribunal that during the period of
time that the Claimants lived in the Dominican Republic there was no attempt to renounce
completely to residential connections in the United States since a fair amount of time was also
spent in such country. Nevertheless, this standard does not seem to require renouncement of one
nationality over the other. This does suggest however that the Claimants continued maintaining
connections to the United States despite their permanent residence being officially in the

Dominican Republic.

565. As to the amount of time spent in each country, Mr. Ballantine clarified in his witness statement
the number of days that Ms. Ballantine spent outside the Dominican Republic from 2010 to 2014
and from those days how many were spent in the U.S. From this examination, it seems that in
2010 and 2011 most of Ms. Ballantine’s days were spent in the United States while in 2012, 2013
and 2014 she spent more days in the Dominican Republic. Overall, the majority of her days
between 2010 and 2014 were spent in the Dominican Republic. On the other hand, Mr. Ballantine
indicated that he “travelled just slightly less [...] but he joined [Lisa] on almost every return to
the United States” .!°*? We consider that if Mr. Ballantine travelled less, then most likely he would
have spent at least the same amount of days in the Dominican Republic as Ms. Ballantine over

the same period.

Exhibit R-16 also contains a sworn statement indicating the Claimants’ residence in the Dominican Republic. The
Tribunal notes as well that according to the Digest of United States Practice in International Law 1991-1999,
published by the International Law Institute under agreement with the United States Department of State, Office
of the Legal Adviser, residence and other voluntary associations are important factors for the “dominant and
effective” nationality determination: “These tests should be used to determine the dominant, effective nationality
of the applicant in question. The primary question to be asked is what nationality is indicated by the applicant’s
residence or other voluntary associations. A second question is whether the applicant has manifested an intention
to be a national of one of the two States, while also seeking to avoid or terminate nationality in the other. Of these
two questions, the former will ordinarily be the more important”. (Emphasis added), Exhibit RLA-10, p. 36.

81 Reply Memorial, § 37.

vos Witness of Michael Ballantine, 4 21. ding to this information, in 2010 Ms.
Ballantine spent 101 days in the Dominican Republic, 145 days in the United States and 119 in other places. In
2011 she spent a close amount of days both in the Dominican Republic and in the United States, 159 in the former
and 162 in the latter, as well as 44 days in other places. In 2012, she spent 192 days in the Dominican Republic,
98 days in the United States and 75 days in other places. In 2013 she spent 238 days in the Dominican Republic
and 127 in the United States. In 2014 she spent 213 days in the Dominican Republic, 109 in the United States and
43 days in other places.

 

158

PCA Case No. 2016-17
Final Award
3 September, 2019

566. Although the number of days spent in each country may confirm that the Claimants split
significant amounts of time between two countries and consequently resided at times in both
countries, their legal status, at least from 2008 until the moment they became Dominican nationals

in 2010! was as permanent residents of the Dominican Republic and being nationals from 2010

 

 

to 2014, most of their time was spent in that country. We view this evidence as confirming the
legal status the Claimants voluntarily chose to acquire. Consequently, although the Claimants
maintained ties with the United States, their permanent residence at the relevant time was centered

in the Dominican Republic.

2. The Individual’s Personal Attachment for a Particular Country

567. Personal and professional relationships. As mentioned above, the Tribunal is aware that the
majority of the Claimants’ lives was spent in the United States, which consequently would entail
deep connections of different types. The Claimants argue that certain factors such as education or
religion should be taken into account in order to determine that their dominant and effective

nationality was of the United States.'°*

568. The Claimants were educated in the United States. They further argue that although two of their
children attended school in Jarabacoa, they did so at an American school. The Tribunal does not
view the fact that the Claimants’ children attended a school in Jarabacoa as a fact necessarily
indicating that the Claimants’ dominant and effective nationality was Dominican.'*** This would
seem to be a decision logically derived from the fact that the Claimants’ residence changed. The
fact that the school their children attended was American could indicate their intention to maintain
their children closer to the U.S. in terms of language, education and relations within the new
community they were already integrating to. Mr. Ballantine has asserted that their children
“attended an American school [...] The classes are taught predominantly in English by United
States citizen teachers. All of our children have primarily pursued their education in the United
States” and Ms. Ballantine has indicated that “we [...] enrolled our children in the new American
school. This would give us the opportunity to work there and to give the kids consistency with

their education”.'°*° The Claimants have also stated that they attended an American church'°*’

1083 The Claimants have indicated that they obtained the Dominican nationality in 2010. According to Exhibit R-
18, such nationality was approved by Presidential Decree No. 931-09 issued on December 30, 2009.

and that their home was not a Dominican home in which English was the language spoken at all

times, !°88

Whilst this may have been the case and it certainly could indicate a desire to keep connections
with the United States and their sentiment of belonging, the Claimants did move to and lived in
the Dominican Republic for a significant period of time, eight years up to the moment their claim
was submitted. They started a business there (in the case of Ms. Ballantine she established a
factory for her non-profit organization) which they conducted for that period of time and it would
be difficult to consider that they did not integrate into the Dominican community during that time
without making personal and professional relations of some type. Ms. Ballantine has indicated
that she had personal connections in the Dominican Republic although limited! and Mr.
Ballantine has indicated personal and professional connections as well.’ The Tribunal also notes
that while requesting the Tribunal to assess moral damages the Claimants not only contend that
they were forced to abandon the “efforts of ten years of hard work” but also that “they were forced
to sell their home and leave their friends and colleagues in_the Dominican Republic” .'°'
(Emphasis added)

Mr. Ballantine has expressed that “we developed a deep love and passion for the people and
culture of this beautiful island”'°”? and
I can’t deny that I have sentiment for the Dominican Republic and there was good
experiences and, you know, that there was positive things in the Dominican Republic. It

wasn’t like it was all conspiracy and bad and evil. There was good times and, you know,
there’s some very nice people. So, I can’t deny that.!°

Ms. Ballantine has expressed as well that they “/ove the Dominican Republic, it is [their] country,
[she is] Dominican now and [they] invest[ed] everything here and [they] feel like a pain, like
rejection”.'°* For the Tribunal these elements indicate personal attachment for the Dominican
Republic. However, there seems to be some contradiction with other statements provided by the

Claimants in this regard. Ms. Ballantine has indicated that her “cultural connection to the

[Dominican Republic] was limited”'° and Mr. Ballantine stated that they “did very little to even

try to assimilate with Dominican culture”,'°* “I did not integrate with the culture. I was an

investor”,'” “[t]here’s some relationships, some people I still keep in contact with. But there's

nothing cultural that’s been enduring whatsoever.”!°°8

572. The Claimants have provided evidence from the years 2012 to 2014 in which they state: “[t]hey

really have no idea how their perpetual actions, and threats has devastated us and our desire to
continue in their country [...] I cannot wait to get out of this place”, “I haven't really made
friends here in the DR. It is a difficult culture to connect with and [I] am still an outsider [...] I

am pretty lonely.”!'

573. The Tribunal considers that the Claimants had personal connections or attachment to both the

United States and the Dominican Republic during the relevant period. We are aware that the extent
of such connections is difficult to measure objectively, particularly to the extent there have been
some contradictory statements. In terms of professional relations, the Claimants seem to have
been more connected to the Dominican Republic by virtue of their investment, however, it appears
to this Tribunal that, although the Claimants had personal and professional attachments to the

Dominican Republic, the attachments to the U.S. seem to be of equal force.

mention within the jurisdictional issue that the “entirety of the capital [...] initially invested in

to maintain financial connections to the United States.'!°?

According to the facts and evidence presented before this Tribunal, the Claimants have financial
connections to both the United States and the Dominican Republic. Regarding the U.S., they both
maintained a checking account, Mr. Ballantine maintained an individual retirement account, Ms.

Ballantine established a non-profit organization named Filter Pure, Inc and they established

another non-profit organization named Jesus For All Nations, even though the purpose of this
non-profit entity was to distribute innovative water filters throughout the Dominican Republic
and Haiti.!!* In the case of the Dominican Republic Mr. Ballantine maintained also accounts in
Dominican banks, both had saving accounts and accounts related to Jamaca de Dios, and a factory
was established in relation to Ms. Ballantine’s non-profit organization.''™ Regarding the origin
of the capital initially invested, we do not consider such factor has a lot of weight since the capital

was invested to create Jamaca de Dios.

576. Regarding where the center of the Claimants economic, social and family life was, this Tribunal
is of the view that during the relevant time such center was in the Dominican Republic. According
to the facts of the case, the Claimants moved to the Dominican Republic in 2006 and made a
significant investment creating Jamaca de Dios, a luxury residential community; in order to do
this, they sold two of their homes and commercial real estate!!’. Therefore, the reason for moving
to the Dominican Republic was to establish Jamaca de Dios" and although they maintained
connections to the United States, it seems to the Tribunal that from 2006 to the moment the claim
was submitted, the Claimants had moved or relocated their economic center and their family
center to the country where they resided permanently, independently of the fact that they often
visited the United States, that their children continued their education in the U.S or that they kept

social relations in the U.S. The fact is that the Claimants established what appeared to be their

1107

“main” business in the Dominican Republic''®’ and reorganized their way of living in the

Dominican Republic for several years around the investment. In consequence, this Tribunal is of

the view that the Dominican Republic was the center of their economic, family and social life,

despite maintaining ties with the U.S.

Although Ms. Ballantine indicated that the original plan was to manage the investment from
Chicago but that they realized the project would need more direct oversight,!'* they moved to
Jarabacoa because of the investment. She characterized Mr. Ballantines work as “/argely in the
DR” while hers “/argely outside the DR.”''® The Tribunal is aware that Ms. Ballantine’s non-
profit organization resulted in her traveling more often, however, she still resided permanently in
the Dominican Republic, established a factory there and most of her days were spent in that
country. She also stated that in the Dominican Republic, she worked and partnered with local
NGOs and was responsible for raising money and distributing filters manufactured in the factory
established therein and that she helped administer the Jamaca de Dios Foundation.''!° All of these
elements support our conclusion that the center of the Claimants’ economic, social and family life
was in the Dominican Republic, a connection stronger to the one maintained with respect to the

U.S throughout the relevant times.

4. Naturalization

The Claimants voluntarily acquired, through naturalization, the Dominican nationality on
December 30, 2009.'!"! In addition, they made the relevant citizenship requests for two of their
children, for whom they stated formally to the authorities: “[w]e want the Dominican citizenship
to be granted to them as well since they comply with all the requirements according to the Law
and we feel very identified with the sentiment and Dominican customs since we have had a close
bond of coexistence and respect”.!'" The Tribunal notes that a similar statement was provided in

relation to the Claimants’ naturalization process!!!

In Nottebohm, the ICJ took the view that naturalization, as opposed to other factors which it

considered merely illustrative, would always be a relevant factor. Hence, it considered that

“[nJaturalization is not a matter to be taken lightly. To seek and to obtain it is not something that
happens frequently in the life of a human being”."''* We agree with this last statement.
Naturalization is an important event in a person’s life. It creates a particular bond to a country
that certainly has legal consequences, and thus, should not be taken lightly. In this case, the ICJ
asserted the “profound significance” and “the serious character” of such procedure and took into
account within its examination that “naturalization was not based on any real prior connection
with Liechtenstein, nor did it in any way alter the manner of life of the person upon whom it was
conferred”.'''> Furthermore, it considered that:
[iJn order to appraise its international effect, it is impossible to disregard the circumstances

in which it was conferred, the serious character which attaches to it, the real and effective,
and not merely the verbal preference of the individual seeking it.!"" (Emphasis added)

  

This would, in fact, suggest that naturalization is also a key component to be analyzed within the
dominant and effective nationality test. The Tribunal observes that in Nottebohm, naturalization
was understood as involving “breaking of a bond of allegiance and [the] establishment of a new
bond of allegiance”. This does not seem to be expected or foreseen by DR-CAFTA. If that were
the case, the dominant and effective nationality test would not serve its purpose in the event that
an individual possessed two nationalities, one acquired after the other one. This would be the case
since a “breaking of allegiance” would actually imply the existence of only one nationality, the
nationality with respect to which a new bond of allegiance is established. As mentioned above,
dual nationality does not seem to be a matter of extinguishing one bond in favor of another but of

assessing the qualities that characterize those bonds in terms of strength and effectiveness.

5. The Reason to be Naturalized as Dominicans

The Claimants have asserted that they applied to be naturalized in order to protect their investment
and avoid discrimination.!!!’ In his witness statement, Mr. Ballantine indicated the decision to
naturalized as Dominicans was made for “asset protection’"'!'*, to “protect our investment and to

minimize government obstruction, as well as any perceived biases in the market”.!'"° In her

witness statement, Ms. Ballantine indicates her reason for becoming a Dominican Republic
citizen was “to protect our investment in case of our demise. I was concerned that our children
could lose the entire investment if were we to die”.''?° During the hearing, Mr. Ballantine was
asked the reason for taking the decision to become a national of the Dominican Republic, to which

he responded:

Yes. Primarily, at that time I thought that I owned a very valuable piece of property in the
mountains of the Dominican Republic. And I felt very insecure, in case of my demise or my
wife’s, what would happen through an arbitrary court ruling or my children having to pick
up the pieces, and I thought that it might help protect our estate. Secondly, I felt like it was
important for a business decision in order for the commercial aspects. There were oftentimes
people that wouldn’t buy from me, for example, because they didn’t think that I was
committed and they were afraid to buy from a gringo and they would feel more comfortable.
And so I lost sales. It was a very simple process. There was no renunciation of anything. I
lost nothing as a United States citizen, and I just simply became a Dominican citizen. And
from my understanding, I gained no other right other than the right to vote. And so that was-
- it_was only-- had to do with ics and it had to do with estate I did not

integrate with the culture. I was an investor. And we spent most of our time, as much as
possible, away.!!2! (Emphasis added)

 

The Tribunal considers this criterion is directly related to the objective of investment protection.
As already mentioned, we agree with the tribunal in Nottebohm in that “[n]aturalization is not a
matter to be taken lightly. To seek and to obtain it is not something that happens frequently in the
life of a human being”.''” Naturalization is an important event. A serious event with legal
consequences that should not be taken slackly. It appears that the Claimants’ understanding on
naturalization was different. This would seem evident from Mr. Ballantine’s statement above
regarding what Dominican nationality entailed. Furthermore, the Claimants took this step for two
of their children.'!?3 However, that same step did not seem to have the same connotation for the

Claimants either.'!**

Naturalization bestows an individual with a set of rights and obligations and creates a particular
bond between the individual and the State. In this Tribunal’s view, naturalization should not be
equated to the purchase of a good or service. Regardless of this, the naturalization by the
Claimants as Dominicans produced effects and altered their condition as only U.S. nationals

during a period relevant for the application of DR-CAFTA Chapter 10. As mentioned above,

114 At the hearing, Mr. Ballantine expressed the following in response to the question of whether his children were
naturalized: “My two oldest were not. My two youngest were--were on their way out, and I said, ‘Hey, do you
guys want to become Dominican too? I can get you a passport for a souvenir.’ That’s all it was. There was no
commitment. It was just like, ‘Hey, you guys can have a passport too, because we're Dominicans.’ That was the
extent of the conversation, like, ‘Yeah, I’ll take one.’ That was it.” Hearing Transcript, Day 2, 480 (English).

Chapter 10 protects foreign “investments” and “investors”. It is not designed nor meant to be
applied to citizens of the host State, at least not when their dominant and effective nationality is
that of the host State. Therefore, this Tribunal finds relevant the fact that the main reason for the

Claimants to acquire a second nationality was the investment directly related to this proceeding.

Whilst the Claimants have mentioned that discriminatory treatment was one of the reasons for
becoming Dominican, the Claimants have expressed that their motives were for protection of the
investment, as a business decision for commercial aspects, an economic decision. The sole reason
for becoming Dominican and domestic investors was the investment. The Tribunal finds trouble
reconciling the fact that the Claimants’ desire was to be viewed as Dominicans for purposes of
bolstering their investment and yet, regarding the application of the protections designed for

foreign investors, they contend such nationality is not as important.

6. Conduct of the Host State and Other Authorities

The Claimants have also argued that a relevant factor is how the United States and the Dominican
Republic viewed them. Particularly, the Claimants consider the fact that U.S. diplomatic officials
advocated on their behalf as evidence of their dominant and effective nationality.!'?° We do not
consider this is the case. In the Tribunal’s opinion, the actions of diplomatic officials do not imply
that an assessment was made as to which nationality is dominant and effective. This is particularly
true when there is no evidence that authorities knew or could have known that the person involved

had another nationality.

In this regard, we note that in its submission under Article 10.20.2, the United States actually
indicated that: “it does not take a position in this submission on how the interpretation offered
below applies to the facts of this case, and no inference should be drawn from the absence of
comment on any issue not addressed below.”!'** It also indicated that “where U.S. embassies or
consulates provide facilitative assistance to U.S. nationals abroad in connection with disputes
between those nationals and other countries, such officials typically do not make a legal
determination with respect to a dual national’s dominant and effective nationality in order to
provide such assistance.”''”’ As to the Respondent, this Tribunal considers that the involvement
of agencies in charge of foreign investment do not equate to a determination of dominant and

effective nationality. In the Tribunal’s opinion the evidence does not indicate that U.S. Embassy

officials or officials in the agency responsible for foreign i in Domini ic were

aware of the Claimants’ dual nationality.

As mentioned above, the dual nationality test does not require a person to renounce their
citizenship and it would seem that officials treated them as foreign investors when they presented
themselves that way. Regarding the consequences prescribed in Dominican domestic law, which
may result in a person losing such citizenship, we do not view such factor as relevant to determine

the effectiveness and dominance of such a bond. The fact is that the bond exists.!!°

7. How the Claimants Presented Themselves

The Ballantines presented as evidence the contracts from the lot sales in Phase | of Jamaca de
Dios.''° They contend that a more compelling fact regarding those sales is that every lot sale was
conducted in U.S. dollars. The Tribunal does not consider this fact to be as compelling as the
Claimants do in terms of nationality. Particularly since a fair amount of the contracts indicate “or
its equivalent in RD” after the price of sale is determined in U.S. dollars. The Tribunal could also
locate a small amount of contracts in which quantities in Dominican Republic Pesos were

established.''*°

The Exhibit presented by the Claimants contains contracts certified by a public notary. From those
contracts, the Tribunal could identify 77 specific contracts signed by Mr. Ballantine in
representation of “Jamaca de Dios Jarabacoa, C. por A.” Those contracts were not signed by Mr.
Ballantine in a personal capacity, but on behalf of the company (i.e. the investment) as president.
The Tribunal observes that in those contracts, Mr. Ballantine identifies himself as national of both
the United States and the Dominican Republic in five cases, as Dominican in 41 and as U.S
national in 31. Moreover, from those 31 contracts 19 were signed in the years 2006-2009 before
the Claimant had gone through the process of naturalization, therefore, there was only one
nationality that he could present: the American. In the rest of the contracts, he presented himself
as U.S. national even though he had already acquired the Dominican nationality, i.e. in 12

contracts signed mostly in 2010 and 2011 and one in 2013.

On the other hand, the contracts in which Mr. Ballantine identified himself as Dominican, were

signed between 2010 and 2015, i.e. Mr. Ballantine continued to present himself as Dominican

even after the claim was submitted. The Respondent also presented evidence in this regard,!'*! in
which the number of contracts signed by Mr. Ballantine as Dominican is also higher. We consider
this evidence to be relevant in showing his Dominican nationality prevailed over the times he

presented himself as U.S national in formal acts directly related to the investment.

Regarding Ms. Ballantine, the evidence presented does not involve her directly since the contracts
were signed by Mr. Ballantine as president of Jamaca de Dios. Mr. Ballantine’s actions seem to
confirm his statements regarding the investment being the reason to apply for naturalization as
Dominican and it would appear to have been a conscious decision of both Claimants as addressed
below. Therefore, the Tribunal is not fully convinced that the fact that Ms. Ballantine did not sign
contracts necessarily means that she did not apply for Dominican naturalization for the investment

or that it was not a business decision for Jamaca de Dios which involved her.

Another way in which the Claimants have presented themselves in terms of nationality is through
the use of the official document issued by each State to attest for the nationality of its citizens,
that is, through the use of their passport. The Respondent presented the Claimants’ migration
records for the years 2010 to 2014.''? According to those records, the Claimants entered to the
Dominican Republic mostly as nationals by way of their Dominican passport and exited the
country with their American passport.

Although the Claimants have argued that the Dominican passport was not used when travelling

internationally, but only when entering the Dominican Republic,''*

we recall that nationality
establishes a legal connection between a State and a person. The Tribunal takes note that Mr.
Ballantine’s view on the Dominican passport itself, expressed in the hearing, differs. At the

hearing, Mr. Ballantine indicated:

The only travel benefit that we ever received was--which is the same right afforded to a
resident--is that I pay a $10 entrance tax or be penalized for staying in the country too long.
But that same right is given to residents as well... Yes. We saved $10. You’re correct.!!+

Dominican records show that only on two and three occasions, did Mr. and Ms. Ballantine,
respectively, enter the Dominican Republic as Americans. In 25 and 30 occasions they entered
with their Dominican passports, respectively. On the other hand, they exited the country more

often as Americans on 21 and 30 occasions. The numbers seem closely even, which suggests the

151 Table of Nationalities Used in Jamaca de Dios Sales Contracts, Exhibit R-290. This Table appears to have
been elaborated based on the contracts presented in R-209. Although the table includes cases in which Mr.
Ballantine presented himself only as U.S national, as well as both Dominican and American, the numbers are
significantly lower than the ones presented according to Exhibit C-162.

Claimants’ intention to be recognized as Dominicans when entering the country as well as
Americans when leaving the country towards the United States. This line of thinking would not
change the fact that they represented themselves more often as Dominicans before the Dominican
authorities. We do not consider the fact that such representation was being made so to speak

“domestically” to be less valid.!'*°

The Tribunal also considers relevant the fact that the Claimants presented themselves as nationals,
e.g. when voting.''° The Claimants have argued that this fact does not support that their
Dominican nationality was dominant since they also voted in the U.S. elections in 2014.'7 The
Tribunal agrees that the evidence presented on this factor does not reflect a preference for
Dominican nationality, however, it does not consider that it reflects preference for the American

nationality either.

The Claimants have also argued that “afier the Ballantines became naturalized Dominican

citizens, they applied [to] have Jamaca de Dios registered as a foreign ii under the

 

 

Dominican Foreign h Law 16-95.”''*8 (Emphasis in original) However, such procedure
was not completed.''? The Claimants contend that they were “awaiting approval of their Phase
2 permitting request” but that their application confirms their intention “to return the anticipated
profits [...] to the United States, their dominant nationality”. We do not consider these facts to
evidence that the Claimants’ request relates to their perception of the United States as their
dominant and effective nationality. The facts of the case indicate that although they submitted
such request, the procedure was never completed, which could also prove a point regarding

Dominican nationality contrary to the Claimants’ assertions.

CONCLUSION

Having analyzed the evidence and arguments put forward by the Parties, while this Tribunal
cannot deny the fact that during the relevant period, the Claimants maintained connections to the
United States and this also seems natural from the fact that they were born and lived in that country
for the majority of their lives, in this Tribunal’s opinion, during the relevant period the Dominican

nationality was effective and took precedence over the American nationality. Although the

1135 According to the exhibits submitted, Mr. Ballantine also presented himself as Dominican before a local court
as Claimant in a domestic procedure. See Hearing Minutes, La Vega Tribunal de Tierras (September 12, 2013),

Claimants maintained residential connections to the United States, their permanent residence was
in the Dominican Republic, overall, most of their days from 2010 to 2014 were spent in the
Dominican Republic, they changed their status to permanent residents and later to Dominican

citizens.

While their personal and professional relations to the Dominican Republic may have been limited,
it is difficult to deny that during that period of time their investment kept them economically
centered in the Dominican Republic. In the case of Ms. Ballantine, although she managed her
non-profit organization and travelled more, she still was resident and established herself in the
Dominican Republic. Both of the Claimants continued with their life in the Dominican Republic.
Moreover, both of them voluntarily decided to change their status of permanent residents to a
status of nationals because of the investment, whether such decision may have entailed different
consequences in their mind, they decided to change their status to be viewed as Dominicans and
treated as Dominicans. They presented themselves as Dominicans. That nationality was key to

their business.''“°

In sum, the Claimants’ motivation for taking on the Dominican nationality was said to be
economic and commercial in nature, for their business and the substantial investment they had
made. During that relevant period of time, they lived, ran a business and accepted to be viewed
as Dominicans. Nationality was not forced upon them, it was requested''*! and accepted by them.
It is not the intention of this Tribunal to assert that the Claimants ceased to be Americans or that
they did not have connections to that country. As already indicated, acquired dual-nationality is

not about renouncing one nationality or ceasing to have connections with one’s country of origin.

Thus, the Tribunal considers that their Dominican nationality took precedence during the relevant
times, i.e., at the time the alleged measures were taken and at the time of the submissions of the
claim. Therefore, the Claimants do not qualify as investors of a Contracting Party in accordance

to the definition set forth in Article 10.28 of DR-CAFTA.

COSTS

The Parties’ respective positions on costs are summarized in Section IX. Each Party requested the
Tribunal to order the other Party to pay all the costs and fees related to this dispute.

Pursuant to Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal will first fix the costs of the
arbitration and later proceed to apportion those costs between the Parties, in accordance with

Article 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules.

FIXING THE COSTS OF THE ARBITRATION

Article 40(2)(a) and (b) of the UNCITRAL Rules states that the fees and expenses of the arbitral
tribunal must be stated separately as to each arbitrator and fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance

with Article 41.

The fees of Ms. Marney Cheek, co-arbitrator amount to USD 110,962.50 and her expenses amount
to USD 386.37.

The fees of Prof. Raul Emilio Vinuesa, co-arbitrator, amount to USD 196,687.50 and his expenses
amount to USD 9,779.68.

The fees of Prof. Ricardo Ramirez Hernandez, presiding arbitrator, amount to USD 244,070.60
(plus VAT USD 38,541.30) and his expenses amount to USD 5,629.48.

The costs of other tribunal expenses, including the costs of ICSID facilities for the Hearing, court
reporting in both English and Spanish, simultaneous interpretation, audio and video technicians,
live broadcasting of the Hearing, catering, translation, telecommunication, bank charges, printing
and courier charges, and others total USD 169,796.13.

PCA fees amount to USD 108,980.36 and its expenses amount to USD 10,073.45.

Each Party paid advances on costs to the PCA in the amount of USD 450,000, i.e. a total advance
of USD 900,000. The unexpended balance of the deposit amounts to USD 5,092.59.

In accordance with Article 10.19(2) DR-CAFTA, the Secretary-General of ICSID acted as
appointing authority and the fees incurred in this regard amount to USD 10,000. This fee was paid
by the Claimants.

Based on the sum of the above figures the total costs of the arbitration amount to USD 904,907.41.
As for the Parties’ respective costs of legal representation and expert assistance, the Claimants’
affirm that their costs amount to USD 1,424,852.70 in legal fees and expenses for its arbitration-

related counsel; USD 491,898.57 in expert fees and expenses; and USD 131,682.21 in additional

expenses.

The Respondent, in turn, affirms that its costs related to this arbitration amount to USD
2,611,371.56 in legal fees and expenses for its counsel, Arnold & Porter; USD 562,529.26 in
expert fees; and USD 7,670.00 and DOP 2,874,522.29 in additional expenses.

Considering the complexity of this proceeding, the novel issues of fact and law that have arisen
in its context, and other relevant circumstances, the Tribunal determines that the Parties’ costs are

reasonable in accordance with Article 40(2)(e) the UNCITRAL Rules.

APPORTIONING THE COSTS OF THE ARBITRATION

The Claimants argue that the Respondent should pay all the costs and fees of the Arbitration based
on the way the Respondent’s officials acted.''? In particular, the Claimants argue that the
Respondent’s officials “took deliberate actions to harm the Ballantines’ investment through a

barrage of discriminatory, arbitration, and expropriatory measures.” |" In addition, the

 

 

Claimants contend that the R dent’s Admissibility ission raised costs and

that the Claimants should not bear the costs of defending against it.'"4

On the other hand, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal must grant the Respondent all of the
costs of the proceeding, as well as legal fees and expenses, as the Claimants’ claims lack
jurisdiction and/or merits.''45 The Respondent explains that “[o]ther relevant factors also militate
in favor of an award of costs and legal fees to the Dominican Republic, including: the fact that
the Ballantines do not qualify as “claimants”; the fact that their claims are substantively
meritless; and the Ballantines ‘litigation style, which has caused unnecessary expenditures for the
Dominican Republic (as for instance due to the Ballantines’ constantly changing argumentation;
their reformulation of the facts in each round of pleadings; and their willful omissions during

document production.).”!"*°

As already noted by the Tribunal, this dispute was brought by the Claimants in accordance with
DR-CAFTA and the UNCITRAL Rules.

Pursuant to DR-CAFTA Article 10.26 (“Awards”), a tribunal may award costs and attorney’s fees

in accordance with Section B and the applicable arbitration rules.

619. DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.6 (“Conduct of the Arbitration”) provides:

When it decides a respondent’s objection under paragraph 4 or 5, the tribunal may, if
warranted, award to the prevailing disputing party reasonable costs and attorney’s fees
incurred in submitting or opposing the objection. In determining whether such an award is
warranted, the tribunal shall consider whether either the claimant’s claim or the respondent’s
objection was frivolous, and shall provide the disputing parties a reasonable opportunity to
comment.

620. Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides:

The costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party or parties.
However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it
determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the
case.

 

621. The Tribunal notes that these provisions do share a common feature: they grant the Tribunal with

discretion to allocate costs and fees between the Parties.

622. In light of the above cited provisions, such discretion is qualified, first, by the determination of
whether an award on costs is warranted, the claimant’s claim is frivolous, and secondly, by the

consideration of the particular circumstances of the dispute.''” In relation to the latter, other

1148, 1149

tribunals have taken into account: the complexity''* and novelty!” of the issues involved, the

1150

manner in which the Parties have conducted throughout the arbitration, including any

1182

misconduct,''*! and whether the Parties presented solid or meritorious arguments.

'l47 The Tribunal recalls that paragraph 3.1 of the Terms of Appointment states that “[p]urswant to Articles
10.16(3)(c) and 10.16(5) of the CAFTA-DR, this arbitration shall be conducted in t to the extent modified by the
CAFTA-DR.”

PCA Case No. 2016-17
Final Award
3 September, 2019

The majority of the Tribunal is of the view that these criteria are objective and relevant to inform
its decision on costs together with its assessment on whether the claim was “frivolous”, as
established by DR-CAFTA, to determine whether a costs award in favor of the prevailing party is
“warranted”. Moreover, despite providing for a general “loser pays” rule, the UNCITRAL Rules
empower tribunals to apportion costs by simply determining that apportionment is “reasonable”.
In this case the rules under DR-CAFTA and the UNCITRAL Rules must be read together. If the
losing party’s claim was not frivolous, the Tribunal has discretion to decide whether there are
circumstances in the present dispute that justify a reasonable allocation. The Tribunal also notes
that the approaches followed by other tribunals in exercising their power to allocate costs vary

from one dispute to another.

This is the case in the context of arbitrations under the DR-CAFTA. For example, in RDV v.
Guatemala, the tribunal distinguished between jurisdictional and merits phases and ordered the
respondent to bear the costs of the two jurisdictional phases that were rejected and each party to

bear 50% of the costs of the merits phase.'!**

In Corona Materials v. Dominican Republic, the
tribunal ordered that each party bear 50% of the arbitration costs and its own legal fees and
expenses. In that case, the tribunal determined that “neither of the Parties has presented its cases
in a way justifying the shifting of arbitral costs against it.”''** In Pac Rim v. El Salvador, the
tribunal ordered the claimant to pay a proportion of the respondent’s legal costs and each party to
bear its own share of the arbitration costs.'' In Aven and others v. Costa Rica, the tribunal
ordered the claimants to bear all of the arbitrators’ fees and expenses, the ICSID administrative
expenses and the direct expenses of the arbitration, and each party to bear its own legal costs and
expenses.'!*° In all of these cases, the tribunals took into account the circumstances at issue rather

than applying directly the principle of the “costs follow the event”.

In its jurisdictional objection, the Respondent argued that (i) the Ballantines did not qualify as
“Claimants” as defined under DR-CAFTA Article 10.28 and (ii) their claims do not involve a
breach of an obligation under Articles 10.1 to 10.14.

The Tribunal has already decided that the Claimants do not qualify as investors of a Contracting

Party in accordance to the definition set forth in Article 10.28 of DR-CAFTA, therefore the

Respondent has prevailed regarding its preliminary objection. Consequently, the Tribunal lacks

jurisdiction ratione personae to assess the merits of the dispute.

The question that follows for the Tribunal, is whether it is warranted that the Claimant should pay
the Respondent all the costs and fees resulted from this dispute or whether costs and fees should

be allocated in different portions.

As a starting point, the Tribunal notes that DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.6 (“Conduct of the
Arbitration”) demands that the Tribunal determine, in this case, whether the Claimant’s claim was

“frivolous”.

In the present dispute, the nationality issue before the Tribunal was different from others where
investment tribunals often face a determination of whether the investor acquired nationality as a
means of gaining treaty protection.''’ Most important, the Tribunal noted that this is a case of
first impression. In the absence of specific provisions under the DR-CAFTA setting a dominant
and effective nationality standard, the Tribunal had to determine the meaning of “dominant” and
“effective” in light of the unique factual circumstances of this case, the context provided for in
the DR-CAFTA, its object and purpose, and the applicable rules of international law. In other

words, the present dispute involved a complex and novel issue.

With regard to the conduct in this arbitration, the Tribunal considers that both Parties have
conducted themselves in good faith and presented their arguments in support of their claims or
defenses in a professional manner. In the Tribunal’s view neither Party caused an undue delay to

this proceeding or otherwise had a procedural misconduct.

In addition, the majority of the Tribunal decided to hear the facts concerning the jurisdictional
objection together with the facts concerning the merits. Both Parties submitted extensive

arguments on the application of the dominant and effective standard as well as on the merits.

Having considered the facts of the dispute and the allegations, the majority of the Tribunal does
not find elements to consider that such claim was “frivolous”. In Commerce Group v. El Salvador,
the tribunal, having ruled in favor of the respondent, considered that to conclude that the claims

were “frivolous” “would be to go too far”. The tribunal saw “no indication that [c\laimants were

not serious about the claims they asserted in [the] proceedings, nor that the Claimants pursued

[the] matter in bad faith.”''** In a similar situation, the tribunal in Corona Materials v. Dominican
Republic that decided in favor of the respondent in matters of jurisdiction, stated that “the facts
surrounding the dispute and the allegations made [demonstrated] that the Claimant — even if it
was wrong in the construction and application of the DR-CAFTA to said facts — had a bona fide
claim and did not act with such wanton disregard of the facts and the law as to permit [the]

tribunal to consider that its claim was ‘frivolous”"'*°.

633. In the present case, in the view of the majority of the Tribunal, the Claimants brought a credible
case and presented their arguments on jurisdiction in good faith and fairly and they acted
professionally during the p ding''°. Likewise, the Respondent and its counsel also presented
their jurisdictional objection in good faith and acted professionally. While the conduct of both
Parties is relevant under the UNCITRAL chapeau of relevant circumstances, the inquiry of
whether a claim is frivolous under DR-CAFTA must be focused on the losing party. In sum, the
majority of the Tribunal considers that the good faith presumption was maintained in the
presentation of the claim and the jurisdictional objection,''®' and that the Parties conducted

themselves in good faith throughout the proceedings. |!

634. The Tribunal also notes the discretion bestowed by the applicable arbitration rules to allocate the
costs. In principle, such rules provide that the costs shall be borne by the unsuccessful party, but
the Tribunal has authority to apportion such costs in a different manner if it finds that doing so

would be reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.

635. Notwithstanding that the Respondent prevailed in the jurisdictional objection and the Tribunal did
not have to address the merits, the Claimant presented a bona fide claim. Having considered the
particular circumstances of this case and in light of the fact that the claim brought was not

“frivolous”, the majority Tribunal finds that it would be reasonable for each party to bear half of

Expedited Preliminary Objections, (May 31, 2016), § 277.

1160 Even if the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to decide the merits of the case with final and binding effects, the
Tribunal has nevertheless heard the Parties’ full arguments on the merits; and in the view of the majority of the
Tribunal, it cannot avoid having formed a prima facie opinion of the case based on the facts and legal arguments
alleged by both Parties. In fact, in order to determine whether a claim is frivolous or not, as required by DR-
CAFTA, a tribunal must necessarily have an opinion, or otherwise it would simply be a meaningless standard
whenever there is no jurisdiction.

the arbitration costs and its own legal fees and expenses incurred in this proceeding. Moreover,
the Tribunal does not find any other element which would warrant an award on costs in favour of

the Respondent.

636. While each Party has advanced USD 450,000 to the PCA to fund the costs of the proceedings,
only the Claimants have paid the costs of the appointing authority (ICSID) in the amount of USD
10,000. Hence, the Respondent owes the Claimants the amount of USD 5,000. As stated above,
the unexpended balance in the case deposit amounts to USD 5,092.59. In order to account for an
equal distribution of costs, the PCA shall therefore reimburse to the Parties the unexpended
balance of the deposit as follows: the amount of USD 5,046.29 to the Claimants, and the amount
of USD 46.29 to the Respondent.!!

Partial Dissent of Ms. Cheek on Jurisdiction

I. INTRODUCTION

1. While agreeing with many of the factual findings of the Majority, I respectfully register my
dissent with regard to the test articulated for assessing the dominant and effective nationality of
the Claimants and the ultimate conclusion of the Majority that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to
consider the merits of the Ballantines’ claims based on a finding that their dominant and

effective nationality on the relevant dates is Dominican.’ I join the Award as to costs.

2. I am in agreement with my colleagues that, as a threshold matter, DR-CAFTA instructs that dual
citizens such as the Ballantines may only assert a claim against the Dominican Republic if their
dominant and effective nationality is, in this case, that of the United States at the time of the
alleged breach and at the time of submission of the claim.” | also concur with many of the
factual findings set forth in the Award. However, I respectfully dissent from the Majority’s
articulation of the legal test for dominant and effective nationality and the Majority’s conclusion

that Claimants’ dominant and effective nationality on the critical dates is Dominican.

3. As explained below, through the inclusion of the phrase “dominant and effective nationality” in
Article 10.28, the parties to the DR-CAFTA incorporated the customary international law
standard for the treatment of dual nationality that this Tribunal is bound to apply. While my
colleagues acknowledge the customary international law standard for assessing dominant and
effective nationality, they ultimately depart from it. The Majority’s analysis gives great weight
to the Ballantines’ investment-based contacts with the Dominican Republic during a narrow
window of time.? While dominant and effective nationality must be assessed on certain dates,
namely, the date of the alleged breach and the date of submission of the claim, it is the entire life
of the individual that is relevant to the analysis. In other words, dominant and effective
nationality is a distinct legal test separate and apart from the making of, maintenance of, or
injury to a claimant’s investment. When the customary international law standard is properly
applied to the Ballantines, the conclusion reached is that the Ballantines’ dominant and effective

nationality on the critical dates is that of the United States.

' Terms defined in the Award have the same meaning in this dissenting opinion.

PCA Case No. 2016-17
Partial Dissent of Ms. Cheek on Jurisdiction

ASSESSING DOMINANT AND EFFECTIVE NATIONALITY

Article 10.28 of the DR-CAFTA states that “a natural person who is a dual national shall be
deemed to be exclusively a national of the State of his or her dominant and effective

nationality.”

Through the use of the phrase “dominant and effective nationality,” the
DR-CAFTA parties adopted the customary international law standard for determining nationality
of dual citizens. I disagree with my colleagues, as set out in paragraph 530 of the Award, that
the Tribunal should only “take guidance from customary international law, taking into account
Article 10.28 particular context, within DR-CAFTA general object and purpose.” Rather than
“giving effect to the specific context provided for in this instrument as well as its object and
purpose,”® the customary international law standard referenced in DR-CAFTA should be
applied, without altering that test in an investment treaty-specific context. I disagree with the
Majority that it is “appropriate to give specific meaning to the terms used in DR-CAFTA rather

than directly incorporating any other standard[.]””

Article 10.22 of the DR-CAFTA states that the governing law for this dispute is “this Agreement
and applicable rules of international law.”* Where the DR-CAFTA parties have incorporated a
tule of customary international law into the treaty, as they have done with regard to the

dominant and effective nationality test, the Tribunal should simply apply it.

The standard in DR-CAFTA is the customary international law standard to determine dominant
and effective nationality, articulated by the International Court of Justice (“ICI”) in the

Nottebohm Case? and reflected in the Mergé Case of the Italian-United States Conciliation

Commission"? and decisions of the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal, notably Case No. A/I8 and Malek

v. Iran.''

7. According to the ICJ in Nottebohm, “nationality is a legal bond having as its basis a social fact
of attachment, a genuine connection of existence, interests and sentiments, together with the

12 While the ICJ in Nottebohm was not concerned

existence of reciprocal rights and duties.
with dual nationality (the question in that case was one of diplomatic protection), the ICJ
referenced the customary international law standard in cases of multiple nationalities, observing

that:

International arbitrators have decided in the same way numerous cases of dual
nationality, where the question arose with regard to the exercise of protection.
They have given their preference to the real and effective nationality, that which
accorded with the facts, that based on stronger factual ties between the person
concerned and one of the States whose nationality is involved. Different factors
are taken into consideration, and their importance will vary from one case to the
next[.]!

8. To determine a natural person’s dominant and effective nationality is thus a fact-specific
inquiry. As the Majority observes at paragraph 548, quoting Nottebohm, “the habitual residence
of the individual concerned is an important factor, but there are other factors such as the centre
of his interests, his family ties, his participation in public life, attachment shown by him for a

given country and inculcated in his children, etc.”"*

9. The Mergé Case and Case No. A/I8 reiterate this customary international law test. The Mergé
Case tribunal observed that Nottebohm “is not a case of dual nationality; but it is interesting for

our purposes to note what is set forth in the reasoning of the decision in regard to the problem of

dual nationality[,]” and went on to quote the Nottebohm passage above.'* The tribunal in the
Mergé Case then applied the test articulated in Nottebohm:

In order to establish the prevalence of the United States nationality in individual

cases, habitual residence can be one of the criteria of evaluation, but not the only

one. The conduct of the individual in his economic, social, political, civic and

family life, as well as the closer and more effective bond with one of the two States

must also be considered.'®
Similarly, the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal in Case No. A/18 observed that the Nottebohm Case
“demonstrated the acceptance and approval by the International Court of Justice of the search
for the real and effective nationality based on the facts of a case, instead of an approach relying
on more formalistic criteria.”'? The Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal went on to conclude that it had
jurisdiction over cases of dual citizens against Iran where the dominant and effective nationality
of the claimant was that of the United States. It then adopted the test in Nottebohm: “In
determining the dominant and effective nationality, the Tribunal will consider all relevant
factors, including habitual residence, center of interests, family ties, participation in public life
and other evidence of attachment.”"*
While dominant and effective nationality must be assessed on the date the claim arose and the
date the claim was submitted for purposes of jurisdiction, the relevant period of time for
determining dominant and effective nationality on those dates is an individual’s contacts over a
lifetime. As the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal explained in Malek, “[o]bviously, to
establish what is the dominant and effective nationality at the date the claim arose, it is
necessary to scrutinize the events in the Claimant’s life preceding this date. Indeed, the entire
life of the Claimant, from birth, and all the factors which during this span of time, evidence the
reality and the sincerity of the choice of national allegiance he claims to have made, are
relevant.”!?
Nottebohm and its progeny’s list of considerations is not exhaustive, but it nevertheless

establishes an objective factual inquiry. I disagree with my colleagues that application of the

PCA Case No. 2016-17
Partial Dissent of Ms. Cheek on Jurisdiction

dominant and effective nationality test set forth in DR-CAFTA Article 10.28 should be applied
to give greater weight to investment-related connections with the Dominican Republic because
DR-CAFTA is an investment treaty. Specifically, I disagree with the Majority that “the
inclusion of this phrase [/.e., dominant and effective nationality] in an investment chapter within
the broader framework of a Free Trade Agreement imbues that phrase with a specific meaning”
and therefore “it [is] appropriate to give specific meaning to the terms used in DR-CAFTA
rather than directly incorporating any other standard. . . [.]”?° The standard articulated in DR-
CAFTA is not an investment treaty-specific test for dominant and effective nationality. Rather,
it is the well-established customary international law standard. My opinion in this regard is
consistent with the recent decision in Aven v. Costa Rica, where the tribunal applied the

Nottebohm test in examining the question of dual nationality under DR-CAFTA Article 10.28.7!

13. While the Majority and I agree that the Claimants’ entire lifetime is relevant to the dominant and
effective nationality inquiry, we diverge where the Majority also focuses on what it deems the
specific context of DR-CAFTA for the dominant and effective nationality test.” The Majority
“considers that the investment itself, the status of investor as well as other circumstances
surrounding those elements may be relevant factors for assessing nationality and its dominance
and effectiveness within Article 10.28 of DR-CAFTA.””> This appears to go beyond an
examination of the Claimants’ economic ties to both countries over their lifetimes. The

Majority concludes that “a claimant’s entire life is relevant but not dispositive’
whether the Claimants’ Dominican nationality “was strong enough to take precedence over their
U.S. nationality and it was producing effects or was operative during the relevant time in order
to determine whether they were investors under DR-CAFTA.””> The result of this approach,

shall be interpreted,””® is to give greater weight to the Claimants’ investment-related contacts as
of the date the claim arose and the date the claim was submitted,?’ rather than engaging in a

truly holistic inquiry of the Claimants’ entire lifetimes on each of those dates.

14. The proper inquiry should examine the Claimants’ ties to the United States and the Dominican
Republic over the course of their lifetimes to determine whether, at the time of the alleged
breach (i.e., 12 September 201 1)°8 and at the time of the submission of the claim to arbitration
(i.e., 11 September 2014), the dominant and effective nationality of each Claimant was that of

the United States or the Dominican Republic.”

customary international law standard articulated in Nottebohm. The relevant dates for

27 See, e.g., Award, para. 597 (“[W]hile this Tribunal cannot deny the fact that during the relevant
period, the Claimants maintained connections to the United States and this also seems natural from the
fact that they were born and lived in that country for the majority of their lives, in this Tribunal’s
opinion, during the relevant period the Dominican nationality was effective and took precedence over
the American nationality. Although the Claimants maintained residential connections to the United
States, their permanent residence was in the Dominican Republic, overall, most of their days from
2010 to 2014 were spent in the Dominican Republic, they changed their status to permanent residents
and later to Dominican citizens.”) (emphasis added); see also Award, para. 598 (“While their personal
and professional relations to the Dominican Republic may have been limited, it is difficult to deny that
during that period of time their investment kept them economically centered in the Dominican
Republic.”) (emphasis added).

28 12 September 2011 is presumed to be the date the claim arose, as that is the date the Ballantines’
expansion request was denied by the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources of the
Dominican Republic on the basis that the slopes on the upper portion of the property exceeded the 60
percent slope permitted under Article 122 of the Environmental Law and because it was considered an
environmentally fragile area, creating a natural risk. See Award, para. 126 (citing Letter from Zoila
Gonzalez de Gutierrez to Michael Ballantine (September 12, 2011) (C-8)).

?° To the extent “effective” nationality also reflects a concept that citizenship is valid as a legal matter
and there is a bona fide connection between the natural person and the State, the Parties agree that
concept has been satisfied here. See Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, para. 44 (“Typically, the
first step in the ‘dominant and effective nationality’ analysis is to identify a person’s ‘effective’
nationalities (i.e., any nationalities for which there exists a bona fide connection between the person
and the State of nationality). In the present case, however, this first step is unnecessary, as it is
uncontested that the Ballantines — who are nationals of both the Dominican Republic and the United
States — have genuine connections to both States.” (internal citations omitted)).

determining dominant and effective nationality are 12 September 2011 (the date of the alleged
breach) and 11 September 2014 (the date of submission of the claim). For the reasons explained
below, both Ms. Ballantine and Mr. Ballantine had dominant and effective U.S. nationality on

both critical dates.

16. Lisa Ballantine’s connections to both the United States and the Dominican Republic can be

summarized as follows:

¢ Ms. Ballantine was born and lived in the United States until 2000, that is, for
approximately the first forty years of her life. The center of her interests during this
period, including her family ties and participation in public life through civic and
religious groups, was the United States. The center of her professional life was also in
the United States. At all relevant times, Ms. Ballantine was a U.S. citizen.

e Ms. Ballantine worked as a missionary in the Dominican Republic for a year in 2000,
and returned to the United States in 2001."'

e She then moved to the Dominican Republic in August 2006, along with her husband
and children.*? The Ballantines enrolled their children in the American School in the
Dominican Republic, attended an American church,** and spoke English at both
church and at home.** Ms. Ballantine lived in the Dominican Republic from 2006
until this claim was submitted.*°

nonprofit organization, Filter Pure, Inc.,“? which partners with local NGOs around the
world, including in the Dominican Republic, to develop water programs. Filter Pure,
Inc. had significant operations in the Dominican Republic.*” Since 99 percent of its
donations came from U.S. donors, Ms. Ballantine, who was responsible for
fundraising, spent much of her time in the United States.*!

e Ms. Ballantine described her cultural connection to the Dominican Republic as
“limited,” although she also spoke of the Dominican Republic on social media as
“our country.”> I agree with the Majority view that she had personal attachments
both to the United States and the Dominican Republic. Connections to the United
States were not displaced with connections to the Dominican Republic.

17. There is no question that the focal point of Ms. Ballantine’s daily life shifted from the United
States to the Dominican Republic when she moved with her husband and young children to the
Dominican Republic in 2006. That said, this shift in focus, even coupled with Ms. Ballantine’s
naturalization in 2010, is not enough to support a finding that Ms. Ballantine’s dominant and
effective nationality on the critical dates (i.e., 12 September 2011 and 11 September 2014) was

Dominican.

18. Looking holistically at Ms. Ballantine’s habitual residence during her lifetime, the centre of her
personal and professional interests, her family life, and her maintenance of significant ties to the
United States, the facts support a finding that under customary international law Ms.
Ballantine’s dominant and effective nationality is that of the United States. Ms. Ballantine
chose to nationalize in the Dominican Republic because she and her husband owned a
significant investment and thought it might bolster the success of their business. Less than two
years later, the alleged breach in this case arose. That Ms. Ballantine chose Dominican

nationality not necessarily for love of country and allegiance, but out of economic self-interest,

reasons for seeking Dominican citizenship are but two of many relevant factors to be considered

in this analysis.

summarized as follows:

¢ Mr. Ballantine was born and lived in the United States until 2000, °° that is, for
approximately the first forty years of his life. The center of his interests during this period,
including his family ties, participation in public life through civic and religious groups, was
in the United States. At all relevant times, Mr. Ballantine was a U.S. citizen.

e Mr. Ballantine worked as a missionary in the Dominican Republic for a year in 2000, and
returned to the United States in 2001. *°

¢ He then moved to the Dominican Republic five years later, in 2006, along with his wife and
children.*” The Ballantines enrolled their children in the American School in the Dominican
Republic.** They attended an American church,® and spoke English both at church and at
home.® Mr. Ballantine lived in the Dominican Republic from 2006 until this claim was
submitted.*!

¢ Mr. Ballantine testified that he did little to assimilate with Dominican culture.”> He also
attested to his close bond with the Dominican Republic when he sought citizenship.” I
agree with the Majority view that he had personal attachments both to the United States and
the Dominican Republic.” Connections to the United States were not displaced with
connections to the Dominican Republic.

There is no question that the focal point of Mr. Ballantine’s daily life shifted from the United

States to the Dominican Republic when he moved with his wife and young children to the

Dominican Republic in 2006. Further, even before acquiring Dominican citizenship, but

certainly from 2010 to 2014, Mr. Ballantine’s economic ties to the Dominican Republic were

stronger than his economic ties to the United States, as he spent more time in the Dominican

Republic because his business was there.

Nevertheless, looking holistically at Mr. Ballantine’s life, and considering his habitual residence
during his lifetime, his family life, the center of his personal and professional interests, and his
maintenance of significant ties to the United States through both family and property, the facts
support a finding that under the customary international law standard of dominant and effective
nationality, Mr. Ballantine was a U.S. national on the critical dates. Mr. Ballantine chose to
nationalize in the Dominican Republic because he and his wife owned a significant investment
there and thought it might bolster the success of their business. Less than two years after their
naturalization, the alleged breach in this case arose. That Mr. Ballantine chose Dominican
nationality not necessarily for love of country and allegiance, but out of economic self-interest,
does not lead to a conclusion that his dominant and effective nationality was Dominican on the
critical dates. Mr. Ballantine’s economic ties to the Dominican Republic and his narrow reasons
for seeking Dominican citizenship are but two of many relevant factors to be considered in this

analysis.

It is worth noting that the consequence of the Majority’s determination that the Ballantines are
dominantly and effectively Dominican is that the Ballantines could bring a DR-CAFTA claim
against the United States, assuming that alleged harm to an investment in the United States
occurred during the same relevant time frame as in the instant case. It is difficult to imagine

that if the Ballantines launched this hypothetical case against the United States under DR-

CAFTA, such a case could move forward based on a dominant Dominican nationality of

the Claimants. The factual record simply does not support such a conclusion.

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE BALLANTINES’ DECISION TO OBTAIN DOMINICAN
CITIZENSHIP.

The Majority is troubled by the Ballantines’ motivation for seeking Dominican citizenship,
which Mr. Ballantine described at the Hearing as “it was only — had to do with economics and it
had to do with estate protection. I did not integrate with the culture. I was an investor.””* I
agree with the Majority, quoting Nottebohm, that “[n]aturalization is not a matter to be taken
lightly. To seek and to obtain it is not something that happens frequently in the life of a human
being.” Naturalization is a commitment and a responsibility on the part of an individual to the

country he swears allegiance to.

But in this particular case, what should the legal consequences be of the Ballantines’ motivation
for seeking Dominican citizenship? If the Ballantines were motivated by a desire to protect
their investment, should that prevent them from filing a claim as U.S. nationals under the
DR-CAFTA? Such a question standing alone is not one of dominant and effective nationality,
but one of bad faith or abuse of rights. When determining the dominant and effective
nationality of Mr. and Mrs. Ballantine, the circumstances surrounding the Ballantines’
naturalization in the Dominican Republic is simply a factor to be considered as part of a holistic

examination of the facts.

With regard to bad faith or abuse of rights, both Parties agree that the Ballantines did not
acquire a second nationality as a form of treaty shopping to gain access to a dispute settlement
mechanism.*’ In fact, their Dominican nationality had the potential to defeat their ability to
bring a claim. Claimants did not take steps to avail themselves of a second nationality so they
could gain protections under DR-CAFTA or bring a claim they would not otherwise have been

entitled to bring. They made their investments as U.S. nationals, and the steps they took to

become Dominican nationals involved a risk that they would jeopardize their ability to bring a

potential future investment claim against the Dominican Republic.

On these facts, the Dominican Republic chose not to allege bad faith or abuse of rights in this

case, and rightly so.

It is commonplace for a U.S. corporation to incorporate a wholly-owned subsidiary abroad in
order to do business. In the typical case, the U.S. corporation would have created a Dominican
corporation for the ease of doing business — for buying property, paying employees, etc. — and
the U.S. company would maintain ownership over its subsidiary and manage it from afar. There
is no question that the U.S. company could bring a claim on behalf of that U.S.-owned

Dominican enterprise under DR-CAFTA.*!

The difference between the Ballantines and this hypothetical U.S. corporation is that the
Ballantines were small business owners, and while they created a Dominican corporation for the
ease of doing business, they decided not to manage it from afar. Instead, they moved to the
Dominican Republic and chose to directly manage and run their investments with personal

devotion and commitment.

In this case, these two U.S. nationals acquired a second nationality in 2010 in an effort to help
their investments thrive. Under those circumstances, the second nationality does not become
the dominant one by virtue of the investment-related motivations of the Claimants. Instead, the
test for dominant and effective nationality remains a holistic one that focuses on the totality of
one’s personal, familial, economic, and civic ties over a lifetime. Under that test, both Lisa and
Michael Ballantine are U.S. nationals who qualified as U.S. investors under the DR-CAFTA at
the time of the alleged breach and at the time they submitted their claims against the Dominican

Republic.

CONCLUSION

For these reasons, I am unable to join the Award with regard to the Majority’s decision on
jurisdiction and must with all due respect issue this dissenting opinion with regard to the
Majority’s determination that this tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear the Ballantines’ claims. I
join the Award as to costs. For the reasons set forth in the Award, it is appropriate in the
circumstances of this case for each party to bear its own legal fees and expenses and for each

party to bear half of the costs of the arbitration.

PARTIAL DISSENT AS TO THE ALLOCATION OF COSTS

1. While fully agreeing with the decision on the Tribunal’s lack of jurisdiction in this matter, I regret
being unable to share the grounds justifying the majority’s decision on the allocation of the costs
of the proceedings before the PCA, and of the Tribunal’s fees and expenses, for the following

reasons.

2. The applicable law for determining who should bear the legal costs and fees is set forth in DR-
CAFTA as well as in the applicable arbitration rules, i.e. the UNCITRAL Rules.

3. Under these provisions established by different instruments, the Tribunal must, given that there
is no order of priority between them, interpret and apply these provisions privileging their

compatibility.

4, The guiding criterion, both in DR-CAFTA! and in the UNCITRAL Rules,’ is related to the
principle of “the unsuccessful party pays”. The applicable law grants the Tribunal broad
discretional power to adjust the application of this principle by considering the particular
circumstances of the case to reach a reasonable result. Therefore, this broad discretional power is
not absolute, but rather it must be exercised pursuant to the parameters established under the

applicable law.

5. After stating that the tribunal may, if warranted, grant the unsuccessful party court costs and fees,
DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.6 goes on to say the tribunal should likewise consider whether the
Claimant’s claim is frivolous in nature. If the tribunal finds the claim is not frivolous, it should
then assess the circumstances of the case in order to adopt a reasonable criterion as regards the
apportioning of the costs. DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.6 does not exclude the tribunal’s power to
justify the reasonability of its decision based on the particular circumstances of the case, under

Article 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules.

6. Under applicable law it is not possible to confuse the frivolity assessment of a “claim” with the
necessary consideration of the particular circumstances of each case to arrive at a reasonable
result. The threshold for determining the frivolity of a claim is high and such a determination

under no circumstances presupposes in itself setting aside the guiding principle for cost allocation

' DR-CAFTA, Article 10.20.6 (“When it decides a respondent’s objection under paragraph 4 or 5, the tribunal may,
if warranted, award to the prevailing disputing party reasonable costs and attorney’s fees incurred in submitting or
opposing the objection. In determining whether such an award is warranted, the tribunal shall consider whether
either the claimant’s claim or the respondent’s objection was frivolous, and shall provide the disputing parties a
reasonable opportunity to comment.”)

2 UNCITRAL Rules, Article 42(1) (“The costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful
party or parties. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines
that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case”).

PCA Case No. 2016-17
Partial Dissent of Prof. Vinuesa on Costs

(i.e. “the unsuccessful party pays”). Pursuant to applicable law, the “unsuccessful party pays”
principle is the starting point and likewise an essential circumstance the Tribunal is required to

keep in mind when deciding on the reasonability of the result in apportioning costs.

7. Thus, the Tribunal’s determination as to the frivolity or not of a claim is a determination which is
prior to and independent of the consideration of the particular circumstances of the case in

establishing a reasonable result.

8. For this reason, therefore, I do not agree with the conclusion of the majority of the Tribunal,
which, having considered the facts of the dispute and allegations does not find elements to deem
the claim “frivolous”. Firstly, pursuant to the text and context of the applicable regulations, the
frivolity of a claim does not depend on “the facts or arguments put forward by the parties”, but
simply on the content and scope of the claim. Secondly, the cases cited in this same paragraph by
the majority that reached the decision on costs (the Commerce Group* and Corona Materials*
cases), are insufficient, under the law the Tribunal is required to apply in this case (i.e. DR-CAFTA
and UNCITRAL Rules) to justify their aforementioned conclusion. Thirdly, once a tribunal has
decided that a claim is not frivolous, only then must it proceed to determine the apportioning of
the costs bearing in mind the guiding criterion that “the unsuccessful party pays” and any other

particular circumstances of the case, to reach a reasonable result.

9. The tribunal in the Commerce Group case held, without providing any grounds, that the power
granted to the Tribunal under Article 10.20.6 of DR-CAFTA is limited to the determination of
costs, considering only whether the claims filed by the claimants or the preliminary objection

submitted by the respondent were “frivolous”.

10. Likewise, the tribunal in Corona Materials held that the tribunal’s discretion in allocating costs

and fees is subject only to a single test — that of “frivolity”.”

6 Commerce Group, 137 (“The Tribunal has found entirely in favor of Respondent. However, to conclude from
Respondent's victory that Claimant’ claims were “frivolous” would be to go too far. Indeed, the Tribunal has been
presented with no indication that Claimants were not serious about the claims they asserted in these proceedings”).

7 Corona Materials, {277 (“Looking at DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.6, the immediate test for the Arbitral Tribunal
is to determine whether the claim was ‘frivolous’. The Arbitral Tribunal finds that the facts surrounding the dispute
and the allegations made demonstrate that the Claimant — even if it was wrong in the construction and application
of the DR-CAFTA to said facts — had a bona fide claim and did not act with such wanton disregard of the facts and
the law as to permit this tribunal to consider that its claim was ‘frivolous’.”).

PCA Case No. 2016-17
Partial Dissent of Prof. Vinuesa on Costs

11. Therefore, citing the Commerce Group and Corona Materials cases as valid precedents to justify
the decision of the majority on costs is inappropriate. The tribunals that heard those cases were

not bound, as is this Tribunal, to apply the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.

12. Although ICSID Rules, like UNCITRAL Rules, grant tribunals a broad margin of discretion in
deciding on cost allocation between the parties,* the substantive difference lies in that the
UNCITRAL Rules applicable to this case expressly states the criterion (“the unsuccessful party
pays”) from which other particular circumstances of the case should be considered to reach a

reasonable result on cost allocation.

13. Moreover, the above-mentioned cases cited by the majority as grounds for their decision on costs
contradict the arguments made by other DR-CAFTA precedents, likewise cited by the majority:
this is the case of the Railroad Development Corporation v. Republic of Guatemala; Pac Rim
Cayman LLC. v. Republic of El Salvador; and David R. Aven et al v. Republic of Costa Rica

precedents.”

14. In this context, the tribunal in Railroad’ does not take the “frivolity” of the unsuccessful party’s
allegations as a basis when deciding that the costs involved in the proceedings relating to the
jurisdictional stage should be paid for by the respondent who was, ultimately, the unsuccessful
party in that stage. Instead, in the allocation of procedural costs related to the merits, the tribunal
decided that such costs should be apportioned equally between the respondent and the claimant.'"
The tribunal clearly distinguishes the provisions it must apply when allocating the costs and
expenses of the proceedings, acknowledging that the ICSID Rules do not impose any condition
or requirement to decide on this matter. The tribunal likewise applied Article 10.20.6 of DR-
CAFTA on the understanding that it had full discretion to decide on the costs and other tribunal’s

"| Railroad, § 282 (“Each party has pleaded that it be awarded counsel fees and expenses as well as the
administrative expenses of ICSID and the fees and expenses of the Tribunal. CAFTA Article 10.26.1 permits the
award of costs and attorney’s fees in accordance with that section and the applicable arbitration rules. The ICSID
Arbitration Rules only require that the award contain “any decision of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the
proceeding” (Rule 47). On the basis of the discretion bestowed on the Tribunal by CAFTA and the applicable
arbitration rules, the Tribunal determines that they shall be responsible for their own counsel fees and expenses.
‘As to administrative expenses of ICSID and the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, the Tribunal distinguishes
between the jurisdictional phases and the merits phase of the proceedings. Given that Respondent's objections to

expenses.'? However, the tribunal, though not required to apply the UNCITRAL Rules, decided
the allocation of the costs related to the jurisdictional stage by relying on the “the unsuccessful
party pays” principle.

15. Therefore, the award given in Railroad does not help to provide support to justify the majority of

the Tribunal’s decision on costs.

16. In Pac Rim," the tribunal confirms, with some tempering, the principle that states that the
unsuccessful party shall pay. This precedent, therefore, likewise fails to support the decision of
the majority of the Tribunal on costs. The tribunal held that it had jurisdiction, dismissing the
respondent’s additional objections and dismissing on the merits all the damages and interest
claims submitted by the claimant during the third stage of the arbitration. The tribunal orders the
claimant to pay USD 8 million for the respondent’s fees, while the costs of the procedure were to

be apportioned equally between the parties.'*

17. Toarrive at this conclusion, the tribunal held it had broad discretion to allocate costs under Article
61(2) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 47(1)(j) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Thus, the

tribunal considered that the following factors were relevant when exercising its discretion:'°

t]he Tribunal has decided that the Respondent is to be considered the prevailing party

in the merits phase of this arbitration. Second, [...] the Tribunal decided in its Decision
on Jurisdiction that neither Party could be considered as having prevailed overall.
Third, [...] whilst the Claimant’s case prevailed over the Respondent’s case under the
Tribunal’s Decision on Preliminary Objections, it was perhaps, as the Duke of Wellington
might have put it (as he did of the Battle of Waterloo), a “near-run thing” with consequences

18. It is evident from analyzing the Pac Rim case that the tribunal did not diverge from the general
principle of “the unsuccessful party pays”’” but rather adapted its application to the favorable or

adverse result of each party in each stage of the process. Therefore, and independently of the fact

that the tribunal was not bound by the UNCITRAL Rules, this precedent also does not help to

support the decision of the majority on costs.

In the David Aven" case, the tribunal held that Article 10.26.1 of DR-CAFTA provides that a
tribunal may also allocate costs and attorney fees under this Section and the applicable arbitration
rules. By considering that the applicable rules were precisely the UNCITRAL Rules, the tribunal
pointed out that their Article 42 defines the standards for allocating costs based on the principle
that arbitration costs should be paid by the unsuccessful party. This same standard authorizes the
tribunal to apportion the costs between the parties, if it decides that the apportionment is

reasonable taking into account the circumstances of the case.'”

This way, the tribunal in David Aven does not even consider the option of restricting its discretion
to merely assessing the eventual “frivolity” of the unsuccessful party when deciding on the

allocation of costs and fees.”°

The tribunal understood that it had the obligation to assess the circumstances of the case and the

reasonability of costs (UNCITRAL Rules Article 42(1)) to conclude that,

[iJn this case, the Claimants are unsuccessful regarding the merits, but the Respondent is
unsuccessful on the Counterclaim so_the Tribunal shall take into account such
of the case” in order to decide on the apportionment of costs.”!
(Emphasis is my own)
The tribunal in David Aven correctly interprets and applies DR-CAFTA and the UNCITRAL
Rules when stating that the tribunal should consider as “circumstances of the case” — who was
unsuccessful and who was successful at each stage of the proceedings — for the purpose of

exercising its discretion in the apportioning of costs, pursuant to applicable law.

In short, the tribunal in David Aven did not even consider the potential or apparent “frivolity” of
the claimant’s claim or of the respondent’s objections when deciding on the allocation of costs
and fees. Although the tribunal decided that it did have jurisdiction, and thus the claimant is the

prevailing party in that stage, the fact that on the merits the tribunal dismissed the claimant’s

heads of claim and the respondent’s counterclaims, it eventually ordered that all the costs of the
proceedings (i.e. arbitrator fees and expenses involved in the proceedings before ICSID) be paid

for by the claimant, in other words, the unsuccessful party on the merits.

The David Aven precedent is also not helpful to support the decision taken by the majority of this

Tribunal on costs and fees.

Accordingly, based on everything stated so far, I disagree with the majority’s holding that, in all
the precedents cited, the tribunals took into account the circumstances of the case instead of
directly applying the “costs follow the events” principle.” A simple analysis of the cases
previously cited, including the case in which the tribunal applied DR-CAFTA and the UNCITRAL

Rules, confirms the opposite.

Unlike what the majority holds,” and as has already been set forth previously, I consider that “the
frivolity of the claim” must be determined pursuant to its content and scope. Once it has been
defined that the claim is not frivolous, the particular circumstances of each case should be taken

into account to give support to a reasonable result in the allocation of costs.

Among the particular circumstances of this case, the majority deciding on costs cannot ignore,
for the purpose of allocating such costs, that the Respondent was successful and the Claimants
were unsuccessful, and therefore the Tribunal was unable to hear the merits of the claims. The
very precedents cited by the majority that decided the issue of costs show that, even in some of

those cases in which the UNCITRAL Rules were not a part of the applicable law, the

‘ization of ful party and ful party was cc das one of the particular
circumstances and the starting point to keep in mind for the purpose of reaching a reasonable

result in the allocation of costs.

Regarding the scope which the majority assigns to the nature of the objection on the dominant
and effective nationality of the Claimants as though this were a relevant circumstance to bear in
mind, I consider that, while this objection sets forth a novel issue, it in no way warrants
considering this case as a complex one to justify the existence of a special circumstance that
would merit setting aside the application of the guiding principle on costs allocation.’ Unlike

what the majority deciding on costs held,”> I consider that the power to interpret the applicable

24 Although in the context of this particular case at issue, the tribunal in David Aven held that “[t]he Tribunal thinks
that the issues that were submitted to its judgment, although showing some technical complexity, by themselves
are not especially complex from a legal point of view. The complexity of this case arises rather from the actions

and omissions of the parties than from the litigated is

 

sues.” (David R. Aven, § 762).

rules is not an exceptional role justifying the existence of a special circumstance. Rather, this
power is part of the basic primary role any tribunal is required to assume when reaching a decision

consistent with the law.

Furthermore, within the particular circumstances of this case, one cannot overlook the effects of
the Claimants’ opposition to the request for bifurcation made by the Respondent. This opposition
led to a majority decision by the Tribunal on bifurcation which demanded considerable time and
effort and greater costs to the Parties throughout the procedure. These greater costs turned out to
be unnecessary and fruitless since the Tribunal eventually reached a majority decision on its lack
of jurisdiction.

Moreover, I consider that when the majority deciding on costs holds that “the Claimants brought

9926

a credible case,””* a value judgement is being made on the merits that exceeds the scope of the

majority’s decision as to the Tribunal’s lack of jurisdiction.

In the present case, the lack of jurisdiction makes no pre-judgement as to the merits of the issues
brought, therefore, the Tribunal cannot and should not give an opinion on the merits. In this sense,
the Tribunal, having decided by majority that it has no jurisdiction, is not empowered to give an
opinion as to the consequences that the majority deciding on costs attempts to attribute to the
allegations by the Claimants on the merits, by describing them as consisting of a “credible case”.
In this context, it is certainly understandable that the Tribunal should have an opinion to be able
to determine whether the claim is frivolous or not. But that opinion must inexorably be based on
the content and scope of the Claimants “claim” in the context of the jurisdictional stage, and not,

927

as held by the majority, on “the facts and allegations of the Parties”*’ as developed throughout
the proceedings. In this award, the analysis of the majority decision on jurisdiction make no
reference to the developments on the merits for the simple reason that such proceedings could not

be taken into account as grounds for a decision on jurisdiction.

Likewise, I consider that not only the Claimants, but also the Respondent, acted in good faith and
submitted their arguments on jurisdiction adequately and acted professionally during the
proceedings. Therefore, it is my understanding that it is not possible to consider the behavior of
one of the Parties as a special circumstance to benefit that Party as regards the other, which, as

the successful Party, also displayed the same behavior.

Finally, the majority that decided on costs failed to verify the reasonability of the result caused
by its decision. It does not even base its reasoning on the cases it cites to provide a counterfactual

test comparing the logical consequences of a possible decision in favor of the Claimants on

jurisdiction and in favor of the Respondent on substance, with the decision on jurisdiction in favor

of the Respondent adopted by the majority.

To conclude, a submission based on a claim that can be defined as “not frivolous” may, to my
understanding, empower the Tribunal to mitigate the rigorousness of the guiding principle it is
required to apply (“the unsuccessful party pays”), but not to ignore it, and much less to dismiss
it. In this context, taking into account the behavior of the Parties and their legal counsel during
the process, I consider that each of the Parties should bear their own costs and fees. Since, in
accordance with the particular circumstances of the case, the Claimants have been unsuccessful
in all of their jurisdictional claims, there has been no especial legal complexity involved in the
issues submitted, and in view of the costs incurred as a consequence of the Claimants’ opposition
to the request for bifurcation made by the Respondent, it is reasonable to decide that the expenses
of the PCA and arbitrator fees and expenses should be borne entirely by the unsuccessful Party,

ie. the Claimants.

For all the reasons set forth above, and agreeing that each Party should bear its own costs and
legal fees incurred throughout the proceedings, I dissent with the majority that decided on costs,
with regards to their decision to allocate the costs of the PCA proceedings and the Tribunal’s fees
and expenses equally among the Parties. I therefore consider that PCA’s costs, including the
Tribunal’s fees and expenses, should be borne entirely by the Claimants after due consideration
of the particular circumstances of the case that justify the reasonability of the abovementioned

apportionment.
