THE PROCEEDINGS

On 29 March 2016, ickale insaat Limited Sirketi (“igkale” or the “Claimant”) filed with the
International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) a
Request for Supplementary Decision and Rectification of the Award rendered by the
Tribunal on 8 March 2016 (the “Request’) pursuant to Article 49(2) of the Convention on
Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States dated 18

March 1965 (the “ICSID Convention”).

By letter dated 6 April 2016, the ICSID Secretary-General informed the Parties that the
Centre had registered the Request pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 49(2)(a).

By letter dated 11 April 2016, the Tribunal established a schedule for written submissions to
address the Request pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 49(3). According to the schedule,
the Respondent was to submit its observations on the Request by 9 May 2016, the Claimant
was to file its Reply by 23 May 2016, and the Respondent was to file its Rejoinder by 6 June
2016.

By email dated 9 May 2016, the Respondent requested an extension of the deadline to file

its observations on the Request until 12 May 2016.

By email dated 10 May 2016, the Tribunal granted the Respondent’s extension request and
amended the existing schedule. According to the amended schedule, the Respondent was to
submit its observations on the Request by 12 May 2016, the Claimant was to file its Reply

by 26 May 2016, and the Respondent was to file its Rejoinder by 9 June 2016.
On 12 May 2016, the Respondent filed its observations on the Request (the “Observations”).

By letter dated 18 May 2016, the Centre requested that each Party make an advance payment
in the amount of USD 60,000 in order to meet the costs arising out of the Request within 30
days, ie. by 17 June 2016, in accordance with ICSID Administrative and Financial

Regulation 14(3)(d).

By letter dated 25 May 2016, the Claimant requested a three-day extension of the deadline

to file its Reply to the Respondent’s Observations.

By letter dated 26 May 2016, the Tribunal granted the Claimant’s extension request and
amended the existing schedule for written submissions to the effect that the Claimant was to
file its Reply by 31 May 2016, and that the Respondent was to file its Rejoinder by 14 June
2016.

On 31 May 2016, the Claimant filed its Reply to the Respondent’s Observations (the
“Reply”).

On 14 June 2016, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the Request (the “Rejoinder”).

By letter dated 16 June 2016, the Claimant requested a three-month extension of the deadline
to pay the advance on costs. The Claimant also requested the ICSID Secretariat and the
Tribunal to reconsider the amount of the advance payment. The Claimant further agreed
that, in view of the Respondent’s objection that one of the Claimant’s exhibits (Exhibit CA-

1) constitutes new evidence, this exhibit be struck from the record.

By letter of 20 June 2016, the Respondent submitted comments in response to the Claimant’s
letter of 16 June regarding Exhibit CA-1 and the introduction of new evidence by the

Claimant.

By letter dated 21 June 2016, having considered the Claimant’s letter of 16 June 2016 and
the relevant circumstances, the ICSID Secretariat reduced the amount of the advance
payment to be made by each Party to USD 40,000, and extended the deadline for payment
until 18 July 2016.

By letter of 27 June 2016, the Claimant submitted comments in response to the Respondent’s

letter of 20 June.
On 15 July 2016, the Centre confirmed receipt of the Claimant’s advance payment.

On 26 July 2016, the Centre confirmed receipt of the Respondent’s advance payment.

On 16 August 2016, the Respondent requested leave from the Tribunal to file a response to
the Claimant’s argument regarding the Claimant’s new depreciation calculations in footnote
2 of the Claimant’s letter of 20 June 2016. On the same day, the Claimant objected to the
Respondent’s request, stating that the Respondent had already responded to the Claimant’s

letter, and that it was too late to raise the issue now.

On 17 August 2016, the Tribunal granted the Respondent’s request and invited the
Respondent to file its comments by 19 August 2016. The Claimant was provided with an

opportunity to file a brief response by 23 August 2016.

On 19 August 2016, the Respondent filed a brief comment on footnote 2 of the Claimant’s
letter of 20 June 2016.

On 24 August 2016, the Claimant filed its reply to the Respondent’s submission of 19 August
2016.

On 14 September 2016, the Tribunal declared the proceedings closed pursuant to ICSID
Arbitration Rule 46.

THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF
The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant explains that its Request “is limited to the Tribunal’s ruling concerning the
expropriation of Claimant’s assets by the Supreme Court of Turkmenistan’s Directive dated
9 June 2010.”! The Claimant refers, in particular, to paragraphs 371 to 376 of the Award

in which, according to the Claimant, the Tribunal,

“after finding that the Directive dated 9 June 2010 from the Supreme Court of
Turkmenistan to the State Customs Service shows that machinery and equipment ‘may
have been taken without justification’ and ‘may have been expropriatory,’ [...]
performs a number of adjustments pursuant to the Second Expert Report of Abdul
Sirshar Qureshi in order to conclude that the difference between the real value of
Claimant’s machinery and equipment and the delay penalties is small and has not been

' Request, para. 4.

24.

26.

shown, and therefore the Supreme Court’s directive which permanently deprived
Claimant of its assets in Turkmenistan was not excessive or expropriatory.””
The Claimant takes issue with the Tribunal’s valuation of the assets allegedly expropriated
as a result of the Supreme Court directive (the “Supreme Court Directive” or the
“Directive’), which the Claimant contends should be supplemented, and with the deductions
made by the Tribunal when calculating the difference between the value of these assets and
the delay penalties imposed on the Claimant.’ According to the Claimant, the Tribunal’s

calculations include “gross errors.”*

2.1.1 The scope of Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention

According to the Claimant, its Request falls within the ambit of Article 49(2) of the ICISD
Convention. The Claimant argues, referring to the decision of the tribunal in LG&E v.

Argentina’ and legal scholarship,° that

“[t]he purpose of a supplementary decision under Article 49(2) is to provide a remedy
for questions that were put before the Tribunal during the proceedings on the merits
but not addressed or decided in the Award. In order to warrant a supplemental
decision, the omitted question must concern an issue that materially affects the award
according to Christoph Schreuer. Article 49(2) further states that the Tribunal ‘shall
rectify any clerical, arithmetical or similar error in the award.’ The rectification of
clerical, arithmetical or similar errors in the Award is obligatory.”

The Claimant denies that its Request amounts to a request of reconsideration of the

Tribunal’s decision on the merits, as alleged by the Respondent. According to the Claimant,

“Tthe] request for the rectification of errors does not require the Tribunal to exercise
any legal judgment whatsoever or to change any legal reasoning, or to rule upon any
matter over which the Tribunal has discretion in terms of its legal judgment or to rule
directly on any substantive issue. These rectifications are entirely a matter of correcting
very basic math errors and clerical errors. Rectification does not require the Tribunal

to make any analyses of facts or law, nor to exercise any judgment, and its comparison
of the value of the machinery and equipment and the delay penalties is quite obviously
mathematically incorrect on multiple levels and must be corrected.”*

27. The Claimant argues that, despite the Respondent’s misleading references to “minor” errors,

all errors should be corrected, whether they concern small or large sums.!°

28. The Claimant contends that the Respondent cannot rely on Vivendi v. Argentina and Perenco
v. Ecuador to argue that corrections of errors cannot lead tribunals to modify their findings
on the merits.!! While Vivendi addressed errors that have nothing to do with those at issue
in this case, Perenco did not concern a request for rectification, but a request for
reconsideration.'? The Claimant refers instead to RDC v. Guatemala in which the tribunal
corrected the discount rate and as a result increased the amount awarded by USD 2 million.'*
The Claimant also draws support from the dissenting opinion in the same case which
suggested that “even in a situation where the Claimant had not even mentioned a set-off
amount in its pleadings at all, including apparently during the final hearing, the arbitral
tribunal should correct this too.”'* The Claimant further relies on ICC Case No. 10609 in
which the tribunal agreed to rectify an error in computation and its decision regarding the

amount of damages.!°

29. The Claimant suggests that, if the Tribunal did not modify the findings which were based

upon its errors, the “logical syllogism” at the centre of its reasoning would no longer stand.'®

16 Reply, para. 176. The Claimant argues that this syllogism is as follows:

“A — A seizure is expropriatory only if the difference between the value of Claimant’s seized machinery and the
amount due to Respondent is a large, positive value.

B — The difference between the value of the Claimant’s seized machinery and equipment and the amount due to
Respondent is a negative value.

This would also go against the spirit and purpose of Article 49(2) and deprive it of its
effectiveness, contrary to the requirement of effet utile.'’ The Claimant adds that if the
Tribunal were to make the requested modifications to its findings, the risk that the

Respondent may file an application for annulment would be inexistent.'*

2.1.2 The Claimant’s request that the Award be supplemented to reflect a correct
valuation of the confiscated assets

30. The Claimant requests that the Tribunal supplement the Award to include assets which it
alleges were also expropriated by the Supreme Court Directive. In the Claimant’s view,
rather than using the value of “all equipment and materials” as a starting point to establish
the value of the assets expropriated by the Directive, the Tribunal used the value of the
“equipment and machinery” and thus failed to take into account (i) five seawater pumps,
which the Claimant state were confiscated by the Customs Authority pursuant to the
Directive and (ii) a “significant amount of cement,” which the Claimant contends was

confiscated at the sea port of Turkmenistan pursuant to the Directive.!”

31. The Claimant contends that the Tribunal “likely missed these amounts because the values
were presented with respect to the Avaza Canal project.”?? However, according to the

Claimant,

“this was merely a matter of ‘presentation’ in order to avoid duplicating claimed
amounts elsewhere. As also indicated during the hearing by Claimant’s Counsel, the
Arbitral Tribunal could use the amounts quantified by Hill and Mazars to determine
the value of what was expropriated.””!

Conclusion: Claimant’s sized machinery is not expropriatory.” (Reply, para. 176 (original emphasis omitted).

In the Claimant’s view, proposition B being incorrect, it must be corrected and the conclusion must change:

“A — A seizure is expropriatory only when the difference between the value of the Claimant’s seized machinery and
the amount due to Respondent is a large, positive value.

B — The difference between the value of the Claimant’s seized machinery and the amount due to Respondent is a large,
positive value.

Conclusion: Claimant’s sized machinery is expropriatory.” (Reply, para. 177 (original emphasis omitted)).

According to the Claimant, the value of the five seawater pumps and cement amounts to

EUR 3,280,699 or USD 3,918,794.”

In the Reply, the Claimant clarified that its request for a supplementary decision is
“secondary.””? However, contrary to the Respondent’s allegation, it does not amount to a
new claim.”* The Claimant refers in this respect to portions of its memorials and expert
reports which show that (i) the pumps were never paid for, were held at Customs and have a

specific value,?>

and that (ii) the value of the cement was also cited.”° The Claimant argues
that, “[w]hile the claims could clearly have been made in a more straightforward manner,
they were claimed with far more particularity than Respondent’s vague allegations that it
‘did not know’ if insurance had been repaid.”?” According to the Claimant, the claims “also
clearly show that the difference between the amounts that were confiscated by Respondent

were many millions of USD greater than the machinery and equipment claim alone would

suggest.”

2.1.3. The Claimant’s argument that the Tribunal made “gross errors” when
calculating the difference between the confiscated assets and the delay
penalties

The “gross errors” which the Claimant alleges should be rectified by the Tribunal include

“using the incorrect amount of delay penalties;” “an obvious error with respect to whether

inter-company transfers represent a positive or negative value;” “an incorrect deduction for
insurance payments;” “the Tribunal’s incorrect deduction for depreciation;” “the
mathematically-incorrect deduction of USD 1,200,000 from an already depreciated amount;
and “the mathematically-incorrect deduction of USD 23,000 from an already depreciated

amount.”

2.1.3.1 The Claimant’s argument that the amount of delay penalties used by the
Tribunal is incorrect

The Claimant argues that the amount of delay penalties used by the Tribunal, namely USD
2,812,786 + USD 419,112 = USD 3,231,898, is wrong”? and should be reduced to USD
3,096,974.3!_ The Claimant provides a table at paragraph 26 of its Request, which

summarizes the evidence on record, in support of its contention.

According to the Claimant, the Respondent does not contest that the Tribunal did not use the
correct figure.*? Contrary to the Respondent’s position, whether or not the amount is “de
minimis” is irrelevant. According to the Claimant, Article 49(2) is not “a la carte;”** all

arithmetical and clerical errors, whether small or significant, must be corrected.?°

2.1.3.2 The Claimant’s argument that the Tribunal made “a gross error” as to
whether inter-company transfers represent a positive or negative value

According to the Claimant, the Tribunal made a “gross error, confusing positive and negative

values”6

when it criticized the Claimant for failing to explain why the Tribunal should take
into account inter-company invoices which were USD 1.8 million higher than the original
supplier invoices. The Claimant argues that the Tribunal misunderstood Mr Qureshi’s
comment on this point in his Second Report and as a result erroneously deducted this amount

from the total value of the confiscated assets.7” According to the Claimant:

“All that Mr Qureshi does in his Second Report is to concede that when supplier
invoices are used, as he suggested, the value of the expropriated assets in fact increases
(not decreases), showing that there was nothing remotely suspect about Claimant’s
use of initial inter-company invoices initially which, in fact, understated (not
overstated) the value of the expropriated machinery and equipment.”**

40. The Claimant further argues that the Respondent agrees that the valuation based on the

original supplier invoices was USD 1.8 million higher than the inter-company invoices.*?
The fact that the USD 1.8 million deduction was unanimous is irrelevant.“? The Claimant
also emphasizes that, as the Respondent implicitly agrees,*! the Tribunal subtracted this
amount without being requested to do so either by the Respondent or by its expert, Mr
Qureshi.” The Tribunal’s error cannot be explained by the Respondent’s allegation that the
Claimant’s evidence was unreliable.4? While the Respondent’s argument is, in the
Claimant’s view, an effort to appeal “to the Tribunal’s worst instincts and prejudice,” it is
clear that the initial supplier invoices produced by the Claimant were held by the Tribunal to

be satisfactory evidence.*

confiscated assets.** Specifically, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal “rectify its
inadvertent error in paragraph 372 of the Award by replacing the word ‘higher’ by ‘lower’

and by correcting its calculations relying on this inadvertent error.”*?

2.1.3.3 The Claimant’s argument that the Tribunal made an incorrect deduction for
insurance payments

The Claimant contends that “the majority also incorrectly subtracts USD 2.6 million for

50

hypothetical insurance payments that were never made. The Claimant refers to Ms

Lamm’s Partially Dissenting Opinion, which in the Claimant’s view rightly criticized this

51

subtraction.°' According to the Claimant, if the Respondent had any evidence that showed

the insurance payments had been made, it would have submitted it, but it did not.>?

The Claimant also notes that during the document production phase it produced email
correspondence between an official of Yap Kredi Leasing and Ozan ickale dated 10 January
2013, in response to the Respondent’s own document production request.>? The Respondent
was therefore aware, based on the contents of this correspondence, that “the insurance
policies of the leased machinery and equipment did not cover the confiscation of these assets

by a State.”>+

The Claimant further contends that it did not have the opportunity to produce this document
in the arbitration.®> As Mr Qureshi addressed the issue in his Second Report, which was
submitted with the Respondent’s Rejoinder on the Merits, the Claimant had no opportunity
to address Mr Qureshi’s allegations.°° Even then, Mr Qureshi never made a “positive,
particularised allegation that Claimant was actually reimbursed by insurance.”°*’ Nor did the
Respondent in its Rejoinder on the Merits or at the hearing make any such argument.°®> Had
the Respondent done so, it would have had the burden of proving its allegation.’ The
Claimant insists that the Respondent should have proved, which it did not, that “the leased

equipment was insured by political risk insurance, that Claimant was reimbursed by

insurance, that Claimant was required to obtain political risk insurance, or that such political

risk insurance even existed for Turkish companies.”°°

The Claimant further argues that, although the Respondent had the burden of proof on this
issue, the Claimant “had already shown that it was required to pay the amount of leased
agreements by submitting positive evidence which is a Debt Liquidation Agreement
Ex.C-212 (Claimant’s Reply), which clearly states that Claimant was under the obligation to

pay the amounts of leased machinery and equipment back to the leasing company.”*!

The Claimant contends that the majority of the Tribunal was wrong to assume that insurance
payments would be made on the basis of 100% of the historical acquisition costs of the
machinery rather than the decreased value that would take into account depreciation over
time.©? According to the Claimant, “political risk insurance never reimburses 100% of the

63

initial value of assets, only net value. Indeed, the Tribunal’s calculation produces “an

improper negative value”®*

as it results in deducting an “undepreciated amount from a
depreciated amount.”® The Claimant requests that this amount not be subtracted from the
value of the confiscated assets. The Tribunal “should only subtract the amount of insurance
payments that Respondent has actually proven (i.e., USD 0 in the instant case) or, if the
Majority insists on being unfair, the amount of insurance that could be potentially paid for

expropriated assets (i.e., less than 100%).”°7

2.1.3.4 The Claimant’s argument that the Tribunal made an incorrect deduction for
depreciation

The Claimant argues that, “by taking into account the depreciated value of the [confiscated]

machinery and equipment as USD 10,000,000” rather than its acquisition value of USD

13.9 million, the Tribunal has failed “to rule upon an issue that was put to it,” namely
determining “the precise reduction that it would like to apply to the value of the machinery

and equipment for depreciation despite the fact that it had all the necessary elements to

determine this value.”

48. According to the Claimant, there is no justification for the Tribunal’s ruling that the Claimant
did not prove the loss of value owing to depreciation.” First, it was the Respondent and not
the Claimant who made the allegation that “rather than using replacement costs the

machinery should be valued at historical costs from which depreciation should be

v7l

subtracted. The Respondent therefore had the burden of proving the amount to be

subtracted for depreciation,” as arbitral tribunals such as the Petrolane tribunal have

1.74

required.’> The Respondent however failed to prove the amount.”* Second, in the Claimant’s

view, the Tribunal should have “asked for questions and further precisions by the parties;””>

accepted or followed up on the calculations that the Claimant’s expert, Mr Almaci, offered

at the hearing;’° relied upon an expert to calculate depreciation;”’ or done the calculation

itself,”* including online using the “Straight Line Depreciation Method.””? The Claimant

requests that the Tribunal “take the Straight Line Depreciation Method into consideration as

areasonable method for determining the amount of depreciation, and to calculate the amount

Award.”®°

The Claimant also argues that the Tribunal appears to have made further mathematical

errors.*!

The Claimant infers from paragraph 375 and footnote 226 of the Award and
paragraph 23 of Ms Lamm’s Partially Dissenting Opinion*? that the Tribunal deducted USD
6.3 million from the acquisition value of the confiscated assets (USD 13.9 million) and
contends that the latter figure is based on an incorrect reading of Mr Qureshi’s Second
Report.** While Mr Qureshi indicates in his Second Report that the USD 6.3 million figure
corresponds to the acquisition value of the machinery and equipment aged between four and
nine years,** the Tribunal appears to have subtracted this amount from the total acquisition
value “in order to determine what it considered to be the depreciated amount” as if the value
of the assets aged between four and nine years were nil.** This, according to the Claimant,
is “obviously wrong.”** In order to correct this error, “the Tribunal must either not deduct
USD 6.3 million for the total value of machinery, or not refer to Mr Qureshi’s amount for

the machinery older than 4 years as a justification to is finding that ‘the evidence before the

Tribunal suggests that the depreciated value of the assets was substantially less than USD 10

million, the amount mentioned by Mr Almaci.””*”

According to the Claimant, the Tribunal has also “mixed apples and oranges” by subtracting
undepreciated values from the depreciated value proposed by the Claimant’s expert, and
made a mathematical error,** which has resulted in deducting more than 100% of the initial

invoice value of the assets.*” Because the Tribunal used the depreciation rate proposed by

 

sue is a request for rectification and

not a request for a supplementary decision, as wrongly suggested by the Respondent. (Reply, para. 84.)

the Claimant’s expert to determine the starting value of the confiscated assets, it should have

used the same rate for its deductions.”
Finally, in the Reply, the Claimant requests that:

“Tf for any reason Tribunal does not rectify, as it obliged [sic], the errors related to the
depreciation although it has the elements to do so in its possession, and it does not
modify its conclusion by accepting the depreciation provided by Claimant at the
hearing or by performing its own basic calculations, Claimant respectfully requests the
Tribunal, alternatively, to make a supplementary decision and to apply the depreciation
rate it considers reasonable with the help of an expert.””!

2.1.3.5 The Claimant’s argument that the deduction of USD 1,200,000 from an
already-depreciated amount is mathematically incorrect

The Claimant submits that the Tribunal wrongly subtracted USD 1.2 million for confiscated
assets that were allegedly transferred to third parties from “already depreciated equipment
costs, rather than from the cost of the equipment.”*? This results in “a deduction of over

993

100% of the value of the allegedly transferred assets,””’ which is mathematically incorrect.

The Claimant asserts that, contrary to what is argued by the Respondent, the Claimant did
provide reliable evidence in relation to the original purchase value of the equipment, as
recognized by the Tribunal.** According to the Claimant, the Tribunal can only deduct
depreciated values from the depreciated starting value using the Claimant’s proposed

depreciation rate.”

depreciated value of 10 million trans

2.1.3.6 The Claimant’s argument that the deduction of USD 23,000 from an already
depreciated amount is mathematically incorrect

The Claimant argues that the Tribunal cannot deduct USD 23,000 on the basis of double
counting from already depreciated costs because this amounts to “a deduction of over

100%.”°°

According to the Claimant, it had submitted to the Tribunal “all the necessary evidence to
decide the case.”°’ Based on this evidence, “[tJhe Tribunal should have deducted the USD
23,000 from the original purchase value, or depreciated this amount and deducted it from the
depreciated value of USD 10 million using the depreciation rate of approximately 28,52% of

which the Tribunal was in possession.”

2.1.4 The Claimant’s Request for Relief

In its Request, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal correct all of the arithmetic, clerical
and similar errors identified by the Claimant as they are so obvious that they “could not be
made knowingly by neutral arbitrators.”°? The Claimant’s summarizes its corrections as

follows:

“Acquisition value of USD 13.990 million (value of the machinery and equipment
based on supplier invoices) + USD 3,918,794 (acquisition value of 5 pumps at the
Turkmenistan Customs Authority and the cement left at the Turkmenistan Maritime
Authority) - USD 3,096,974 (actual delay penalty amounts) — USD 3.9 million (loss
due to depreciation of materials and equipment) - USD 1,200,000 (value of allegedly
transferred assets) - USD 23,000 (value of allegedly double-counted assets) = USD
9,688,820 (the difference between the value of the expropriated assets and the delay
penalties after all relevant offsets).”!°

In the Reply, the amount calculated by the Claimant is “slightly higher” than the amount
calculated in the Request (USD 9,947,624 as opposed to USD 9,688,820) “due to the correct

deduction of USD 1,200,000 (value of allegedly transferred assets) and USD 23,000 (value

of allegedly double-counted assets) before the depreciation.”!°!

The Claimant further requests the Tribunal to correct its finding of expropriation as a result
of the corrected calculations.'” It also requests that the Tribunal “issue a Supplementary
Decision concerning the value of the pumps and cement, which can also deal with any
outstanding issues concerning expropriation where the Tribunal would find additional
guidance from the Parties to be helpful.”!°? The Claimant further requests that the Tribunal
rectify its decision on costs and rule that the Respondent shall pay the Claimant’s costs in
connection with this arbitration since the “Claimant has proven that Respondent’s actions are
unjust and in violation of the Turkey-Turkmenistan BIT, and only the majority’s obviously

incorrect calculations unjustly deprived Claimant from a ruling in its favour.”!*

In its Request, the Claimant requests the Tribunal:

“(i) To supplement the Award to include the materials (S pumps and cement), which
were also expropriated by the Supreme Court’s Directive;

(ii) to correct all arithmetic, clerical and similar errors in paragraphs 372-376 of the
Award;

(iii) to rule that the Supreme Court of Turkmenistan’s Directive dated 9 June 2010 was
excessive and expropriatory;

(iv) to rule that Respondent shall pay USD 9,688,820 to Claimant as a result of the
actions of Turkmenistan;

(v) to rule that Respondent shall pay the costs of Claimant in connection with this
Arbitration.”!°

In its Reply, the Claimant requests the Tribunal:

“(i) to supplement the Award to include the materials (5 pumps and cement), which
were also expropriated by the Supreme Court’s Directive;

(ii) to rectify all arithmetic, clerical and similar errors in paragraphs 371-376 of the
Award;

(iii) to draw the necessary inference that the Supreme Court of Turkmenistan’s
Directive dated 9 June 2010 was, after rectification of the Majority’s errors, plainly
excessive and expropriatory;

(iv) to rule that Respondent shall pay USD 9,947,624 to Claimant as a result of the
actions of Turkmenistan plus interests; and

(v) to draw the necessary inference and rule that Respondent shall pay the costs of
Claimant in connection with this Arbitration.”!°°

The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that the Claimant’s Request should be rejected, and that the Claimant

should be ordered to pay the costs of the Request.!°7

According to the Respondent, while the “dearth of evidence and incoherent arguments”!°®

put forward by the Claimant should have led it “to walk away from a failed and misguided
gamble,”!” the Claimant has elected “to attempt to re-open the merits of issues already
decided by the Tribunal, re-plead its case, present new claims, new evidence, new
methodologies, new arguments on issues that it could have and should have addressed before,

and ask the Tribunal to change its decision on the merits.”!!°

According to the Respondent, the Claimant’s Request falls outside the scope of Article 49(2)

of the ICSID Convention,''' and none of the grounds that the Claimant asserts for

106 Reply, para. 190. At paragraph 188, the Claimant states that, “[i]f Claimant’s request for a supplemental decision
concerning the materials were not granted, then the Tribunal would find a mathematical difference in value of: USD
6,028,830 = USD 9,947,624 (the remaining amount after the relevant offsets) - USD 3,918,794 (acquisition value of
5 pumps at the Turkmenistan Customs Authority and the cement left at the Turkmenistan Maritime Authority).”

supplementation or rectification can succeed.'!? Even if the Claimant’s requests for
rectification concerned errors within the meaning of Article 49(2), “neither the
supplementary decision Claimant seeks, nor any of the alleged errors that Claimant seeks to

rectify, nor the sum of all of these, would affect the Tribunal’s ultimate decision to dismiss

Claimant’s expropriation claim.”!!?

2.2.1 The scope of Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention

64. The Respondent submits that the Claimant’s Request “has nothing to do”!'* with the
procedure provided for in Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention. In the Respondent’s view,
leaving aside the requirements of this provision, “there is no justification for the relief
Claimant is requesting, under any standard.”!'> The Claimant cannot introduce new factual
evidence in the context of a request pursuant to Article 49(2) and does not understand how

the rules allocating the burden of proof operate.!!°

of Article 49(2) is narrow, and that the provision “cannot be invoked to appeal or challenge

the substance or validity of the Tribunal’s decision.”!°

relies, does not help its case.!32 While the RDC tribunal acceded to the claimant’s first
request for rectification and corrected its computational error and, therefore, the amount of
damages awarded, this correction did not lead the RDC tribunal to change its reasoning or
methodology, its finding on liability or on any aspect of the merits of the case, or its decision
on costs.!3 The Claimant, which also relies on the dissent in RDC v. Guatemala, fails to
refer to the majority’s decision regarding the second request for rectification,'* in which the

majority emphasized the “very limited nature” of its power under Article 49(2):

“Tt was not for the Tribunal to go beyond what Claimant pleaded prior to the Award
and consider the mathematical implications of Claimant’s approach when Claimant
itself did not take them into account. In these circumstances to rectify the Award as
requested is not just a simple mathematical operation, it implies the Tribunal accepting
a change of pleading in the context of a rectification request. This is beyond the power
of the Tribunal under Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention.”!*>

Soufraki v. Egypt'*® and GAMI y. Mexico, as follows:'*?

“Claimant ignores the fact that, throughout the case, it bore the legal burden of proof
on the issue of the value of the allegedly expropriated assets. That burden did not (and
indeed cannot in any circumstances) shift to Respondent. The relevant question is not
whether Claimant produced better evidence on this issue than Respondent, but whether
Claimant’s evidence was sufficient to carry its legal burden on that issue. The Majority
determined that it was not.”!4°

2.2.2 The Respondent’s argument that the Claimant has presented no valid grounds
for supplementation or rectification

The Respondent contends that, in order to prove that the Supreme Court Directive was
expropriatory, the Claimant unsuccessfully seeks “to ‘supplement’ the value of the assets
allegedly expropriated by virtue of the Directive by identifying additional items that it argues
were not taken into account by the Tribunal namely, five sea water pumps and a quantity of
cement, both of which were supposedly purchased for the Avaza Canal project, and which
Claimant asserts have a combined value of 3,280,699 Euros (US$3,918,794);”!4! “to reduce
the amount of the delay penalties that were the subject of the court judgments at issue;”!4
and “to challenge certain ‘deductions’ to the estimated value of the assets allegedly affected
by the Directive put forward by Claimant’s expert, which the Tribunal applied when it was
attempting to arrive at a reasonably plausible valuation of those assets.”!4 These deductions
include (a) the deduction of USD 1.8 million in respect of discrepancies in the prices of
equipment and machinery as reflected in inter-company invoices; (b) the deduction of USD

2.6 million for insurance payments; (c) the appropriate deduction for depreciation; (d) the

deduction of USD 1.2 million for assets which the Claimant used after they were allegedly

confiscated; and (e) the deduction of USD 23,000 for double counting.

2.2.2.1 The Claimant’s claim that seawater pumps and cement should be included in
the value of the allegedly expropriated assets is submitted for the first time in
this arbitration

The Respondent contends that the Claimant never alleged that five seawater pumps and
cement were expropriated as a result of the Directive, and never included their value in the
quantum it claimed for allegedly confiscated assets.'** Since the Claimant never submitted

this claim for compensation, the Tribunal cannot be blamed for failing to decide it.'*

According to the Respondent, the Claimant is in reality seeking to amend its claim for
compensation for allegedly expropriated assets under the guise of a request for a
supplementary decision.'#° Indeed, the detailed list of allegedly expropriated items that the
Claimant’s expert, Mazars, submitted with the Memorial did not include the seawater pumps
and the cement. Nor were they identified or valued in the Claimant’s claim for compensation
for allegedly expropriated assets.'*” These items were also absent from the claim in the Reply

on the Merits and Mazars’ Second Report.'“

In the Respondent’s view, “[i]t would have been easy, and, indeed, necessary, for Mazars to
note on its list of expropriated assets for Avaza Canal, or somewhere in its report, that it was
intentionally omitting the pumps and cement even though they were also expropriated, if that
were the case.”!4° It was up to the Claimant and Mazars, not to the Tribunal, to specify what
items were to be included or excluded in each of the Claimant’s heads of claim.'°° Contrary
to the Claimant’s allegation, the value of the pumps was not indicated and accounted for

elsewhere; the Hill International Second Report discusses the pumps in the section on alleged

“additional work” for the Avaza Canal project, but does not mention their value anywhere.'*!
As for the value of the cement, the Hill International Second Report is also the only place
where it is discussed, in connection with the “additional works” relating to the Avaza Canal
project.'°?. The Claimant cannot now claim the cost of cement as damages for a different
breach and under a different head of damages.'*? This not only falls outside the realm of
Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention, but also raises an issue of due process since the
Respondent never had the opportunity to address this new claim for the value of pumps and

cement. !*4

Moreover, if the Respondent had to address it now, the Respondent would need to conduct
factual investigations, to consult its experts, and to submit factual and legal arguments.!*>
The Respondent argues that the Claimant “has not even made a prima facie showing that the

156

pumps and cement were in fact affected by the Directive. Indeed, the Claimant’s

argument that the omission of the pumps and cement as allegedly expropriated assets was a
matter of presentation intended to avoid duplication is contradicted by its own expert
according to whom these items should be treated as “consumables” or a cost of the project
rather than as assets of the Claimant.'°’ According to the Respondent, the Claimant’s new
claim would require additional investigation and evidence, including a number of
discrepancies between the Claimant’s allegations and the exhibits it relies upon,'** and has

no place in a rectification or supplementation procedure. !*?

The Respondent notes that the Claimant itself has minimized the importance of its request

by characterizing it as “secondary.” According to the Respondent, this confirms that it

should be rejected.'

2.2.2.2. The amount of delay penalties calculated by the Tribunal does not require
correction

The Respondent contends that the “relatively de minimis” difference in amount that the
Claimant has identified between the Tribunal’s and the Claimant’s calculation of the delay
penalties, USD 134,924, would not have changed the Tribunal’s decision as to the excessive

nature of the Directive.!°!

In addition, the majority identified two alternate figures for the delay penalties, USD
3,231,898 (including the USD 419,221 for the Abadan School and Abadan Kindergarten
projects) and USD 2,812,786 (not including the USD 419,221), which it then used to
calculate, “for illustrative purposes,” the difference between the “assumed actual value” of

the allegedly expropriated assets and the delay penalties.'™

The Respondent argues that the
Claimant’s proposed “correct amount” (USD 3,096,974) falls within the range of delay

penalties identified by the Tribunal.'®

As a result, according to the Respondent, the Tribunal’s alleged error does not require

correction!

2.2.2.3. The Claimant’s arguments regarding the deductions applied by the Tribunal
to the estimated value of the assets allegedly affected by the Directive are
inappropriate and would not in any event justify a reversal of the Tribunal’s
decision on expropriation

The Respondent contends that the presentation of arguments and evidence by the Claimant
was “often incoherent, inconsistent, and incomplete.”!®> The Claimant had the burden of
providing sufficient evidence to determine the value of the allegedly expropriated assets,
which it failed to do.'® In the absence of a reliable estimate of this value, the Tribunal

exercised, in the Respondent’s view, “its best judgment [...] in order to reach a reasoned

decision on the claim for expropriation of such property.”!®’ It applied all the deductions

unanimously, except those relating to the insurance payments.!©*

The Respondent further argues that “[e]ven if Claimant’s arguments and proposed
modifications of the Tribunal’s adjustments were appropriate, which they are not, they would
not justify a reversal of the Tribunal’s decision rejecting the claim for expropriation of the
equipment and machinery, under the standards of Article 49(2) or under any standard of

fairness and due process.”!©°

2.2.2.4 The deduction of USD 1.8 million regarding discrepancies in the prices of

quir and hinery refl in the inter- pany invoices for these
items

The Respondent argues that the Claimant’s position regarding the USD 1.8 million
deduction, which was applied by the Tribunal unanimously, ignores one of the criticisms
made by Mr Qureshi in his Second Report that there were significant unexplained
discrepancies between the value of certain equipment and machinery as reflected in the
original supplier invoices and the value of the same items as reflected in the inter-company
invoices for these items.'”° While “PwC noted that the net impact of relying exclusively on
the original supplier invoices was a valuation which was US$1.8 million higher than

”°!71 the fact remains that the evidence as to the value of the

previously asserted by Claimant,
equipment and machinery was unreliable because of the many unexplained discrepancies. !7*
The Claimant and its experts, Mazars, failed to address these discrepancies although they

had “multiple opportunities” to do so at the hearing and in the post-hearing submission.!7

The Respondent concludes that the Tribunal’s substantive finding that the “Claimant has

failed to explain or demonstrate on what basis the Tribunal should take into account the

and insusceptible of being challenged as an “error” within the meaning of Article 49(2) of
the ICSID Convention.'> The Tribunal exercised its judgment on the basis of the evidence

and arguments before it.'7°

The Respondent also disagrees with the Claimant’s position that any adjustments resulting
from the inter-company invoices should have been made prior to the adjustment for
depreciation.'”” According to the Respondent, addressing this issue would require additional
factual and expert evidence, which again shows that the Claimant “failed to carry its burden
of proving the value of its equipment and machinery; both the original purchase value, as

well as the depreciated value.”!78

2.2.2.5 The deduction of USD 2.6 million for insurance payments

The Respondent contends that, contrary to the Claimant’s position, the question of insurance
arrangements for the allegedly expropriated assets and their impact on the valuation of these
assets was raised in both the Counter-Memorial and PwC’s First Report.!”” When PwC’s
Second Report criticized Mazars’ own Second Report for apparently not taking into account

180

“insurance cover and potential claims or reimbursement from insurers,”'*? the Claimant and

its expert did not respond.'*!

Moreover, despite being ordered to produce insurance arrangements during the document
production phase, the Claimant failed to do so, with the exception of one brief email, which
was not put in the record and was “generated during the course of this Arbitration and
specifically during the document production period.”!*? The Respondent also points out that

the email “does not indicate the identity of the sender [...], nor does it identify what lease,

what equipment or machinery, or what insurance arrangement was the subject of this
particular email communication.”!*? As a result, the Claimant cannot possibly claim that the
Respondent was aware that the Claimant’s insurance policies did not cover the allegedly

expropriated assets or that this email proved this alleged absence of insurance coverage. !**

The Claimant’s allegation that it had no opportunity to rebut Mr Qureshi’s arguments
regarding the insurance arrangements when in reality it failed to do so is, in the Respondent’s

view, equally baseless.!*°

So is the Claimant’s attempt to recast the Debt Liquidation
Agreement as “positive evidence” that it received no insurance payments when this
Agreement was never before identified as being relevant to the issue of insurance

payments.!8°

The Respondent submits that it is no excuse for the Claimant to argue that the Respondent

 

bore the burden of proof; it did not.'8? The Respondent insists that the Claimant had the
burden of proving the value of the allegedly expropriated assets and failed to respond to the
Respondent’s arguments regarding the insurance arrangements with evidence that the

Claimant alone could have had in its possession. '**

Finally, the Claimant’s argument that the Tribunal “should not have assumed that an
insurance company would make a hypothetical insurance payment to Claimant based on
100% of the historical acquisition costs of the machinery” since the value of the machinery
would decline over time, should be rejected.'*? The Respondent underscores that “(i)
Claimant never made this argument during the Arbitration, (ii) Claimant never suggested an
appropriate rate of depreciation during the Arbitration, and (iii) Claimant never produced the
relevant insurance agreements, claims or reimbursement documents which would have

permitted the Tribunal to understand the terms of any reimbursement by the insurance

arguments and provide evidence on the issue of insurance arrangements and cannot use the

rectification procedure to present new evidence post-award.!?!

2.2.2.6 The appropriate deduction for depreciation

The Respondent disputes the Claimant’s contention (i) that the Tribunal failed to rule on the
issue of the amount to be deducted from the value of allegedly expropriated assets owing to
depreciation or (ii) that if the Tribunal was not satisfied with the evidence offered by the

Claimant, it should have taken steps to remedy this.!°”

In the Respondent’s view, the Claimant refused throughout the arbitration to acknowledge
that depreciation should be taken into account, including at the hearing and in its Post-
Hearing Brief.'” For the Respondent, this is not an issue that the Tribunal failed to decide,
but rather one that “Claimant and its expert failed to address with sufficient and reliable
evidence, despite having had the opportunity to do so.”!°4 The Claimant had the legal burden
of proving the value of the allegedly expropriated assets and elected to use a methodology
that did not account for depreciation, a weakness which the Respondent identified and the
Claimant never remedied.'*> The Claimant’s reliance on the Petrolane case to argue that the

4,196

Tribunal should have performed its own depreciation calculations is misplace including

because it is distinguishable from the present one.'” Similarly, the Claimant’s argument that
the Tribunal should have appointed an expert overlooks the fact that this is uncommon,
discretionary, cannot be done in the context of a rectification, and raises due process

issues. !°8

According to the Respondent, the Claimant also erroneously asserts that the Tribunal made
a deduction of USD 6.3 million to calculate the value of the allegedly expropriated assets;!”
the Tribunal never used this figure in its calculation. Instead, the Tribunal adopted “for
argument’s sake” the value of USD 10 million which the Claimant’s expert proposed at the
hearing as the depreciated value of those assets.?"! The Tribunal then held that “the evidence
before the Tribunal suggests that the depreciated value of the assets was substantially less
than USD 10 million [...].”?°? In support of this proposition, the Tribunal referred to PwC’s
Second Report, which merely referred to “evidence in the record that a significant portion of
the equipment and machinery included in Claimant’s expropriation claim was more than four
years old, and that this was another reason why Claimant’s expert’s US$10 million figure
was unreliable.”?°> The Respondent stresses that the Tribunal’s valuation was not designed
to be a precise quantitative exercise, but was used “to make a qualitative judgment as to
whether that Directive was so ‘excessive’ as to be considered an ‘expropriation’ in violation

of the Treaty.”

The Respondent concludes that there is no basis to make any supplementary decision on the
issue of the appropriate deduction for depreciation. The Tribunal has already decided this

issue.

2.2.2.7 The deduction of USD 1.2 million for assets which were used by the Claimant
after the alleged confiscation

The Respondent contends that the Claimant’s pleadings on the original value of the allegedly
confiscated assets were deficient, and evidence as to the appropriate rate of depreciation was

absent.?°° The Respondent points out that, “[i]n these circumstances, it is difficult to fault

the Tribunal for taking the assumed depreciated value of Claimant’s equipment and

accepted deductions to that amount.”?°” Far from being a request for the rectification of a
clerical or arithmetical error, the Claimant’s request would imply a reconsideration of the

merits, which Article 49(2) does not allow.?%

2.2.2.8 The deduction of USD 23,000 for double counting

The Respondent argues that, while the Claimant blames the Tribunal for erroneously
“deducting USD 23,000 for alleged double counting of assets from already depreciated

costs,”2

the Tribunal was not in a position to make calculations in the way the Claimant
suggests because “Claimant did not provide sufficient information or evidence to support
any finding either as to the original purchase value of Claimant’s equipment and machinery,
or as to the appropriate rate of depreciation to be applied after the accepted deductions had

been applied.”?!°

According to the Respondent, the proposed “correction” thus cannot be made and even if it
could, it would not justify a reversal of the Tribunal’s decision on the Claimant’s

expropriation claim.7!!

2.2.3. The Respondent’s Request for Relief

In its Observations, the Respondent requests that, for the reasons set out in the Observations,

3 THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

97. The relevant legal provisions governing supplementary decisions and rectification of errors
by ICSID tribunals are Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule
49. Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:

“The Tribunal upon the request of a party made within 45 days after the date on which
the award was rendered may after notice to the other party decide any question which
it had omitted to decide in the award, and shall rectify any clerical, arithmetical or
similar error in the award. Its decision shall become part of the award and shall be
notified to the parties in the same manner as the award. The periods of time provided
for under paragraph (2) of Article 51 and paragraph (2) of Article 52 shall run from
the date on which the decision was rendered.”
98. As set out above, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal make a supplementary decision to
resolve a question that the Tribunal allegedly omitted to decide in the Award, and that it

correct certain errors in the Award that require rectification.

99. The procedure governing the submission, receipt and processing of requests for a
supplementary decision or for the rectification of an award is set out in ICSID Arbitration

Rule 49 (“Supplementary Decisions and Rectification”), which provides:

“(1) Within 45 days of the date on which the award was rendered, either party may
request, pursuant to Article 49(2) of the Convention, a supplementary decision on, or
rectification of, the award. Such a request shall be addressed in writing to the
Secretary-General. The request shall:

(a)identify the award to which it relates;

(b)indicate the date of the request;

(c)state in detail:

(i) any question which, in the opinion of the requesting party, the Tribunal
omitted to decide in the award; and

(ii) any error in the award which the requesting party seeks to have rectified;
and

(d) be accompanied by a fee for lodging the request.
(2) Upon receipt of the request and of the lodging fee, the Secretary-General shall

forthwith:

31

100.

101.

3.1

102.

(a) register the request:
(b) notify the parties of the registration;

(c) transmit to the other party a copy of the request and of any accompanying
documentation; and

(d) transmit to each member of the Tribunal a copy of the notice of registration,
together with a copy of the request and of any accompanying documentation.

(3) The President of the Tribunal shall consult the members on whether it is necessary
for the Tribunal to meet in order to consider the request. The Tribunal shall fix a time
limit for the parties to file their observations on the request and shall determine the
procedure for its consideration.

(4) Rule 46-48 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to any decision for the Tribunal pursuant
to this Rule.

(5) If a request is received by the Secretary-General more than 45 days after the award
was rendered, he shall refuse to register the request and so inform forthwith the
requesting party.”
The Tribunal has provided the Parties with an opportunity to file observations pursuant to
ICSID Arbitration Rule 49(3), and has applied ICSID Arbitration Rules 46-48, mutatis

mutandis, in preparing this decision, as required by ICSID Arbitration Rule 49(4).

The Tribunal will address each of the Claimant’s two requests in turn below.

The Claimant’s Request for Supplementary Decision

According to Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal “may [...] decide any
question which it had omitted to decide in the award” in a supplementary decision. Such a
decision “shall become part of the award and shall be notified to the parties in the same
manner as the award.” The language used in Article 49(2) (“may”) suggests that the tribunal
may decide, in its discretion, whether a supplementary decision is required or indeed

appropriate. This is the position adopted by other ICSID tribunals.”!+

2I4 See, e.g., Railroad Development Corporation v. Republic of Guatemala, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/23, Decision on
Claimant’s Request for Supplementation and Rectification of Award, 18 January 2013, Exhibit CA-4, para. 39 (“The
Tribunal observes that the Parties are in agreement that the Tribunal has discretion as to whether or not to supplement

an award under the terms of Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention.

 

term ‘may’ leaves no doubt that this is the

case when the Tribunal has omitted to decide a question submitted to it.”)

32

103. The Tribunal notes that the scope of Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention is limited. The
provision provides a mechanism to remedy “inadvertent omissions and minor technical
errors in the award,” but “[i]t is not designed to afford a substantive review or reconsideration
of the decision;” rather its purpose is to “enable[] the tribunal to correct mistakes that may
have occurred in the award’s drafting in a non-bureaucratic and expeditious manner.”?'> This
position has been confirmed by ICSID tribunals, and by the ad hoc committee in Vivendi v.

Argentina, which stressed that:

“[I]t is important to state that that procedure [i.e. supplementation and rectification],
and any supplementary decision or rectification as may result, in no way consists of a
means of appealing or otherwise revisiting the merits of the decision subject to
supplementation or rectification.”?!°
104. The Claimant requests that the Award be supplemented. According to the Claimant, the
Tribunal’s decision on the Claimant’s expropriation claim relating to the assets allegedly
confiscated as a result of the Supreme Court Directive only considered the value of “all
equipment and machinery,” even though the Directive applied to “all equipment and
materials.” The Claimant contends that the Tribunal in particular failed to take into account
five seawater pumps allegedly confiscated by the Customs Authority pursuant to the
Directive, and a “significant amount of” cement that was similarly said to have been

confiscated at the sea port of Turkmenistan pursuant to the Directive.

105. The Claimant explains that the relevant invoices were provided in the Second Report of Hill

International and amount to over EUR 3 million, and that “[t]he Tribunal likely missed these

amounts because the values were presented with respect to the Avaza Canal project.”?!”

However, according to the Claimant, this was merely “‘a matter of presentation” in order to

avoid duplication, referring to Mr Almaci’s explanations at the hearing.”!® The Claimant

notes that its counsel also mentioned at the hearing that “the Arbitral Tribunal could use the

amounts quantified by Hill and Mazars to determine the value of what was expropriated.”?!?

106. As summarized above, the Respondent argues that the Claimant’s argument constitutes a
“new claim.”??° According to the Respondent, the Claimant “never once asserted — let alone
proved — that these items were expropriated as a result of the Directive, nor did Claimant
include the value of these items in the quantum it claimed for allegedly confiscated assets.”??!
The Respondent contends that the Claimant has not even made a prima facie showing that
the pumps and cement were in fact affected by the Directive; indeed, the evidence suggests
that there were only three seawater pumps, and that the Claimant had already invoiced the
contractual counterparty for them. In other words, the seawater pumps were not assets but
consumables and “were incorporated into the project and were billed to the Contractual

Counterparty.””?? According to the Respondent, the same applies to the cement.2>

107. The Tribunal has carefully reviewed the Parties’ submissions and evidence, including expert
reports, in order to determine whether it omitted to decide a “question” relating to the
Claimant’s confiscation claim. It has concluded that the claims for the seawater pumps and
cement were not presented on the basis of these having been expropriated by the Supreme
Court Directive; the Parties did not address the claims as such and accordingly the Tribunal

did not omit deciding the issue.

108. As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal notes that while the Claimant points out that the
Supreme Court Directive prevented it from taking “equipment and materials” out of
Turkmenistan (and not “equipment and machinery”), the Claimant argued throughout the
arbitration that its claim was for confiscation of “machinery and equipment” and “confiscated
assets,” and that it never articulated a claim in its legal submissions for expropriation or

9922:

confiscation of “materials.”*+ More specifically, neither the seawater pumps nor the cement

24 Thus, the Claimant’s Memorial contained a heading that read “Respondent Unfairly Confiscated the Machinery
and Equipment of Claimant,” and the Reply Memorial on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction (“Reply

at the sea port were ever mentioned by the Claimant in any of its legal submissions or on any

list of expropriated assets as being among the assets that allegedly had been confiscated.

109. In this connection, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant’s Memorial does not list the allegedly
confiscated machinery and equipment,” but refers to the First Mazars Report, which does
list them, under the heading “Confiscated Machinery and Equipment” and “Appendix 1 —
List of Confiscated Machinery and Equipment.” The lists in Appendix 1, which are
organized per construction site, have not been translated but the headings are in English and
only refer to “machinery and equipment.” As far as the Tribunal can discern, Appendix 1
does not list the five seawater pumps or the cement. Moreover, while the “pumps” item is
mentioned in the Memorial,””° this is in connection with the Claimant’s claim for breach of
the fair and equitable treatment (“FET”) standard and not in relation to the confiscation

claim.??7

110. Similarly, the Claimant’s Reply Memorial states that “the confiscated machinery and
equipment were identified as per construction sites.”?7* It again refers to the First Mazars
Report, which as noted above, does not mention seawater pumps and cement. While
“pumps” are also mentioned in the Reply Memorial, this is again in connection with the FET
claim.” The Second Mazars Report corrects the amount claimed and relies on original
supplier invoices instead of the inter-company transfer invoices, which increases the amount
claimed from USD 12.228 million to USD 13.990 million; Appendix D to the report then

lists the confiscated machinery and equipment for which original invoices had been provided.

Memorial”) contained a heading that read “Respondent Unlawfully Expropriated Machineries and Equipment of
Claimant in Violation of Article III of the BIT in Turkmenistan.” The argument under these headings set out the
Claimant’s substantive claims and its Reply to the Respondent’s Counter-Memorial on the Merits. Moreover, while
the factual section in the Reply Memorial did also contain a heading “Respondent Has Confiscated Machineries,
Equipment and Significant Amount of Construction Materials of Claimant without any Legal Basis and
Compensation,” the argument under this heading related to the question of whether the Claimant’s claims were treaty
claims or contract claims. The substantive discussion of the claim for expropriation only mentioned “machinery and
equipment.”

225 Memorial, p. 82 et seq.

226 See Memorial, para. 141.

27 See heading III.C.1.c (sub-heading “Respondent arbitrarily forced and pressurized the Contracting Authorities not
to approve and make the progress payments without President’s prior consent and therefore made the completion of
some construction projects impossible for Claimant.”)

28 Reply Memorial, p. 354 et seq.

229 See Reply Memorial, paras. 432 and 485 (sub-headings III.D.2.a(i) and (v)).

35

The items on the list are not translated, but the heading again reads “List of Confiscated
Machinery & Equipment.” The Claimant has not argued (in the arbitration or in the present

proceedings) that the seawater pumps and cement are among the listed items.”*°

111.

As pointed out by the Claimant, the seawater pumps were included in the Hill International
Report, which dealt with the cost claim (unpaid progress payments, delay penalties, retention,
and costs for additional works).”! The Claimant’s Reply Memorial takes these figures and
claims them under the sub-heading “Value of additional works and cost overruns unpaid,”
under the main heading “Value of the works completed but not paid.”?** “Cement” was also
mentioned in the Hill International Report, as an item under the heading “additional

9233

works,”*** and it was also claimed in the Reply Memorial under the sub-heading “Value of

additional works and cost overruns unpaid,” under the main heading “Value of the works

completed but not paid.”?**

“Cement” left at the Avaza Canal project site was further
mentioned in the Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief, but again in connection with the FET claim

for additional costs.?*°

112. The Claimant did not therefore expressly include the seawater pumps and cement in its

confiscation claim.

113. The Tribunal is also unable to agree with the Claimant’s argument that the inclusion of the
seawater pumps and the cement in the cost claim and not as part of the confiscation claim
was merely a matter of “presentation.” The Claimant refers to the explanation provided by
Mr Almaci at the hearing.?*° It is clear, however, that he stated he had been instructed to
put the confiscated assets in a separate claim from the cost claim, and that this made sense
from an accounting point of view as pumps were considered consumables (rather than

igkale’s assets) as they were incorporated into the works and thus became a cost of the

project.” Consequently, the distinction made by the Claimant and its experts between a
cost claim and a confiscation claim was not merely a matter of “presentation” as the Claimant
suggests, but reflective of a distinction between materials (consumables) which would be
incorporated into the project (and therefore would have to be accounted for as costs), on the
one hand, and assets that i¢kale had purchased and that would not be incorporated into the
project (and therefore would be accounted for as ickale’s assets), on the other.?** While this
does not mean that materials could not have been confiscated before they were incorporated
into the works, this is not a claim the Claimant ever advanced. In this context, counsel for
the Claimant’s argument at the hearing, to the effect that the Tribunal “could use the amounts
quantified by Hill and Mazars to determine the value of what was expropriated,”?*? does not
change the fact that the Claimant never presented and quantified the five seawater pumps
and the cement allegedly left at the sea port as part of its claim for assets confiscated as a
result of the Directive. In order to make such a claim, the Claimant should have presented
evidence as to the value of the pumps and cement at the time of the alleged taking and as to
their status (e.g., whether or not they were incorporated into the Avaza Canal project at the
time of the Supreme Court Directive), and to explain the basis for the application of the

Directive to them. The evidence presented to the Tribunal did not address these details.

The Tribunal finds that the Claimant’s request for a supplementary decision to deal with “any
question which it had omitted to decide in the award” is not, in substance, a request for a
supplementary decision. Rather it constitutes an attempt to make a new claim, one that was
not made in the arbitration. The Tribunal cannot assess now what the Claimant would have
been able to prove as to their value, whether or not they were incorporated into the Avaza
Canal project, and whether they were within the reach of the Supreme Court Directive. The
Tribunal would also have to hear the Respondent’s arguments and evidence on the issue
before it could decide. None of this occurred because the claim was not presented. The

Tribunal therefore could not have omitted, and did not omit, to decide the issue in the Award.

238 Indeed, the Claimant recognizes this in its Reply: “[D]epreciation should not be calculated in cement and pumps
since depreciation is only applicable to fixed assets (i.e. buildings, machinery, vehicles, etc.) which have economic
useful lives of more than a year. Cement and pumps are subject to consumption in terms of inventories, where their
cost is included in the cost of sales as soon as they are used.” (Reply, para. 151).

The Claimant’s request for a supplementary decision therefore must be dismissed.

The Claimant’s Requests for Rectification of Errors

According to Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention, upon a request of a party made within
45 days after the date on which the award was rendered, an ICSID tribunal “shall rectify any
clerical, arithmetical or similar error in the award.” The language (“shall rectify”) suggests
that, unlike a supplementary decision, an ICSID tribunal has no discretion as to whether or
not to make a correction; rather, “any clerical, arithmetical or similar” errors “shall” be
rectified. Like a supplementary decision dealing with a question that was omitted from the
award, such a decision “shall become part of the award and shall be notified to the parties in

the same manner as the award.”

As noted above, Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention provides a remedy for “minor

technical errors in the award” and “is not designed to afford a substantive review or
reconsideration of the decision but enables the tribunal to correct mistakes that may have
occurred in the award’s drafting in a non-bureaucratic and expeditious manner.”*4? Like a

request for supplementary decision, rectification “in no way consists of a means of appealing

 

or otherwise revi v24l

 

iting the merits of the decision subject to [...] rectification.
Moreover, as explained by the Vivendi ad hoc committee:

“A review of pertinent arbitral awards illustrates that the availability of the rectification
remedy afforded by Article 49(2) depends upon the existence of two factual conditions.
First, a clerical, arithmetical or similar error in an award or decision must be found to
exist. Second, the requested rectification must concern an aspect of the impugned
award or decision that is purely accessory to its merits. Simply stated [...], Article
49(2) does not permit the ‘rectification’ of substantive findings made by a tribunal or
committee or of the weight or credence accorded by the tribunal or committee to the
claims, arguments and evidence presented by the parties. The sole purpose of a

rectification is to correct clerical, arithmetical or similar errors, not to reconsider the
merits of issues already decided.”?+

119. Similarly, the RDC v. Guatemala tribunal stressed that “[t]he power of the Tribunal to rectify
the Award is limited. The threshold question is whether the rectification requested falls

within the parameters of Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention.”??

12

S

All of the Claimant’s several requests for rectification relate to its claim for the alleged
confiscation of its machinery and equipment, which was dealt with by the Tribunal in
paragraphs 364-76 of the Award. According to the Claimant, “the Tribunal makes a number
of gross errors in its calculations” of the difference between the value of the allegedly
confiscated assets and the delay penalties.*“* It asserts that these include using an incorrect
amount for delay penalties; an “obvious error” with respect to whether inter-company
transfers represent a positive or negative value; an incorrect deduction for insurance
payments; an incorrect deduction of depreciation; a “mathematically-incorrect deduction” of
USD 1,200,000 from an already depreciated amount; and a “mathematically-incorrect

deduction” of USD 23,000 from an already depreciated amount.?4>

121.

The Tribunal recalls that the Claimant’s confiscation claim was dismissed because the
Tribunal found, by majority, that the Claimant had “failed to prove that the Supreme Court’s
Directive was excessive and as such expropriatory.”*4° Accordingly, the Tribunal’s decision
on the Claimant’s confiscation claim turned on the question of whether the evidence before
the Tribunal established that the Supreme Court Directive had an expropriatory effect, that
is, whether an expropriation had taken place. This is a qualitative determination as to the
application of the law to the facts; it is not a decision on quantification of compensation for
expropriation that the Tribunal has determined to have taken place. Consequently, as the
purpose of the calculations in paragraphs 364-76 of the Award was to enable the Tribunal to

determine whether the evidence before it established that the Supreme Court Directive could

be characterized as being excessive and, as such, as having an expropriatory effect, the
calculations were necessarily only indicative, or approximations, and were not intended to
provide a precise quantification for the purposes of formal valuation of either the value of

the assets or any of the adjustments accepted or not accepted by the Tribunal.

It also should be noted that a precise quantification of the difference between the delay
penalties and the value of the allegedly confiscated assets was not possible as many of the
adjustments were approximations to begin with.7*” In the circumstances, the Tribunal
concluded that the evidence before it suggested that “the depreciated value of the assets was
substantially less than USD 10 million, the amount mentioned by Mr Almaci,” which the
Tribunal used as a basis of its approximative calculations. The Tribunal therefore could “not
accept that this amount represents the real value of the Claimant’s machinery and equipment

at the time of their alleged confiscation.”*4*

The majority of the Tribunal would have had to tackle these evidentiary issues and seek to
quantify the difference between the delay penalties and the value of the allegedly confiscated
assets only if it had first determined that the evidence before it indeed established that the
Supreme Court Directive was excessive. Moreover, had the majority of the Tribunal
concluded on the basis of the evidence that the Supreme Court Directive was indeed prima
facie excessive in the sense that the total depreciated value of the Claimant’s machinery and
equipment exceeded the amount of the delay penalties, the question would also have arisen
whether this finding, in itself, would have been sufficient to establish that the measure had a
confiscatory effect and that an expropriation had taken place.” The majority of the Tribunal
never reached these questions because it concluded that “the Claimant had failed to prove

that the Supreme Court Directive was excessive and as such expropriatory.”?°°

47 Thus, for instance, the difference between the original supplier invoices and the inter-company invoices, the value

of the assets transferred to third parties, and the value of the leased ass

 

's and the depreciated value of the machinery

and equipment could not be reliably quantified in the first place.

250 Award, para. 375.

40

124. Keeping in mind these observations on the nature of the Tribunal’s findings, the Tribunal

will address each of the Claimant’s requests below in turn.

3.2.1 Delay penalties

125. The Claimant argues that the total amount of delay penalties imposed by the Turkmen
Arbitration Court was “incorrectly stated” in the Award. According to the Claimant, the
amount should be USD 3,096,974 and not USD 3,231,898 (which is the total of the two
figures mentioned in the Award, USD 2,812,786 and USD 419,112), i-e., there is a difference
of USD 134,924. The Claimant provides in its Request a table demonstrating the difference
between the Tribunal’s calculations and its own calculations, citing to the relevant
evidence.”*! The Claimant requests that the error be corrected, and that “the value of USD
3,096,974 rather than the amount of USD 3,231,898 should be used in the Award and the

Tribunal’s calculations.”?*?

126. The Respondent states that “the relatively de minimis amount identified by Claimant would
not have changed the Tribunal’s determination as to the ‘excessive’ nature of the Directive

in comparison to the delay penalties.”??

Moreover, according to the Respondent, the
Tribunal merely established, “for illustrative purposes,” a possible range of delay penalties
(from USD 2,812,786 to USD 3,231,898), without making a definitive determination as this

was not required.?**

127. The Tribunal notes that the difference between the Claimant’s calculations and the amounts
mentioned in the Award is indeed de minimis (USD 134,924) and concludes that it would
not require correction of the Award even if the Claimant’s figures were correct. Moreover,
as explained above, the calculations made by the Tribunal in paragraphs 371-76 of the Award
were only approximations and also involved currency conversions from Euro and Manat into

US Dollars.

131.

In any event, the Claimant’s table appears to be incorrect as it omits the tax (“state duty”) in
the amount of USD 165,082 imposed by the Arbitration Court.2> The delay penalty
mentioned for item 2 in the Claimant’s list (“Decision of Arbitration Court of Turkmenistan
dated 22 April regarding Ashgabat Cinema Project TNG-I 16”) is also incorrect; it should be
USD 621,000 and not 621,500.2°° These corrections not only reduce the difference between
the Claimant’s and the Tribunal’s totals to USD 30,658; they also mean that the Claimant’s
total is slightly higher than that of the Tribunal (which further reduces the difference between
the delay penalties and the value of the allegedly confiscated assets, as calculated by the
Claimant). The remaining difference (USD 30,658) appears to be a result of different

exchange rates used for currency conversion for the Euro and Manat amounts.

For these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that there is no error in the Award relating to the
amount of delay penalties that requires rectification. The Claimant’s request for rectification

on this issue must be dismissed.

3.2.2 Inter-company transfers

The Claimant argues that the Tribunal incorrectly deducted USD 1,800,000 for inter-

company transfers from the value of the allegedly confiscated assets.

The issue was addressed in paragraphs 372 and 373 of the Award. Referring to the evidence
of Mr Qureshi, the Respondent’s expert, the Tribunal noted that, according to Mr Qureshi,
“[b]ased on inter-company invoices, some of the assets were sold by the Claimant to its
Turkmen branch at prices that were, in total, approximately 1.8 million higher than the prices
reflected on the original supplier invoices.”*” The Tribunal then concluded that “the
Claimant has failed to explain or demonstrate on what basis the Tribunal should take into
account the price of inter-company transfers of some of the machinery and equipment, which
were USD 1.8 million higher than the prices at which they were acquired from third

parties.”?°8

286 See Exhibit AI-89.
257 Award, para. 372.
288 Award, para. 373.

42

132. The Claimant argues that the Tribunal misstates Mr Qureshi’s criticism as the value of the
original supplier invoices was in fact USD 1.8 million higher than the inter-company
invoices, and “Mr Qureshi did not claim that USD 1.8 million should be subtracted from the
amount shown by the supplier invoices.””°? The Claimant requests the Tribunal “to correct
its obvious error and to remove the amount of USD 1.8 million that it incorrectly subtracts

from the value of the expropriated assets.”

133. The Respondent argues, in response, that the Claimant ignores that “the point of PwC’s
criticism was that Claimant’s evidence regarding the value of the equipment and machinery
reflected in different invoices for the same items was inconsistent, incomprehensible, and
therefore unreliable.”?°! Although PwC (Mr Qureshi) noted that “the net impact” of relying
exclusively on the original supplier invoices “was a valuation which was US$ 1.8 million
higher than previously asserted by Claimant, that does not change the fact that the evidence
contained unexplained discrepancies, and could therefore not be accepted.””°? According to
the Respondent, the Claimant “failed to carry its burden of proving the value of its equipment

and machinery, both the original purchase value, as well as the depreciated value.”?%

134. The Tribunal notes that there is a drafting error in the Award, but it relates only to the manner
in which the issue is described: the relationship between the two figures (original supplier
invoices and the inter-company invoices) is inaccurately described in that the inter-company
invoices were USD 1.8 million lower than the original supplier invoices, and not vice versa.
While the Tribunal agrees that the drafting error must be corrected, this has no effect on the
decision of the majority of the Tribunal, which took the lower of the two values, based on
Mr Qureshi’s evidence. The issue arose as a result of the change in the Claimant’s approach
to the valuation of the allegedly confiscated assets in the course of the proceeding. While
the Claimant initially relied on the inter-company invoices that showed the lower value (USD
12.228 million), it subsequently amended its claim and relied on the original supplier

invoices (to the extent they were available), which increased the amount claimed from some

USD 12.228 million to USD 13.990 million. As noted by Mr Qureshi in the relevant part of
his Second Report (on which the Tribunal relied; see para. 372 of the Award):

“There is no consistency between the original supplier prices (now relied upon by
Mazars) and the prices used on the inter-company invoices from Ickale to its branch
in Turkmenistan (relied upon in the First Mazars report):

(i) 39 assets were sold by Ickale to its Turkmen branch for a higher price than for
which they were originally purchased. The item with the highest difference is a
crane (model 1995), where the import price of USD 135,000 contrasts with the
original purchase price of USD 24,000 (excluding VAT), which suggests a 462.5%
increase; and

(ii) 21 assets were sold to the Turkmen branch for a lower price compared to the
original purchase price. The item with the highest difference is a Caterpillar
excavator (model 2001), where the import price of USD 460,000 contrasts with the
original purchase price of USD 856,000 (excluding VAT), which suggests a 46.3%
decrease.

The overall impact is that the claim increased by approximately USD 1.8 million
excluding VAT based on the original supplier invoices (compared to inter-company
invoices). I believe this should have been analysed in detail as the differences may
be due to partial depreciation of the assets already at the time of the import to
Turkmenistan, technical enhancements to the machinery, adjusting prices for
customs declarations or other factors. However Mazars do not appear to address
any of the differences and therefore my questions from my first report remain
unanswered.”

135. Accepting Mr Qureshi’s evidence that the Claimant’s valuation was unreliable, the Tribunal

264
265

concluded that “the Claimant has failed to explain or demonstrate on what basis the Tribunal
should take into account [the prices at which the some of the machinery and equipment were
acquired from third parties, which were USD 1.8 million higher than the prices of inter-
company transfers].”?°° Due to the drafting error noted above, the conclusion was incorrectly
described in the Award, and it needs to be corrected. The Tribunal considers that such a
drafting error may be considered a “clerical” or “similar” error (i.e., an error similar to a
clerical or an arithmetical error) within the meaning of Article 49(2) of the ICSID

Convention. The correction does not require any consequential changes to either the

Paragraph 372 of the Award reads:

“Based on inter-company invoices, some of the assets were sold by the Claimant to

Paragraph 372 of the Award is corrected to read:
“Based on inter-company invoices, some of the assets were sold by the Claimant to

its Turkmen branch at prices that were, in total, approximately USD 1.8 million
lower than the prices reflected on the original supplier invoices;”

137. Similarly, the following correction must be made to paragraph 373:

Paragraph 373 of the Award reads:

“Second, the Claimant has failed to explain or demonstrate on what basis the
Tribunal should take into account the prices of inter-company transfers of some of
the machinery and equipment, which were USD 1.8 million higher than the prices
at which they were acquired from third parties.”

Paragraph 373 of the Award is corrected to read:
“Second, the Claimant has failed to explain or demonstrate on what basis the
Tribunal should take into account the prices at which some of the machinery and

equipment were acquired from third parties, which were USD 1.8 million higher
than the prices of inter-company transfers.”

Deduction of insurance payments

138. The Claimant argues that the majority of the Tribunal “incorrectly subtracts USD 2.6 million

for hypothetical insurance payments that were never made.

9266

139. The relevant part of the Award reads as follows:

266 Request, para. 38.

45

140.

141.

142.

“Finally, neither the Claimant nor its experts have commented on Mr Qureshi’s
argument that insurance arrangements should have been considered as the evidence
indicates that the lease agreements concluded by the Claimant for some of the
machinery and equipment required it to insure the leased assets for their full value.
The value of these assets when acquired amounted to approximately USD 2.6 million.
In the absence of any response on this point from the Claimant, the Tribunal considers
that the Claimant must be assumed to have recovered the value of these assets from
insurance. It follows that, even if the evidence suggests that the Claimant was required
under the relevant lease contracts to pay, and argues that it did pay, the value of the
leased machinery and equipment to the lessors in the event it failed to return them, the
evidence indicates that the Claimant would have been able to recover these payments
from the insurance.”°”
The Claimant contends that, apart from challenging the Claimant’s evidence, the Respondent
did not submit “anything,” and argues that the insurance in any event did not cover
confiscations. The Claimant refers, in support, to an email message that it provided to the
Respondent in connection with document production;?* however, this email message is not
on record, and in any event, no new evidence could be submitted at this stage of the

proceedings.

The Claimant also argues that it had no opportunity to comment on Mr Qureshi’s Second
Report, which was submitted with the Respondent’s Rejoinder; that the Tribunal reversed
the burden of proof; and that it failed to “ask anything concerning insurance over the entire

arbitral proceeding.”?

The Respondent argues, in response, that the Claimant’s complaints are another attempt “to
make new arguments now, post-Award, which it did not make during the Arbitration.”?”
The Respondent notes that the insurance issue was raised by Mr Qureshi already in his first
report, and was also addressed by the Respondent in its Counter-Memorial, and was therefore
“squarely put in issue in the first round of Respondent’s submissions.”?”! The Respondent
also points out that during the document production phase the Tribunal ordered the Claimant

to produce all insurance agreements or arrangements, but the Claimant failed to do so. The

only document produced was the email that the Claimant now seeks to introduce in this
proceeding, dated 10 January 2013 and thus generated during the arbitration, and which does
not prove what the Claimant says it does.?”? The Claimant also had an opportunity to
comment on the issue in its Post-Hearing Brief, but did not, even if it did address the lease
arrangements.””> According to the Respondent, the Claimant simply failed to carry its burden

of proof, and only has itself to blame.”

The Tribunal finds that the Claimant’s request is not a request to correct a typographical,
clerical or similar error. Rather it is in effect a request for reconsideration of the Tribunal’s
reasoning and evaluation of the evidence that was before the Tribunal, coupled with a
complaint as to the manner in which the Tribunal conducted the proceedings. Such matters
fall outside the scope of Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention, and the Claimant’s request

for rectification must therefore be dismissed.

3.2.4 Incorrect deduction of depreciation

The Claimant argues that the Tribunal “failed to determine the precise reduction that it would
like to apply to the value of machinery and equipment for depreciation despite the fact that
it had all the necessary elements to determine this value, which is a simple calculation.”?”>
According to the Claimant, “[i]f the Tribunal was not satisfied by the way in which the
evidence was presented, it should have asked questions and further precisions by the parties,
or accepted the written calculations concerning depreciation that Claimant offered at the
hearing, or ruled on this amount using the help of an expert.”?”° The Claimant suggests that

“{tJhe Tribunal could have performed the calculation itself, which is very easy to do today

online and requires only inputting a few values.”?”7

The Claimant further argues that, “[t]o the extent that the value of the machinery and

equipment may have been partially determined by the Tribunal,” it appears to have “made

mathematical errors.”?7*

The Claimant states that, according to its understanding, the
Tribunal calculated the value of the expropriated machinery “by reducing the acquisition
value of the machinery of USD 13,990,000 by USD 6.3 million, thus obtaining the amount
of USD 7,690,000.”?”? According to the Claimant, “[i]f the Tribunal did rely on this USD

6.3 million figure,” this would be “an incorrect reading” of Mr Qureshi’s report.?°°

The Respondent points out that it was the Claimant’s case throughout the arbitration that the
appropriate valuation should be based on the replacement cost, and that is not necessary to
consider depreciation.”*! According to the Respondent, the Claimant “cannot fill a hole in
its case today, after apparently deciding that its strategy was ill-advised.”?*? It is not the task
of the Tribunal to “invit[e] Claimant’s expert to provide some depreciation calculations ‘later
on.”” Indeed, such a step “would have been a gross violation of due process, depriving the
Respondent of the opportunity to cross-examine Claimant’s expert, or to present its own
expert evidence on the issue.””*? Nor is it the task of the Tribunal to “alert Claimant as to

the points on which its case is weak or its evidence insufficient.”?**

The Tribunal notes that, to the extent that the Claimant complains of the way in which the
Tribunal dealt with and evaluated the evidence before it, its request fails to qualify as a
request for a clerical, arithmetical or similar error, within the meaning of Article 49(2) of the

ICSID Convention. It therefore stands to be dismissed.

To the extent that the Claimant complains of an alleged “mathematical error” in the
Tribunal’s assessment of the evidence relating to depreciation, the Claimant is mistaken. The
majority of the Tribunal did not deduct the amount mentioned by Mr Qureshi, USD 6.3
million, from the acquisition value of the machinery; the amount of USD 6.3 million (which
represents the value of the assets that were more than four years old at the time of the alleged

confiscation) is mentioned in footnote 226 of the Award to support the Tribunal’s finding

that the evidence before it “suggest[ed] that the depreciated value of the assets was
substantially less than USD 10 million, the amount mentioned by Mr Almaci.”?*> The
footnote was merely a comment relating to the reliability of Mr Almaci’s evidence on

depreciation, not an attempt to calculate the depreciated amount.

Consequently, the Claimant’s request for rectification relating to the issue of depreciation

must be dismissed.

3.2.5 Incorrect deduction of USD 1,200,000 from depreciated amount

The Claimant argues that the Tribunal “incorrectly deducted the value of USD 1.2 million
from already depreciated equipment costs, rather than from the cost of the equipment.”?°°
According to the Claimant, this is “mathematically incorrect” since it results in a deduction

of over 100% of the value of the allegedly transferred assets.

. The Respondent responds that “it is difficult to fault the Tribunal for taking the assumed

depreciated value of Claimant’s equipment and machinery allegedly confiscated, precisely
because it had no other number, and applying the accepted deductions to that amount.”?°”
The Claimant’s arguments also require the Tribunal “to reconsider the merits of issues
7288

already decided.”

As already noted above,?*?

the Claimant’s request is based on a misunderstanding of the
nature of the decision taken by the Tribunal in paragraphs 364-76 of the Award. The majority
of the Tribunal did not seek to quantify a loss incurred by the Claimant as a result of an
expropriation that had been found to have taken place; it made a qualitative determination as
to whether the Supreme Court Directive was excessive and had a confiscatory effect.
Consequently, the Tribunal’s calculations were made for this qualitative purpose only and
were therefore merely indicative; they were not made for the purpose of quantifying the

Claimant’s loss. Nonetheless, while the Tribunal considered that there was not sufficiently

In conclusion, the Claimant’s request is not a request for a correction of a clerical, arithmetic
or similar error. Rather it is a request for reconsideration of the Tribunal’s decision on
whether the Supreme Court Directive was excessive and as such expropriatory. It too must

therefore be dismissed.

3.2.6 Incorrect deduction of USD 23,000 from depreciated amount

The Claimant argues that the Tribunal incorrectly deducted the value of USD 23,000 from
already depreciated equipment costs, rather than from the cost of the equipment. According

to the Claimant, this is “obviously incorrect as a matter of arithmetic.”?”°

The Claimant’s argument here is essentially the same as that addressed in Section 3.2.5
above, and is subject to the same analysis and conclusion. It too must therefore be dismissed,

for the reasons set out in Section 3.2.5.

COSTS

Both Parties request that the Tribunal award the costs incurred by them in connection with

these proceedings under Article 49(2) of the Convention.

Having considered the Parties’ positions, and taking into account the Tribunal’s decisions,
which resulted in two clerical corrections to the Award, the Tribunal determines that each
Party shall bear their legal and other costs and half of the Tribunal’s fees and costs and of
the administrative expenses of ICSID. The Tribunal’s fees and costs and the administrative

expenses of ICSID amount to USD 77,952.28.

st, para. 67.
n. Once the case account balance is

  

final, the ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a detailed financial statement, and the remaining balance will
be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the advances they made.

(b) The Claimant’s requests for rectification of the Award are denied, with the

exception of the following;

(i) The fourth bullet point in paragraph 372 of the Award is rectified by the

substitution of the word “lower” for the word “higher;”

(ii) | The fourth sentence in paragraph 373 of the Award is corrected to read:

the Tribunal should take into account the prices at which the some of the
machinery and equipment were acquired from third parties, which were
USD 1.8 million higher than the prices of inter-company transfers.”

(c) Each Party shall bear 50% of the administrative expenses of ICSID and of the

costs and fees of the Tribunal; and
