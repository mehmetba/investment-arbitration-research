PETITION TO ENFORCE ARBITRAL AWARD

1. Petitioner Perenco Ecuador Ltd. (““Perenco”), by and through undersigned counsel, brings

this action pursuant to 22 U.S.C. § 1650a and Article 54 of the Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States (the “ICSID Convention”).
Petitioner seeks recognition and enforcement of an arbitral award (the “Award”) issued on
September 27, 2019, in International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”)
Case No. ARB/08/6 against Respondent, the Republic of Ecuador (“Ecuador”). A certified copy
of the Award is attached as Exhibit A, filed concurrently with and in support of this Petition.
The Award imposed pecuniary obligations on Ecuador in the net amount of $394,380,883.00 on
the parties’ substantive claims plus $16,723,847.00 in legal fees and costs. The Award provided
for post-award interest on both amounts to accrue from December 1, 2019. The Award also
provided that Perenco shall pay Petroecuador $49,629.76 in legal fees and costs together with
simple interest accruing from June 30, 2011. The Award thus entitled Perenco to the net amount
of $411,042,817.89 as of October 1, 2019, subject to adjustments for interest specified in the

Award.

Case 1:19-cv-02943 Document 1 Filed 10/01/19 Page 2 of 11

2. To date, Ecuador has not paid any portion of the Award.

3. Enforcement of the Award has not been stayed by the arbitral tribunal (the “Tribunal”).
4. Pursuant to Article 54 of the ICSID Convention and 22 U.S.C. § 1650a, arbitral awards
issued under the ICSID Convention are not subject to collateral attack and must be enforced and
given the same full faith and credit as if the award were a final judgment of a court in the United
States.

5. Accordingly, Perenco requests that this Court: (1) enter an order recognizing the Award
and enforcing it in the same manner as a final judgment issued by a court in the United States;
(2) enter judgment in Perenco’s favor against Ecuador in the net amount set forth in the Award,
subject to adjustments for interest, and the costs of this proceeding; and (3) award Perenco such

other and further relief as the Court may find just and proper.

PARTIES
6. Petitioner Perenco is a private company incorporated under the laws of the
Commonwealth of the Bahamas.
7. Respondent Ecuador is a foreign state within the meaning of the Foreign Sovereign

Immunities Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1330, 1332, 1391(f), and 1602-11.

8. Ecuador signed the ICSID Convention on January 15, 1986, and deposited its instrument
of ratification on the same date. The ICSID Convention entered into force for Ecuador on
February 14, 1986. On July 6, 2009, the depositary received a written notice of Ecuador’s
denunciation of the ICSID Convention. In accordance with Article 71 of the ICSID Convention,
the denunciation took effect six months after the receipt of Ecuador’s notice, on January 7, 2010.
Ecuador’s denunciation did not prevent ICSID from hearing and resolving this case because
Ecuador’s membership and consent to ICSID jurisdiction as of the filing of the arbitral

proceeding gave it a continuing obligation to abide by the ICSID Convention with respect to that

Case 1:19-cv-02943 Document1 Filed 10/01/19 Page 3 of 11

dispute. See ICSID Convention, art. 72 (“Notice by a Contracting State [that it intends to
withdraw from the ICSID Convention] shall not affect the rights or obligations under this
Convention of that State or of any of its constituent subdivisions or agencies or of any national of
that State arising out of consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre given by one of them before
such notice was received by the depositary.”). A copy of the ICSID Convention is attached to
this Petition as Exhibit D.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
9. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 22 U.S.C.
§ 1650a(b), which provides that “[t]he district courts of the United States . . . shall have
exclusive jurisdiction over actions and proceedings” to enforce awards entered under the ICSID
Convention.
10. In addition, this Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action because this action
is a “nonjury civil action against a foreign state” on a claim “with respect to which the foreign
state is not entitled to immunity” under certain subsections of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities
Act (“FSIA”). 28 U.S.C. § 1330(a).
11. Ecuador is not entitled to immunity from this Court’s jurisdiction in an action to enforce
an award issued pursuant to the ICSID Convention. First, Ecuador waived any such immunity
by becoming a party to the ICSID Convention. 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(1); see ICSID Convention,
art. 54 (“Each Contracting State shall recognize an award rendered pursuant to this Convention
as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its territories as if
it were a final judgment of a court in that State.”); Blue Ridge Investments, L.L.C. v. Republic of
Argentina, 735 F.3d 72, 84 (2d Cir. 2013) (ruling that “Argentina waived its sovereign immunity

[under § 1605(a)(1)] by becoming a party to the ICSID Convention”). Second, Ecuador is not

Case 1:19-cv-02943 Document 1 Filed 10/01/19 Page 4 of 11

immune because the Award was governed by the ICSID Convention, a treaty in force in the
United States calling for the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards. § 1605(a)(6)(B).
12. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Ecuador pursuant to the FSIA, 28 U.S.C.
§ 1330(b).
13. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to the FSIA, 28 U.S.C. § 1391(£)(4).
14. The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., does not apply to
“enforcement of awards rendered pursuant to the [ICSID] convention.” 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(a).
As such, the FAA’s jurisdictional requirements do not apply to this action.

THE UNDERLYING DISPUTE
15. The facts giving rise to the arbitration are not in dispute and have been settled by the
Tribunal in a previous award. See Decision on Remaining Issues of Jurisdiction and on Liability
(the “2014 Decision on Liability”) (Ex. B). The dispute arose out of Perenco’s investments in
two blocks of oil fields in Ecuador, known as Block 7 and Block 21. See id. § 43. On September
4, 2002, Perenco and Ecuador entered into two agreements (the “Participation Contracts”)
pursuant to which Perenco became the sole operator and majority holder of the oil fields of
Block 7 and Block 21. Jd. §§ 43, 70.
16. In April 2006, following a change in political leadership, Ecuador enacted Law 42, which
required oil companies with participation contracts (including Perenco) to grant Ecuador at least
50 percent of the company’s revenues above the reference point (defined as the monthly average
oil price in effect at the time of the execution of the contracts). See id. §§ 96-99. The following
October, Ecuador enacted Decree 662, which increased Ecuador’s share of Perenco’s revenues
from its operations in Block 7 and Block 21 to 99 percent. See id. J 109-10.
17. On July 16, 2009, Ecuador physically seized Perenco’s operations in Block 7 and Block

21. See id. § 206. On November 12, 2009, the Ecuadorian Ministry of Mines initiated

Case 1:19-cv-02943 Document1 Filed 10/01/19 Page 5 of 11

caducidad proceedings to terminate the Participation Contracts. Jd. 4214. Ecuador formally
declared caducidad of the Participation Contracts, effectively terminating them, on July 20, 2010.
Id. 4215.

THE ARBITRATION
18. On April 30, 2008, Perenco filed its request for arbitration against Ecuador with ICSID
(the “Request’’). In the Request, Perenco claimed that Ecuador had violated its obligations under
the Participation Contracts, as well as under the France-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty (the
“BIT”).! Perenco filed an amended version of the Request on July 28, 2008.
19. Perenco’s Request was based on Article 9 of the BIT, which provides for ICSID
arbitration of “any legal dispute arising between [a Contracting Party, i.e., France or Ecuador,]
and a national or a company of the other Contracting Party by the latter in its territory.”
Perenco’s Request was also based on the arbitration clauses contained in both Participation
Contracts, which provided for arbitration before ICSID.
20. On June 4, 2008, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance
with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. On November 21, 2008, the Tribunal was initially
constituted. Due to resignations by arbitrators, the Tribunal was reconstituted in its final form on
May 6, 2010. The Tribunal, in its final form, was chaired by Judge Peter Tomka, a national of
Slovakia. Perenco appointed Mr. Neil Kaplan CBE, QC, SBS, a United Kingdom national, and
Ecuador appointed J. Christopher Thomas QC, a Canadian national.
21. The Tribunal held a hearing on jurisdiction from November 2-4, 2010. Both Ecuador
and Perenco were represented by counsel and fully participated in the hearing. The Tribunal
issued a decision dismissing certain jurisdictional objections and reserving judgment on others

' France and Ecuador signed the BIT on September 7, 1994, and the BIT entered into effect

on June 10, 1996. A copy of the BIT is attached to this Petition as Exhibit E.

Case 1:19-cv-02943 Document1 Filed 10/01/19 Page 6 of 11

on June 30, 2011 (the “Decision on Jurisdiction”). Perenco had initially named Petroecuador as
a second respondent in the arbitration, but the Tribunal held in the Decision on Jurisdiction that it
had no jurisdiction over Petroecuador.
22. The Tribunal held a hearing on the merits and remaining jurisdictional issues from
November 8-16, 2012. On September 12, 2014, the Tribunal issued the 2014 Decision on
Liability. 2014 Decision on Liability (Ex. B). In the comprehensive 234-page decision, the
Tribunal held that Ecuador’s 2008 imposition of the 99-percent windfall tax had breached the
Participation Contracts and Article 4 of the BIT, and that Ecuador’s declaration of caducidad
breached the Participation Contracts and Article 6 of the BIT. Jd. 4713. The Tribunal also held
that, although Perenco is a company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of the
Bahamas, the BIT applies to the Participation Contracts because Perenco—through its parent
company, Perenco International Limited—is controlled by French nationals. See id. {§ 509-30.
23. In December 2011, Ecuador asserted environmental counterclaims under Ecuadorian law.
These counterclaims were briefed separately, and on August 11, 2015, the Tribunal rendered an
interim decision on the counterclaims (the “2015 Decision on Counterclaims”). 2015 Decision
on Counterclaims (Ex. C).
24. The Tribunal held hearings on damages from November 9-13, 2015, and on April 21,
2016.

THE AWARD
25. On September 27, 2019, the Tribunal issued the Award, ruling that Ecuador’s breaches
entitled Perenco to compensation for its substantive claims in the amount of $448,820,400.00
plus interest at a rate of LIBOR for three-month borrowing plus two percent, compounded
annually, accruing from December 1, 2019, until the date of full and final payment. Award

4 1023(a) (Ex. A). The Award also requires Perenco to pay Ecuador $54,439,517.00 as

Case 1:19-cv-02943 Document 1 Filed 10/01/19 Page 7 of 11

compensation for the environmental counterclaims that Ecuador asserted plus interest at a rate of
LIBOR for three-month borrowing plus two percent, compounded annually, accruing from
December 1, 2019, until the date of full and final payment. Jd. { 1023(b). The net amount to
which Perenco is entitled under the Award as compensation for its substantive claims is thus
$394,380,883.00, in addition to the specified post-award interest.

26. The Tribunal also ordered both Perenco and Ecuador to pay a portion of each other’s
legal fees and costs. The Award required Ecuador to pay Perenco $23,000,000.00 and Perenco
to pay Ecuador $6,276,153.00, in each case together with simple interest at an annual rate of
three percent accruing from December 1, 2019, until the date of full and final payment. Jd.

Fj 1023(c)-(d). The net amount to which Perenco is entitled under the Award as a contribution
to its legal fees and costs is thus $16,723,847.00, in addition to the specified post-award interest.
27. Finally, the Tribunal also ordered Perenco to pay Petroecuador, a state instrumentality of
Ecuador, for its legal fees and costs. The Award required Perenco to pay Petroecuador
$49,629.76 together with simple interest at an annual rate of three percent accruing from June 30,
2011 (the date of dispatch of the Tribunal’s Decision on Jurisdiction), until the date of full and
final payment. Id. J 1023(e). The accrued interest from June 30, 2011 to October 1, 2019 is
$12,282.35, resulting in a total amount payable to Petroecuador of $61,912.11 as of the date of
this Petition. For purposes of this action, the Petitioner assumes that the small amount Perenco
must pay to the Ecuadorian State oil company, Petroecuador, will simply be netted against the
much larger amount that Ecuador must pay to Perenco, which will therefore modestly reduce the
debt Ecuador owes to Perenco. If, however, Ecuador or Petroecuador were to seek and receive a

separate payment from Perenco to Petroecuador, then the amount paid to Petroecuador would not

Case 1:19-cv-02943 Document 1 Filed 10/01/19 Page 8 of 11

reduce Ecuador’s debt, and the net amount that Ecuador would have to pay to Perenco would
increase by the same amount.
28. The net amount Ecuador owes to Perenco under the Award as of the date of this Petition
is $411,042,817.89, the sum of the net amounts due to Perenco for the parties’ substantive claims
and their fees and costs, less the amount due to Petroecuador (including interest accrued on the
Petroecuador amount from June 30, 2011 through the October 1, 2019 date of this Petition). The
net amount will change slightly between the time of this Petition and the Court’s entry of
judgment. In particular, from December 1, 2019, the net amount will increase due to the interest
accruing on the substantial amount that Ecuador owes to Perenco. From October 1, 2019, the net
amount will decrease slightly due to interest of $4.08 per day on the small amount that Perenco
owes to Petroecuador. The Petitioner respectfully requests that the net amount be updated so that
it is accurate and current as of the date that the Court enters the judgment.

LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR RELIEF
29. Article 54 of the ICSID Convention requires contracting states to “recognize an award
rendered pursuant to the Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed
by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State.” The
United States is a contracting state to the ICSID Convention and is therefore obligated to
recognize and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by an ICSID award, according it “the
same full faith and credit as if the award were a final judgment of a court of general jurisdiction
of one of the several States.” 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(a); see also ICSID Convention, art. 54
(requiring member states to “recognize an award rendered pursuant to this Convention as binding
and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award”).
30. An arbitral award issued against a foreign state under the ICSID Convention may be

recognized and enforced through a plenary action in federal court. This action must comply with

Case 1:19-cv-02943 Document 1 Filed 10/01/19 Page 9 of 11

the requirements for commencing a civil action under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and
with the personal jurisdiction, service, and venue requirements of the FSIA. See Mobil Cerro
Negro, Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, 863 F.3d 96, 112 (2d Cir. 2017); see also
Micula v. Gov't of Romania, 104 F. Supp. 3d 42, 49-50 (D.D.C. 2015).

31. | Awards issued pursuant to the ICSID Convention are not subject to collateral attack in
enforcement proceedings under 22 U.S.C. § 1650a. “Member states’ courts are . . . not permitted
to examine an ICSID award’s merits, its compliance with international law, or the ICSID
tribunal’s jurisdiction to render the award; under the Convention’s terms, they may do no more
than examine the judgment’s authenticity and enforce the obligations imposed by the award.”
Mobil Cerro, 863 F.3d at 102; see OI European Grp. B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,
No.16-CV-1533 (ABJ), 2019 WL 2185040, at *4 (D.D.C. May 21, 2019). The ICSID
Convention therefore “reflects an expectation that the courts of a member nation will treat the
award as final.” Mobil Cerro, 863 F.3d at 102; see also id. at 118 (noting that an “ICSID award-
debtor . . . [is] not . . . permitted to make substantive challenges to the award”); ICSID
Convention, arts. 53(1), 54(1).

32. Accordingly, the Court should confirm the Award.

COUNT I
FOR RECOGNITION OF ARBITRATION
AWARD PURSUANT TO 22 U.S.C. § 1650a

33. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference preceding paragraphs | through 32 as

if set forth fully herein.

34. A binding arbitration award under the ICSID Convention has been issued in Perenco’s
favor.
35.  Arbitral awards issued pursuant to the ICSID Convention are subject to mandatory

recognition and enforcement in the courts of the United States. 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(a).

Case 1:19-cv-02943 Document1 Filed 10/01/19 Page 10 of 11

36. Ecuador has not paid any portion of the Award.
37. Accordingly, Perenco is entitled to an order enforcing the Award as a judgment pursuant
to Article 54 of the ICSID Convention and 22 U.S.C. § 1650a, and entering judgment thereon in
the amount of $411,042,817.89, subject to the adjustments for interest accruing from the date of
this Petition set forth in the Award.

Perenco and against Ecuador and requests that the Court issue an order:
