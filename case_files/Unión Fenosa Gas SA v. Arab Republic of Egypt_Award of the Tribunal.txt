PART I: THE ARBITRATION

(1) The Parties

The Claimant is Union Fenosa Gas, S.A. (hereinafter referred to as “UFG”, “Union
Fenosa” or the “Claimant”). UFG is a company organized under the laws of the
Kingdom of Spain in 1998 as a gas subsidiary of the Spanish electricity utility

company, Unidn Fenosa S.A., which has its headquarters in Madrid, Spain.

The Respondent is the Arab Republic of Egypt and is hereinafter referred to as
“Egypt” or the “Respondent.”

The Claimant and Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Parties.”

The Parties’ respective representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).
(2) The Arbitration’s Procedure

On 14 February 2014, the Claimant filed with ICSID a request for arbitration against
the Respondent (the “Request” or “RfA”).

On 27 February 2014, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in
accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the
registration. In her Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to
proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule
7(d) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and
Arbitration Proceedings.

On 28 February 2014, the Claimant appointed Mr J. William Rowley, QC, a national
of Canada and the United Kingdom, as its party-appointed arbitrator, pursuant to
Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. By letter of the same date, ICSID informed
the Parties that, as provided in ICSID Arbitration Rule 2(3), either of the Parties might
choose the formula of Article 37(2)(b) at any time 60 days after the registration of the
Request for Arbitration, if no agreement had been reached on another procedure for
constituting the Tribunal within that period. ICSID noted that the Parties had not yet
informed ICSID of any agreement on the number of arbitrators and the method of
their appointment. ICSID also invited the Respondent to respond regarding the

Claimant’s proposed method of constitution of the Tribunal.

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 28 of 347

By letter of 30 May 2014, the Claimant invoked the formula contained in Article
37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and confirmed its previous appointment of Mr

Rowley as its party-appointed arbitrator.

By letter of 30 May 2014, ICSID acknowledged that the Claimant had invoked Article
37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, according to which the tribunal would consist of
three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each Party and the president of the
tribunal appointed by agreement of the Parties. By the same letter, ICSID
acknowledged the Claimant’s appointment of Mr Rowley as a co-arbitrator. ICSID
also invited the Claimant to propose a name of a person to serve as president of the
tribunal and to invite the Respondent to concur with such a proposal, as provided in

ICSID Arbitration Rule 3(1)(a)(i).

By letter of 1 June 2014, the Respondent appointed Mr J. Christopher Thomas, a
national of Canada, as arbitrator in this case pursuant to Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID

Convention.

On 3 June 2014, ICSID informed the Parties that Mr Rowley had accepted his

appointment as a co-arbitrator.

On 4 June 2014, ICSID informed the Parties that Mr J. Christopher Thomas had
accepted his appointment as a co-arbitrator. On the same date, ICSID invited the
Parties to proceed with the appointment of a third arbitrator to serve as president of

the tribunal.

On 3 November 2014, Mr Thomas voluntarily withdrew his acceptance of his
appointment. By letter of the same date, ICSID invited the Respondent to appoint

another arbitrator in place of Mr Thomas.

On 7 November 2014, the Claimant requested the Chairman of the ICSID
Administrative Council to appoint the arbitrator not yet appointed by the Respondent,

pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention.

On 8 November 2014, the Respondent appointed Mr Mark Alan Clodfelter, a national
of the United States of America, as arbitrator pursuant to Article 37(2)(b) of the
ICSID Convention.

On 13 November 2014, M. Clodfelter accepted his appointment as a party-appointed

arbitrator.

By letter of 25 November 2014, ICSID acknowledged the Parties’ mutual agreement
to appoint Mr V.V. Veeder as president of the tribunal. Mr Veeder accepted his

appointment on 7 December 2014.

On 8 December 2014, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the
ICSID Arbitration Rules, notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted
their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed constituted on that
date. Ms Milanka Kostadinova, ICSID Senior Counsel, was designated to serve as

Secretary of the Tribunal.

By agreement between the Tribunal and the Parties, the first session was held on 25
February 2015 by telephone conference. The Parties confirmed that the Tribunal was
properly constituted and that no Party had any objection to the appointment of any
Member of the Tribunal. They agreed, inter alia, that the applicable Arbitration Rules
would be the ICSID Arbitration Rules in effect from 10 April 2006, that the
procedural language would be English, and that hearings should take the place at

ICSID in Washington, D.C., “unless the Parties agree otherwise.”!

The agreement of the Parties and the Tribunal’s decisions were embodied in
Procedural Order No. 1 (“POI”), which was signed by the President and circulated to
the Parties by the Secretary on 3 August 2015. On the same date, the Tribunal also
issued Procedural Order No. 2 (“PO2”), by which it granted to the Parties permission

to file written submissions concerning the procedural timetable after 7 August 2015.

In accordance with the Parties’ partial consensus on the procedural timetable reached
at the first session, the Claimant filed its Memorial on the Merits on 7 August 2015,

along with supporting documentation.

By letter of 24 August 2015, the Respondent filed an application to the Tribunal for
permission to submit a Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, together with a
request for bifurcation, by 15 December 2015 (as opposed to a deadline of 16

November 2015, as determined earlier). The Claimant opposed the application by

POL, Paragraph 10.2.

letter of 31 August 2015. The Respondent replied to such objections by letters of 4
and 15 September 2015; and the Claimant responded by letters of 17 and 23
September 2015, respectively.

On 28 September 2015, having considered the Parties’ written submissions, the
Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 (“PO3”), fixing a deadline of 25 November
2015 for the filing the of Respondent’s Memorial of Objections to Jurisdiction,

together with any request for bifurcation.

On 25 November 2015, the Respondent filed a Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction

and Request for Bifurcation, along with supporting documentation.

On 2 December 2015, the Tribunal held a procedural meeting by telephone
conference call with the Parties to address outstanding issues regarding the procedural
timetable for the entire case, including for the Parties’ respective submissions on
Respondent’s request for bifurcation and its application for a stay, or suspension, of

the arbitration.

Pursuant to the Tribunal’s directions given during the procedural conference call on 2
December 2015, on 9 December 2015 the Parties submitted by letter their respective
proposals for procedural calendars on both bifurcated and non-bifurcated scenarios.
The Respondent also submitted its proposed procedural calendar if the Tribunal were
to order a stay or suspension of this arbitration pending the resolution of three other
arbitrations pending before the Cairo Regional Centre for International Commercial

Arbitration (“CRCICA”) and the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”).

On 22 December 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 (“PO4”), setting
out a procedural timetable for the filing of the Claimant’s Counter-Memorial in
Opposition to the Respondent’s Request for Bifurcation, the Respondent’s Reply to
such Counter-Memorial and the Claimant’s Rejoinder Memorial. The Tribunal
reserved, for the time being, its decision regarding Respondent’s request for a stay or

suspension of this arbitration.

On 22 December 2015, the Claimant filed its Objection to Respondent’s Request for

Bifurcation.

On 30 December 2015, the Respondent requested an adjustment of dates as proposed
in a schedule. On the invitation by the Tribunal, on 11 January 2016, the Claimant
submitted its response to the Respondent’s letter of 30 December 2015, objecting to

any date adjustments.
On 18 January 2016, the Respondent filed its Reply Memorial on Bifurcation.
On 5 February 2016, the Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Bifurcation.

On 4 March 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 (“POS”) concerning the
two procedural issues of bifurcation and stay/suspension raised by the Respondent on
25 November 2015. The Tribunal decided to join the Respondent’s objections to
jurisdiction to the merits of the dispute. With regard to the Respondent’s application
for a stay/suspension, the Tribunal requested that it “continue to be informed on a
regular basis by the Parties of the progress made in the CRICCA and ICC arbitrations
(insofar as it may be permissible for each of them to do so).”? The Tribunal made no

order for a stay or suspension of this arbitration.

On 8 April 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 (“PO6”), by which it
addressed certain unresolved differences between the Parties over the procedural
timetable. The Tribunal fixed a procedural calendar for the filing of further written
pleadings and requests for document production. The Tribunal also proposed dates
for the oral hearing, which both Parties subsequently confirmed as beginning on 6

March 2017.

On 13 June 2016, the Claimant filed its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and

Admissibility; and the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the Merits.

Following the completion of their first round of written pleadings on the merits,
pursuant to the Tribunal’s PO1 and PO6, on 29 July 2016 the Parties submitted their

respective Schedules of Requests for Document Production.

On 22 August 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 (“PO7”) addressing

the production of documents disputed by the Parties.

By letter of 12 September 2016, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that the Parties
had been unable to complete the work necessary to carry out the Tribunal’s directions
relating to document production by the deadline of 31 August 2016, as required by
PO7. As a result, the Claimant had agreed with the Respondent upon an extension of
the deadlines for the remaining two rounds of written pleadings. The Tribunal

approved the Parties’ agreed extension on 13 September 2016.

On 22 September 2016, the Claimant and the Respondent submitted their respective

privilege logs.

In accordance with the adjusted timetable, on 7 October 2016, the Respondent filed its
Reply Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Admissibility; and the Claimant

filed its Reply on the Merits.

On 26 October 2016, the Claimant requested an order from the Tribunal directing the
Respondent to produce the five documents listed in the Respondent’s Privilege Log,
subject to any confidentiality undertakings considered appropriate by the Tribunal,
and to produce documents responsive to the Claimant’s Request No. | ordered under

the Tribunal’s PO7.?

On 28 October 2016, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to reply by 7 November
2016.

On 7 November 2016, the Respondent filed observations disputing the Claimant’s
application of 26 October 2016, and asked the Tribunal to reject the Claimant’s
request that the five documents listed in the Respondent’s Privilege Log be produced.
The Respondent further stated that, following a diligent search, it had not identified
any documents responsive to the Claimant’s Request No. 1; namely, for the 1999 Gas
Master Plan for Egypt issued by the Government of Egypt and/or its State-owned

companies (the “Master Plan”).

On 12 December 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8 (“PO8”)
concerning production of documents and procedural matters. The Tribunal made no
order for the production of the five documents listed in the Respondent’s Privilege

Log. The Tribunal stated that that it “will [...] keep the matter under consideration in

the light of any further relevant circumstances, including the Hearing.”* The Tribunal
asked the Respondent to clarify its position concerning its knowledge of any version
of the Master Plan held by any third person or organization; whether it had made any
attempt to procure such a version from any such third party; and to describe such
attempt or attempts. The Tribunal also invited the Parties to inform the Tribunal
concerning the status of their travel and visa arrangements for the March 2017

Hearing.

By letter of 28 December 2016, the Respondent replied that it was unable to locate or

procure the particular document.

On 16 January 2017, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the Merits and the

Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction.

On 31 January 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9 concerning

procedural matters.

On 6 February 2017, the President of the Tribunal held a pre-hearing organisational
meeting by telephone conference with the Parties. By letter of 6 February 2017,
ICSID transmitted to the Parties the Tribunal’s decision to maintain the scheduled
date and venue of the Hearing. The Parties were asked to inform the Tribunal
promptly of any material event jeopardizing the March 2017 Hearing in Washington,

D.C. resulting from political developments in the USA’s new administration.

The Tribunal also approved the Parties’ agreed positions concerning the organisation
of the Hearing, as communicated to the Tribunal on 3 February 2017. These included
the hearing schedule and allocation of time, the preparation of an indicative complete
hearing schedule, the order in which fact witnesses would be called for examination,
the presentation of hearing bundles and other materials, the submission of post-

hearing briefs and statements of costs, and main logistical matters.

On 6 February 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 10 (“PO10”), by which
it confirmed that the March 2017 Hearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits will be held

By email of 8 February 2017, both Parties submitted their lists of fact witnesses and

experts for cross-examination at the Hearing.

By letter of 22 February 2017, the Respondent requested that the Claimant withdraw
from the record certain documents filed with the Claimant’s Rejoinder Memorial on
Jurisdiction and Admissibility (namely Exhibits C-0456 and C-0458 through C-0463)
or, in the alternative, that the Tribunal find these documents inadmissible and strike
them from the record of the arbitration. The Respondent argued that these documents

constituted confidential state secrets not subject to disclosure under Egyptian law.

On 24 February 2017, the Claimant applied to the Tribunal for leave to introduce
additional documents into the record, including twelve Exhibits (C-0476 through C-
0487) (the “New Documents”) and seven Legal Authorities (CL-0250 through CL-
0256).

By letter of 28 February 2017, responding to the Respondent's letter of 22 February
2017, the Claimant declined to withdraw any of the documents and opposed the
Respondent’s request that the Tribunal strike these documents from the record. The
Claimant’s letter was accompanied by one new Exhibit (C-0488)* and sixteen

additional Legal Authorities (CL-0257 through CL-0272).

On | March 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 11 (“PO11”), concerning

the examination of expert witnesses.

On the same date, the Claimant requested leave from the Tribunal to introduce into
the record a new Legal Authority.° By email of 5 March 2017, the Respondent
indicated that it did not object to the Claimant’s request. The new Legal Authority
was admitted into the record of the arbitration by the Tribunal on 6 March 2017.”

On 2 March 2017, responding to the Claimant’s application of 24 February 2017, the
Respondent stated that it did not oppose the admission of two of the New Documents

(namely Exhibits C-0482 (Transcripts of the CRCICA case 896 Hearings of 30

5 Dockets of Exhibits submitted on behalf of Mr. Sameh Fahmy in Case No. 41 of 2011, [C-0488].

January and 3 February 2017) and C-0487 (English translation of Exhibit NAV-175)),

but raised arguments as to why the remainder should not be admitted into evidence.

On 2 March 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 12 (“PO12”) directing
the Respondent to reply in writing to the Claimant’s letter of 28 February 2017. The
Tribunal indicated that it wished to decide the procedural issue before the

commencement of the Hearing on 6 March 2017.

By letter of 5 March 2017, responding to the Claimant’s letter of 28 February 2017,
the Respondent reiterated its request that the Tribunal exclude from the record of the
arbitration Claimant’s Exhibits C-0456 and C-0458 through C-0463, pursuant to

1.61 On the first day of the Hearing, the Tribunal heard each side’s oral arguments on the
outstanding procedural issues, including (i) the Respondent’s application of 22
February 2017 to exclude certain documents from the record of the arbitration; and
(ii) the Claimant’s application of 24 February 2017 to admit into the record the
nineteen documents, including seven Legal Authorities and twelve Exhibits, of which
two were no longer an issue.* Having deliberated on the two disputed applications,
the Tribunal decided regarding the Respondent’s application of 22 February 2017 to
admit Exhibits C-0456, C-0458 through C-0463, and C-0488 de bene esse. °
Regarding the Claimant’s application of 24 February 2017, the Tribunal decided to

de bene esse.'° The Tribunal announced its decision without reasons, but indicated

that it might wish to revisit the decision later.!!

As directed by the Tribunal on the final day of the Hearing,'? by letter of 15 March
2017 the Claimant confirmed that, having performed a comprehensive review of the
hearing record, it had determined that, from the disputed ten New Documents. one
was referred to during the Hearing (Exhibit C-0486). The Claimant maintained that
the admission of the New Documents was warranted; and it requested that the

Tribunal confirm the admission of all documents labeled C-0476 through C-0486.
The Tribunal addresses below the admission of these several “de bene esse” materials.

On 19 April 2017, the Parties agreed on transcript corrections. The finalized

transcripts were sent to the Tribunal on 1 May 2017.

During the Pre-Hearing conference-call on 6 February 2017 and again at the
Hearing, !* the Tribunal requested the Parties to try to complete and provide an agreed
chronology. On 21 April 2017, the Claimant sent to the Respondent a draft
chronology for comments. On 22 April 2017, the Respondent objected to the draft
prepared by the Claimant. On the same date, the Claimant transmitted its draft

chronology to the Tribunal.

On 23 April 2017, the Tribunal inquired when the Respondent would be in a position
to submit its own draft chronology and/or comment on the Claimant’s draft
chronology. On 28 April 2017, the Respondent replied that it would provide

comments within 2-3 weeks.
On 17 May 2017, each Party filed a statement of costs.

On 22 May 2017, the Respondent sent a redline PDF reflecting Respondent’s
comments on the draft chronology prepared by the Claimant to the Tribunal. A clean

The “de bene esse” Materials: As to C-0456 and C-0458 to C-0463, these materials
were submitted as exhibits to the Claimant’s Memorial on Jurisdiction and
Admissibility. The Respondent requested that the Claimant withdraw them or,
alternatively, that the Tribunal strike them from the record pursuant to Article 9(2)(f)
of the IBA Rules. The Claimant refused to withdraw them. The Tribunal ruled on the

first day of the Hearing that it should retain and inspect these documents de bene esse.

As to Exhibits C-0476 to C-0488, the Claimant submitted these materials on 24
February (C-0476 through C-0487) and 28 February 2017 (C-0488). The Respondent
did not oppose the admission of two of these documents, namely: C-0482 and C-0487.
The Tribunal decided on the first day of the Hearing that these other materials would

be inspected by the Tribunal de bene esse and ruled upon their admission later

The Tribunal has decided this procedural issue as follows: Only one of these
documents was referred to by the Claimant during the Hearing, namely C-0486 (see
the Claimant’s letter of 15 March 2017). In that letter, however, the Claimant asked
the Tribunal to confirm the admission of all its materials. In the circumstances, in the
absence of any material prejudice to the Respondent, the Tribunal has decided to

admit all such materials into the evidential file.

The Six (Seven Documents): On 21 June 2017, the Respondent filed an application for
the production of six additional documents produced by the Claimant in CRCICA
Arbitration No. 896/2013. The Claimant objected to their production by letter of 30
June 2017. The Respondent replied by letter of 8 August 2017.

On 4 September 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 13 (“PO13”). The
Tribunal ordered the Claimant to produce to the Tribunal and the Respondent true
copies of the requested documents de bene esse. The Tribunal made the production of
these documents subject to the Parties’ entering into a suitable confidentiality
agreement given that four of the documents were said to be confidential as regards

other interested parties.

On 20 September 2017, following the execution by the Respondent of a
confidentiality undertaking, the Claimant produced the six documents ordered by the

Tribunal. The Claimant also produced an additional seventh contemporaneous

document, a Termination Agreement dated 27 November 2003 (not covered by

POI3).

By letter of 23 November 2017, the Respondent asserted that the six documents
produced were highly relevant and material to the issues of corruption, reiterated its
request that the Six Documents be admitted into evidence, and sought permission
from the Tribunal to file a short submission on these documents to assist the Tribunal.
By letters of 30 November 2017 and 8 December 2017, the Claimant objected to the
application and requested that the Tribunal reject the Respondent’s proposal for a

written submission supporting admission of the six documents.

On 12 December 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 14 (“PO14”). The
Tribunal granted permission to the Respondent to submit, in writing, short
observations not exceeding five pages on “the six documents.” Further, the Tribunal
requested the Respondent to comment, in writing, upon the other matters raised in the

Claimant’s letter dated 8 December 2017.

By its letter dated 8 December 2017, the Claimant informed the Tribunal (inter alia)
of developments in the CRICA Arbitration (896) between UFG and EGAS:

Earlier this week, on December 5, 2017, EGAS sought leave from the
Tribunal in CRCICA Case 896 to disclose to Egypt the pleadings filed by
UFG and EGAS on EGAS’ corruption defense in that case. EGAS
explained to the Tribunal that it sought such leave because Egypt intends
to submit these Case 896 pleadings in this arbitration. Specifically, EGAS
stated: ‘We understand that the Arab Republic of Egypt would seek to
place these submissions before the tribunal in Union Fenosa Gas, S.A. v.
Arab Republic of Egypt (ICSID Case No. ARB/14/4).’ Egypt's
determination to use these materials must be quite strong since EGAS
made its request notwithstanding that the Case 896 Tribunal had already
closed that proceeding and admonished the parties not to submit further
requests [...] As we have previously noted, EGAS has entered into a joint
defense agreement with Egypt and is therefore doubtless well informed of
Egypt's intentions in this arbitration [...].

Pursuant to PO14, the Respondent made its written submissions on the “six
documents” and other matters by letter dated 21 December 2017. At the Tribunal’s
request of 23 December 2017 under PO14, the Claimant submitted its response by
letter dated 3 January 2018.

Part I - Page 14 of 16

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 41 of 347

Pursuant to the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 15, the Respondent made further
submissions by letter dated 22 January 2018; and the Claimant made further

submissions by letter also dated 22 January 2018.

In its Procedural Order No. 16 dated 2 February 2018, the Tribunal decided as

follows:

1. The Tribunal refers to the Respondent’s application to the Tribunal for
an order admitting new documents into this arbitration’s evidential file
and to the Claimant’s opposition to the Respondent’s application. The
Respondent’s application addressed originally only six documents. The
Claimant thereafter produced a seventh document. The Tribunal considers
that all seven documents should be read together for the purpose of this
Procedural Order.

2. The Tribunal refers to its Procedural Orders Nos 13, 14 and 15 and the
Parties’ respective letters (or email messages) dated 22 January 2018
(two), 3 January 2018, 21 December 2017, 8 December 2017, 30
November 2017, 23 November 2017, 20 September 2017 (email), 19
September 2017 (email), 8 August 2017, 30 June 2017 and 21 June 2017.

3. Notwithstanding the Respondent's application made at a late stage of
this arbitration, the Tribunal considers that these six new documents are
relevant to issues raised by the Parties’ dispute, as also the seventh
document. Accordingly, the Tribunal has decided to admit these seven new
documents into the evidential file, together with the Parties’ several
submissions regarding these documents made in their respective
correspondence listed above.

4. This Procedural Order is strictly limited to the admission of the seven
new documents into the evidential file. The arbitration’s evidential file is
closed to the Parties. Nonetheless, the Tribunal reserves its right to
request any further written explanations from the Parties.

The “Parallel Arbitrations”: By letter dated 8 June 2018, the Respondent informed
the Tribunal of developments in certain “parallel arbitrations.” By letter dated 8 June
2018, the Claimant responded to the Respondent’s said letter. By its Procedural Order
No. 17 of 11 July 2018 (see also below), the Tribunal decided to retain these two
letters on the file for information and not evidential purposes; and, in the
circumstances, it rejected the Claimant’s application to respond further to the

Respondent’s letter.

PART IT: THE PARTIES’ DISPUTE

(1) Introduction

A dispute exists under the Treaty between the Claimant, UFG, and the Respondent,
the Arab Republic of Egypt, in regard to UFG’s alleged investments in Egypt
regarding the Damietta natural gas liquefaction plant located in the northeast of Egypt
(the “Damietta Plant”) and associated legal and contractual rights. In general terms,
UFG’s business concerns the liquefaction, shipping, regasification and
commercialisation of natural gas. The Respondent, a sovereign State, advances
objections as to jurisdiction and admissibility in regard to the Claimant’s claims.
Alternatively, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to suspend this arbitration
pending the resolution of similar disputes in other arbitrations. In the further
alternative, the Respondent denies any liability to the Claimant and, if liable, disputes

the amounts of compensation claimed by the Claimant.
(2) The Claimant’s Claims

In summary, UFG contends that the Respondent has failed, through its own acts and
omissions and through the acts and omissions of its State instrumentalities and organs
for which the Respondent bears international responsibility (EGPC and EGAS), to
afford to UFG’s investments in Egypt the protections granted by the Treaty.! UFG
contends that its investments have suffered and continue to suffer significant harm as
a result of the decisions attributable to the Respondent to curtail and cut the supply of
natural gas to the Damietta Plant, which eventually resulted in the Damietta Plant’s

complete shut-down for lack of the necessary gas supply.”

UFG contends that the Respondent, through its own actions and omissions and by the
acts and omissions of EGAS, EGPC and their affiliates, has breached its substantive
obligations under the Treaty; namely:} (i) the obligation to grant fair and equitable
treatment to UFG’s investments under Article 4(1); (ii) the obligation not to hamper
by means of unjustified or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance,
use, enjoyment, expansion or disposal of UFG’s investment under Article 3(1); (iii)

the obligation to protect UFG’s investment under Article 3(1); and (iv) the obligation

Part Il — Page 1 of 6

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 44 of 347

to provide UFG’s investment with treatment not less favourable than that accorded to
investments made by its own nationals or investors of a third country under Articles

4(5) and 4(2) of the Treaty.
(3) The Respondent’s Objections, Responses and Defences

2.4 Insummary, as to jurisdiction and admissibility, the Respondent first contends that the
Damietta project was “riddled with corruption”: UFG selected Halliburton, whose bid
was US$ 50 million higher than that of the next competitor, as its subcontractor; and
Halliburton’s CEO pleaded guilty in the USA to violations of the US Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, including bribes and kickbacks in connection with the Damietta

Project.‘

2.5. In addition, the Respondent contends that UFG’s procurement of the Project is replete

with “red flags.” As explained later in Part VII of this Award, these red flags include

the following, based particularly on the “Six Documents” nn

(i) _ the Project takes place in a country known for corrupt payments, namely Egypt

at the time of the events in question;

(ii)

(iii) There is no substantial time lag between
and the date when the main contract is awarded to the principal ( tol
August 2000);

(iv) The subject matter of the fe is not tangible (for example, i

(v) The agent has a close personal or family relationship, or business relationship,
with a public official or relative of an official (such as that between Mr El Komy
and the Respondent’s Minister Mr Fahmy), which is the only qualification the

agent brings to the venture;

structure (EATCO is a shell entity owned by members of Mr El Komy’s
family);

The Respondent submits, therefore, that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction or should not
exercise its jurisdiction because the Claimant procured its alleged investments through
corrupt and illegal means in violation of Egyptian law and international public

5
policy.

The Respondent next contends that the Claimant has failed to establish that its alleged
investments were investments of a Spanish investor at the time that the acts and
omissions occurred that the Claimant alleges to constitute violations of the Treaty.
The Respondent submits that, in July 2007, SEGAS assigned to HSBC UK all of its
rights under the Tolling Agreements in the context of a refinancing transaction that
led UFG to pledge to HSBC Egypt its shares in SEGAS, and associated rights to the
Damietta Plant, as security. Accordingly, the Respondent submits that the Claimant

has failed to establish any investment under the Treaty.°

The Respondent next contends that this dispute is essentially contractual in nature?
and has been submitted to contractual arbitrations.* Accordingly, the Respondent
submits that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction or should not exercise its jurisdiction

over this dispute.

As to the suspension of this arbitration, the Respondent requests that this Tribunal
suspend or stay this arbitration until the resolution of the contractual claims in the

contractual arbitrations by the ICC and CRCICA tribunals.?

As to the merits, the Respondent contends that the conduct of which UFG complains
is not attributable to the Respondent;!° nor is the conduct an exercise of sovereign
powers that could engage the Respondent’s international responsibility under the
Treaty;!'! there is, in any event, no breach of the FET standard of the Treaty; the
Respondent did not fail to accord protection to UFG’s investment;!? the Respondent
did not impair the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or expansion of UFG’s
investment by unjustified or discriminatory measures; '* the Respondent did not fail to
accord to UFG National or MFN Treatment;!> and, in any event, any wrongful
conduct complained of would be precluded by state of necessity, if, quod non, such
conduct were attributable to the Respondent, involved an exercise of governmental

authority and was not in conformity with the obligations under the Treaty. !° Further,

the Respondent contends that no recoverable damages have been proven by UFG.!7
(4) The Parties’ Prayers for Relief

Jurisdiction/Admissibility - The Respondent's Claim for Relief. The Respondent
requests the Tribunal in Paragraph 110 of its Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction

(3) The SPA (C-0002]

The Sale and Purchase Agreement dated 1 August 2000 between UFACEX as Buyer
(later “assigned” to UFG) and EGPC as Seller (later “assigned” to EGAS) (the

“SPA”) provides in material part, as follows:

Article 5.1 of the SPA: “Seller’s Obligations”

[1] Given that the capacity of the Complex shall be known once the EPC
Contract is executed, Buyer shall notify Seller the nominal capacity of the
Complex as prompt [sic] as possible after signature of the EPC Contract,

Part III — Page 3 of 11

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 52 of 347

and Seller commits to sell and deliver to the Buyer at the Delivery Point up
to the maximum of the amount of NG needed for the nominal capacity of
the Complex, according to the terms of this Agreement and the nomination
procedure to be included in the Coordination, Operating and
Measurement Agreement.

[2] In the event that new natural gas liquefaction trains are constructed by
Buyer, then Buyer shall notify Seller of the nominal capacity of the new
train/s as prompt [sic] as possible and Seller undertakes to sell and deliver
to Buyer at the Delivery Point up to the maximum of the amount of NG and
daily quantities of NG needed for such capacity.

[3] Seller shall also sell and deliver to the Buyer at the Delivery Point the
NG that Buyer requests for the execution of the commissioning, start-up
and testing, and any other action needed for the commercial operation of
the Complex, at the price set forth in Article 13, and with the specific
delivery conditions set forth under the Coordination, Operating and
Measurement Agreement.

[4] Seller shall be the exclusive responsible [sic] for the transportation,
supply and delivery of NG to the Delivery Point specified in Article 12.

[5] Seller shall at all times keep a back up supply to meet an on stream
(load) factor of 95% of the LNG Complex.

3.10. Article 6.1 of the SPA: “Take or Pay”

During each Contract Year, Buyer will be obligated to purchase, take and
pay for, or pay for if not taken a minimum of ninety per cent (90%) of the
ACQ applicable for such Contract Year, less any amount of NG to be
deducted from the ACQ (or from the quantity applicable for each Contract
Year of the Build-up period, as the case may be) due to the occurrence of
(i) Force Majeure events, (ii) Seller’s failure to supply the NG, and/or (iii)
scheduled maintenance of the Complex (‘Adjusted ACQ’).

If for any reason whatsoever, the capacity of the Complex is increased
(due to the increase in capacity of the first train up to a maximum of 10%
of the then existing ACQ or due to the construction of new train/s), Seller
shall be obligated to sell and deliver to Buyer the NG necessary for that
increase in capacity. The take or pay obligations of the Buyer for the first
train shall not be altered and therefore they shall be 90% of the ACO as
defined in 4.1, less the amounts and concepts mentioned in (i), (ii) and (iii)
of this Section 6.1.

3.11. Article 8.1 of the SPA: “Failure to Supply NG”

[1] Jf Seller, for reasons other than Force Majeure or Buyer’s failure to
take, fails to deliver at the Delivery Point a quantity of NG nominated by
Buyer according to this Agreement, Seller shall be liable to Buyer for any
damages, costs and/or expenses (to the extent permissible under Egyptian
laws, but excluding consequential damages and loss of profits) arising

Part III — Page 4 of 11

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 53 of 347

from Seller’s failure to supply, including (i) third party’s claims and
penalties against Buyer, (ii) costs, extra-costs, damages and expenses
caused to the Complex arising from Seller’s failure to supply, including
operation and maintenance costs (expressed in USD per MMBTU), and
capital investment costs (expressed in USD per MMBTU).”

[2] Seller’s liability vis-a-vis Buyer as a result of this Section 8.1 shall not
exceed an amount equivalent to ninety per cent (90%) of the Price
applicable to the NG not delivered by Seller.

3.12. Article 9.1 of the SPA: “NG Specifications”

The quality specification of the NG to be supplied to Buyer, shall be in
accordance with the Specifications contained in Annex 2 (‘NG
Specifications’) of this Agreement, which shall include the typical values
for such NG and the limits of such values which are acceptable for Buyer.
The procedures for measurement of quality and tests shall be developed in
the Coordination, Operating and Measurement Agreement referred to in
Article 19.

3.13. Article 11.1 of the SPA: “Scheduling”

The provisions regarding the nominations, procedures, deviations from
nominations, commissioning and tests, and maintenance, among others,
shall be developed by the Parties in the Coordination, Operating and
Measurement Agreement referred to in Article 19.

3.14. Article 15.1 of the SPA: “Definition of Force Majeure”

For the purposes of this agreement ‘Force Majeure’ means an event or
circumstance which is beyond the reasonable control of a Party or Parties
(acting and having acted with reasonable level of due diligence) resulting
in or causing failure by the Party concerned to perform any of its
obligations hereunder.

3.15. Article 15.2 of the SPA: “Suspension of Obligations”

The Parties shall be relieved from liability under this Agreement for so
long as and to the extent that due to Force Majeure, and without limiting
the generality of the foregoing Section 15.1, any of the following events or
circumstances, (each of which shall constitute a Force Majeure event only
to the extent that it satisfies the requirements of Section 15.1) occurs:

Any act of war, invasion, armed forces conflict or act of foreign enemy,
blockade, embargo or revolution.

Any riot, insurrection, civil commotion, act or campaign of terrorism or
sabotage that is part of religious or ethnic unrest or commotion that is
widespread or nationwide, such as, by way of example and not limitation,
actions associated with or directed against the Buyer (or its contractors)

Part III — Page 5 of 11

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 54 of 347

as a part of a broader pattern of actions against companies or facilities
with foreign ownership or management.

[el

(iv) Strikes, works to rule, labor unrest or go-slows that are
widespread or nationwide or that are of a political nature, (but not where
the same is related to the Seller or any of their assignees, affiliates, joints
ventures [sic], contractors and subcontractors or successors in title) such
as, by way of example and not limitation, labor actions directed against

(iii) Are due to the inability of the transportation system and/or
pipeline (whether for reasons of maintenance, repairs or lack of
capacity or otherwise) to meet consumer demand and/or Buyer
demand.

PART IV: THE PRINCIPAL ISSUES

(1) Introduction

The Tribunal divides the principal matters and issues arising from the Parties’ dispute
into the following categories, as here numbered by reference to the Parts of the Award

that follow.
(2) Principal Issues

(V) Principal Facts: In Part V of the Award, the Tribunal describes the relevant
persons and events. The latter takes the form of a chronology, limited to the facts

found nec!

 

sary by the Tribunal for the purposes of this Award.

(VI) Jurisdiction (with Admissibility) Issues: In Part VI of the Award, the Tribunal
addresses the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections; namely (as alleged by the
Respondent): (i) the absence of any protected investments within the meaning of
Article 1 of the Treaty and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention; (ii) the “claim-
splitting” tactics employed by the Claimant and SEGAS in their disputes and several
arbitrations with the Respondent and EGAS; and (iii) the contractual nature of the

Claimant’s claims.

(VII) Corruption Issues: In Part VII of the Award, the Tribunal addresses the
Respondent’s other objection to jurisdiction and admissibility based on “corruption,”
namely the several alleged acts of corruption by the Claimant (including its

predecessor UFACEX) in procuring the SPA made with EGPC (succeeded by EGAS).

(VIII) Necessity Issues: In Part VIII of the Award, the Tribunal addresses the defence
of necessity under customary international law pleaded by the Respondent to preclude
its international responsibility for the alleged international wrongs under the Treaty
towards the Claimant. (The Treaty does not contain any specific provision on the

defence of necessity).

(IX) Merits Issues: In Part IX of the Award, the Tribunal addresses the merits of the

Claimant’s claims and the Respondent’s defences under the Treaty.

respective submissions on compensation, applying the legal principles applicable

under the Treaty and international law.

(XI) Stay/Suspension Issues: In Part XI of the Award, the Tribunal addresses the

to exercise its jurisdiction, or order a stay (or suspension) of this arbitration pending

the resolution of CRCICA and ICC arbitrations.

(XII) Costs Issues: In Part XII of the Award, the Tribunal addresses the Parties’
respective claims for legal and arbitration costs under Article 61(2) of the ICSID

PART V: THE PRINCIPAL FACTS

(1) Introduction

The following description of persons and events is not exhaustive, albeit lengthy.
Moreover, the events are mostly confined to evidential references to contemporary
documentation in the form of a documentary chronology. The chronology is largely
drawn from the Parties’ own chronologies submitted at the request of the Tribunal.
These rival chronologies were not agreed between the Parties; and, further, it should
not be assumed that any Party agrees with the Tribunal’s chronology below, recording

the more limited facts found necessary by the Tribunal for the purpose of this Award.
(2) Dramatis Personae

The project for the Damietta Plant included several legal and other persons, at

different times.

UFG: UFG is the Claimant. It is a company incorporated under the laws of Spain, and
(by “assignment”) a contractual party to the SPA. It also owns just under 80% of
SEGAS’ shares. Mr J.M. Egea Krauel was UFG’s Chairman from December 2009
onwards. In March 2010, Mr J. Saez Ramirez was appointed UFG’s Executive Vice-
President for Supply and Operations. Both testified as factual witnesses in this

arbitration.!

UFACEX: UFG’s predecessor-in-interest in regard to the SPA and the Damietta Plant
was Union Fenosa Desarrollo y Accion Exterior S.A. (“UFACEX”). It was a wholly
owned subsidiary of Unién Fenosa, which later merged with another company to

become Gas Natural Fenosa SDG, S.A., and which holds 50% of the shares in UFG.

UFGC: UFG owns 99.99% of UFGC. UFGC bought gas from UFG, and sold it on to

other customers outside Egypt.

SEGAS: SEGAS, the owner and operator of the Damietta Plant, is owned as to just
under 80% by UFG. UFG established SEGAS in 2000, as an Egyptian joint stock
company majority-owned by UFG, to develop and operate the Damietta Plant. At the

time of the SPA, the Damietta Free Zone was operative, having been established in

' Egea Krauel WS; Tr. D2 482-552; Sdez Ramirez WS1 and WS2; Tr. D2 401-477.

Part V—Page I of 102

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 63 of 347

1993.? As intended by UFG, SEGAS was granted tax-free status under Egyptian tax
laws by GAFI (the Respondent’s General Authority for Foreign Investment and Free
Zones).> That tax status was changed by the Respondent in 2008. That change forms

part of UFG’s claims in this arbitration.

5.7. Of SEGAS’ directors from 2000 to 2009, Mr Fernandez Martinez testified as a factual
witness in this arbitration. Another former director and shareholder was Mr Yehia El
Komy (who was not called as a witness in this arbitration). Mr J.L. de Lara Alonso-
Burén was an engineer employed by SEGAS at the Damietta Plant from April 2005 to
December 2012 (excepting a period of convalescence in Spain from December 2006

to November 2007). He testified as a factual witness in this arbitration.*
5.8 As Mr Fernandez Martinez testified:

Union Fenosa decided from the beginning to create a local corporate
vehicle, SEGAS, for the sole purpose of building, owning and operating
the Damietta Plant. SEGAS was incorporated in Egypt in 2000. SEGAS
does not itself own, purchase, or export gas but instead provides
liquefaction services in exchange for the payment of a tolling fee. The fee
is to be paid by UFG and EGAS as tollers (companies who own natural
gas that is liquefied at the LNG plant) under two separate Tolling
Contracts and is prorated on the basis of the gas quantities they have
contracted to toll through the Plant. EGPC and EGAS each obtained 10%
ownership of SEGAS; and EGAS obtained 51.98% of the Plant's
production capacity for an initial four-year period and thereafter only up
to 41.80% for the remaining contract years.°

5.9 Gas Natural Fenosa: In 2009, Union Fenosa merged with Gas Natural SDG, S.A.,
becoming “Gas Natural Fenosa.” As a result, Gas Natural Fenosa owns 50% of UFG,
which in turn owns 79.99870% of SEGAS. The remaining shares in SEGAS are
owned by EGAS (10%), EGPC (10%) and a subsidiary of Gas Natural Fenosa
(0.00087%).

5.10 ENT: In 2003, Union Fenosa sold 50% of its interest in UFG to ENI Spa. (“ENT”).

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 64 of 347

For ease of reference below, save where the context requires otherwise, these different
entities are described as “Unidn Fenosa,” “Gas Natural Fenosa,” “SEGAS,”

“UFACEX” and “UFG” (as the sole Claimant in this arbitration).

EATCO: The Egyptian Arab Trading Company (“EATCO”) is an Egyptian company,
operated and controlled by Mr Yehia El Komy, a national of Egypt. From the early
days of the Project, EATCO and Mr El Komy had a relationship with Union Fenosa.

Mr El Komy was not a witness in this arbitration.

In brief, this relationship included the following: EATCO and UFACEX entered into
an agreement on 9 March 2000,° under which the parties were to undertake a pre-
feasibility study into the Damietta Plant, and EATCO was to provide logistical and
technical support to UFACEX. UFACEX

Mr El Komy: As already indicated, Mr Yehia El Komy was an Egyptian businessman,
operating EATCO, of which he was the Chairman and Managing Director. His role in
the Project is controversial and strongly disputed between the Parties. As pleaded in
the Claimant’s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, the Claimant contended
that Mr El Komy was the originator of the Project, a partner of UFACEX and that the
fees he received were relatively modest in the light of his contributions to the Project,

beginning with events leading up to the SPA.'°

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 65 of 347

The Respondent contends that Mr El Komy’s role was much more significant, as part
of a corrupt conspiracy involving (inter alia) EATCO, UFACEX and UFG. The
Respondent refers, in particular, to contemporary documents, all of which are
addressed in the chronology below under the heading “Six Documents” (there are, in

fact, seven such documents).!!

EGPC: The Respondent created EGPC (the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation)

by law in 1976 to regulate and manage the Egyptian hydrocarbons sector. '?

EGAS: EGAS is wholly owned by EGPC. It succeeded, by way of “assignment” to
EGPC’s rights and obligations under the SPA. It was created by Decree of the
Egyptian Minister of Petroleum in August 2001 to regulate, organise, and exploit the
Respondent’s natural gas resources.'? From 2004 to December 2009, Mr Hassan El
Mahdy was EGAS’ assistant vice-chairman for operations; and from June 2010 to
December 2011, he was EGAS’ vice-chairman for operations. Mr El Mahdy testified

as a factual witness in this arbitration. 4

According to the Claimant, the Respondent created EGAS and EGPC to allow it to
exercise control over the hydrocarbons and energy sectors in Egypt; and the
Respondent used and continues to use these companies and their affiliates to exercise
governmental authority and to dominate all aspects of natural gas exploration,

development, production, liquefaction and sale in Egypt.

The EPC Contractor: In 2001 SEGAS awarded a contract for the engineering,
procurement and construction of the Damietta Plant (the “EPC Contract’) to a joint
venture consortium!> comprised of three international companies, one of which was

Halliburton KBR (“Halliburton”).

(3) Selected Factual Chronology

The Tribunal sets out below its selected factual chronology, with annotations. As

already indicated, it is based largely on the rival chronologies prepared by the Parties.

1999: The Minister of Petroleum (Mr Sameh Fahmy) produces an Integrated Gas
Strategy (1999) for the natural gas industry of Egypt to 2017 (the “Master Plan”):

In 1999, the Egyptian government declared that domestic demand had
been met and encouraged the search for export markets.

In conjunction with that search, the Integrated Gas Strategy (1999) in
Egypt was penned by Mr Sameh Fahmi, Petroleum Minister. It featured
the creation of a ‘Master Plan’ which should remain valid through 2017.
The Master Plan involves price optimization to attract investors, increased
gas exports, and_ infrastructure development, qualified by six
considerations:

1. An export ceiling — 25% of total production;

2. No foreign or domestic gas operator may export gas from Egypt prior to
investing in Egypt’s domestic gas market;

3. Special incentives were established to encourage foreign and Egyptian
Exploration & Production (E&P) companies to establish marketing
franchises, in order to promote gas-based business within Egypt;

4. Incentives were also established to encourage diversification within the
gas industry;

5. Exploration & Production (E&P) incentives were aimed to maintain a
higher level of attractiveness, when compared with neighboring countries;

6. All businesses within Egypt — whether state-controlled, private, or
mixed — were encouraged to convert to natural gas for energy needs.°

21 January 2000 - The Six Documents: The Respondent refers to the first of the Six

 

to Mr Elias Velasco Garcia of Unidn Fenosa, with an attached fax of 20 January 2000

5.28 The fax of 20 January 2000 from Mr El Komy states (inter alia) in relation to the
Project: “we would like to inform you that we have obtained the initial approval from

the Egyptian government to construct such a project.” It is cited more fully below:

Reference to our telephone conversation at this week and with regard to
the meeting held on Jan 10, 2000 with Mr Omar El-Koumy, ADGAS-U.A.E.
regarding the Spanish company interest to construct LNG and Electrical
Power Plant of 500 MW using local Egyptian natural gas, we would like to
inform you that we have obtained the initial approval from the Egyptian
government to [construct] such Project.

The power plant of 500 MW will be able to supply the LNG plant with the
required electricity and the remaining capacity will be tied to the local
national grid with mutual agreement on the prices of natural gas and
supply of electricity to the national grid per KW.

We also can obtain long term supply of natural gas with a contract of
25 years renewable for another 25 years and so on. The price formula will
be mutually agreed between the Egyptian government and the new
company to be established to construct such project.

EATCO will secure all local land for the project and all local license for
the project and also EATCO will be the local partner in this project.

I’m going to meet the minister of petroleum of Egypt on 23.1.2000 for
arranging the meetings required with you and the Spanish company in this
regard. We understand that the Spanish company will fund the project
completely and will be able to utilize all LNG produced by this plant. We
understand that the capacity of LNG will be in the range of 2.5 million
metric tons per year.

The official gas price will be US50.041 per m? of natural gas supplied to
the battery limit of LNG [...]

5.29 It also sets out a work plan with meetings in Egypt to be attended by Union Fenosa,
including a meeting with the “Oil Minister” to explain the Project and “to confirm the

approval of the Egyptian government to the Project.”

5.30 According to the Respondent, this first document directly contradicts the Claimant’s
contention that “the SPA was the result of genuine arm’s length negotiations between

»21

the parties involved. In fact, again according to the Respondent, this document

shows that, even before UFACEX had even met with the Minister of Petroleum

(Mr Sameh Fahmy), or submitted a proposal for the SPA, iii

had already secured “the initial approval” for the Damietta Project (in only ten days).
As the cover letter addressed to Union Fenosa states, so the Respondent submits, Mr
El Komy’s representation confirmed the “reality and viability” of the expectations
shared by Union Fenosa, apparently to obtain the Project by any means. It did so ina
contract of the same duration, substantially the same quantity and cs

26-30 January 2000: A delegation from UFACEX attends a meeting with the Minister
of Petroleum (Mr Sameh Fahmy) in Egypt. A contemporaneous memorandum

prepared by a member of the UFACEX delegation describes the meeting as follows:

Between January 26 and 30, a UNION FENOSA delegation held a series
of meetings for the purpose of gathering information and obtaining a
clearer perception of the potential LNG project that had been presented to
the management of UNION FENOSA {...] we had a meeting with the
Minister of Petroleum, Sameh Fahmy, who has openly confirmed the
support of the Government of Egypt for this Project. The Minister
mentioned during the meeting that other international groups had
expressed an interest in the Project, and encouraged UNION FENOSA to
submit a proposal for negotiation (in case UNION FENOSA was
interested in the Project) shortly. Thus, in relation to this meeting with the
Minister, we have summarized our impressions of him and our/the
Minister's commitments:

- A young, active and ambitious Minister.
- He is very familiar with the gas business.

- Although he has been Minister for only a short time, he is eager to doa
‘well-known’ project in a short period of time.

- He has a personal interest in the project and entering the Spanish
market.

- We have his support for the project and his commitment to provide the
gas with a long-term contract of 20 to 25 years at a competitive price
23

This meeting is the beginning of the negotiations leading to the execution of the SPA
on 1 August 2000. These negotiations are conducted for EGPC by a committee
comprised of the EGPC Chairman (Mr Mohamed Tawila), the EGPC Vice-Chairman
for production (Mr Hassan Akl), the EGPC Vice-Chairman for natural gas

(Mr Mohamed Latef), the Assistant General Manager of GASCO’s Natural Gas
Management Division (Mr Ahmed Shaaban) and the legal counsellor for Engineering
for the Petroleum and Process Industries (ENPP) (Mr Ahmed Taha). Mr Shaaban

testified as a factual witness in this arbitration.”
5.33. Mr Shaaban’s witness statement described the negotiations of the SPA as follows:

During the negotiations with UFACEX, which lasted for several months,
no representatives from the Ministry of Petroleum or Government were
present. EGPC was negotiating in its own name and independently, and
all instructions to Committee members were made by EGPC
representatives. I am not aware of any instructions given by the Ministry
to the members of the Committee on the terms we negotiated with
UFACEX, and as far as I know, the Ministry was not involved in these
negotiations, nor was EGPC required to seek or obtain any approvals
from the Ministry regarding these terms. *°

5.34 2 March 2000 - The Six Documents: The Respondent next refers, as the second of
these documents, to the minutes of 2 March 2000 of a UFACEX internal meeting
(“UFGTREATY 0047964”).

5.35 These minutes, headed “Re: Natural Gas Liquefaction Project in Egypt,” record the
attendees of this meeting as follows: Mr Eloy Alvarez Pelegry, Mr Juan Manuel
Alvarez Gonzalez, Mr Jorge Porras, Mr Antonio Hernando Villaroya, Mr José Maria

Suarez and Mr Arturo Torrego.
5.36 The “matters discussed” at the meeting include the following:

Mr Antonio Hernando produced the draft letter to EATCO, for signature
by Mr Eloy Alvarez, in which the request for additional information and
for a possible meeting date of March 7 is repeated.

He also produced the draft MoU with EATCO which, with slight changes
(postponement of the date of commitment to a pre-feasibility study and a
fuller description of the tasks that EATCO undertakes to carry out in this
first phase) will be used at the next meeting. He also produced a form
Confidentiality Agreement between EATCO and UFACEX, which may be
used as a model for work with engineers/consultants, who will be
mentioned below.

The MoU with the Egyptian Authority is being drawn up as a draft in two
different versions: depending on whether EATCO is simply an agent

activating the project or more of an investor partner. This document may
not be finalized until such time as these and other points of the agreements
with EATCO have been defined [...]

According to the Respondent, these minutes, some two months prior to the MOU for
the Project, show that UFACEX deliberated on preparing two different versions of the
MOU, one portraying Mr El Komy’s company EATCO as “simply an agent activating
the project”; and the other as “investor partner.” As alleged by the Respondent,
despite the Claimant’s contention that Mr El Komy played a leading role in the
Project i. ix May 2000 UFACEX
adopted a version of the MOU that did not disclose EATCO’s stake in the Project (or
refer to it at all), thereby demonstrating a concern within UFACEX about disclosing

26

Mr El Komy’s role in procuring the Project.

09 March 2000: UFACEX and EATCO execute a Preliminary Agreement. It

provides, in material part:

WHEREAS

1. UFACEX is a Spanish Company working in the field of electricity
and gas.

2. UFACEX is interested in entering in the market of [...| Egypt by means
of [...] developing, constructing and operating a single train of Liquefied
Natural Gas Project (LNG Project) in Egypt.

3. EATCO has been rendering advisory and assistance services in Egypt
for many years, EATCO is also investing in several projects in oil and
petrochemical sector, and is interested in co-operating with UFACEX, in
the above-mentioned LNG Project.

Both parties have met in Cairo on 26th-28th January 2000 and in Madrid
on 8th-9th March 2000 and have agreed to study and analyse co-operating
in the LNG Project. Both Parties agree to the following [...°"

21 March 2000: UFACEX and the Minister of Petroleum meet to negotiate the LNG
project in Egypt. A letter from UFACEX to the Minister following the meeting
records UFACEX’s understanding of the outcome:

First of all, we would like to thank your Excellency for the opportunities

we had to meet with you to discuss the LNG Project in Egypt. Since our
last meeting on the 2Ist of March, and in accordance with your

The First Party [Mr Yehia El Komy] provided the required services for
the establishment of this project. It introduced the Spanish Companies to
the Egyptian Government through meetings with the Minister of Petroleum
and other officials in the Egyptian Government. The First Party also
played a main role in obtaining the required official approvals for the
establishment of the projects, in addition to the raw natural gas supply
approvals, the land allocation, and the coordination with official and
financial entities for the establishment of the project.??

5.41 17 May 2000: EGPC and UFACEX execute a Memorandum of Understanding (the
“MOU”. It states:

ARTICLE 2 PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF THIS MOU.

The purpose of this MOU is to determine the general framework of the
Natural Gas Sale and Purchase Agreement and the responsibilities and
commitments to be assumed by each Party with the aim to support the
development of the Project. The Parties will cooperate and act in good
faith and diligently to pursue the development of the Project.

5.42 31 May 2000: UFACEX and the Minister of Petroleum continue to consider the LNG
project in Egypt. A memorandum written on the same day by a member of the

UFACEX delegation records:

In successive visits to Egypt, we have completed a set of tasks aimed at
establishing a framework of information upon which decisions can be
made with respect to the LNG Project. [...] The long-term supply of
Natural Gas for the LNG Plant will come from the Government of Egypt’s
share [of gas] in the production of international operators through a long-
term purchase contract (25 years extendable by another period of identical
duration) with EGPC. [...] [I]n recent conversations with the Minister of

5.49 May-July 2000: The EGPC Chairman asks the EGPC Board of Directors to review

and approve the proposed SPA. His memorandum records:

Based on the request of the Spanish Unién Fenosa company to purchase
the gas needed to produce about 4 million tons per annum; with the
company to cover the costs of setting up the liquefaction and storage
facilities and the shipping pier and to secure the necessary financing for
this purpose; and with the company to also take care of the operations to
transfer the liquefied natural gas to Spain; and with the responsibility of
the Egyptian side being restricted to supplying gas in the quantities and
specifications until liquefaction.*"

5.50 15 July 2000: A memorandum of understanding, in principle, is signed between
EGPC and UFG. Later, the EGPC Chairman’s own note summarises the effect of the

memorandum of understanding:

Agreement is to be reached on a sale price for the gas upon signing the
final contract. [...]

At the end of the negotiations, agreement was reached between the two
parties to implement the prices. This is considered to be a success for the
petroleum sector in the field of pricing gas for export, [...] This contract
has been signed in principle between the Egyptian General Petroleum
Commission and the Union Fenosa company on 15 July 2000, on
condition that the competent authorities approve the agreements that have
been made regarding the price of the gas, given the potential for this to
contribute to the dollar currency returns earned by the petroleum sector
[...] This will increase with the average export ratios. [...] [T]he matter is
being submitted to the Board of Directors so that they may review and
approve the draft agreement to sell gas to the Union Fenosa company and
begin the implementation procedures thereof.

5.52 25 July 2000: The Minister of Petroleum proposes to the Respondent’s Council of
Ministers for its session on 25 July 2000 that a memorandum of understanding should
be entered into with UFACEX.* This is followed by a letter from the Minister dated
27 July 2000 to the Prime Minister, Dr Atef Ebeid, on the SPA’s pricing terms.*' Also
in July 2000, the Minister sends a separate memorandum to the Council of Ministers,
summarising the then-draft SPA and the Project as a whole, and seeking the Council’s
approval for “signing a contract with the Spanish Company Unién Fenosa.”*? This

memorandum clearly preceded the SPA’s signing ceremony on 1 August 2000.

5.53 The Minister of Petroleum’s memorandum to the Council of Ministers for its session
on 25 July 2000, seeking its approval for the SPA, acknowledges that the SPA prices

fall within the range with accepted international prices:

In April 2000, Union Fenosa [...] requested to sign a contract on
purchasing the Egyptian natural gas to manufacture, liquefy and export,
and market it in Spain. In this framework, an understanding memorandum
was [executed] between the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation
(EGPC) and Union Fenosa in May [...] During the landmark visit which
was paid by His Excellency President Mohamed Hosni Mubarak to Spain
and which supported the project within the framework of encouraging the
economic cooperation between the two countries, and after signing the
above mentioned memorandum, intensive negotiations were carried out
between the two parties. The negotiations lasted till after the termination
of the visit and they aimed to sign the gas sales agreement and implement
the first project for natural gas liquefaction and export in the history of
Egypt. [...]

5.57 29 July 2000: The Ministry of Petroleum (Technical Affairs Division) acknowledges
approval of the draft SPA by EGPC Board and approval by Council of Ministers prior

to the execution of the SPA. In that acknowledgment, the following is recorded:

The role of the Egyptian Petroleum sector: Sale and supply of gas in the
quantities and specifications required to the liquefaction facilities at the
project’s site in northern Egypt, at a price paid in hard currency and
ranging from 0.75-1.25 USD MMBTU [...] Attached is a table [that]
indicates the sale prices of natural gas which is distributed [...] in some
countries competing with Egypt. The prices are almost identical to the
price of selling gas to liquefaction units [...]

The Project was submitted to the Economic Commission of the Board of
Directors of the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation and approved
on 20/7/2000. The Economic Commission recommended consulting the
board of the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation in this regard and
the board approved the project in its 12th session on 20/7/2000. The
Project was also submitted to the Council of Ministers and the council
approved the project on 25/7/2000.”

5.58 1 August 2000: UFACEX and EGPC execute the Natural Gas Sale and Purchase
Agreement (the “SPA”).°° Article 16.4 of the SPA contains a CRCICA arbitration
clause. Article 24.1 of the SPA provides that each Party to the SPA represented that it
acted “as principal and not as agent, fiduciary, or any other capacity.” Mr Shabaan

testified at the Hearing that EGPC was negotiating the SPA in its own name.*!

5.59 Later, on 17 October 2002, EGPC gave notice that it had novated its rights and
responsibilities under the SPA to EGAS, effective as of August 2000.°? On 30 June
2003, UFACEX sought permission to novate its rights and responsibilities under the

of at least 25 years. EGAS was to supply up to the maximum amount of natural gas
needed for the nominal capacity of the Plant, which resulted in a gas quantity of 7.56
billion cubic meters per annum (“bema”). The economics of the Damietta Plant were
dependent upon its receiving the contractually agreed quantities of natural gas from

EGPC (later EGAS).

Later, the Ministry of Petroleum produces a number of memoranda on the SPA for the
Council of Ministers or the Minister for Petroleum, after the SPA had been signed on
1 August 2000: an undated memorandum;*4 a memorandum dated 14 November 2006
outlining amendments to the SPA’s pricing mechanism, which had been negotiated
with UFG;*° and two memoranda dated 27 August 2007*° and January 2008°7
concerning further proposed amendments to the pricing mechanism in the SPA. The
Tribunal concludes the Respondent, by its Ministry of Petroleum and Council of

Ministers, was and remained familiar with the terms of the SPA.
The recitals to the SPA set out its purpose:

WHEREAS, Buyer intends to contract with Seller for the firm supply and
transportation by Seller of NG to the Complex, in which the NG will be
liquefied and transformed into liquefied natural gas (‘LNG’), to be
exported for sale to Spain and other territories.

The SPA contains several guarantees of supply of natural gas to the Damietta

Project, including:

Section 5.1. Seller shall at all times keep a back up supply to meet an on
stream (load) factor of 95% of the LNG Complex.

Section 23.2. Adequacy of Supply. Seller is the sole responsible [party] for
securing adequate supplies of N{atural] G[as] for performance of its
obligations hereunder. Seller shall, throughout the Term, provide Buyer or
Lenders with such further assurances as Buyer or Lenders may reasonably
request from time to time regarding the continued adequacy of N{atural]
G[as] supply sources relied upon by Seller to perform hereunder.

Section 24.3. Adequacy of Supply of N{atural] G[as]. Seller is aware that
the supply of N{atural] Glas] to Buyer under this Agreement is a key
element for the successful development of the Project, and therefore Seller
represents and warrants that its availability of NG will be sufficient to feed
the Complex under the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Also
Seller represents and warrants that it has, and will have during the Term,
all the legal, administrative and corporate rights, licenses and
authorizations to deliver the N{atural] G[as] at the Delivery Point and to
comply with all its obligations under this Agreement.

5.64 It also contains a force majeure provision that carves out “changes in market

conditions” from force majeure.

15.3 Failure of Market.

(b) In the case of the Seller, Force Majeure shall not include changes in
market conditions including, without limitation, changes that:

(i) Directly o[r] indirectly affect the demand for or price of N{atural] G[as].
(ii) Result in the diversion of N{atural] G[as] to other users.

(iii) Are due to the inability of the transportation system and/or pipeline
(whether for reasons of maintenance, repairs or lack of capacity or
otherwise) to meet consumer demand and/or Buyer demand.

5.65 EGPC undertakes in the SPA to obtain from Egyptian authorities an undertaking not

to interfere with UFACEX’s rights under the SPA:

Section 21.1. EGPC’s support to the Project. EGPC undertakes to procure
that the Egyptian authorities undertake not to interfere with the rights of
Buyer under this Agreement, and not to dictate or promulgate any act or
regulation which could directly or indirectly affect the rights of Buyer
under this Agreement, or affect the capacity of Buyer [sic] to perform its

5.86 07 May 2001: SEGAS is formally registered in the commercial registry of Egypt. This
is evident from a covering letter by UFACEX regarding various documents,

including:

Please find attached hereto the following documents [...| A photocopy of
the Business Registry document (provided by Yehia El Komi) [...}*!

5.87 08 July 2001: EGPC and UFG discuss gas supply and EGPC’s participation in the
Damietta Plant as the sole Egyptian shareholder (in SEGAS), as described in EGPC’s
letter to UFG:

Reference to your Fax [...] concerning the agenda of the proposed meeting
in Cairo next week, we would like to emphasize the following:

1. Gas supply to the first train will be 450 MMSCFD equivalent to 4 bem
as per article 4 of the contract which may have been repeatedly
communicated with you in several occasions.

2. EGPC participation of 10% in Damietta LNG plant is based on the
concept that EGPC will be the only Egyptian shareholder in this project.

Mr Fernandez Martinez testified:

During the EPC Bid Process in 2001, the two consortiums that we
considered recommended increasing the capacity of the LNG train to 7.56
Bem instead of 4.4 Bcm as originally agreed. This would allow a large
increase in capacity with almost the same initial investment and equivalent
operating costs because of significant economies of scale. We proposed
the increase in the size of the project and the Ministry of Petroleum agreed,
repeatedly assuring UFG that Egypt had ample gas supply to
accommodate expanded capacity and approved the expansion. Later, in
2002, UFG offered Egypt the opportunity to participate directly in the
Damietta Project and thus monetize Egypt’s natural gas resources by
selling LNG directly on the international market. The Government
expressed its interest in having EGAS and EGPC buy this increased
capacity. 82

agreement of SEGAS Board of Directors held on September 20, 2001. The
signing ceremony took place on December 19, 2001.°*

UFG was to expend an amount of about US$ 1.3 billion to build the Damietta Plant
and associated facilities in Egypt. The Damietta Plant was built as an integrated
single-train facility for the production of liquefied natural gas (“LNG”). It was located
in the Damietta Port Private Free Zone about 60 kilometres west of Port Said and the
Suez Canal. At the time of its construction, the Damietta Plant was the largest natural
gas liquefaction train operating in the world. It was completed on time and within

budget.

  

1 February 2002: UFG asks the Minister of Defence for assistance in relocating the

military base so as to facilitate the construction of the Damietta Plant:

Through{] the Damietta’s Port Authority we have maintained several
meetings, some of them, being attended by Militaries in Charge, reaching
an agreement in which we would take care of the expenses that this
military housing re-location may originate, and the Port Authorities would
provide them a new site inside the Damietta’s Port. [...]

[O]ur situation right now is critical and if this relocation does not occur
on an immediate date, there would be a delay on the starting up of the
plant with the consequent detriment for both countries, Spain and Egypt,
and will entail a loss of income from the GNL sale. [...] [O]n the practice
of your responsibilities as Minister of Defence of the Government of the
Arab Republic of Egypt, I kindly ask for your intervention, [i]n the
knowledge that in your hands is the solution to this issue, that although
small for your responsibilities, is of great significance for the well being of
the project that we consider of great interest and importance for both
countries. °*

EATCO’s 40% shareholding of SEGAS, the Minutes of the Board meeting indicate
EATCO’s default on a requested payment for up to 25% of the issued capital:

EATCO, however, have only offset credits to SEGAS [...] in the amount of
651,033 US $, and has made a direct disbursement of 548,967 US$ which
represent a total amount of 1,200,000 US$. EATCO, therefore, still
remains liable to the Company in the amount of 3,120,000 USS. [...]
Accordingly, EATCO is required by the Board to fund the amount of
3,120,000 US Dollars immediately. pe

Item No. 3 of the Minutes further indicates that “EATCO is in default [of] its relevant
obligations in the amount of 30,000,000 US dollars,” based on a decision of SEGAS’
Board of Directors of 16 October 2001, resolving that the entirety of SEGAS’ issued
share capital had to be paid before 31 January 2002.°°

According to the Claimant, EATCO was required to pay this US$ 30 million out of its

own resources, even if it had used Po to finance its

participation in SEGAS.*”

The Tribunal notes that EATCO’s default in the sum of US$ 30 million was a small
fraction of the total cost of the Damietta Plant. Its own cash contribution to SEGAS’
capital at this date was limited to US$ 548.967, less than 0.00043% of the total cost
incurred by SEGAS.

quickly or risk creating a supply/demand gap. It concludes:

A gas supply -demand gap emerges in the short-term (in 2009/2010) and
therefore it is very important that progress is made on signing upstream
GSAs and sanctioning new development projects this year. There is

enough discovered gas to be developed until 2017/2018, after which point
yet-to-find (undiscovered) reserves will need to be produced. [...]

 

In order to ensure supply to the LNG plant to the end of the loan tenor in
2022, some 26 tcf reserves need to be discovered and developed by
2016/2017, assuming that no further LNG exports are sanctioned. This is
equivalent to an average annual discovery rate of 2.6 tcf/year over the
next 10 years, which is lower than the average discovery rate of 4 tcf/year
seen over the last 5 years. [...]

Wood Mackenzie has not performed any geological studies to establish if
this level of reserves can reasonably be found in the timeframes required
for the SEGAS Project but if exploration drilling and success rates are
maintained at previous levels and new fields are developed in a timely
manner then Wood Mackenzie believes that this target can be met.'* [...]
Wood Mackenzie has reviewed EGAS’ data and in light of its experience in
analysing Egypt's energy market and forecasting gas demand worldwide,
we believe EGAS’ gas forecast to be reasonable.'*!

5.158 29 May 2007: UFG requests EGAS to meet its gas supply commitments:

I would like to analyse again with you the situation concerning the feed
gas supply to Damietta, that we have been experiencing during the first
part of the current year 2007 and that will become even worse during the
rest of the year 2007, according to the fax received from EGAS informing
SEGAS about the forecasted gas supplies for the next months (June to
August) [...]

Understanding the continuous efforts of EGAS to improve the feed gas to
Damietta, once again, I kindly ask you a further effort in order to increase
the feed gas supply to Damietta, thus, allowing Union Fenosa Gas to meet
its commitments with the customers, recovering at the same time the
production lost and fulfilling the Annual Delivery Program of 78 ships
established for year 2007.'>"

5.159 27 July 2007: SEGAS refinances its debt to replace the original corporate funding and

Together, these agreements allow SEGAS to refinance its debt funding for the
Damietta Plant. In brief, HSBC provide loans to cover the funds that had been used
for the Damietta Plant’s construction, using the Damietta Plant as security; and UFG
pledges its shares in SEGAS, as the owner of the Damietta Plant, to HSBC Egypt as
collateral against a possible default in repayment of the loan by SEGAS.

July 2007: Egypt promotes natural gas investments in its territory, including the
Damietta Plant, to other international investors. A letter from the Ministry of

Petroleum to UFG, requesting that UFG co-operate in this promotion effort, states:

[Kindly be informed that Quality Communications Productions (OCP) is
currently preparing a report for the Economist magazine entitled ‘The
Gateway to Opportunity’. The objective of this report is to inform on the
latest developments and opportunities in the Oil & Gas sector,
communicating our position to the world, marketing our competitive
advantages to the international community, while at the same time
reinforcing the idea of Egypt as an ideal investments venue.

This report will feature, through professional and top quality in terms of
both content and design, not only the government and state holding
companies, but also the private sector companies, both Egyptian and
multinational, who are behind the success of Egypt’s Oil, Gas &

ordered subsequent gas price improvements after 2000. EGAS and EGPC also
acknowledge that the value of the Damietta Project is US$ 2.3 billion.

In mid-2000, before signing the contract with Union Fenosa and through
the final negotiations carried out with His Excellency the Engineer
Egyptian Petroleum Minister, the price equation was first adjusted as the
maximum increased to 1.25 USD in case the price of Brent crude is more
than 24 USD/barrel [...]

In light of the instructions of the Eng/the Minister of Petroleum to improve
the terms of the Contract with Unién Fenosa, it was agreed with the
Company in June 2003 on the exploitation of the surplus capacity of the
liquefaction factory in order for the Petroleum Sector to benefit from a
percentage up to 50% from the total capacity of the factory which
decreases gradually to reach 42% during the initial five years of operation

[J

In light of this agreement, which allows the Petroleum Sector to liquefy the
gas owned by the State and sell same according to international prices
maximizing the revenues for Egypt, the average price of exporting the
Egyptian share of the liquefied gas from the liquefaction factory in
Damietta during 2005/2006 has reached around 5.7 USD/MMBTU. [...]
Moreover, such investments exist in Egyptian territories, and the
replacement value is estimated by approximately 2.3 billion dollars in
addition to what the establishment of the plant in the free zone area in
Damietta represents of economic and social development and employing
of Egyptian labour and operating ancillary and assisting activities to the
project in the governorate, all of which represent direct and indirect
economic returns to the Egyptian economy. This matter is submitted for
your consideration and guidance [...]'*

5.163 10 December 2007: Egypt’s Minister of Trade and Industry states that demand for

natural gas is growing rapidly, as reported by the Financial Times:

Rachid Mohamed Rachid, minister of trade and industry, says he and his
colleagues are not projecting a gas shortage and the government has
moved to curb energy demand by raising prices for industrial purchasers
or off-takers. But he concedes demand is growing very fast.

‘We are not expecting gas shortages in the short term. We have laid out
the energy policy and the pricing strategy for the next 15 years. The
reality is that we are growing much faster than we expected. The increase
in energy consumption is growing at double-digits,’ Mr Rachid said.'°°

involvement in SPA negotiations in 2000; the Minister’s instructions to renegotiate
SPA gas prices after 2000; the Minister’s prompting of the negotiation of the EGAS
Tolling Contract (whereby EGAS was allocated a proportion of the LNG produced at
the Plant); and the participation of the Ministry of Petroleum and EGAS in the official

visit to Spain to renegotiate gas prices in 2006:

In mid-2000, before signing the contract with Unién Fenosa Gas and
through the final negotiations carried out with His Excellency Engineer
the Egyptian Petroleum Minister, the price quotation was first adjusted as
the maximum increased to 1.25 USD in case the price of Brent crude is
more than 24 USD/barrel {...]

In addition to the above mentioned and in the framework of the
instructions of the Minister of Petroleum to improve the terms and
conditions of the contract signed with Unién Fenosa Company, a contract
was signed with the company to increase the capacity of the liquefaction
plant with annual energy estimated by 7 BCM/annum. Petroleum sector
benefits of that by a proportion up to 50% although the contribution of the
sector whose investment was estimated by 1.3 billion USD in the project
has been limited to only 20% {...]

In the framework of the efforts which you have exerted in this regard and
based on your instructions to complete negotiations with Unién Fenosa

5.172 26 August 2008: UFG asks EGAS to meet its gas supply commitments:

UFGas is specially affected by this situation [falling feedgas supply] in
such a manner that UFGas’ gas reserves have been reduced dramatically
and cannot face its customers’ firm contractual commitments, and more
than that is not able to satisfy the Spanish Regulator provisions. This will
negatively impact on the image of UFGas in the Spanish gas market as
well as on the image of Egypt as a gas supplier country to the
Spanish market.

We would also like to remind you of the recent agreement reached between
UFGas and EGAS in July 2008 by means of which EGAS is bound to
supply at least 15 LNG cargoes in the 2nd half of year 2008.'**

gas prices, as well as the Minister’s continued support for the Damietta Project. This

is referred to in a later letter from Union Fenosa to the Minister:

First of all I would like to thank you very much for the valuable time you
gave to me and to my colleagues on October 16th in your office. Iam so
pleased with the very open and candid discussion we had and your
consistent support of our joint successful SEGAS LNG project. In the past,
with your great vision, we managed to build together the first LNG project

A Cairo court on Tuesday overruled the Egyptian government's decision to allow
exports of natural gas to Israel and said the constitution gave parliament the right to

decide on sales of natural resources."7!

In late 2008, the Global Financial Crisis began. Its effects were felt for a number of
years thereafter. The Global Financial Crisis caused economic slowdowns in Egypt in
2009, affecting especially its balance of payments, specifically exports, remittances,
tourism and capital inflows. Foreign direct investment and domestic investment both

dropped in 2008 to 2010.'7? The Respondent’s witness Mr El Mahdy, formerly the

Chairman of EGAS, explained:

The global financial crisis that began in 2008 made investors unwilling to
start new natural gas exploration projects. In light of global economic
uncertainty and the high cost of development, many investors postponed
exploration and development activities, particularly offshore, which
accounts for about 80% of Egypt's gas production."

5.179 13 January 2010: UFG continues to discuss a potential recovery plan with EGAS.

UFG writes in a letter to EGAS:

I think that it would be convenient [...] to define as well an annual
recovery program for the under-supplied quantities relevant to the period
from 2006 to 2009.'7°

5.180 26 January 2010: SEGAS informs EGAS of operational instability caused by a

shortfall of gas supply:

We feel it is necessary to draw your immediate attention to the operational
requirements and associated risks that the shortfall of gas supply is
generating in SEGAS LNG Plant. Recent circumstances of availability of
gas to SEGAS have reached to a point where Owner must notify the
impossibility to maintain the stable operation of the Plant if this situation
is repeated and comes to stay for a continuous period.‘

5.181 29 January 2010: UFG requests an urgent meeting with EGAS to discuss the

imminent risk of the shutdown of the Damietta Plant.

The situation of the gas supply to Damietta LNG plant is dramatically
worsening day by day, facing the risk of a shutdown of the plant due to a
gas supply below the minimum flow threshold. This fact will cause, inter
alia, a very negative impact at international level on the reputation in
terms of reliability of all the Parties involved in the Project. Therefore I
suggest arranging a meeting in Cairo at your earliest convenience to
agree an action plan in order to overcome the present problems.'"*

in the upstream development plans associated with the international
economic crisis, EGAS has thoroughly discussed this serious issue with the

5.183 16 February 2010: UFG asks EGAS to meet its gas supply commitments. It delivers a
presentation to EGAS regarding reduced gas supply to the Damietta Plant. The letter

to which the presentation is attached concludes:

As shown in our presentation [...] the feed gas shortfall has been
increasing during the last months, with a mere 50 % compliance of the
ADP in January 2010, and is having a huge impact on UFGas’
cost structure.

The attached presentation notes:

Reputable international sources suggest a relevant increase in
Egyptian gas exports, whilst the supply to Damietta LNG Plant has been
dramatically reduced.'*°

5.184 27 February 2010: Egypt’s Conseil d’Etat rules that the Government's decision to
export gas to Israel was a sovereign decision, not subject to review by Egypt’s

A Cairo court on Saturday gave the Egyptian government legal clearance
to allow natural gas exports to Israel, cancelling a lower court’s verdict to
stop exports.

The Higher Administrative Court, an appeals court for cases involving the
state, also ruled Egypt should monitor the price and quantity of its exports
and ensure it met local energy needs before exporting.

[...] ‘It is not within the jurisdiction of the courts to hear appeals against
the government's decision to export gas to eastern Mediterranean
markets, including Israel,’ said Mohamed Husseini, who chaired the
court’s meeting.

5.190 06 August 2010: UFG writes to EGAS, attributing the issues caused by feedgas

suspension to EGAS:

We hereby want to record that the sudden suspension of the supply
constitutes an unacceptable breach of your obligations to supply natural
gas to the LNG plant in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
gas supply agreement dated I* August 2000. [...] We consider all this
directly attributable to EGAS and we reserve our rights with respect to the
subject matter under the Contract or elsewhere to protect our interests and
recover any damages suffered. '**

5.191 3 December 2010: UFG sends a letter to EGAS summarising a recent telephone

conference-call concerning gas supply shortfalls.

As for the committed volumes during the transient period of shortfalls, the
positions are aligned with the exception of the first quarter of year 2011.
We have made the effort to adjust the quantities as per Egas' indications
and we appreciate Egas' position to commit to such minimum volumes as
they are of extreme importance to guarantee a minimum throughput in
Damietta LNG Plant and a minimum level supply to markets. '*°

5.192 25-28 January 2011: The Egyptian revolution begins with protests in Cairo, leading to
the resignation of President Mubarak and an extended period of protests and changes
to the composition of the Egyptian Government. The resulting political turmoil,
social unrest and deteriorating security situation creates uncertainty over Egypt’s
economic prospects for both domestic and foreign investors. Along with the
continuing Global Financial Crisis and the subsequent Eurozone crisis, this leads to a
sharp fall in foreign direct and financial investments in 2011 and 2012,!°° especially

investment remains poor.!*? As of these dates, the Government of Egypt expects the

country to emerge from its economic crisis only in the coming two to three years.!>

Mr De Lara Alonso-Buron testified that:

Street protests in Egypt intensified on 25 January 2011. I remember
hearing that there were calls for people to join the demonstrations in the
press that week. The press was saying that big demonstrations would take
place on 28 January 2011, after Friday noon prayers.'**

The Respondent’s expert witness, Dr Khan testified:

At the same time, Egypt was also suffering from an unfolding energy crisis
that manifested itself in country-wide electricity shortages and daily power
cuts. In addition to the inconvenience and hardships this caused
households, energy shortages also had a negative impact on industry,
which in many cases, such as heavy industries like cement production,
were operating at 50-60 per cent capacity. This energy crisis had a strong
negative impact on the economy, with significant reductions in industrial
production and employment.'%>

Mr El Mahdy testified to similar effect:

The Global Financial Crisis and the 2011 revolution caused instability
and security concerns that made investors reluctant to invest.'°°

In consequence, investment fell for both exploration for new fields, and
development of existing fields with existing infrastructure in order to
maintain or increase capacity. The latter, in particular, caused a rapid
decline in the levels of gas production."
This national shortage of gas production, as compared to supply, began in 2002-2003,
with a net shortage across all natural gas consumers of 0.1 bema. This steadily
increases to a shortage of 7.0 bema in 2009-2010. In 2010-2011 the shortage increases

further to 10.9 bema, and thereafter increases sharply to 20.5 bema in 2012-2013.!8

 

In response to the gas shortages and the risk of blackouts across the country, EGAS

prioritised distribution of gas to the domestic market in order to maintain power

minimised, or stopped completely.°°

A later report of the Managing Director of UFG to the Board of Directors, of 20
March 2013, outlined the economic effects of the 2011 revolution in Egypt. The
report referred to permanent riots in Cairo, Port Said, Alexandria and Suez, and a

1,201

“permanent state of insurrection and civil commotion” since 201 The recurrent

political instability was the main factor behind deterioration in investments, a rise in
the unemployment rate, and a decline in industrial production.2°? According to the
report, “[floreign direct investment came to a virtual standstill following the
revolution”, and would not likely return “[uJntil security and stability return to the
country and greater clarity is achieved in the political transition.”?° In the claim
before the Commercial Court of Madrid brought against UFG and some of its
directors, by some of its other directors, the claimant directors referred to a proposal
by UFG’s Head Office on 20 March 2013 to issue force majeure notices to its
customers as a result of the Egyptian revolution, and the slowdown of foreign direct
investment and consequent deterioration in gas extraction and production capacity

that resulted.?

5.202 23 February 2011: UFG and EGAS initial Heads of Agreement as a temporary two-
year agreement (the “HOA”).”°* Under Article 2 of this draft Agreement, UFG agrees
to accept lower levels of gas than the minimum quantities specified in the SPA. By
Article 3, EGAS acknowledges that there were quantities of gas that UFG was entitled
to receive under the SPA and which had not been delivered, but which would be

delivered in future.

5.204 It was nine months later that the HOA was signed by the parties. According to Mr

Soliman, a former Undersecretary of the Ministry of Petroleum, which was forwarded
by Mr Soliman to Mr Séez Ramirez of UFG.7?® Mr Ismail’s email attached an

Sherif Ismail was the Chairman of Ganoub El Wadi (“Ganope”), a State-owned oil
and gas company. Later, he became the Minister of Petroleum and, later still, the

Prime Minister of Egypt.

From 2012, the gas supply to the Damietta Plant deteriorates with EGAS restricting
and suspending gas supply. According to UFG, this situation resulted from the
Respondent’s decision to block deliveries of contractually agreed gas supply to the
Damietta Plant whilst diverting gas supplies to other purchasers, most notably to the
domestic electricity generation sector. As a result of these actions, so UFG contends,
UFG was able to lift only two full cargoes of LNG from the Plant after July 2012,
instead of the 39 cargoes originally planned and agreed for this period.””? Since
December 2012, no LNG has been lifted from the Damietta Plant, which has remained
idle.

considerations [...]

Consequently, please kindly consider the present letter as an official
UFG’s rejection of the FM notification mentioned above and eventual
suspension of EGAS’ obligations under the SPA.**!

5.222 6 February 2012: SEGAS also rejects the force majeure notice sent by EGAS under
the EGAS Tolling Contract.

We understand that the Burullus facility has resumed its operations [...] As
we have not timely received full particulars of the event as detailed here
above and until we receive and analyze them, we are not in a position to

Article 17 of the Tolling Contract to reject such notification.”

(EGAS does not follow up on its force majeure notices).

5.223 22 February 2012: EGAS and UFG representatives meet in Cairo concerning issues
over EGAS’ feedgas supply. UFG requests proportional curtailments of other
industries to ensure compliance with the HOA’s Minimum Feedgas Commitment; and
UFG reiterates its cooperation with EGAS and the Egyptian authorities, including

price renegotiations for gas sales:

[W]e are seriously concerned by your description of the current situation,
which led to EGAS' default on the feedgas supplies to the Damietta LNG
Plant and would cause the feedgas supply to Damietta LNG Plant {...] to
be significantly below the Minimum Feedgas Commitment agreed in the
Heads of Agreement [...] [T]his will have direct consequences over us,
such as damages, costs and/or additional expenses {...]

[O]ur view is that EGAS must and can act promptly to supply Damietta
LNG Plant at the minimum committed level under the HoA (560 mmscfd,
on average). The current shortfall stands at around 175 mmscfd, and we
see different alternatives that EGAS can implement to comply with its
Minimum Feedgas Commitment during 2012. These include a limited
prorata reduction of Industry and Other consumers, a limited increase of
mazout as primary energy for electricity generation and certain industrial
consumers or a combination of both. Such measures are directly under
your control and will have as a consequence the avoidance of the Default
in the supply to Damietta LNG Plant under the HoA (not to mention those
under the SPA).

As the Country faces difficult supply/demand scenarios through the
Transient Period 2011-2013, UFG has shown its strong commitment with
EGAS, in particular, but also with Egyptian Authorities in general, by
recently agreeing a natural gas price increase and a reduction (even
temporarily and to be recovered in the future) of the volumes down from
the contractual volume to a minimum committed quantity. Now we
strongly request that EGAS takes the necessary steps to guarantee the
supply of natural gas to the Damietta LNG Plant within the agreed level.

We trust EGAS will support the compliance of our agreement in place, and
we are sure that this will strengthen the continued development of our
partnership, but also it will strengthen EGAS and the Egyptian Petroleum
Sector as a whole, since the opposite (i.e., the continued default under the
agreement) will not help UFG to continue supporting EGAS and will
surely have as a consequence, apart from the economic losses, deficit in
the sector, delay in projects, lack of new investments and finally additional
shortfalls affecting both exporters and domestic consumers.”

5.224 13 March 2012: Mr Paolo Conti, SEGAS’ Managing Director of Administration and
Control, informs the SEGAS Board of Directors (including representatives of EGAS)
that:

Among the highlights for year 2011 Mr Conti refers to the production of
the plant not being adversely affected by the revolution that has taken
place in the country during this year adding nevertheless that the final
production was significantly under the budget expectations.?**

5.225 15 March 2012: UFG rejects EGAS’ stated reasons for the reduced supply; and UFG
alleges that EGAS discriminates against UFG:

Reference is made to yesterday’s communication received by SEGAS in
which a supply to Damietta LNG Plant of only 150 mmscfd was announced
due to gas production reduction in certain limited gas fields. As a direct
consequence of such nomination, well below the minimum turn down ratio
of the Damietta LNG Plant, SEGAS has been forced to stop production for
the third time in year 2012.

Contractually, supply of NG to Damietta LNG Plant is not supported by
any particular field and EGAS is ‘the exclusive responsible for the
transportation, supply and delivery of NG’ [...] keeping at all times a
‘back-up supply to meet an on stream (load) factor of 95%’ in the Plant,
regardless of the origin of the gas.

Consequently any eventual reduction of gas availabilities in a field cannot
be used by EGAS as a contractual reason to reduce the feed gas to

Damietta LNG Plant, as still remains a sufficient amount of gas in the grid
to fill the plant according to EGAS contractual obligations.

As per the contracts in force, Damietta LNG Plant has to be treated in a
non-discriminatory manner in comparison with other NG customers which
means that an eventual reduction of NG in the grid has to be shared on a
pro-rata basis between all customers. We consider that EGAS has
discriminated UFG by curtailing feedgas Damietta LNG Plant to a higher
exten[t] than other NG customers and we hold EGAS responsible of the
consequences of such breach.?*°

5.226 8 May 2012: UFG sends a letter to EGAS requesting that EGAS meet its gas

supply commitments:

[S]ince the beginning of commercial operation of the Damietta LNG Plant
in year 2006 the supply of natural gas from EGAS to UFG under the Sale
and Purchase Agreement between our Companies (the "SPA”) has been at
substantially all times below UFG’ contractual rights (and corresponding
EGAS' delivery commitments) under the SPA and, more recently, under the
HoA.?*°

5.227 12 May 2012: The Egyptian Natural Gas Co. (“GASCO”) notifies SEGAS of

increased gas availability:

Please be informed that you can increase the gas quantity for SEGAS

5.229 16 May 2012: GASCO requests SEGAS to prepare for a safe shut down of the
Damietta Plant:

Ref to your fax received now concerning non-response to your request to
decrease SEGAS plant consumption rate to 200 MMSCD, and as a result
of severe falling in gas pressures all over the National Gas Grid reaching
to a critical situation; A case that requires an immediate action to
maintain National Gas Grid Balance, as well as, to ensure safely
operation for Power Stations. The matter that forcing our company [sic]

5.230 22-29 May 2012: UFG expresses concern over the frequency of shutdowns ordered by
GASCO; and it accuses EGAS of wilfully discriminatory treatment of SEGAS:

Further to your request, and before Suspending feedgas to SEGAS, please
note as follows.

EGAS/GASCO have requested already 5 times to stop production to
SEGAS throughout May 2012. Other consumers have not been curtailed in
similar quantities, therefore EGAS is wilfully discriminating [against]
SEGAS [...

EGAS informs SEGAS that is not the only consumer affected by the situation.*4!

5.234 11 June 2012: UFG sends a letter to EGAS expressing concern over feedgas

suspension to the Damietta Plant:

We write you today to show our deep concern raised by the sequence of
events that affected SEGAS and UFG on June 6th, 2012 which leaded to
the unilateral total suspension of the feedgas flow to the LNG Plant for the
10th time since the beginning of May 2012 [...]

EGAS, through the intervention of GASCO, has forced several times to
reduce and/or suspend the feedgas to SEGAS, especially since the
commencement of May 2012. We strongly oppose each and every one of
such unilateral suspensions of your obligation to deliver without any
contractual grounds; however, we regard with special concern the events
occurred on June 6th.

In this occasion, the facts as they are known to us have been: (i) we have
received EGAS assurance that the plant would be operated on continuous
basis above its Minimum Turndown Ratio; (ii) as of the time of the
GASCO communications, the grid was stable and pressure was building
up; (iii) no hiccups to production happened in such time frame; (iv)
SEGAS requested clarification as to the rationale to such instruction and
as a response it received a [threat] to shut down the inlet gas valve, i.e., a
menace to blackout the plant; (v) GASCO proceeded to shutdown the valve
forcing SEGAS' stoppage.***

Your Excellency,

This letter is aimed to share with you our concern raised as a consequence
of the deterioration of the feed gas supply to the Damietta LNG Plant
throughout the recent months and particularly our deep concern due to the
unilateral complete suspension by Egypt of the Natural Gas supply to the
Damietta LNG Plant and to Union Fenosa Gas since 17 June 2012,
without further notice. [...] I would like to request your support to assure
the immediate restoration of the feedgas supply to SEGAS and Union
Fenosa Gas and its operation on continuous basis. Subject to this, Union
Fenosa Gas will continue to cooperate with Egypt as we have always
done.**

5.238 15 July 2012: GASCO orders SEGAS to operate the Damietta Plant in recycle mode,

citing priority in supply for the electricity sector.

Due to the high consumption rates of electricity sector and high degrees of
temperatures, as well as, the continuous decreasing in gas pressures over
the whole Grid, and in the light of what was agreed upon with EGAS,
please be informed to reaching [sic] SEGAS plant operation on Recycle
Mode by today at 12:00 pm (noon) until 12:00 am (midnight).

5.239 15 July 2012: SEGAS expresses concerns to GASCO over EGAS/GASCO’s actions.

Reference is made to GASCO fax ‘SEGAS Plant Operation on Recycle
Mode’, sent to SEGAS on 15th July 2012 at 10:00 hours, and to which
EGAS has received copy.

In such respect, we wish to state clearly that:

|. There is no other existing agreement with EGAS other than complying
with nominated quantities provided that they are within the safe operating
range of the LNG Plant. This agreement does not contemplate that
SEGAS LNG Plant shall balance the gas grid in the conditions stated in
GASCO fax.

2. Therefore, the decision to force SEGAS to adapt its operation to balance
the gas grid for safeguarding other consumers is made unilaterally by
EGAS/GASCO and in no manner it is framed within any agreement
between EGAS and SEGAS.

We find it is not appropriate to introduce these misleading statements in
the operating communications received from GASCO.”

19 July 2012: The Ministry of Petroleum announces reduction of gas exports in favour

of the domestic market. The news media reports:

Egypt will decrease the amount of natural gas it exports in order to meet
urgent domestic needs, a move that may result in a massive loss of
revenues, said a Petroleum Ministry senior official on Thursday.**!

25 July 2012: UFG expresses continued concern to EGAS over EGAS’ gas supply.

We write to you to express our deep concern about feed gas supply to the
Damietta LNG Plant. As you are aware of, since the beginning of
commercial operation of the Damietta LNG Plant in year 2006 the supply
of natural gas from EGAS to UFG under the SPA has been substantially at
all times below UFG’s contractual rights (and corresponding EGAS'
delivery commitments) under the SPA and, since its date of signature,
under the HoA. The situation has significantly deteriorated from
2011 onwards [...)°**

04 August 2012: President Morsi apologizes to the public for the widespread
electricity blackouts across Egypt.** EGAS suspends all gas deliveries to UFG. This
is described by Mr Egea Krauel (of UFG) in his written testimony:
In May and June 2012, a series of unexpected gas stoppages (situations
where EGAS abruptly stops delivering natural gas) affected production at

the Damietta LNG Plant and, by July, it had become clear that we would

5.246 26 August 2012: UFG requests an urgent meeting with the Minister of Petroleum to

discuss the gas supply to the Damietta Plant:

On behalf of Union Fenosa Gas, we would like to congratulate you
sincerely for your appointment as Minister of Petroleum [...] We look
forward to the prospect of continuing the work with the Petroleum Sector
and especially with our counterpart Egyptian Natural Gas Holding
Company, strengthening our close cooperation with them.

As you probably know, Union Fenosa Gas is one of the main investors in
the Gas Sector in Egypt, being Damietta LNG Plant the first export project
developed in Egypt providing the opportunity to Egyptian Partners to
access international markets and constituting the foundation of a fruitful
partnership between Egypt and Spain.

However, this strategic joint project is suffering from the lack of supply of
continuous feedgas to the Damietta LNG Plant at operational levels,
which de facto has been suspended throughout the summer.

In line with the continued cooperation between the Egyptian Authorities
and Union Fenosa Gas, we would like to kindly ask you for an urgent
meeting at your earliest convenience [...]?>*

The content of discussions at the meeting is described in Mr Egea Krauel’s written

testimony:

During that September meeting, Minister Kamal stated that he was
conscious of UFG’s problem and that he was in the process of reviewing
the situation of every exporter (including UFG) and major domestic
customer. He stated that he was analyzing the contractual frameworks
and the legal conditions for stopping gas deliveries to one consumer in
order to improve supply to other gas users. He expected to get the results
of this study within a month. The Minister never got back to us with the
results of this analysis. We realized that UFG had been singled out as the
offtaker of gas from the grid whose supply would be indefinitely
interrupted. UFG had been one of the largest consumers of natural gas in
Egypt and was no longer receiving any gas.?°!

Mr Saez Ramirez’s testimony describes this meeting:

In August 2012, Osama Kamal was appointed Minister of Petroleum.

5.250 17 October 2012: UFG writes to the Minister of Petroleum objecting to press reports

As we had the opportunity to discuss in such meetings, UFG is deeply
worried because of the current situation of the feed gas supply to Damietta
LNG Plant since, despite of our constant spirit of cooperation, the actual
level of supply in the past few months has been considerably lower than
EGAS commitments in previous meetings and tremendously below the
contractual volumes under the SPA and the agreed Minimum Feed Gas
Commitment for the period. Far from improving, the situation has further
deteriorated to the point that no supply of gas has been delivered to the
Damietta LNG Plant since 16 July 2012, as explained in more detail below.
Furthermore, this shortage of supply represents a clear discriminatory
measure against UFG by EGAS and the Egyptian authorities, as evidenced
by the fact that the supply of gas has not been interrupted to other
consumers (such as, for example, the liquefaction plant in Idku).?%*

In view of all the above and under the firm conviction that Your Excellency
shall support an urgent action to resume Damietta LNG feed gas, we
would like to request an urgent meeting with Your Excellency at the
earliest convenience to address this matter.°%

5.251 17 October 2012: UFG again requests an urgent meeting with the Prime Minister of
Egypt to discuss gas supply to the Damietta Plant.

We are aware about the challenging current situation for the Petroleum
and Electricity sector, but Damietta LNG Plant is one of the main
consumers suffering curtailments, in opposition to other LNG export
projects in Egypt which remain in continuous operation. This is despite of
our continuous spirit of cooperation with the authorities of the Ministry of
Petroleum, materialized in an agreement executed in November 2011,
accepting a transient reduction of supply plus a significant increase in
prices versus a commitment by Egas to receive a minimum feed gas
volume on stable basis.°°”

5.254 6 November 2012: UFG writes to EGAS, requesting a resumption of the feedgas
supply to the Damietta Plant and reiterating its position that the Damietta Plant was

being discriminated against:

We do appreciate the spirit of cooperation, and especially EGAS endeavor
to maintain the supply to Damietta LNG Plant once the production was
resumed on the 22nd of October. Unfortunately, SEGAS has received a
request to stop production and operate the Plant in recycle mode, which
cannot be sustained for long periods. Consequently, we shall appreciate
Egas action to resume feedgas supply to Damietta LNG Plant soonest.

Finally, we respectfully dispute your view that SEGAS/UFG is not being
discriminated in comparison with other consumers, based on the
longstanding reduction/suspension of our contractual supplies. We will
have the opportunity to further explain our position to you in our
forthcoming meeting?”

It is needed to remind that this policy to favor ones in detriment of others
is not only unfair but against the contractual framework and other
international laws.

For the benefit of all parties we request for your active action to revert the
current situation by clearly instructing EGAS to resume Damietta feed gas,
attend SEGAS request in terms of cash needs and to order a pro-rata
sharing of gas availabilities, all of it according to EGAS' contractual
commitments. [...]

5.258 18 November 2012: UFG expresses concerns to EGAS over EGAS’ failure to supply
gas at the Damietta Plant’s minimum turn-down ratio, and its refusal to commit to

doing so:

I acknowledge receipt of your letter, however I must stress that the
operational conditions imposed to the feedgas that I read in your letter are
not compatible with stable continuous operation of the LNG plant [...]

We received assurance from Egas that commencing mid November the
plant will be fed with 350 mmscfd on continuous basis. We will
co[m]mence the cooldown tomorrow, but we need to ramp up feedgas
above to stable continuous operational threshold asap, and I request your
support and understanding to achieve this.

5.262 8 December 2012: EGAS stops providing gas to the Damietta Plant. The Damietta
Plant suspends LNG production due to EGAS’ failure to deliver gas. Mr Saez
Ramirez (of UFG) testified that:

We visited [Osama Kamal, Minister of Petroleum] again on November 27,
2012, after meeting with the Ministry of Investment on November 14. At
that time, the Plant had been running again for a few weeks, even if at very
low capacity and in a very unstable mode. Unfortunately, supply stopped
again completely a few days later, and by late November 2012 production
at the Plant had to be suspended again. We were able to deliver only two
LNG cargoes in November and December 2012, but soon thereafter EGAS
requested that the Plant be shut down again. In December 2012 and
January 2013, with the Plant completely stopped, EGAS stopped
responding to UFG’s inquiries and requests for gas.?"*

I write you further to our letter dated 5 of December to underline the
critical situation that our joint company SEGAS is facing as a
consequence of the lack of feedgas supply to Damietta LNG Plant.

As we have extensively discussed in our last meeting, we have the urgent
need to (i) assure a minimum number of cargoes produced by the LNG
Plant during the coming months and (ii) implement a remedy plan to
assure the compliance with financial commitments of the Company and to
be submitted to the Lenders for approval before the end of December 2012,
in order to avoid a Default under SEGAS Financial Agreements.

We also informed Your Excellency about the status of the conversations
with EGAS/EGPC, including the outcome of SEGAS General Assembly
held on 28th November to propose a remedy plan. [...]

As Your Excellency knows, feed gas to Damietta LNG Plant is currently
interrupted by EGAS/EGPC and we have not received any feed back in
reference to the planned resumption of supply. [...]

We have further received strong pressure by the Lenders urging SEGAS to
update them with respect to the progress of the Remedy Plan, and at the
same time we have tried without success to contact EGAS' representatives
to understand the status of the matters under discussion.

In view of the critical situation SEGAS is facing, we gently reiterate the
urgent need in solving this matter [...] and we request your prompt action
and support to achieve these goals.?*°

5.265 12 December 2012: UFG expresses concerns to EGAS over SEGAS’ operations and

discrimination, and about payments to lenders due to suspension of feedgas.

As you know, feed gas to Damietta LNG Plant was suspended by
EGAS/EGPC from July to the end of October and, despite EGAS
commitment to supply 350 mmscfd from mid November of 2012 until April
2013 [...] SEGAS has not been able to resume stable production due to
shortage of gas and we have received several petitions from GASCO and
EGAS to operate in recycle mode and finally to stop production.

I would like to take this opportunity to stress how UFG and SEGAS
operations are being jeopardized by EGAS and EGPC due to shortfall of
gas, the damages that we are suffering due to the suspension of feedgas
supply, the financial risks that SEGAS is undertaking and the urgency to
restore the feedgas supply to allow to continue operations and avoid any
eventual default in front of Lenders and its dramatic consequences for all
parties involved.

Moreover, we understand from different sources that other Egyptian LNG
facilities are currently producing at higher rates than SEGAS in 2012 and
other pipeline export project is currently receiving feedgas [...] Finally, in

order to minimize the damages we are sustaining, we would like to request
your cooperation to restart Damietta LNG plant production, assuring
that EGPC/EGAS available gas is shared equitably between the
different consumers.?®!

5.266 12 December 2012: UFG expresses concerns to EGAS and EPC over the gas supply
situation and demands of EGPC and EGAS that there be a Shareholders’ Meeting for
SEGAS.

[L]et us remind you of the extremely severe situation in which SEGAS is
currently in and the need to agree on a Remedy Plan on an urgent basis.
As you may recall, the submission of the Remedy Plan before 31 December
2012 is one of the obligations assumed by SEGAS before the Lenders
under the waiver negotiated during the last weeks. In addition to this, the
Remedy Plan is also a condition to avoid a default under the finance
contracts and the multiple consequences that such default would carry for
SEGAS, EGAS and UFG as well as for Egypt and its reputation towards
international banks {...]

[P]/ease revert on an urgent basis with a proposed date for holding
SEGAS Shareholders’ Meeting.***

5.267 13 December 2012: GASCO requests that SEGAS stop the use of natural gas at the
Damietta Plant so as to ensure the safety of the Plant and electricity power stations,

until further notification:

Reference to our last fax [...] requesting to stop SEGAS plant completely
from using natural gas owing to Gas Grid low-pressures, please be
informed that till the moment SEGAS plant is still taking natural gas. Thus,
we argue your cooperation and understanding to the situation of non-
taking any gas quantities at all even though as fuel, to ensure safety to
your plant and electricity power stations until further notification of using
natural gas.°*

5.268 December 2012: EGAS stops paying SEGAS accrued Toll-or-Pay fees under the
EGAS Tolling Contract:

As of January 2013, we understand that US$ 22.6 million of the 2011 Toll-
or-Pay amounts remained to be collected as did the entire 2012 amounts.
An additional US$ 9 million was invoiced in 2013, but we understand that

5.270 29 January 2013: UFG issues its notice of an investment dispute under the Treaty to

the Respondent. It provides (inter alia) as follows:

UFG directly and indirectly owns and controls significant investments in
the gas industry in Egypt, relating to the Damietta natural gas liquefaction
plant [...] UFG’s investments in Egypt are suffering significant harm as a
result of the Republic’s decision to cut the supply of natural gas to the
Damietta LNG Plant, which has resulted in substantial reductions in
operations and in the Plant’s shut-down for lack of the necessary gas
supply. UFG is hopeful that this dispute can be promptly resolved through
amicable negotiations, but it reserves all legal rights, including those
under the Treaty.

 

UFG has already made substantial efforts to negotiate in good faith with
the Government, the Ministry of Petroleum, and [...] EGAS and [...] EGPC,
Egypt's State-owned entities, in order to resolve the problem of the gas
supply to the Damietta LNG Plant. UFG’s willingness to solve the dispute
is amply evidenced, for instance, by the numerous agreements reached
with the State-owned entities, addressing, inter alia, repeated natural gas
price increases that EGAS and EGPC requested beyond the originally-
agreed contractual terms [...] UFG has constantly accommodated EGAS
and EGPC’s requests with a view to continuing its now more-than-a-
decade-long relationship with Egypt.?*°

5.271 4 February 2013: EGAS asserts that the Egyptian revolution and the Global Financial

Crisis constitute a situation of force majeure:

As you are well aware, however, several extraneous factors such as the
continuing social and political instability in Egypt as well as the ensuing
economic crisis have led to operational difficulties and an unforeseeable
decrease in the supply of available natural gas. In fact, such is the extent
of these circumstances that they have, for some time, affected our ability to
perform our different gas sales agreements, including the SPA, and fall

We write [...] regarding the continued situation of force majeure which
EGAS has been facing. We note that UFG (i) claims to be ‘surprised’ that
the current situation in Egypt has disrupted EGAS’s ability to perform the
SPA. We further note that UFG alleges that EGAS (ii) has chosen to
divert gas away from UFG as a result of a ‘change in market conditions’,
(iii) discriminated against UFG and (iv) did not provide a valid notice of

the next two months to face electrical load.*”°

5.275 9 April 2013: The Ministry of Petroleum announces a meeting between UFG and

EGAS officials to discuss the non-supply of gas to Damietta Plant. The media reports:

Petroleum ministry sources confirmed that EGAS officials will hold a
meeting with officials at the Spanish Union Fenosa next Wednesday in
order to discuss the current situation after halting natural gas supplies to

5.277 19 April 2013: ENI-appointed UFG board members file a claim against other board

members before the Commercial Court of Madrid:

As a result of the situation of acute civil strife in Egypt since January 2011
due to the sudden emergence of the ‘Arab Spring’ in that country, which
eventually led to the ouster of President Mubarak, the economic crisis has
worsened unrelentingly and this has led to, among other things, a
slowdown of foreign direct investment in Egypt’s energy sector with the
consequent deterioration in gas extraction and production capacity. [...]
The infringement by the defendant Directors of the rules in matters of
conflict of interest is far from an insignificant or purely theoretical issue,
because the harm which this involves for UFG to maintain the current
situation is extremely serious.?°°

5.278 17 May 2013: UFG files a Notice of Arbitration with the Cairo Regional Centre for
International Commercial Arbitration. (This is to become the CRCICA Arbitration

Case 896). The Notice of Arbitration provides a summary of the dispute:

This dispute concerns EGAS’ contractual breach by failing to follow a
price adjustment procedure with respect to gas delivered to UFG under
the SPA. The Parties adopted the price adjustment procedure when they
entered into a Heads of Agreement (the ‘HOA’) dated November 23, 2011,
which amended — for a temporary period — certain of their obligations
under the SPA. The SPA requires EGAS to deliver, and UFG to receive
and pay for, certain volumes of natural gas at the Damietta LNG Plant in
Damietta, Egypt (the ‘Plant’), for processing and conversion into liquefied
natural gas (‘LNG’). The HOA sets forth, inter alia, a revised pricing
formula for natural gas delivered by EGAS to UFG during a certain
period (‘the transient period’), extending from January 1, 2011, until
September 30, 2013 (with the possibility of extension thereafter).**

This dispute concerns EGAS’ breach of the SPA by failing to deliver
natural gas to UFG under that Contract. The SPA requires EGAS to
deliver, and UFG to receive and pay for, certain contractually agreed
volumes of natural gas at the Damietta LNG Plant in Damietta, Egypt (the
‘Plant’), for processing and conversion into liquefied natural gas (‘LNG’),
which UFG subsequently lifts. Under the SPA, EGAS committed to supply
up to the maximum amount of natural gas needed for the nominal capacity
of the Plant.?°°

August 2013: Egypt’s energy policy is characterised by industry commentators
as “political”:
Surging domestic energy consumption has meant the government has been
forced to divert a growing share of its natural gas production to the

domestic market, where low domestic, rather than high international
prices are paid.

divert more gas into the domestic sector is highly problematic from an

5.285 September 2013: UFG meets the Minister of Petroleum regarding the proposed
Transient Agreement (described below). This meeting is referred to in a later letter

dared 8 November 2011 from UFG to the Minister:

We would like to commence by stressing the importance of your
participation in the process [...| As your Excellency noted during our last
meeting in Cairo in September, a new stage in the Project commences, and
we are prepared to work together with our Egyptian Partners under the
steer of Your Excellency to bring additional value to all stakeholders by
maximizing the utilization ratios of the Plant and increasing our gas intake
during the Transient Period and beyond.*®!

5.286 29 October 2013: EGAS and UFG execute the Transient Agreement of 29 October
2013 to restart gas supply to the Damietta Plant in an attempt to resolve their
differences relating to EGAS’ failure to supply gas to the Damietta Plant.*°? Because
the Transient Agreement postpones some of EGAS’ delivery obligations to later dates,
it requires EGAS to deliver only gas sufficient to produce two LNG cargoes during
the last two months of 2013, as well as to make certain payments for outstanding Toll-

or-Pay Fees. It provides (inter alia):

Article 4(II): [T]he Settlement Schedule under section I of this article does,
not affect UFG’s right to receive the quantities of NG to which UFG
would be entitled under the UFG Contracts from the beginning of the SPA
until the end of the Ramp Up Period to the extent that these quantities of
NG shall become Total Lost Quantities pursuant to the HOA, including
Article 3 thereof. °°

5.287 On the same day, EGAS and SEGAS execute the Transient Agreement (the

“Transient Agreement”) to resume Toll-or-Pay Payments under the EGAS Tolling

5.291 11 November 2013: A former head of EGAS confirms that the oil industry was not

impacted by the Egyptian revolution:

Engineer, oil expert and managing director of Citadel Group energy
department Mohammed Shoaib says the only industry unaffected by events
in Egypt following the January 25th revolution may be the oil industry.
This is due to work sites and oil fields being located far from unrest,
meaning that production did not stop at any of Egypt's oil fields
throughout the period of instability, he said.

5.292 12 November 2013: SEGAS writes to EGAS and requests a ramp up of feedgas from

EGAS in order to resume LNG production under the Transient Agreement:

We would like to thank you for the support given to us during the past four
days while we were conducting the re-commissioning of SEGAS Plant. {...]

We thank you in advance for your support and we will keep waiting for
your confirmation at earliest to proceed

5.293 12 November 2013: EGAS refuses SEGAS’ request to ramp up feedgas in order to

resume LNG production under the Transient Agreement.

Pls be informed that the current status of the national gas grid now does
not support your request to load Segas plant tomorrow as per your request,
as we encountered several unforeseen major problems with the gas
production flow rate to the grid in the past few days where you can notice
the effect of that on the drastic reduction in the grid pressure in general
and particularly in front of Segas plant at [Damietta] where the grid
pressure dropped from about 50 bar to about 33 bar.*!°

5.294 12 November 2013: UFG reiterates the supply commitments made by EGAS under the

accordance with the Delivery Schedule and the Transient Agreement.

iii. [...] [A]fter start up operations EGAS is under an undertaking to
supply to UFG sufficient NG to ensure that UFG will lift no less than one
cargo in November 2013. The NG has to be supplied by EGAS at the rate
of no less than 335 mmscfd for a continuous period of at least 12 days in

November 2013.

iv. EGAS’ obligations under the Transient Agreements are not subject to
the conditions, status or functioning of the National Grid and EGAS is
obliged to take all necessary actions to ensure full compliance with such

obligations.*!!

5.295 14 November 2013: UFG requests delivery of feed-gas in accordance with the terms

of the Transient Agreement:

SEGAS is ready (and request to) start ramp up {...] as [...] agreed in the

Delivery Schedule for the year 2013 [...]

EGAS has the obligation to provide sufficient NG to cover this ramp up

from today, November 14th, 2013.

As you should know Damietta LNG Plant is in an unstable situation and
ramp-up process has to continue as agreed in the Delivery Schedule [...]

without delay or interruption.

EGAS [’] obligations under UFG Transient Agreements are not subject to
the conditions, status or functioning of the National Grid and EGAS is
obliged to take all necessary actions to ensure full compliance with such
obligations being, in terms of LNG Cargoes, only 2 loadings in 2013 and 6

in 2014.

In line with all [of the] above we strongly request EGAS to provide NG for
such ramp-up operation [...] Finally let me stress that EGAS{’]
unfulfillment of its obligations under [the] UFG Transient Agreement [...]

constitutes a breach of [the] UFG Transient Agreement”!

5.296 14 November 2013: EGAS requests a reduction of feedgas consumption by the

Damietta Plant:

Ref. to our telecom this morning pertaining [to] the current gas grid
condition, and as we were suffering this week from several major
production facilities shut down ending with [Burullus] s/d this morning
whereby the grid pressure now is in the lowest operable condition which
does not support at all the plant loading as per the agreed schedule.

In this [sic] circumstances please refrain from loading up the plant as
that will cause the full collapse of the national gas grid pressure.

[Y]ou will be notified as soon [as] the grid condition get [sic] improved to
retry the plan operation sequence again.*!3

15 November 2013: EGAS announces the shutdown of the Damietta Plant, by an

email message to Mr Saez Ramirez of UFG:

As per my telephone call with Jose now, we are going to shut down the
Damietta LNG plant at 1 pm. We are recommending to meet early
next week to re-evaluate the situation and decide when we are going
to restart.”>\4

15 November 2013: UFG proposes a revised delivery schedule for feedgas supply

under the Transient Agreement:

We write you further to the UFG Transient Agreement [...] your phone call
and your request to re-schedule the November 2013 Program for Damietta
LNG Plant. We would like to record our idea for the path forward and the
production of the November LNG Cargo under the Agreement. [...]

Please confirm by return email your acceptance and if so, please send us
back a copy of the attachment executed. For the avoidance of doubt,
unless we both sign a new amended delivery schedule comprising
November cargo, we consider the current agreed Delivery Schedule
as enforceable.*'*

5.299 15 November 2013: EGAS requires the shutdown of the Damietta Plant:

Please be informed that we accept to shut down today at 19:30. The plan
for restart will be discussed with you as explained in my call with you this
morning in a similar conference call on Sunday. By that time we will have
better view of the grid situation.*'®

5.300 15 November 2013: UFG rejects EGAS’ request and seeks information on the start-up

and rescheduling of EGAS’ supply commitments:

UFG does not agree to suspend the start up operations of the LNG Plant
today without knowing precisely when such start up operations will
recommence. The UFG Transient Agreement requires that EGAS supplies
the NG necessary to assure that UFG has a full LNG cargo available in

EGAS shall avail the necessary gas to support this commitment.

We have worked out a [...] possible path forward to address your
operational request within the contractual framework of the Transient
Agreement, but the precise terms of the Delivery Schedule for the
November Cargo have to be established today if the start up sequence is
going to be interrupted?"

5.301 15 November 2013: EGAS informs SEGAS that the gas grid pressure is critical and
that partial blackouts occurred as a result of SEGAS’ non-compliance with EGAS

request to reduce consumption:

The pressure now [in] the gas grid is very critical and it gets more worst
every hour especially during night time where the electricity peak start,

Yesterday we were trying to recover the grid pressure but we failed mainly
as a result of Segas non compliance with our request to reduce the current
gas consumption of Segas plant (as Segas plant now is the biggest gas
consumer from the gas grid), and as a result of that further reduction in
the gas grid pressure took place. [...]

Despite of that, and in order to try to recover the gas grid pressure today
Segas we asked to perform temporally normal and controlled stop to the
plant for a while by going to recycle mode {...] in order to fix the gas grid
low pressure problem and resume the grid normal pressure but again
Segas didn’t comply with gasco gas grid control center and that caused
further affect on the power stations during peak time with relevant partial
black out in some districts today[...] [Glas grid pressure is expected to
collapse in any time and that will dramatically negatively affect all the
consumers and power stations in the area [...}*!8

5.302 16 November 2013: UFG reiterates its offer to EGAS to revise the delivery schedule

under the Transient Agreement:

Dear Khaled,

As you know, Ufg has offered Egas to re-program the agreed delivery
schedule to support your request to shutdown today, coupled with the
requirement to Egas to commit to a date to resume the start up operation
(proposed 19th nov).

To date, ufg has not concluded any agreement to amend [Nlovember
delivery schedule, but we remain at your full disposal to discuss such

delivery schedule in terms compliant with our contractual transient
agreement.>!9

5.303 16 November 2013: EGAS asks UFG to cooperate with its efforts to avoid the risk of

a sudden gas grid pressure drop:

[I] think you feel the serious situation that we are all currently encounter, i
am fully understand your contractual point of view as mentioned in your
mail below, however we are now in a middle of action and we need to take
decisions on the ground to rescue the gas grid in order to be restored
again and then we can sit and appraise the situation and you can agree
with Egas on whatever you will conclude with them.

Meanwhile, please help me now to fix this situation for the sake of all of us
including Segas plant to avoid the risk of sudden gas grid pressure drop in
the area which can take place in any time and at that case the situation
will be out of control especially that we will start the first working day of
the week after few hours where additional consumption loads is
expected with relevant further gas pressure reduction in the grid is
expected as well.*?°

5.304 16 November 2013: EGAS requests UFG to stop the Damietta Plant.*?! On the same

date, EGAS informs UFG of a new emergency situation.*”
5.305 16 November 2013: UFG announces the shutdown of the Damietta Plant:

Further to Egas request and telecom this morning, Segas [LNG] plant will
suspend the start up operations. As per agreement, tomorrow Sunday at 10
hrs Cairo time we will hold a teleconference to confirm the new delivery
program as per yesterday's UFG proposal, and including Egas comments,
but, as agreed, in all circumstances assuring that sufficient NG will be
availed to produce UFG November 2013 LNG cargo.

Our proposal from yesterday included both stopping plant and set{t]ing a
recom[m]encement date for the start up process.*>

commitment with reference to the Delivery Schedule for the year 2013 in

[J

[O]nce the Delivery Schedule is agreed between the Parties with such
short notice, that becomes a no-return point in which UFG can neither re-
schedule nor re-consider its obligations mid- and downstream, and all of
them bring us direct costs without any possibility to be mitigated.

Currently, EGAS has suspended any operational communication and
despite the urgency and gravity of the situation, we do not have any
detailed information from your side about EGAS' plans to resume
production [...]°”

5.307 24 November 2013: The Minister of Petroleum (Mr Sherif Ismail) states that local

market needs take priority over supply to the Damietta Plant. Local media reports:

In terms of the current international arbitration lawsuit with the Spanish
Union Fenosa; Sherief Ismail said that we should first cover local
market's needs from natural gas, pointing out that the agreement with
UFG is a long term agreement that will last for more than 15 years so we
have the opportunity to find a solution. He added that minister of
petroleum currently negotiates with UFG to reach an agreement that
satisfies all parties, but first we have to cover local market’s needs.*>

5.308 24 November 2013: UFG submits to EGAS a notice of intent to terminate the

Transient Agreement:

Pursuant to Article 3 of the UFG Transient Agreement, EGAS undertook
to supply to UFG NG to ensure that UFG will lift at least one (1) LNG
Cargo in November 2013 and at the rate of no less than 335 million
standard cubic feet per day, in order to enable the Damietta LNG Plant to
operate for a continuous period of at least 12 days per Calendar Month,
not allowing the operative and material conditions to lift the November
LNG Cargo.

As at November 24, 2013, EGAS has failed to comply with its delivery
commitments under the UFG Transient Agreement.

In accordance with Article 5.III of the UFG Transient Agreement, EGAS
has a period of thirty (30) days since the date this Notice of Intent to
Terminate is received to come into compliance with the abovementioned
obligations [...] Failure to comply with such obligations after the 30 days'

period shall entitle UFG to exercise its right to terminate the UFG
Transient Agreement.*°6

5.309 26 November 2013: UFG meets the Minister of Petroleum and the chairman of EGPC
and EGAS regarding the termination of the Transient Agreement. The outcome of the

meeting is referred to in a letter of 5 December 2013 from UFG to EGAS:

We write you further to the meeting that, together with the Chairman of
EGPC and the Chairman of EGAS, we held with Your Excellency on
November 26th at the Ministry's premises [...]

Our meeting with Your Excellency of November 26th takes place at a very
difficult instance, after EGAS failed to deliver natural gas for the
production of at least one LNG cargo during November. [S]uch obligation
was unconditional under the Transient Agreement [...]

EGAS’ unapologetic refusal to comply with the Agreement less than a
month after its entry into force is astonishing. We note, in this context,
your equally distressing statement during our meeting on November 26th
that Egypt will in fact not comply with its obligations in the near future.

We have listened to your explanations during the meeting but, although we
appreciate any efforts that the Petroleum Ministry and EGAS may have
made to obtain the minimal quantities of gas during the short time of the
LNG Plant’s cooldown, we cannot accept your assertion that the reason
not to supply feedgas to the LNG Plant was the need to prioritize the
available gas to other customers which cannot be curtailed. It is clear to
us that the reason for shutting down the Damietta LNG Plant has been the
deliberate decision to discriminate, once more, against UFG by directing
available natural gas to the rest of the consumers (exports to Jordan,
exports of LNG in the other Egyptian export project, all industrial and
petrochemical customers, including exporters of industrial and
petrochemical products and gas-based power generation).**7

5.310 Mr Egea Krauel testified about this meeting in his written evidence, as follows:

My colleagues and I went to Cairo and met with Sherif Ismail (who had
now become Minister of Petroleum), Taher Abdelraheem (Chairman of
EGAS) and Sherif Hadara (Chairman of EGPC) on November 26, 2013,
approximately ten days after we were forced to shut down the Damietta
LNG Plant. Minister Ismail and Mr Abdelraheem apologized for EGAS’s
failure to meet its supply commitments. They explained that they had
faced some diminution in gas production. Minister Ismail said that he
could not stop supply to electricity generators and fertilizer producers and
thus had to stop supplying UFG. He said that he had received phone calls

from the Ministers of Electricity and Industry asking him not to shut down
supply to power generators and the industrial consumers. This
explanation (which had nothing to do with the alleged ‘national security’
issues) left no doubt as to the fact that the Government's decision to cut
supply to UFG was motivated by political convenience: it was less
politically damaging to cut supply to one large consumer (especially when
that consumer is a foreign company) than to apportion a reduction of
supply across different users and economic sectors. Minister Ismail said
that despite having agreed to the Transient Agreement, there was no gas
for UFG. With great astonishment, I responded that, given the very low
commitments agreed upon in the Transient Agreements, the Ministry of
Petroleum and EGAS should have foreseen this issue, and had other
customers ready to reduce their gas intake instead of yet again sacrificing
UFG. I particularly insisted on the fact that fertilizer producers were
essentially gas exporters (fertilizer production consumes enormous
quantities of gas and Egyptian producers ultimately export a significant
part of their fertilizers) and there was thus reason to curtail their supply as
well. I summarized the main content of the meeting held on November 26,
2013 in my letter sent on December 5, 2013, which makes clear that the
Minister of Petroleum had instructed EGAS to stop supplying the Damietta
LNG Plant.°*

5.311 Mr Saez Ramirez also described the meeting in his written evidence:

We met with the Minister of Petroleum (Mr Sherif Ismail) [...] He said that
he could not give us any gas because the Ministry had to prioritize
diverting the gas to power generation plants throughout the country, as
well as other industrial consumers, and added that he could not stop the
fertilizers and power plants, cement plants, and other industrial users.
Unlike the correspondence that we had received from EGAS just a few
days earlier, there was no mention of any ‘national security’ issues.>??

5.312 December 2013: EGAS fails to comply with the terms of the Transient Agreement by
defaulting on payments due to SEGAS under the EGAS Tolling Contract. On 5
December 2013, UFG writes to EGAS:

Additionally we would like to underline that as at this date EGAS has not
made the payments due to SEGAS on November 2013.*

5.313 19 January 2014: The Respondent replies to UFG’s letter of 5 December 2013.**! It

merits citing in full:

We are in receipt of your letter of 5 December 2013 wherein you make
several allegations against the Government of Egypt in connection with
gas delivery to Union Fenosa Gas (UFG) and the Spanish Egyptian Gas
Company (SEGAS).

We observe that gas deliveries to UFG and SEGAS are governed by
agreements entered into by UFG (or its subsidiaries), SEGAS, the
Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation and/or the Egyptian Natural
Gas Holding Company (EGAS). The Government of Egypt is in no way,
either directly or indirectly, a party to those agreements. We are, therefore,
not in a position to comment on their content or performance. Any dispute
arising under the agreements would be purely contractual in nature and
should be resolved directly with the relevant counterparty (or
counterparties).

In this context, we strongly reject your allegations that Egypt has
‘repudiated’ certain undertakings or failed to ‘fulfill its minimal
commitments’ or that Egypt made statements to the effect that it would not
‘comply with its obligations in the near future’, As Egypt is not bound by
any contractual commitments in respect of the delivery of gas to UFO or
SEGAS, it cannot have ‘repudiated’ or failed to honor any ‘commitments’
in this regard.

We similarly strongly reject your contention that Egypt is deliberately
discriminating against UFG by ‘directing available natural gas to the rest
of the consumers’ and has allegedly given ‘instruction’ to EGAS to halt
deliveries to UFG and SEGAS. We regret that you would make such a
serious allegation without offering any substantiation thereof.

We are also extremely surprised and disappointed by UFG's blatant
mischaracterization of the conversations which took place during our
meetings of September and November 2013 and by your suggestion that
the Ministry was somehow a party to the negotiation and/or performance
of the so-called Transient Agreement between EGAS and UFG. We
therefore reject this disingenuous attempt at distorting the record which
appears to be designed for the sole purpose of implicating the Government
of Egypt in a contractual dispute to which it is not a party. As you
correctly observe, the Government of Egypt places great emphasis on
maintaining the confidence of foreign companies in the face of the ongoing
difficulties confronting Egypt's economy and, in particular, its energy
industry. It was strictly in accordance with this spirit that the Ministry of
Petroleum and Mineral Resources sought to lend its support to the

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 158 of 347

ongoing negotiations between UFG and EGAS. The Ministry's involvement
goes no further and certainly cannot ensure any favorable outcome to the
negotiations.

That said, we still hope that UFG and EGAS will soon reach an amicable
resolution of the dispute between them.

5.314 It is unnecessary to refer here to the Parties’ further correspondence. By this time, the
Parties’ correspondence was most probably being drafted by their respective legal
advisers within the context of this ICSID arbitration; and, as a result, they are less

useful as evidence of contemporary facts for present purposes.

5.315 22 January 2014: The media report that the Minister of Petroleum identifies the local

market gas needs as the top priority. This is reported in the local press, as follows:

Eng. Sherief Ismail, petroleum minister confirmed that covering local
market's needs from petroleum products and natural gas tops the
ministry's priorities, especially production sectors and service sectors that
increases its consumption by 6% a year as it reached last year 75 mn
equivalent tons of oil and gas.***

5.316 13 February 2014: UFG issues its notice of termination of the Transient Agreement to
EGAS:

The thirty-day period triggered by UFG’s Notice of Intent to Terminate
lapsed on 26 December 2013 [...] EGAS has not remedied the situation [...]
Not only did EGAS fail to carry out any actions to remedy this breach but
it also failed to fulfil its delivery commitments for December 2013 and
January 2014 [...]

As a further result of EGAS’ ongoing breach, pursuant to Article 5.III of
the UFG Transient Agreement, UFG hereby terminates the UFG Transient
Agreement with immediate effect as of the date of this notice. Accordingly,
this letter constitutes a Notice of Termination of the UFG Transient
Agreement pursuant to Article 5.III thereof.>*

Pursuant to Article 5 of the Agreement, introduced via Addendum No. 7,
dated July 1, 2011, you are hereby notified of the occurrence of an event of
Force Majeure. The cause behind this Force Majeure declaration, as you
are aware, is the protracted interruption of gas supply from the Damietta
(Egypt) liquefaction plant, which is one of long-term supply sources we
had available to supply gas to you and has been fully interrupted since
mid-2012. Despite having made our best efforts to keep up the gas supply,
which reflects our good faith and has caused us to incur significant loss,

Prime Minister Eng. Ibrahim Mehleb and the Egyptian Petroleum Minister
met on Sunday with British Petroleum (BP) CEO Bob Dudley at the

The Prime Minister stressed that it is a top priority for the government to

17 March 2015: The Minister of Industry announces that he hopes for a potential
settlement of the dispute with UFG; he acknowledges that gas shortages are due to
“poor planning by the previous administration.” As reported, the Minister of Industry,
expresses hope that Egypt’s dispute with Gas Natural Fenosa would be finally settled

by the end of the year. He states that:

When Gas Natural Fenosa commissioned the plant, Egypt was a major oil
and gas exporter. Unfortunately, as a result of poor planning by the
previous administration, my country was suddenly left without gas and
crude oil with which to satisfy not only Gas Natural Fenosa’s demand but
also that of our own industry. We are now importing gas and we hope the

PART VI: JURISDICTION ISSUES

(1) Introduction

It is appropriate to address the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections under four
headings (as alleged by the Respondent): (i) the absence of any protected investments
within the meaning of Article 1 of the Treaty and Article 25(1) of the ICSID
Convention; (ii) the “claim-splitting” tactics employed by the Claimant and SEGAS
in their disputes with the Respondent and EGAS; (iii) the contractual nature of the
Claimant’s claims; and (iv) corruption by the Claimant (including its predecessor
UFACEX) in procuring the SPA made with EGPC (succeeded by EGAS). As regards
(ii) and (iv), the objection may raise issues as to admissibility, i.e. the non-exercise of
jurisdiction by the Tribunal as distinct from jurisdiction. However, for the purpose of
this Award, this is a distinction that makes no difference; and it is therefore

convenient to subsume all issues of admissibility with issues of jurisdiction.

 

As regards (iv) corruption, the Tribunal addresses the Parties’ dispute separately in

Part VII below. This Part VI addresses only (i) the “investment” issues; (ii) the

 

“claim-splitting” issues and (iii) the “contractual nature” of the Claimant’s claims

(which partly overlaps with the previous issues).

The Treaty: Article 1 of the Treaty defines “Investor” and “Investment”: see the text
cited in Part III(2) above. It is not disputed that the Claimant is an “Investor,” ratione
personae, as a legal entity incorporated in Spain under Article 1(1)(b) of the Treaty.
As to “Investment” under Article 1(2) of the Treaty, issues arise from the Claimant’s
participation in the SPA, its performance by the Claimant and its successive

amendments. In regard to the Claimant’s shares in SEGAS, as an Egyptian legal

 

entity involved in the Damietta Project, es arise as to whether the Claimant
maintained its ownership of those shares and, also, whether SEGAS owned any
relevant rights under its EGAS Tolling Contract with EGAS, thereby affecting the
status or value of the Claimant’s shareholding in SEGAS as an investment under

Article 1(2) of the Treaty.

Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention: There appears to be no separate issue
regarding the requirement for an “investment” under Article 25(1) of the ICSID
Convention (for its text, see Part III(5) above). Subject to the issue over SEGAS’

rights under the EGAS Tolling Contract, if the Claimant, as an “investor” had an
“investment” satisfying the test under Article 1 of the Treaty, it satisfied Article 25(1)
of the ICSID Convention as regards this same test. The Tribunal considers that both
Article 25(1) and Article 1 include, as part of the same test, a “holistic approach” and

the “indicia” of an investment listed in Salini v. Morocco (2001).!

“Claim-Splitting”: The Respondent contends that the Tribunal should not exercise its
jurisdiction in this arbitration on the ground that the Claimant and SEGAS have
improperly engaged in claim-splitting between the ICC, CRCICA and Treaty
arbitrations. It is here appropriate to describe these ICC and CRCICA international

commercial arbitrations.

The ICC Arbitration (ICC 19382/MD/TO) was commenced by SEGAS against EGAS
on 11 April 2013 claiming Toll-or-Pay fees under the EGAS Tolling Contract, in the
amount of approximately US$ 82.9 million. (Following its second partial award of 24
May 2016, the ICC tribunal issued its final award dismissing SEGAS’s claim; there

was no pleaded issue of corruption by EGAS; and this arbitration is now at an end).

This ICC Arbitration was followed by a second ICC arbitration brought by HSBC
against EGAS in February 2018, apparently as the assignee of SEGAS in respect of
rights to tolling fees under the EGAS Tolling Contract. (The Tribunal refers to this
second ICC arbitration as the “HSBC Arbitration”). It is pending.

The first CRCICA Arbitration (896) was commenced by the Claimant against EGAS
on 17 May 2013, claiming damages for the failure to comply with provisions for price
adjustments under the SPA, in the amount of approximately US$ 9.7 million. This
first CRCICA tribunal, with its seat in Cairo, issued a partial award on 7 August 2015
and a final award on 21 December 2017, dismissing (inter alia) the Claimant’s
claims; there was also an issue of corruption pleaded by EGAS against the Claimant

which was rejected by the tribunal. This arbitration is now at an end.

The second CRCICA Arbitration (899) was commenced by the Claimant against
EGAS on 30 May 2013 claiming damages for the failure to supply natural gas under
the SPA, in the amount of approximately US$ 2.8 billion. This arbitration was stayed;

but the stay was lifted in early 2018 following the final award issued by the tribunal in
the first CRCICA Arbitration (896). This second CRCICA Arbitration remains
pending, with oral hearings apparently fixed for October and December 2018.

Corruption: The Respondent contends that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction or cannot
exercise its jurisdiction under the Treaty on the ground that the Claimant (with its
associated companies, including UFACEX) procured the SPA by means of
corruption. The Tribunal addresses this jurisdictional objection separately below,

following its decisions on the Respondents other jurisdictional objections.

Before its analyses and decisions, the Tribunal summarises below the Parties’
respective cases on the issues of jurisdiction, “claim-splitting” and corruption. As
indicated in other Parts of this Award, such summaries do not recite in full either
Party’s written and oral submissions. Nonetheless, the Tribunal has considered such
submissions in full; and the omission of a reference to any submission should not be
treated as an indication that it has not been considered by the Tribunal. (As earlier, for
ease of reference, the Tribunal does not distinguish between the Claimant, “UFG” and

UFACEX unless the context requires otherwise).
(2) The Respondent’s Case

In summary, it is the Respondent’s case that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because
the Claimant has failed to establish that it has protected investments. The Respondent
also argues that the Tribunal lacks or should decline to exercise jurisdiction because
the “gas supply dispute” between the parties is contractual in nature and is to be
settled by the contractually agreed fora and because the Claimant (with SEGAS) has
engaged in claim-splitting and its claims in this ICSID arbitration have the same

“fundamental basis” as those raised in the CRCICA and ICC arbitrations.”

The Respondent concludes that the Tribunal lacks ratione materiae jurisdiction over
the dispute and refers to: (a) the pledge of UFG’s shares in SEGAS; (b) the
assignment of SEGAS’ rights under the EGAS Tolling Contract; and (c) the SPA)

which, according to the Respondent, does not qualify as “an investment.”

(a) The Pledge of UFG’s Shares in SEGAS

6.14. The Respondent submits that an investment of an investor of the other Contracting
Party must exist at the time of the measures alleged to constitute a treaty violation.>
Relying on the award in Phoenix v. Czech Republic (2009),* the Respondent asserts
that an investment treaty tribunal lacks jurisdiction over measures alleged to
constitute a treaty violation that occur after an investor loses its status as an investor

with a protected investment.°

6.15 The Respondent disputes that the Claimant owns its shares in SEGAS at the relevant
time. The Respondent contends that UFG pledged its shares in SEGAS to HSBC
Bank Egypt S.A.E (“HSBC Egypt”) as collateral against possible default by SEGAS
(the owner of the Damietta Plant) on the loan repayment in the context of SEGAS’

debt refinancing arrangements in July 2007.°

6.16 Referring to the award in Cementownia v. Turkey (2009),’ and other ICSID awards
that adopted similar reasoning, the Respondent contends that the Claimant bears the
burden of proving that it held the investment at issue at the time of the measures

alleged to constitute the treaty violation.®

6.17 The Respondent submits the Claimant has failed to satisfy its burden to establish that
it has remained at all relevant times the owner of the SEGAS shares.” First, the
Respondent contends that the Claimant has failed to provide any affirmative evidence
of ownership, such as share certificates, which the Respondent notes are in the

physical possession of HSBC. Second, the Respondent rejects the Claimant’s “bare”

 

allegation that it has retained “full ownership” of the SEGAS shares following the

Share Pledge Agreement;!° and it argues: “the terms of the Share Pledge Agreement
belie this allegation.”!! The Respondent points out that Clause 9.1 of the Share Pledge
Agreement, on which the Claimant relies,!” provides that UFG could no longer assign
“any of its rights, title and interest in, to and under [the SEGAS shares]” without
meeting certain conditions “to the satisfaction of [HSBC], acting reasonably.”!> The
Respondent argues that the Share Pledge Agreement therefore supports its case that,
as a result of the pledge, the Claimant could no longer exercise full ownership rights

in relation to the SEGAS shares, including the right to dispose of these shares. '4

The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s alternative argument that even if, in eventu,
UFG transferred “legal ownership” of the SEGAS shares to HSBC, it retained
“beneficial ownership” of the shares.'* The Respondent observes that the Claimant
has failed to point to any investment treaty tribunal that has accepted jurisdiction in

'6 According to the Respondent, whether the Claimant

remained the owner after pledging its shares and transferring the share certificates to
HSBC is “a serious question that requires analysis under Egyptian law,” which
governs the Share Pledge Agreement.!’? The Respondent submits that the Claimant
has failed to establish that the Egyptian law even recognizes the concept of beneficial

ownership. '*

Further, the Respondent objects to the Claimant’s argument that, irrespective of the
issue of ownership rights in the SEGAS shares, the Claimant’s “contractual rights
under the Share Pledge Agreement independently satisfy the BIT’s definition of
investment,” specifically a “‘form ... of participation’ in SEGAS within the meaning
of Article 1(2) of the [...] Treaty.”! The Respondent notes that the Share Pledge
Agreement is not an agreement between UFG and SEGAS (concerning UFG’s
participation in SEGAS), but rather between UFG and SEGAS, on the one hand, and

HSBC, on the other. Moreover, “the Share Pledge Agreement does not confer on the

Claimant any ‘governance rights’ vis-a-vis SEGAS or any other form of participation
in SEGAS”; nor does it grant any other rights to the Claimant, as it only serves “to
limit or potentially transfer any such rights.”?°

In conclusion, the Respondent argues that with respect to the SEGAS shares, the
Claimant has failed to establish that these shares were investments by the Claimant as

a Spanish investor at the time of the alleged violation of the Treaty.”!
(b) The Assignment of SEGAS’ Rights under the Tolling Contracts

According to the Respondent, SEGAS’ contractual rights under the Tolling Contracts
do not constitute “an investment” protected under the Treaty because of the absolute
assignment of these rights.” The Respondent observes that SEGAS has assigned by
way of security to HSBC Bank Plc. (“HSBC UK”) all of its present and future
contractual rights under the Tolling Contracts, pursuant to the Offshore Security
Agreement between SEGAS and HSBC UK® (as trustee for the financial institutions
providing funds to SEGAS), under the same refinancing agreements that included the
Share Pledge Agreement.”4 In support of its position, the Respondent refers to the
ICC tribunal’s award of 24 March 2016 in the arbitration initiated by SEGAS against
EGAS for unpaid tolling fee under the EGAS Tolling Contract, which held (in
relevant part) that:

[Bly executing the Offshore Security Agreement and related documents in

July 2007, SEGAS assigned to HSBC absolutely its rights under the EGAS

Tolling Contract and [...] those rights were not effectively transferred
back to SEGAS by the Deed of Reassignment.”°

 

The Respondent submits that the ICC tribunal’s determination that SEGAS assigned
to HSBC UK “absolutely” its rights under the EGAS Tolling Contract is also

controlling as to SEGAS’ rights under the UFG Tolling Contract because the Offshore

Security Agreement and related instruments transferred rights under the UFG Tolling

Contract on the same terms as the rights under the EGAS Tolling Contract.?°

The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s allegations that irrespective of whether

“specific legal rights under the Tolling Contracts formally belong to SEGAS or HSBC

 

as a result of the assignment, EGAS has a contractual obligation to pay tolling and
toll-or-pay fees” under the EGAS Tolling Contract.2? The Respondent argues that
EGAS has committed to make payments to SEGAS and not to HSBC UK;?8 and, thus,
“the Claimant misses the point.” The Respondent concludes that there is no basis for
the Tribunal to determine whether EGAS has payment obligations under the EGAS
Tolling Contract because SEGAS “has no rights under that contract.” In support, the
Respondent refers again to the ICC tribunal’s award providing that “the sums claimed
for outstanding toll-or-pay amounts and tolling fees under the EGAS Tolling Contract
are not recoverable by SEGAS, because of the absolute assignment created by the

Offshore Security Agreement.”*°

In conclusion, the Respondent therefore submits that the Claimant can “neither [...]
argue that it held indirect investment in the Tolling Contract between SEGAS and
EGAS, nor [...] to claim damages in relation to any dividends [...] recoverable under

the Tolling Agreement.”*!

(c) The SPA

The Respondent submits that the SPA (as a natural gas sale and purchase contract) is
a commercial transaction that is not protected under the Treaty or Article 25(1) of the
ICSID Convention.** According to the Respondent, even if the SPA could constitute
an investment for the purposes of Article 1(2) of the Treaty, the Claimant must still

establish the existence of “an investment” under both the ICSID Convention and the

Treaty. Relying on Salini v. Morocco and other ICSID awards,» the Respondent
maintains that the “investment” must meet certain objective requirements. The
Respondent submits that it is well established that commercial transactions, such as

the SPA, do not meet the inherent characteristics of contribution, duration and risk

that define “an investment.”*4

6.26 For the reasons described below, the Respondent rejects the Claimant’s allegations
that ICSID jurisdiction exists under the SPA based “on a theory that legal rights
[associated with the SEGAS shares] and UFG’s rights under the SPA comprise parts

of the same investment and must be viewed holistically.”*°

6.27 The Respondent argues that none of the legal materials cited by the Claimant in
support to such “holistic approach” stand for the proposition that a dispute regarding
the non-performance of a sale and purchase contract constitutes “a dispute arising

directly out of an investment” under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.*°

6.28 The Respondent notes that the Claimant’s principal claims in this ICSID arbitration,
and all claims for compensation, are based upon the Respondent’s alleged failure,
through EGAS, to supply contractually agreed volumes of gas under the SPA. The

Respondent also points out that the Claimant does not seek any compensation for

The Respondent contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction or, alternatively (if it
had any jurisdiction), the Tribunal should decline to exercise such jurisdiction,
because the “gas supply dispute” is essentially contractual in nature and is to be

settled by the contractually agreed fora (and not ICSID arbitration).

The Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the present dispute
because the bases of the Claimant’s claims in the CRCICA and ICC arbitrations and
its principal claims and all claims for compensation in the present arbitration are
predicated on EGAS’s alleged failure to perform its contractual obligations, i.e., to

supply the contractually-agreed volumes of natural gas under the SPA.*?

The Respondent invokes the doctrine of sovereign authority to argue that it does not
bear state responsibility for EGAS’s breaches of the SPA. Relying on Suez v.
Argentina and other ICSID awards, the Respondent argues that for a State to incur
responsibility for investment treaty breaches, it must act in the exercise of its
sovereign powers.*° The Respondent notes that while the Claimant refers to the
Respondent’s policies, and alleged acts of EGAS in conformity with those policies,
the Claimant has failed to identify a sovereign act of the Respondent, such as a law,
decree or judgment, that would have caused EGAS acts or omissions alleged to

constitute a violation of the SPA. The Respondent therefore submits that its

international responsibility cannot be engaged for the purpose of Article 11 of the

Treaty (providing for ISDS).*!

The Respondent also submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the present
dispute has previously been submitted by SEGAS to CRCICA and ICC arbitrations.”
The Respondent notes that the Claimant has failed to address the meaning of Article
11 of the Treaty, which provide the investor “a choice” between SCC, ICC, CRCICA
or ICSID Convention arbitration, and the meaning of Article 26 of the ICSID
Convention which ensures that ICSID arbitration is the exclusive remedy absent

agreement to the contrary.

The Respondent submits that because the dispute before this Tribunal shares the same

“fundamental basis

 

as the disputes previously submitted to CRCICA and ICC
arbitrations, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over such dispute under Article 11 of the
Treaty and Article 26 of the ICSID Convention.‘ Referring to the “fundamental basis
of the claim” test adopted by the tribunals in H&H v. Egypt and Pantechniki v.
Albania,** the Respondent argues that the essence of the dispute submitted by the
Claimant to ICSID arbitration and all of its ICSID claims, with the exception of its
claims claim based on the revocation of SEGAS Free Zone licenses, is that the
Respondent, through EGAS, has failed to supply the contractually agreed gas and has

thus treated the Claimant less favorably than other consumers.“°

The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s allegations that the “triple identity test” leads
to the opposite conclusion. Relying on the award in Grynberg v. Grenada,*” the
Respondent argues that the Claimant may not maintain, on the one hand, that its
control over SEGAS gives rise to jurisdiction over the investment and then claim that
it is not a party to the ICC arbitration, on the other.** According to the Respondent,

the factual and legal grounds in the parallel commercial arbitrations are “inextricably

linked” to those in the ICSID arbitration.!? The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s
argument that the damages issues in the four arbitrations are different. The
Respondent argues that the Claimant seeks damages on the same precise bases as in

the ICSID arbitration.*”

In conclusion, the Respondent argues that the Claimant has failed to show that its
claims in this arbitration have an autonomous existence outside the SPA and related
agreements. According to the Respondent, because the CRCICA and ICC arbitrations
share the same fundamental basis, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the claims
under Article 11 of the Treaty and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.*! According
to the Respondent, the Tribunal should “decline jurisdiction pursuant to the principle
of lis pendens to prevent Claimant’s abusive multiple claims strategy (claim-

952

splitting).
(3) The Claimant’s Case

The Claimant contends that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Parties’ dispute as
all the requirements for jurisdiction in both the Treaty and the ICSID Convention are
satisfied.** According to the Claimant, the Respondent’s challenges to the Claimant’s
ownership and control over its investment are meritless. The Claimant asserts that its
approximately 80% shareholding of SEGAS, its contractual and legal rights under and
relating to the SPA, its rights under related agreements, and its money, services and
resources invested in the Damietta Project are all rights and assets which constitute,
individually and collectively, protected investments within the meaning of both

Article 1(2) of the Treaty and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.™
(a) The Pledge of UFG’s Shares in SEGAS

The Claimant submits that it has owned its shares in SEGAS at all relevant times and
has fully met its burden of proof. The Claimant contends that, whilst it did grant to
HSBC a security interest in those shares by means of the Share Pledge Agreement, the

pledge did not deprive its ownership in the shares. Under Egyptian law (as the

governing law of the Share Pledge Agreement) a pledge of shares as security does not
transfer ownership from the pledgor to the pledgee.*> The Claimant relies in this

regard on Articles 125 and 129 of the Egyptian Commercial Code.*°

The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s contention that it has not remained the legal
and beneficial owner of the SEGAS shares, allegedly because UFG may not sell its
shares without complying with certain conditions to the satisfaction of HSBC.°’ The
Claimant submits that the Respondent’s position contradicts the express terms of
Clause 8.1(a) of the Share Pledge Agreement that recognises the Claimant as “the sole
legal and beneficial owner of the Secured Assets” at the time the Share Pledge
Agreement was concluded. The Claimant argues that Clause 8.1(e) further recognises
that UFG will continue to own the SEGAS shares for the duration of the Agreement,
given that in this provision UFG warrants that it will not pledge or assign its interest
in SEGAS in the future.** According to the Claimant, Clause 6 of the Share Pledge
Agreement further confirms UFG’s continuing ownership of the SEGAS’ shares,

because HSBC may not enforce its security interest save in the case of default. *?

The Claimant asserts that it “expressly retained almost all of its ownership rights,
including the right (subject to certain conditions) to sell the secured assets [Clause 9],
the right to vote its shares in SEGAS and the right to dividends [Clause 5].”©
According to the Claimant, those interests constitute the essence of ownership and
comprise a “forms of participation in a company”, which satisfy the Treaty’s

definition of “investment.”

The Claimant points out that HSBC’s rights over SEGAS’ shares under the Share
Pledge Agreement (as governed by Egyptian law) contrast significantly with the
HSBC UK’s rights over SEGAS’ interests in the Tolling Contracts under the Offshore
Security Agreement (as governed by English law). Under the latter Agreement,
SEGAS has “

 

signed absolutely” its rights in the EGAS and UFG Tolling Contracts.

The Claimant acknowledges that, under English law, an “absolute assignment” entails

the complete transfer of legal rights from one party to the other. The Claimant asserts

that the concept of “absolute assignment” does not exist under Egyptian law.°!

The Claimant maintains that its protected investments include not only its shares in
SEGAS, but also the rights corresponding to these shares. The Claimant asserts that
its expressly retained voting rights and rights to dividends corresponding to these
shares alone constitute a protected investment, regardless of the party that may
formally own SEGAS’ shares. The Claimant submits that those rights satisfy the
Treaty’s definition of “rights arising from all types of contributions made for the

purpose of creating economic value”: see Article 1(2)[2].”

In conclusion, the Claimant asserts that it continues to own its shares in SEGAS
despite the share transfer to HSBC under the Share Pledge Agreement. Since that
Agreement expressly provides that voting and dividend rights have been retained by
the Claimant, the Claimant concludes that such rights satisfy the Treaty’s definition of
“investment” whether or not they “flow from its independent ownership of its shares

in SEGAS or from the Share Pledge Agreement or from a combination both.”

(b) The Assignment of SEGAS’ Rights under the Tolling Contracts

 

The Claimant contends that SEGAS’ assignment of its rights under the Tolling

Contracts does not impact this Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

According to the Claimant, SEGAS’ Tolling Contracts are only relevant to the extent
they might affect the dividends that SEGAS would have paid to the Claimant, which
is an issue of damages.“ The Claimant acknowledges that SEGAS’ right to payment
under its Tolling Contracts with EGAS and UFG belong to HSBC UK; but it points
out that the assignment is part of a financing arrangement and that HSBC UK is
obliged to assign the rights back to the Claimant once SEGAS’ debts have been

repaid.

The Claimant submits that, under Article 15 of the Offshore Security Agreement, any

payments received under the Tolling Contracts, including payments made by EGAS,

are to be paid to a specific HSBC account and used for specific purposes, i.e.,

financing SEGAS’ operations, paying SEGAS’ debt and paying dividends to SEGAS’

shareholders (i.e., UFG and EGAS). Accordingly, the Claimant and SEGAS both
have an interest in EGAS’ performing its obligations under the EGAS Tolling

Contract.

6.47 The Claimant re-asserts that it expressly holds the right to receive dividends from
SEGAS and that right constitutes part of its “investment” under the Treaty as it is
“clearly an ownership interest, or at least a form of participation.”©’ The Claimant
therefore concludes that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over its claim that the conduct of
the Respondent affected the amount of dividends that the Claimant received from
SEGAS. The separate issues of whether or how much SEGAS would have paid to the

Claimant, by way of dividends, are relevant to damages - but not jurisdiction.
(c) The SPA

6.48 The Claimant contends that the SPA satisfies the Treaty’s definition of “investment”
and therefore constitutes a protected investment under Article 25(1) of the ICSID

Convention, as also Article 1(2) of the Treaty.®*

6.49 The Claimant submits that the SPA is not a “simple sales agreement,” as characterised

by the Respondent. It is part of a larger investment that is to be viewed

796

“holistically.” The Claimant relies on several awards, including Chevron v.

Ecuador” in support to its case that the majority of investment tribunals employ a

“holistic view” of investments. The Claimant submits that its property and contract

rights in shares of SEGAS and its rights under the SPA comprise parts of the same

investment and must be viewed holistically.”!

The Claimant further argues that even if it had no legal interests in SEGAS, the SPA
would still constitute an investment, because it was a component of the legal

arrangements for the Damietta LNG Plant.”

While acknowledging that some ICSID tribunals have employed the Salini test and
held that investment must satisfy the Salini criteria to qualify as “an investment”
under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, the Claimant cites a number of contrary
materials, such as the annulment decision in Malaysian Historical Salvors v. Malaysia
(2009). It contends that other tribunals have not applied Salini as separate,
additional criteria, especially when the definition of investment under the applicable

treaty does not contradict the general understanding of this term.”

The Claimant observes that the Respondent has not addressed the issues of whether
the SPA satisfies the Salini test. The Claimant submits that the SPA satisfies all four
criteria for an investment under the Sa/ini test, namely (i) duration; (iii) regularity of
profit and return; (iii) assumption of risk; and (iv) substantial commitment.”>

The Claimant distinguishes the present case from Global Trading v. Ukraine (2010),”°
on which the Respondent relies to argue that a sale-and-purchase contract can never
satisfy the Salini test. The Claimant points out that the Global Trading tribunal found
that the sale and purchase contacts in that case lacked the essential “connecting factor
of being ‘associated with an investment.’””’’ The Claimant submits that, in contrast,

the SPA is an essential part of the Damietta LNG Project.

In conclusion, the Claimant submits that the SPA cannot be isolated from its overall
investment in Egypt when the Tribunal analyses whether an investment exists for the
jurisdictional purposes of the Treaty and the ICSID Convention. The Claimant argues

that the Tribunal should reject all jurisdictional objections of the Respondent

regarding an “investment,” since the Respondent has failed to provide any valid
arguments as to why the Claimant’s claims do not satisfy the jurisdictional

requirements of the Treaty.”
(d) Contractual Claims under the Treaty and “‘Claim-Splitting”

The Claimant submits that its treaty claims have not been submitted to any form of
arbitration.”? The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s contentions that the Tribunal
lacks jurisdiction over the Claimant’s treaty claims because the Claimant has only
suffered wrongs comprising contractual breaches by EGAS and that the contractual
fora prevail over this ICSID arbitration. The Claimant submits that it has raised
legitimate treaty claims against the Respondent that are distinct from the claims by

SEGAS in the CRCICA and ICC arbitrations.*°

As a preliminary matter, the Claimant relies on the Oil Platform Case (1996)*! and
ICSID decisions that have followed the same reasoning, in support of its case that, for
jurisdictional purposes, it need only to establish a prima facie case that the
Respondent has breached the Treaty.*? The Claimant notes that the Respondent has
provided no argument or evidence to rebut the prima facie legitimacy of the
Claimant’s claims for treaty breaches.*? According to the Claimant, the filing of the
CRCICA and ICC arbitrations before this Treaty arbitration is “by pure
happenstance”; and that fact does not “lessen the seriousness to Egypt’s Treaty
breaches.”*! The Claimant concludes that it has established a prima facie case in

which each of its treaty claims falls within the substantive protections of the Treaty.

The Claimant also asserts that the forum selection clause in the SPA does not bar
ICSID jurisdiction. The Claimant relies on a number of decisions in which ICSID
tribunals have recognised that a contract’s forum selection clause did not foreclose the

right of the claimant to bring an ICSID arbitration.*°

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 180 of 347

The Claimant argues that the adjudication of its claims against EGAS in the two
CRCICA arbitrations cannot be dispositive of the Claimant’s treaty claims against the
Respondent in this Treaty arbitration.*° While the Claimant acknowledges that some
of its treaty claims share some factual background with SEGAS’ contractual claims, it
argues that its treaty claims are not contractual in nature since they are predicated on
the Respondent’s breaches of the Treaty and are grounded on international law and
not on EGAS’ contractual obligations under the SPA and Egyptian law. The Claimant
maintains that the underlying factual matrices of the parallel arbitrations are not

sufficient to sustain a jurisdictional objection in this ICSID arbitration.*”

With respect to the ICC arbitration between SEGAS and EGAS, the Claimant
disputes the Respondent’s allegations that the decision of the ICC tribunal is
dispositive of claims in this arbitration. The Claimant argues that its right to
dividends from SEGAS is based on its position as SEGAS’ shareholder. According to
the Claimant, the ICC tribunal made no finding on the substantive merits of the
Claimant’s claim to dividends from SEGAS because the ICC arbitration concerned
SEGAS’ own right to bring a claim under the EGAS Tolling Contract for EGAS’
failure to make Toll-or-Pay payments due to SEGAS.** The Claimant submits that
whilst the ICC tribunal found that SEGAS could not exercise its rights under the
Tolling Contract because of the assignment of these rights to HSBC UK, that tribunal
did not make findings that Toll-or-Pay payments were not due from EGAS and did
not dismiss SEGAS’ claims on the merits.*”

The Claimant submits that: “[t]he analytical prism that most clearly illustrates the core
distinctions between the claims in this ICSID arbitration and those in the three

different commercial arbitrations is the triple-identity test.
that this legal standard, which requires the identity of the parties, the causes of action,

that the Tribunal “should look, in particular, at the identity of the claims and the

92

causes of action to determine whether the claims are the same of different.

The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s contention that the Claimant’s claims in this

as the Claimant’s and SEGAS’

 

arbitration have the same “fundamental basis’
contractual claims against EGAS. The Claimant submits that the Respondent’s
jurisdictional objection is effectively a “fork-in-the-road” argument.°> The Claimant
submits that Article 11 of the Treaty does not contain a ‘fork-in-the-road’ provision;
and it does not require the Claimant to choose one form of dispute resolution to the
exclusion of others. Contrary to the Respondent's position, the Claimant argues that
Article 26 of the ICSID Convention does not preclude this Tribunal’s jurisdiction,
because the Claimant did not take the Parties’ dispute before multiple investment
tribunals.°> Finally, the Claimant contests the Respondent’s invocation of lis pendens.
The Claimant asserts that that “the initiation of multiple proceedings does not itself
evidence an abuse of process” and argues that it has dully demonstrated that the

commercial arbitrations will not dispose of its claims before this Tribunal.

In conclusion, the Claimant submits that its claims in this arbitration are plainly treaty
claims.*’ The Claimant also concludes that for the purposes of assessing jurisdiction,
it is for the Claimant to define the nature of its claims, and the Respondent should not

be permitted to profit from the mis-characterisation of the Claimant’s claims.°*
(4) The Tribunal’s Analyses and Decisions

The Tribunal addresses in turn the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections based on: (i)
“investment”; (ii) “claim-splitting”; and (iii) the contractual nature of the Claimant’s

claims.

Investment: The Claimant asserts that it is a protected investor with a protected
investment under Article 1(2) the Treaty and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention,

in the form of: (i) the SPA; and (ii) its shares in SEGAS, an Egyptian company.

The Tribunal decides that the Claimant is an “investor” under Article 1(1) of the
Treaty, as a legal entity incorporated in Spain and as a member of the Union Fenosa
association of Spanish companies. As already indicated, this factor does not appear to

be an issue between the Parties.

As to the SPA, its execution, amendments and performance by the Claimant, the
Tribunal decides that, together, these amount to an “Investment” under Article 1(2)[5]
of the Treaty, as “rights to engage in economic and commercial activities authorized
by law or by virtue of a contract, particularly those rights to [...] exploit natural
resources.” It also decides, on the facts in this case, that these rights satisfy the
guidelines provided by the ICSID award in Salini v. Morocco (2001) in regard to
duration, profit and return, risk and commitment to the development of the
Respondent’s economy.” The Tribunal reaches the same conclusion as regards
Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. In support of these conclusions, the Tribunal

points to the facts of this case, as set out in Part V above, which speak for themselves.

As to its shares in SEGAS, as at the time of their acquisition by the Claimant, the
Tribunal decides that these qualified as an “Investment” under Article 1(2)[1] of the
Treaty, as “shares and other forms of participation in companies” and Article 25 of
the ICSID Convention, subject to the issue addressed below regarding the continuity

of such share ownership and SEGAS’ rights under the EGAS Tolling Contract.

The Tribunal also decides that these investments are to be treated “holistically” as one

overall investment made by the Claimant comprising the Damietta Project.

The issue arises whether the Claimant subsequently lost part of this investment by

SEGAS assigning absolutely to HSBC UK its rights under the EGAS Tolling

Contract, by virtue of Clause 3.1(ii) of the Offshore Security Agreement dated 27 July

2007 between SEGAS and HSBC UK (“‘the Offshore Security Agreement”).!°°

6.70 The law applicable to the Offshore Security Agreement was English law: see Clause

28. The law applying to the EGAS Tolling Contract was also English law: see Article
11.1.'°' The Claimant acknowledges that SEGAS’ rights under the EGAS Tolling

Contract were pledged to HSBC UK as security under the Offshore Security

Agreement. The question is whether SEGAS agreed to more than a mere form of

security.

6.71 It was decided by the ICC tribunal in its second partial award of 24 May 2016 in the
ICC Arbitration between SEGAS and EGAS that SEGAS, following its absolute

assignment to HSBC UK, could no longer claim tolling fees from EGAS under the
EGAS Tolling Contract.'°? Paragraphs 376 and 379(ii) of this award contained the

ICC tribunal’s decision (with Paragraphs 313ff), as follows:

376. The Tribunal has found that, by executing the Offshore Security
Agreement and related documents in July 2007, SEGAS assigned to HSBC
absolutely its rights under the EGAS Tolling Contract and that those
rights were not effectively transferred back to SEGAS by the Deed of
Reassignment. Although EGAS was late in pleading the Assignment as a
ground for opposing SEGAS’s claims, having done so in the Rejoinder, it
is not now estopped from relying on the Assignment to object to SEGAS
claiming rights retained by HSBC. Thus, the Tribunal finds that SEGAS is
not entitled to recover from EGAS the toll and pay amounts and tolling
fees claimed in this arbitration.

[el

379. For the reasons stated, the Tribunal hereby Awards, Orders and
Declares: [...]

(ii) The sums claimed for outstanding toll-or-pay amounts and tolling fees
under the EGAS Tolling Contract are not recoverable by SEGAS, because
of the absolute assignment created by the Offshore Security Agreement.

6.72. The ICC tribunal’s decision is legally binding upon EGAS and SEGAS, as res

judicata under the ICC Rules. However, the Claimant was not a party to this ICC

100 Offshore Security Agreement between Spanish Egyptian Gas Company “SEGAS” as Borrower and HSBC

Bank PLC as Offshore Security Trustee, 27 July 2007 [C-0343/R-0038], Clause 3.1, Schedule 1.

arbitration; nor was the Respondent. There is therefore an issue as to the res judicata

effect of this award upon the Parties in this arbitration.

This ICC award does not preclude the Claimant’s shares in SEGAS qualifying as an
investment as at the time of the Claimant’s acquisition of those shares, prior to the
Offshore Security Agreement. The issue arises only from the terms of the Offshore

Security Agreement, as decided by the ICC tribunal in its ICC award.

Whilst the Offshore Security Agreement provided for an “absolute assignment” of
SEGAS’ rights under the EGAS Tolling Contract, the Claimant did not thereby
absolutely assign to HSBC the ownership of its shares in SEGAS. This is confirmed
by Clause 9 of the Share Pledge Agreement of 27 July 2007 between the Claimant,
SEGAS and HSBC Egypt whereby the Claimant remained conditionally entitled to
maintain its interest in those shares. '°? Its shares in SEGAS did not become worthless
or non-existent with the Offshore Security Agreement (see also Clause 3.1(ii) of the

Offshore Security Agreement).

Article 9.1 of the Share Pledge Agreement, subject to the Offshore Agreement,
permitted the Claimant (inter alia) to sell, transfer, part with its interest in, dispose of
or otherwise deal with any of the rights, title and interest in its SEGAS shares, subject
to four conditions “to the satisfaction of the Onshore Security Agent, acting
reasonably.” That agent was HSBC. The law applicable to the Share Pledge
Agreement was the law of Egypt: see Article 18.1. The Tribunal has been shown no
provisions of Egyptian law that treat Article 9 as being consistent only with an

ares in SEGAS to HSBC, depriving those

   

absolute assignment of the Claimant’s

shares of any value or existence as regards the Claimant.

In the Tribunal’s view, after the Offshore Security Agreement, these retained rights by
the Claimant over its shares in SEGAS were sufficient to maintain the Claimant’s
“investment” under Article 1(2) of the Treaty and Article 25(1) of the ICSID
Convention. Nonetheless, the value of those rights, in the form of any dividends
payable by SEGAS to the Claimant, could be affected by SEGAS’ inability, under the
ICC award or otherwise, to recover fees due from EGAS under the EGAS Tolling

'©3 Share Pledge Agreement between UFG, SEGAS, and HSBC Bank Egypt $.A.E., 27 July 2007, [C-0325].

Contract. That factor, however, may raise an issue as to compensation for a breach of

the Treaty by the Respondent; but not an issue of jurisdiction.

“Claim-Splitting”: The Respondent contends that the Claimant (with SEGAS) has
engaged in an elaborate and improper strategy of “claim-splitting.” It points to the two
CRCICA Arbitrations commenced by the Claimant, the ICC Arbitration commenced
by SEGAS and this arbitration, with the significant overlap of factual and expert
witnesses in the four separate arbitrations.'" The Respondent also points to the
formal relief claimed by EGAS, as the respondent in the CRCICA Arbitration (896),
that the CRCICA tribunal should “[f]lind and declare that EGAS’s gas supply

obligations have been relieved by reason Force Majeure.” !°

 

The Respondent relies upon several awards to support its submission that the

Claimant’s claims in this arbitration are precluded by such claim-splitting and
overlapping issues, including Helnan v. Egypt (2008)!°° and Grynberg v. Grenada
(2010).'° To a similar but greater effect, the Respondent might now also rely upon

the recent award in Orascom v. Algeria (2017).'%

In Orascom v. Algeria (2017), the tribunal decided, based on the general principles of

good faith and abuse of rights under international law, as follows:

542. In particular, an investor who controls several entities in a vertical
chain of companies may commit an abuse if it seeks to impugn the same
host state measures and claims for the same harm at various levels of the
chain in reliance on several investment treaties concluded by the host
state. It goes without saying that structuring an investment through
several layers of corporate entities in different states is not illegitimate.
Indeed, the structure may well pursue legitimate corporate, tax, or pre-
dispute BIT nationality planning purposes. In the field of investment
treaties, the existence of a vertical corporate chain and of treaty
protection covering ‘indirect’ investments implies that several entities in
the chain may claim treaty protection, especially where a host state has
entered into several investment treaties. In other words, several corporate
entities in the chain may be in a position to bring an arbitration against
the host state in relation to the same investment. This possibility, however,

does not mean that the host state has accepted to be sued multiple times
by various entities under the same control that are part of the vertical
chain in relation to the same investment, the same measures and the same
harm.
In the Tribunal’s view, the Claimant and SEGAS have come close to the dividing line
between proper and improper conduct in pursuing four separate arbitrations, under the
Treaty, the SPA and the EGAS Tolling Contract with such overlapping factual issues

and evidence.

However, the position in the present case is materially different from the situations
addressed in Helnan v. Egypt (2008), Grynberg v. Grenada (2010) and Orascom v.
Algeria (2017). In those cases, there was bad faith and/or res judicata found against
the claimants. In this case, given the cumulative effect of the different disputing
parties, applicable laws and causes of action under the separate legal instruments,
there can be no res judicata effect of the ICC arbitration award upon the Claimant and
the Respondent in this ICSID arbitration. As to bad faith, the Tribunal does not find
that the Claimant (with SEGAS) was not acting in good faith, although its tactics
appear to the Tribunal be wasteful of time, effort and expense, both for EGAS and the
Respondent but also, possibly, for the Claimant and SEGAS. Unfortunately,
consensual arbitration ill serves multi-party disputes. As to Orascom v. Algeria
(2017), the investor had deliberately structured its investment through several layers
of corporate entities so as to gain the protection of multiple investment treaties. That

is not the present case.

The Tribunal emphasises that this analysis is limited to the issues of jurisdiction. As
will appear from Part X below, the Tribunal returns to the indirect effect of the ICC
award on the Claimant’s claims under the Treaty. It also takes steps in this Award to
ensure that the Claimant does not benefit from any ‘double recovery’ in respect of
equivalent losses under the Treaty, the SPA and the EGAS Tolling Contract. The
Tribunal also addresses the risk of inconsistent findings between the other arbitrations
and this Award in deciding the Respondent’s application for a stay or suspension of

this arbitration, in Parts X and XI below.
As to the nature of the Claimant’s claims in this ICSID arbitration, the Claimant has

made it abundantly clear that all its claims are based on alleged breaches of the

Respondent’s obligations under the Treaty and not for any contractual breaches of the

SPA or related agreements by EGAS. The Tribunal accepts the Claimant’s
formulation of its claims, although it recognizes (as will be apparent below) that there
is a significant factual overlap between issues common to these treaty and contractual

claims.
(5) Summary of Decisions

These conclusions as to jurisdiction are subject to the Tribunal’s decisions on

corruption addressed in Part VII below.

As a matter of jurisdiction, the Tribunal decides that the Claimant is a protected
investor with a protected investment under the Treaty and the ICSID Convention,
sufficient to establish the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to address and decide on their

merits its claims pleaded in this arbitration under the Treaty.

As a matter of admissibility, the Tribunal decides that it may exercise such
jurisdiction to address and decide on their merits the claims pleaded by the Claimant

in this arbitration under the Treaty,

As matters of jurisdiction and admissibility, the Tribunal decides to dismiss the
Respondent’s objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction and to exercise of such
jurisdiction to address and to decide on their merits the Claimant’s claims pleaded in

this arbitration under the Treaty.

PART VII: THE CORRUPTION ISSUES

(1) Introduction

As indicated in Part VI above, the Tribunal addresses here in Part VII the
Respondent’s other jurisdictional objections based on “corruption,” namely the
alleged acts of corruption by the Claimant (including its predecessor UFACEX) in
procuring the SPA made with EGPC (succeeded by EGAS).

(2) The Respondent’s Case

In summary, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction or should
decline to exercise jurisdiction over the Claimant’s investments because they were
procured through corrupt and illegal practices to which the Claimant was a party. The
Respondent submits that such investments are not protected under the Treaty and the

ICSID Convention.!

The Respondent contends that arrangements at the inception of the Damietta Project
prove the procurement of the Project through corrupt means. The Respondent alleges

three separate instances of corrupt conduct.

First, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant’s “process to select the subcontractor
to build the Damietta Plant was [...] rife with corruption.”? Specifically, the Claimant
awarded the EPC Contract for the Damietta Plant to a joint venture consortium led by
Halliburton/KBR, whose bid was US$ 50 million higher than that of the next
competitor. Halliburton/KBR’s CEO later pleaded guilty in the USA to violations of
the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act for bribing Egyptian Government officials in
connection with an “unnamed Egypt LNG project.” According to the Respondent, the
reference was to the Damietta Project because at the time there were only two such

projects in Egypt; and Halliburton had no involvement in the other project.>

Second, the Respondent argues that the Claimant engaged Mr Hussein Salem, a

“former Egyptian intelligence officer and friend of then-President Mubarak,” who

himself publicly stated that he “used his personal connections in the Egyptian
Government for UFG’s benefit.”* According to the Respondent, Mr Salem fled Egypt
after the 2011 Revolution and was implicated in several additional instances of

corruption.

Third, the Respondent alleges corruption relating to the Claimant’s association with

 

Mr Yehia El Komy. The Respondent contends that the Damietta Project “was the
result of influence peddling and corrupt practices as the then-Minister of Petroleum,
Mr Sameh Fahmy, steered the Damietta LNG Project to UFG at the behest of a
personal friend, Mr Yehia El Komy, based on their personal relationship and to enrich

Mr El Komy.”>

The Respondent alleges that Mr El Komy arranged for the Claimant to enter the
Egyptian gas market and procure the Damietta Project corruptly.° The Respondent
observes that the Claimant had no prior LNG experience; and that it came as “a
surprise in the industry when the company was awarded the Damietta Project.”’ The
Respondent notes that Mr El Komy’s family-owned company, EATCO, only added
gas and petroleum investments to its corporate activities more than a year after the

conclusion of the SPA.*

According to the Respondent, Mr El Komy was brought on board by the Claimant for
his connection to the then Minister of Petroleum Mr Sameh Fahmy, who, in the words
of UFG’s officials, had a “personal interest in the [Damietta Project] and entering the
Spanish market.” According to the Respondent, Mr El Komy was an “agent” or
“intermediary” hired by the Claimant to use his illicit influence over the Minister to

secure that the SPA was awarded to UFACEX.

record that UFACEX contributed the entire amount for Mr El Komy’s participation in
SEGAS.”'® Mr El Komy never contributed his own capital and only contributed to
SEGAS’ share capital a total of US$ 6.88 million,’ selling later his stake to
UFACEX for “solid profits.” According to the Respondent, “Mr El Komy’s
‘contribution’ was nothing more than money funneled to him by Claimant in

exchange for his personal connections and back-channel influence.”?”

7.15 The Respondent contends that, in addition to securing the Damietta Project through
influence peddling, the Claimant did not obtain the SPA through an open or
competitive bid process, as required by Egyptian law. The Respondent argues that the
acquisition of the SPA without a tender process violated Article 15 of the EGPC
Commercial Activity Regulation because there was no “case of necessity” to contract
with UFG, which possessed no experience in the LNG sector, the Damietta Project
did not involve appropriate prices, and was unilaterally approved by the Minister of

Petroleum (Mr Fahmy) without a recommendation of EGPC’s Deciding Committee to

dealings behind closed doors,””? a course “clearly unlawful under Egyptian law.”?
According to the Respondent, the short period for negotiations leading to the SPA is
also consistent with the existence of corruption. As a result, the SPA was awarded in

breach of mandatory requirements of Egyptian law.

7.16 The Respondent submits that the corrupt and illegal practices that surround the
Damietta Project disqualify the Claimant’s alleged investments from protection under
the Treaty and the ICSID Convention, and warrant the dismissal of the case on
jurisdictional grounds or, in the alternative, render the Claimant’s claims

7.17 The Respondent asserts that contracts obtained through acts of corruption are contrary
to Egyptian law and international public policy. The Respondent refers to several
decisions of the Egyptian courts, which have held that such contracts are null and
void.?> According to the Respondent, as a result, the SPA, the Tolling Contracts, and
all ancillary agreements are invalid and legally unenforceable as a matter of
international, Egyptian and English law; and any rights under these agreements or
rights or assets resulting from their implementation are not protected under the Treaty

and the ICSID Convention.”°

which expressly provide that: “[e]Jach Party shall protect in its territory the

of a contract, particularly those rights to search for [...] or exploit natural resources, in
accordance with existing laws and regulations.”* The Respondent submits that the
Treaty does not protect investments in violation of the host State’s laws and, relying
on Inceysa v. El Salvador (2006), it argues that investment tribunals may deny treaty

protection to investments for which the required tender process was not followed.”°

7.19 The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s case that corruption should “not automatically

be considered a jurisdictional issue.”*° The Respondent points out that “as Claimant

 

itself recognizes, arbitral tribunals have not only dismissed claims based on ‘contracts

of corruption’ , but also claims based in ‘contracts obtained by corruption,’ as was the
case in World Duty Free Company v. Kenya.”>'! Moreover, so the Respondent
submits, ICSID tribunals have “overwhelmingly” declined to exercise jurisdiction
where an investment have been obtained through corruption; and that such an

approach ensures the promotion of the rule of law.**

7.20 The Respondent also disputes that the applicable standard of proof for corruption
allegation is one of “clear and convincing evidence.”*> The Respondent submits that
no uniform standard exists. The Respondent asserts that tribunals have held that the
difficulty of proving allegations of corruption and illegality renders it inappropriate to
apply a heightened standard of proof for such allegations and have in practice tailored
the standard of proof to the circumstances of each case, accepting circumstantial

evidence as means of proving allegations of corruption and bribery. The Respondent

asserts that, whatever the applicable standard, it has met its burden of proof in
demonstrating corruption at the inception of the Damietta Project. *4

7.21 The Respondent argues that, contrary to the Claimant’s assertions based on Article 45

 

of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, it has neither waived nor acquiesced in
the conduct through the lapse of time; and that it continues to investigate the

corruption surrounding the Damietta Project.**

In response to the Claimant’s
argument that EGAS has ratified the corruption and the Respondent is barred from
invoking corruption due to its alleged “continuing adherence” to the SPA, the
Respondent points out that it is not a contractual party to the SPA; and that, therefore,

it cannot be said that the Respondent “continues to adhere” to the SPA.*°

7.22 Lastly, the Respondent submits that its allegations of corruption are not time-barred,
as the Claimant asserts. It is the Respondent’s case that, even if the Egyptian statute of
limitations barred the prosecution of the corrupt practices at issue, the Respondent is
not prevented from seeking the dismissal of these ICSID proceedings under
international law, because a domestic statute of limitation “cannot apply to claims

filed under the ICSID Convention,” as was decided in Maffezini v. Spain (2000).>”
(3) The Claimant’s Case

7.23 In summary, the Claimant denies the Respondent’s allegations of corruption and
asserts that they are “wholly unsubstantiated and false.”>* The Claimant asserts that
the Respondent lacks any evidence to establish that corruption occurred or that the

SPA was illegally concluded.

According to the Claimant, even if the Respondent’s submissions were accepted as
credibly raising claims of corruption, they provide no basis for ousting the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction or depriving the Claimant from its treaty protections for the following
reasons. First, a finding of corruption is not an automatic jurisdictional “trump” card.
Second, the Respondent has failed to prosecute public officials for any alleged
corruption relating to the SPA. Third, the Respondent has ratified the SPA through
subsequent acts, including six amendments to the SPA, which can also be considered
protected new “investments” not tainted by corruption allegations relating to the

inception of the project.*°

The Claimant asserts that the Respondent is required to prove its corruption
allegations following the “clear and convincing evidence” standard of proof.*°
According to the Claimant, the Respondent has failed to meet such standard and has
not provided any actual evidence to support its corruption allegations, let alone
sufficient evidence to meet the requisite standard. For this reason alone, the

allegations merit summary dismissal. *!

According to the Claimant, the timing of the Respondent’s allegations confirms their
opportunistic nature. The Claimant notes that the Respondent did not claim that the
SPA was corruptly obtained until 15 years after it was signed, after the Claimant had

submitted its Memorial on the Merits in this ICSID arbitration.”

The Claimant further observes that the Respondent has effectively dropped two of its
initially three allegations of corrupt conduct and seeks to suppress evidence
disproving the third. In addition, the Respondent resorts to misrepresentations and

maintains allegations that lack any factual support.

With respect to the first allegation of corrupt conduct regarding Halliburton, the
Claimant denies that it has anything to do with the corruption identified in the plea
agreement of the former Halliburton/KBR CEO under the US Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act.** The Claimant submits that any corrupt arrangements at Halliburton

involved its own CEO and a “consultant” who was a former Halliburton employee,

but not anyone at UFG. With respect to the payment of US$ 10 million under such an
arrangement between Halliburton and a consultant on the Damietta EPC bid, the

Claimant denies any knowledge of and involvement in any such scheme.“

With respect to the second allegation, the Claimant maintains that the Respondent’s
allegations concerning Mr Hussein Salem have no merit.*> The Claimant asserts that
it has never had any dealings with Mr Salem; and it denies that Mr Salem had any
involvement in the negotiation of the SPA. The Claimant further submits that the

Respondent has not provided any evidence to the contrary.

With respect to the third allegation, the Claimant contends that the corruption and
illegality allegations of the Respondent relating to Mr Yehia El Komy are equally

meritless and unsubstantiated by evidence.*®

The Claimant denies that Mr El Komy was UFACEX’s “agent” or “broker” engaged
to buy influence.*” The Claimant describes Mr El Komy as a local businessman, with
a degree in geology and experience as investor in the petroleum industry, who
“decided to establish an LNG facility in Egypt” and had “the necessary technical and
industry knowledge to put this project together.”** The Claimant asserts that Mr El
Komy was instrumental in the inception of the Damietta Project.*? Moreover,

outset;*? an ii confirms the role played in the early days of the
Project and its value for the Claimant. | was terminated less

than a year after its conclusion. For the Claimant, Mr El Komy’s role is consistent

with the usual role of a local partner in substantial international investment projects.*!

According to the Claimant, Mr El Komy’s active role as a business partner in the

early days of the Project is supported by the evidence. The Claimant asserts that Mr El

 

Komy proposed the idea of the Damietta Project to UFACEX.” Specifically, Mr El
Komy and EATCO played a leading role in the incorporation of SEGAS, securing

The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s

 

ertions that Mr El Komy was an instrument
to facilitate corruption by exerting improper influence over Minister Fahmy and
points out that there is no evidence to support such assertions.*4 The Claimant argues
that the Respondent’s sole “evidence” ee
which the Claimant freely produced during the document production phase in this
arbitration. The Claimant asserts that ; only serves to emphasise Mr El
Komy’s and EATCO’s key role in the development of the Damietta Project.

expected to generate over the life of the Project.”7!

The Claimant further asserts that the SPA was the result of genuine arm’s length
negotiations between UFACEX and EGPC.” Specifically, the Claimant argues that
the Respondent has not demonstrated that the SPA is a “direct agreement” and, even
if it were, all conditions for the SPA were fully satisfied.” According to the Claimant,
the SPA was the product of a competitive process in accordance with Egyptian law.”
As a factual matter, there was no violation of EGPC’s internal bidding rules.”
Moreover, the Claimant asserts that it is entitled to rely on Article 24.1 of the SPA, in
which the EGPC’s Chairman warranted that he had “all powers, authority and
applicable approvals (it any) necessary to enter into the Agreement.”’° Further, the
Claimant asserts that the Respondent itself determined that the SPA was “necessary”
for its economic development.” In addition, the Claimant points out that the price for
natural gas was genuinely and intensely negotiated between the Parties, was increased
by the Minister of Petroleum, and that it was considered to be “appropriate” according
to EGPC itself.’* The Claimant also argues that the price was approved by the
Respondent’s Council of Ministers.”? Also, the Claimant rejects the Respondent’s
assertions that the SPA was unilaterally approved by the Minister of Petroleum and
maintains that the SPA was approved by the Respondent’s Cabinet and by the

Economic Commission of EGPC’s Board of Directors.*°

According to the Claimant, corruption is not an issue of jurisdiction or admissibility in
this case. It submits that any consequences of corruption (which it denies) should
form part of the merits.*! Moreover, even if corruption were found to be implicated in

the conclusion of the SPA, that would make the SPA voidable and not void

automatically. It is therefore for the Tribunal to determine whether the SPA is to be

considered avoided in all the circumstances. **

The Claimant further alleges that the Respondent misstates the law governing
corruption issues and that the Respondent’s assertion that the Tribunal lacks

jurisdiction on the basis of corruption and illegality has no legal basis. The Claimant

 

submits that corruption allegations could not lead to a dismissal of the present case on

jurisdictional grounds.

First, the Claimant submits, international anti-corruption law, as well as policy
considerations in international investment arbitration, demand that corruption not be
treated as an inflexible automatic jurisdictional “trump” card leading to an automatic
dismissal of the case for lack of jurisdiction.*? The Claimant argues that the legal
materials cited by the Respondent in support of it jurisdictional objections based on

corruption allegations are either inapplicable or support the Claimant’s case.**

Second, the Claimant contends that the Respondent’s failure to prosecute the former
Minister Fahmy deprives it of the right to invoke corruption in this arbitration.*> The
Claimant points out that the Respondent has not offered any reasons why the Tribunal
should not apply the Wena v. Egypt standard that lack of prosecution is a ground for

disregarding a State’s corruption defences. *°

Third, the Claimant submits that, by its implementation and further amendments to
the SPA for the past fifteen or more years, the Respondent has acquiesced in or
ratified any corruption or any violation of public bidding regulations that may have

occurred in regard to the SPA.*”

Lastly, the Claimant contends that all periods for civil and criminal liability for any
acts of corruption have already passed and, consequently, that the Respondent has lost
the right to raise corruption as a jurisdictional objection or defence on the merits.**

The Claimant submits that the Respondent’s reliance on Maffezini v. Spain (2000) in

support of it position that a domestic statute of limitation does not apply to claims
under the ICSID Convention is misguided. According to the Claimant, Maffezini v.
Spain (2000) stands for the principle that in treaty arbitration an investor’s treaty
claim should not be barred by domestic statutes of limitation because it is based on
international law. The Claimant notes that, to the contrary, the Respondent’s
“corruption and illegality defences are based precisely upon violation of national

law.789
(4) The Tribunal’s Analyses and Decisions

The Tribunal’s starting-point is necessarily the Treaty. Article 1(2) defines an
“investment” as assets and rights “acquired under the law of the host country
[Egypt].” Article 3 provides protection for investments “made in accordance with
[Egypt’s] laws and regulations by investors of [Spain].” In the Tribunal’s view, an
investment made corruptly by a Spanish investor under the laws of Egypt does not

qualify for protection under the Treaty.

The SPA was subject to, as its “governing law,” the laws of Egypt: see Article 16.1 of
the SPA. The SPA also contained a provision for CRCICA arbitration, in Egypt: see
Article 16.4 of the SPA. The Tribunal takes judicial notice that a party’s corrupt acts
in procuring a contract in Egypt, such as the SPA with EGPC, are criminal offences

under Egyptian law.

Thus, so the Tribunal concludes, the effect of international public policy under the
Treaty as a matter of international law and also as a matter of Egyptian law, proven
corruption by the Claimant in procuring the SPA would be fatal to the Claimant’s
claims derived from the SPA in this arbitration, as regards jurisdiction, admissibility

and the merits.

The Respondent’s case, however, turns on the facts alleged by the Respondent and
denied by the Claimant, rather than upon any material difference as to the legal
principles applicable to the Respondent’s case. Hence, this Part of the Award should
be read with the facts found by the Tribunal in Part V of this Award.

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 202 of 347

The Claimant was not an original party to the SPA. However, as elsewhere decided in
this Award, the Claimant stands in the shoes of the original Buyer (UFACEX). The
Claimant can have no better rights under the Treaty than UFACEX, its associated
company. The original Buyer and the Claimant were, together, closely involved in the

Damietta Project from the outset.

The Respondent advanced, in its pleadings, three separate allegations of corruption
against the Claimant and its associated companies, all members of the Union Fenosa
group of companies, to the effect that the “Damietta LNG Project was riddled with
corruption.”°° These concerned, as listed above: (i) the EPC Contract with
Halliburton; (ii) the SPA and Mr Hussein Salem; and (iii) the SPA and Mr Yehia El
Komy. The Tribunal addresses each of these allegations below; but it is appropriate

first to identify certain common features.

The first feature is the legal burden and standard of proof for these allegations of
corruption against the Claimant. As the party making these allegations, the
Respondent bears the legal burden of proof. As to the standard of proof, although
these allegations amount to serious criminal misconduct, the Tribunal considers that
the standard of proof remains “the balance of probabilities.” As has long been
recognised, corruption is rarely proven by direct cogent evidence; but, rather, it
usually depends upon an accumulation of circumstantial evidence. Circumstantial
evidence of corruption is as good as direct evidence in proving corruption. There is no
reason in this arbitration, which is not a criminal proceeding, to impose a higher

standard of proof: see the Libananco award (2011).?!

The second feature is the timing of these allegations. They were first made in this
arbitration by the Respondent on 25 November 2015, more than 15 years after the
SPA of 1 August 2000. Whilst the lapse of time provides, by itself, no complete
answer to the Respondent’s allegations under international law, it raises doubts as to
why such allegations were not raised and investigated by the Respondent’s criminal
authorities long before 2015; and why criminal prosecutions have still not been

brought against certain individuals in Egypt.

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 203 of 347

The third feature is the SPA itself, as “endorsed” by the Respondent at the time, both
in draft form and as executed by the parties. It was signed by EGPC’s chairman.
Under Article 24.1 of the SPA, EGPC represented and warranted that the SPA had
been authorised and approved; that the SPA constituted the valid, binding and
enforceable obligation of EGPC; and that the execution and performance of the SPA
would not cause it to violate any law or regulation. Whilst the terms of Article 24.1
provide, by themselves, no complete answer to the Respondent’s allegations under
international law, these raise a presumption of legality, albeit rebuttable, that is

inconsistent with corruption by the parties to the SPA.

(i) Halliburton: The Halliburton KBR consortium was granted the EPC Contract by
SEGAS on 19 December 2001 (see Part V above).

Later, Halliburton’s Chief Executive Officer, Mr Albert Stanley, pleaded guilty to
corruption under the USA’s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and the SEC (with the
USA’s Department of Justice) charged Halliburton (with others) with paying bribes to

obtain illegally contracts worth more than USS 6 billion.”

These acts of corruption by bribery (with kickbacks), as publicly reported, included
one or more unnamed projects in Egypt. The Tribunal assumes, on the limited
materials before it, that one such project was the Damietta Project. There are no
evidential materials before this Tribunal linking such corrupt acts with the Claimant

or the SPA.

The Respondent has the legal burden of proving that the Claimant (or any of its
associated companies) was party or privy to acts of corruption by Halliburton and
officers of the Respondent in regard to the execution or performance of the EPC
Contract. Its case cannot succeed without such proof. There can be no such guilt
inferred from Halliburton’s mere association with SEGAS as the Claimant’s majority-

owned subsidiary under the EPC Contract.

The Tribunal has considered these limited materials in regard to Halliburton. There is

no proof in these proceedings of any involvement by the Claimant or SEGAS in any

corrupt acts by Halliburton in regard to EPC Contract, the SPA or the Damietta
Project. Accordingly, the Tribunal decides that the Respondent has not discharged its
legal burden of proof, on a balance of probabilities, in regard to corruption by

Halliburton.

(ii) Mr Hussein Salem: According to the Respondent, Mr Salem was a close
“confidant” of President Mubarak. After the Egyptian Revolution, it was publicly
reported in 2012 that Mr Salem (who was no longer in Egypt) had been involved in

corrupt practices in regard to Egyptian sales of natural gas.

He was publicly quoted in the press as saying: “Yes I made gas deals with Israel. We
have a lot of gas in Egypt and can export it. I made an agreement with Israel which
had political undertones, [...]. As for sending gas to Spain — well I owe them, because
they gave me Spanish citizenship and welcomed me and my family.”°

There is no contemporary evidence that Mr Salem was involved in the negotiations
for or the execution or the performance of the SPA; nor that Mr Salem ever met an
officer or employee of the Claimant (or any of its associated companies). The only
evidence of possible corruption is Mr Salem’s statement contained in the press report

cited above.

That statement is obviously disturbing. However, by itself, it does not implicate the
Claimant in acts of corruption in the negotiations for and execution or performance of
the SPA. The Tribunal decides, on this limited material, that the Respondent has not
discharged its legal burden of proof, again on a balance of probabilities, in regard to

alleged corruption by Mr Salem.

(iii) Mr Yehia El Komy: The Respondent’s case regarding Mr El Komy developed
during these arbitration proceedings, culminating in the documentation and
submissions made by the Respondent pursuant to the Tribunal’s Procedural Orders

Nos 13, 14 and 15 on the “Six Documents” (see Part I above).

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 205 of 347

The Tribunal considers that the Respondent’s case raises serious factual issues that
require consideration at some length of the relevant evidence adduced before this

Tribunal.

The Respondent’s allegations concern Mr El Komy’s relationship with the Claimant
(including the Claimant’s associated companies), Mr Sameh Fahmy (as the Minister
of Petroleum at the time the SPA was executed on 1 August 2000) and, so it seems,
President Mubarak. It is alleged by the Respondent that unnamed persons corruptly
within EGPC or the Ministry procured the SPA with the connivance of UFACEX and

the Claimant (including their associated companies).

Mr El Komy was an Egyptian geological engineer and businessman, working in
Egypt. He had no relevant background in the production and sale of natural gas. Mr El
Komy (with his family) owned and controlled an Egyptian company, the Egyptian
Arab Trading Company formed in 1996 (“EATCO”).”4

Following the Egyptian Revolution in 2011, Mr El Komy was arrested by the
Egyptian authorities. On 27 December 2011, he was convicted of credit fraud and
sentenced to three years’ imprisonment; and on 29 March 2012, he was again
convicted and sentenced to a suspended term of imprisonment and heavily fined for
fraud and corruption.°> None of these charges related to the Claimant, the SPA or the

Damietta Project.

At the Hearing, the Respondent’s Counsel informed the Tribunal that Mr Fahmy and
Mr El Komy were both “under investigation by Egyptian authorities in connection
with the corruption surrounding the Damietta Project and, in particular, the gas price
terms of the [SPA].” °° These investigations appear to have begun in 2015 and remain

pending.”

7.70 As publicly reported from an interview in 2007, Mr El Komy explained his

involvement with the Damietta Project, as follows:**

During this period, [about 1999] I became familiar with Union Fenosa,
which was looking to buy natural gas, so I proposed that they build a plant
to liquefy gas and export it to Spain. I was trying to get a 50% share in
this plant with the Spaniards, but they requested a higher share of the
project, so the shares became 60% for Union Fenosa and 40% for me. I
submitted the project to the government, which approved it because it was
profitable and brought new technology for the first time into Egypt.

[J

I have not completely withdrawn from the Project, but rather I have sold
my share in it and kept a share in the Spanish Union Fenosa, but only a
small share. My departure was due to disagreements about a number of
points inside the Project, including the project site. I would have preferred
it to be in Idku, because if we had built the plant in Idku, we would have
benefitted from the Brent gas fields in the area.

[J

Then we faced another point of disagreement, which was choosing the
contractor. Fenosa preferred the Japanese company Chiyoda over the
American company Kellogg, which is a subsidiary of Halliburton [sic: it
was in fact the other way around], despite there being a difference in cost
of around USD 50 million more to be paid to the American company.

[J

I faced pressure that led me to sell my 40% share of the Project, as the
Government wanted to increase the capital of the Project since the
Project’s investments were valued at USD 400 million. With the increase, I
was asked to pay USD 160 million at the time, and obstacles were placed
in front of me. I felt that the Government was pressuring me to withdraw
from the Project.

[J

Q: Did you propose the Damietta Project to Dr Hamdi el Banbi when he
was Minister of Petroleum and he refised it, as is rumored?

A: No, I did not propose the Project to him. Talk about the Project began
in 1999 when Engineer Sameh Fahmy became the minister.

Q: What are the facts behind your relationship with the father of the
current Minister of Petroleum Sameh Fahmy? Was he a partner of yours
in one of your petroleum projects?

A: The father of the Petroleum Minister had a consulting office, and he
prepared the study for the oil refinery that I established in 10P th P [sic]
of Ramadan City. However, that goes back to about 1995 only. He didn’t
participate as a partner with me in the crude oil refining company, but he
held 300 membership shares as a member of the company’s board of
directors only.

From this evidence, as also confirmed by other materials, the Tribunal concludes that
Mr El Komy had a prior business relationship with Mr Sameh Fahmy’s father in or
about 1995, but none with Mr Sameh Fahmy personally as at 1999 onwards. Although
Mr El Komy’s experience did not include natural gas projects before the SPA, the
Tribunal accepts that both he and EATCO had some professional and business

experience with oil and petrochemical projects.”

The Respondent contends that the Claimant (with its associated companies), with Mr
El Komy as an intermediary, corrupted unnamed person(s) in order to procure the
SPA for UFACEX during the period from January 2000 to 1 August 2000. Despite
the juxtaposition of his name, there is no specific allegation from the Respondent that
such corrupt persons included the Minister of Petroleum at the time, Mr Sameh

Fahmy, personally.

The Respondent’s case against the Claimant, its associated companies, Mr El Komy
and EATCO turns on a succession of inferences drawn from contemporary
documentation, as now known to the Respondent. The Tribunal considers each of
these documents separately, before considering the Respondent’s allegations as a

whole.

This contemporary documentation comprises the “Six Documents” (in fact, seven)

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 208 of 347

In the Tribunal’s view, the relevant document is Mr El Komy’s attached fax message.
It evidences an earlier meeting of 10 January 2000 between Mr El Komy and others
regarding “the Spanish company interest” to construct a plant using Egyptian natural
gas; and it refers to a prospective meeting on 23 January 2000 with the Minister of
Petroleum (then, Mr Sameh Fahmy). The Tribunal sees nothing in this fax evidencing
any corrupt purpose. Its contents are consistent with Mr El Komy’s description of
himself as a substantive business partner of the Claimant and its associated

companies, rather than a mere broker or agent.

These were early days for the Damietta Project, with much to be settled even as a
proposal to be formulated by UFACEX. The reference to “initial approval of the
Egyptian Government” could not therefore be an actual “approval,” but rather only
initial support for the eventual Damietta Project (whatever it might be). There was a
later meeting with the Minister attended by Mr El Komy and Union Fenosa during the
latter’s visit to Egypt from 26 to 30 January 2000. The UFACEX memorandum is of

that meeting consistent with the Tribunal’s finding. !°

(ii) The Minutes of the UFACEX internal meeting of 2 March 2000:'

At this meeting, the participants discussed a draft Memorandum of Understanding
with EATCO, in two different versions. The first treated EATCO “simply as an agent
activating the project.” The second treated EATCO as “more of an investor partner.”

The choice required further agreement with EATCO.

These were, again, early days in the relationship between the Claimant (UFACEX)
and Mr El Komy and EATCO. It is clear that Mr El Komy was thought to have
sufficient experience with sufficient resources to be an “investor partner,” as he was
to be. The reference to EATCO’s alternative role as an “agent” is not, by itself proof
of any corrupt intent. There is nothing suspicious about UFACEX’s need to discuss

the forms of the agreement with Mr El Komy.

It was one of many contracts between these parties in what had
become a complicated project, with multiple parties executing different legal
agreements at different times. In the Tribunal’s view, whilst its terms were generous
to EATCO, this agreement is consistent with Mr El Komy’s role as an investor and
business partner in the Damietta Project. It is not proof, by itself, of any corrupt

activity by the Claimant, Mr El Komy or EATCO.

The Tribunal notes that the choice

of site for the Damietta Project was important: the LNG facilities situated at Damietta
would not have access to its own gas field, but would be dependent on the

Respondent’s national grid for its supply of natural gas.

The Tribunal considers that this agreement means what it states. It is inconsistent with
any reward for corrupt acts by Mr El Komy and EATCO. The Tribunal sees no reason
to treat the terms as a disguise for nefarious conduct by any of the parties. Even if one

or more the parties misreported the sale price of SEGAS’ shares to the Cairo Stock

Exchange (as the Respondent contends), by itself, that delinquency does not evidence

corruption in regard to the SPA, as alleged by the Respondent.

In the Tribunal’s

view, as with the earlier exiting agreements of April-May 2002, this agreement does

not evidence corrupt acts by the Claimant, Mr El Komy or EATCO.

Ostensibly, this agreement terminates the Claimant’s relationship with Mr El Komy.
However, if not (as the Respondent contends), it evidences only a residual
relationship between the Claimant, Mr El Komy and EATCO in limited terms similar
Its

a

io
financial terms were certainly not ungenerous. However, again, the Tribunal cannot
see this agreement as evidencing corrupt acts of the Claimant, Mr El Komy or

EATCO in regard to the SPA.

Many of these agreements contain “confidentiality” clauses, from which the
Respondent draws malign inferences. In the Tribunal’s view, that practice is not
unusual for transnational commercial agreements. It is not therefore proof, by itself,

that contractual parties have guilty minds with something to hide.

The Respondent also drew further inferences from the “economical truth” employed
by the Claimant, particularly its change in emphasis in describing Mr El Komy’s role
in the Damietta Project during the course of this arbitration. Faced with allegations of

corruption pleaded by the Respondent in this arbitration, the Claimant’s reticence is

perhaps comprehensible. In any event, it was not, in the Tribunal’s view, the sign of

guilty minds by the Claimant (or its counsel).

The Respondent also criticised Mr Fernandez Martinez (of SEGAS) for limiting his
testimony to exclude or limit his involvement with Mr El Komy, ;
PY With hindsight, Mr Fernandez Martinez might well

have been more forthcoming about his role in regard to that agreement. However, the
Tribunal cannot fault him for misrepresenting his testimony to this Tribunal (as
alleged by the Respondent), neither in writing nor in answers to questions at the

Hearing, where he was cross-examined by the Respondent.

The Tribunal has already taken note that the several payments received by Mr El
Komy and EATCO in regard to the Damietta Project seem generous. However, it is

not for this Tribunal to second-gues

 

, long after the events, upon what conditions the
Claimant (with its associated companies) should have paid for the work of Mr El
Komy and EATCO. Over a period of some two years, Mr El Komy, as an “investor-
partner” provided personal services for the Damietta Project; and EATCO also made
contributions to the Project. For example, EATCO took part in the preparation of the

responsible for the proposal from Chiyoda and APCI for the EPC contract;'! it

Port Authority for SEGAS’ work in December 2000 and March 2001;!!4 and it
participated in the handover from the Damietta Port Authority to SEGAS of the land
plot and jetty in April 2001.!'° The reward for all this was a commercial matter for
negotiation and agreement between the parties at the time. In the Tribunal’s view, the
several payments received by Mr El Komy and EATCO, by themselves, do not

support any necessary inference that they formed part of a corrupt scheme relating to

the SPA. The Tribunal also notes that the relations between the Claimant (with
SEGAS) and Mr El Komy (with EATCO), as originally envisaged, were prematurely
brought to an end in mid-2002. Accordingly, the payments originally agreed between

these parties reflected an intent to form a much longer relationship.

The Respondent also submits that the SPA was executed by EGPC in breach of its
own procedures as regards a public bid.'!* Mr Ahmed Shaaban testified that EGPC,
during the SPA’s negotiations with UFACEX was “negotiating in its own name and
independently;” and that he was not aware “of any instructions given by the Ministry

[of Petroleum].”!!”

In the Tribunal’s view, even if correct, this breach can support no inference of
corruption by the Claimant in circumstances where the SPA was approved in draft by
the Egyptian Council of Ministers and, after its execution, “endorsed” by the Minister
of Petroleum. Moreover, the SPA was thereafter amended several times. If there had
been any breach of procedures in first signing the SPA, it would be odd that such a
breach was not later identified by EGPC (later EGAS) and acted upon before agreeing

to such amendments. It never was.

Thus far, the Tribunal has considered these materials individually, together with the
related testimony adduced in writing and orally at the Hearing. The Tribunal
concludes that, taken individually, the Respondent has not proven its case on the basis
of inferences drawn from these materials, including the “Six Documents.” It is,
however, necessary for the Tribunal to stand back from these individual factors,

assessed separately, so as to consider the Respondent’s allegations more broadly.

As to the source of funds for the Damietta Project, there is no evidence that Mr El
Komy provided any significant capital. Mr El Komy’s fax message of 20 January
2000 (Document (i) above) records his expectation that “the Spanish company will
fund the company completely and will be able to utilize all LNG produced” (emphasis
supplied). Whilst UFACEX’s internal memorandum dated 28 January 2000 notes Mr

El Komy’s offer to secure “financial capacity,” it confirms that Mr El Komy “expects

that we [UFG] provide financing and markets.”!!*

From the evidence before this Tribunal, it does not appear that Mr El Komy provided

any funding net of what he received, or was due to receive, from the Claimant

IT so. 21
U$ 2.87 million he paid in as capital (quite apart from he iT
ee. Nor was Mr El Komy contemplated as a customer for

production from the Damietta Plant; nor was he in fact.

The Tribunal concludes that the Claimant’s choice of Mr El Komy as a local partner
for the Damietta Project cannot be explained on the basis that Mr El Komy (with

EATCO) was a net source of capital for the project.

As to the expertise of Mr El Komy and EATCO, neither appear to have brought any
particular specialist expertise to the project. Mr El Komy was trained as a geological
engineer; but it is undisputed that he had no personal expertise or experience in the
LNG industry. It is also far from clear that he had had any extensive business

experience in the petroleum industry more widely in regard to major projects.

UFACEX’s internal memorandum dated 28 January 2000 reporting on the early
dis

 

ions with Mr El Komy cites three categories of experience: he is “currently the
leading company in a joint venture [...] whose purpose is to build ‘a State of the art
used lube oil refining facility and blending lube oil plant in the new satellite industrial
city east of Cairo’ called Tenth of Ramadan”; he is “currently pursuing a number of
oil concessions in the Gulf of Suez; and he “is developing together with other partners
the Suez Petrochemical Company (SPC) Project, consisting in the production of

vil

polyethylene and polypropylene.”!!° As can be seen, all three are prospective projects.

The first project appears to have been a low-level motor oil recycling venture. It was

eventually established sometime before 2007, according to the press interview Mr El

Komy gave that year;!?° that it was still in the future as of January 2000 is confirmed
by the agreement dated 9 May 2000 between Mr El Komy, Mr Omar El-Komy and
Mr El Maatawy:!?! “[EATCO] is currently establishing an oil refinery factory.” The
third project appears to be the methanol-to-olefins project mentioned in the press
report of January 2002,'”? as something that EATCO Petrochemical Company “is to
have,” but that, as of Mr El Komy’s 2007 interview, was still being worked on but

123

lacked funding.

7.98 The MOU dated 9 March 2000 between the Claimant and Mr El Komy seems to
recognise this situation. It notes (in the present tense) that Mr El Komy “is also
investing in several projects in oil and petrochemical sector.”!74 In his 2007 press
interview, Mr El Komy states that at some time after working as an engineer in Libya,
he bought an oil field services company.'?5 However, EATCO appears to have added
oil field services and oil and gas investments to its authorised company activities only

in 2001, towards the end of Mr El Komy’s active relationship with the Claimant. '?°

7.99 Thus, although the MOU dated 9 March 2000 records that Mr El Komy “has been
rendering advisory and 2 ance services in Egypt for many years;”!?” and i

El Komy’s relevant experience was limited and recent. It would appear to have been

acquired in 1999-2000 only.

 

7.100 The Tribunal concludes the Mr El Komy’s professional expertise (with EATCO)
cannot explain the Claimant’s choice of Mr El Komy as a local partner for the

Damietta Project.

As to access to senior decision-makers, the evidence for an explanation is stronger.
Access to government power can be a valuable asset to bring to a project involving
the purchase of natural resources from the State or State entity, particularly when such
natural resources comprise highly regulated sectors of the economy controlled by the
State. Different States have a variety of standards governing the propriety of taking
advantage of such access; lobbying can take many forms; and a paid lobbyist is not

necessarily committing a crime or other impropriety.

In the Tribunal’s view, Mr El Komy was chosen by the Claimant primarily to act as a
lobbyist with access to senior figures in EGPC and the Ministry of Petroleum. That is
not, by itself, evidence of corruption. The factual question is whether Mr El Komy

was more than a lobbyist, on the evidence adduced before this Tribunal.

The Claimant denies that Mr El Komy offered any advantages from special access to
the Respondent’s decision-makers in regard to the SPA. Indeed, the Claimant goes to
great pains to stress the absence of any special relationship between Mr El Komy and
Minister Fahmy, pleading that “this so-called ‘fact’ is nothing of the sort,” and that
“Egypt has provided no evidence whatsoever that anyone exercised any back-channel

influence.” !”?

he Claimant’s explanation for why it chose Mr El Komy as a business partner, as
pleaded in its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, is that: “[t]he project was the original idea of
El-Komy;”; that “he conceived of the idea and [...] [w]ithout his ‘first mover’
participation, the Project would not have been initiated and moved forward;” and that
“he was the person who initially brought the proposal to Union Fenosa.” The
Claimant alleges that Mr El Komy himself “decided to establish an LNG facility in
Egypt” and agreed, not only to share the opportunity with claimant, but also to the

“relinquishment of equal control in the Project.” '*°

In the Tribunal’s view, the evidence adduced in this arbitration does not support the

Claimant’s explanation.

In his witness statement, Mr Fernandez Martinez (of SEGAS), who was responsible

for overseeing the Damietta Project, testified that: “[b]y 1999, Union Fenosa had been

assessing several options to secure long-term gas supply [...] [and it] was at that time
that Union Fenosa heard of an opportunity to develop an LNG project in Egypt”
(emphasis supplied). He also testified that the Claimant “decided to explore this
possibility and several executives met with the Egyptian Minister of Petroleum in

November or December of 1999.”!3!

The Tribunal infers that the Project was conceived by Union Fenosa in 1999, before
Mr El Komy became involved with the Claimant in early 2000. He did not bring the
project to the Claimant. The Tribunal also infers that the project had been the subject
of previous development on the Claimant’s behalf by other, qualified persons. One or

more of these persons later brought Mr El Komy into their discussions.

The Tribunal accepts, as the Claimant’s Rejoinder pleads, that “Mr El-Komy and
EATCO [...] were from the outset viewed as necessary to the Project.”'>* The

question is “why.”

Mr El Komy and EATCO were not passive or secretive participants in the Damietta
Project. He openly identified himself (with EATCO) and was publicly identified with
UFACEX from the outset of his involvement in the Project with UFACEX. He did
not act as a covert peddler of influence, with his principal’s identity kept hidden from
the Respondent’s decision-makers. To this extent, the Tribunal accepts the Claimant’s
submission that no evidence exists, in this arbitration, of any “back-channel
influence.” However, the Tribunal does not accept that there was no “influence.” It
concludes that there was influence exercised by Mr El Komy over senior decision-
makers at the Ministry of Petroleum and EGPC over the SPA; but that it was not

corrupt.

This conclusion is supported by three factors. First, the Respondent’s case does not
prove that any monies passed from Mr El Komy or EATCO to any senior decision-
maker. There was, on the evidence adduced before this Tribunal, no bribe paid or
promised to any such decision-maker. Mr El Komy and EATCO were well-rewarded
for their involvement in the Damietta Project. However, in the absence of corruption

and as already indicated, it is not for this Tribunal to second-guess, with hindsight and

the lapse of time, commercial decisions that were made by the Claimant towards Mr

El Komy that may now seem mistakenly generous.

Second, the relevant events occurred more than fifteen years ago. Although Mr El
Komy was prosecuted and convicted for other crimes in Egypt, it is significant that he
has never been prosecuted by the Respondent for criminal conduct in regard to the
SPA. Nor has any senior decision-maker at EGPC or the Ministry of Petroleum

(including Minister Fahmy) been prosecuted in regard to the SPA.

Third, the belated plea of corruption, raised by the Respondent as a jurisdictional
objection after the commencement of this arbitration, raises a suspicion that the plea
serves a convenient tactical purpose. This suggestion is strengthened by the weakness
of the Respondent’s two other pleas relating to Halliburton and Mr Hussein Salem,
both of which seemed only to serve a tactical purpose in seeking to defeat or delay the
Claimant’s claims against the Respondent. These two pleas should not have been

made by the Respondent based on the materials presented by it to the Tribunal.

Nonetheless, contrary to the Claimant’s submissions, the Respondent and its legal
representatives should not be criticised for raising its allegations of corruption in this
arbitration in regard to Mr El Komy. These allegations were not frivolous. Several
were classic “red flags”; but even the reddest of red flags does not suffice without
proof of corruption before the tribunal. Whilst it can be relatively easy to allege
corruption, it is less easy to prove it, as observed in the Metal-Tech award (2013).!3
Suspicion is not equivalent to proof. Unanswered queries may have innocent
explanations, not amounting (in the absence of explanations) to proof of corruption.
With hindsight, what business people agree not infrequently defies logic or common-
sense to non-business people, again without amounting to proof of corruption. The
legal burden of proving corruption rests upon the party alleging corruption; and it is
not discharged by placing the burden on the adverse party to prove the absence of

corruption.

Moreover, with a case dependent upon circumstantial evidence (as in the present

case), it is often a question of joining up the dots; but there have first to be dots in the

83 Metal-Tech v. Uzbekistan, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award, 4 October 2013, [RL-0002].

evidence adduced before the tribunal. In this case, so the Tribunal decides, there are

insufficient dots; and the red flags are outnumbered by neutral black flags.

Lastly, the Tribunal has read the Final Award dated 21 December 2017 issued in the
CRCICA arbitration (896), as submitted in these arbitration proceedings by the
Claimant and the subject of written comments by the Respondent. The CRCICA
tribunal there dismissed a similar plea of corruption made by EGAS as the respondent
against the Claimant as the claimant. It is apparent that the CRCICA tribunal received
more evidential materials from the parties (including specific oral testimony) than
were adduced by the Parties in this arbitration. Moreover, given that the parties in the
CRCICA arbitration are not both the same as the Parties to this arbitration, the
Tribunal has thought it right to pay no regard to the CRCICA tribunal’s analysis or
decision in its award. The Tribunal has therefore not done so for the purpose of this
Award. Nor has this Tribunal thought it appropriate to take into account evidence
adduced before the CRICA tribunal (as recorded in its award). Such evidence is not
evidence in this arbitration between different parties. Nonetheless, having reached its
conclusion on the Parties’ submissions and evidential materials in this arbitration, the
Tribunal draws some comfort that its conclusion appears to be consistent with the

decision of the CRICICA tribunal.
(5) Summary of Decisions

The Tribunal finds, as facts relevant to jurisdiction (with admissibility) and the merits,
that there was no evidence of corruption against the Claimant (including UFACEX) in
regard to the SPA proven by the Respondent in this arbitration, where the Respondent

bore the legal burden of proving its allegations on a balance of probabilities.

For all the reasons stated above, the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent’s three

allegations of corruption by the Claimant in regard to the SPA.

PART VIII: THE NECESSITY ISSUES
(1) Introduction
8.1 The Tribunal addresses here the defence of necessity under customary international
law pleaded by the Respondent to preclude its international responsibility for the

alleged international wrongs under the Treaty towards the Claimant, particularly

under the FET standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty. The Treaty does not contain any

 

specific provision on the defence of neces

 

ity.

8.2. Under customary international law, necessity is one of the circumstances that the
State can invoke to preclude the wrongfulness of an act in breach of an international

obligation of that State, including a breach of its obligations under a bilateral treaty.

8.3. The conditions to invoke a plea of necessity under international are confirmed in

Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. | It provides as follows:

1. Necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding the
wrongfilness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation
of that State unless the act:

(a) is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a
grave and imminent peril; and

(b) does not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States
towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community as a
whole.

2. In any case, necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for
precluding wrongfulness if:

(a) the international obligation in question excludes the possibility of
invoking necessity; or

(b) the State has contributed to the situation of necessity.

8.4 Article 25 was cited by both Parties in this arbitration. Thus, the Tribunal is content to

apply its terms, as explained by the ILC’s commentary.”

(2) The Respondent’s Case

8.5 In summary, the Respondent invokes the state of necessity as an alternative defence in
the event that the Tribunal were to find that the alleged acts committed by the
Respondent, or by EGAS or EGPG attributable to the Respondent, breached its

obligations under the Treaty.>

8.6 Such a defence was recognized in Gabcikovo-Nagymaros (1997), on which the
Claimant also relies, and in Continental Casualty v. Argentina (2008).4 The
Respondent submits that the conditions for the defence of necessity in Article 25 of
the ILC Articles are fulfilled in the present case.* Its case falls under the following

several headings.

8.7. Prioritisation: The Respondent asserts that the prioritisation of the domestic
electricity was the only way to safeguard Egypt’s essential interests from a grave and

imminent peril.°

Argentina (2011); and also from the Zimbabwean political crisis:
Zimbabwe (2015). In these cases, the ICSID tribunals decided that an “essential
interest” of a State and its “existence” extend (inter alia) to the social, economic,
financial and political interests of the State. Thus, contrary to the Claimant’s case,
such an interest includes the maintenance of the State’s public order and stability, as

well as the maintenance of its basic services.’ The Respondent notes in this regard

that the Jmpregilo tribunal decided that water and sewage services qualified as an

essential interest within the meaning of Article 25 of the ILC Articles.*

Drawing a parallel analysis with these decisions, the Respondent submits that the
reasons that were absent in Von Pezold v. Zimbabwe (2015) (as to which the tribunal
found that there was no threat to Zimbabwe’s essential interests) are clearly present in
this case.° Unlike Von Pezold v. Zimbabwe (2015), the Respondent's essential interest
in maintaining stability, security and internal peace was threatened because the

situation in Egypt.

That situation, so the Respondent submits: “(i) reached historic levels of violence, (ii)
was out of control due to riots and clashes across the country, (iii) could not be
brought under control by police or otherwise, (iv) reached a level far beyond a threat
solely to the party in power in Egypt, and (v) constituted a threat to the basic
functioning of society and the maintenance of internal stability.”' All this caused a
dramatic drop in the supply of natural gas both internally and for exportation. That led
to repeated blackouts across the country and consequently to more widespread

violence and unrest.!'

The Respondent submits that all these factors, on which other tribunals have relied in
deciding the same issue of necessity, demonstrate that a “grave and imminent peril”
was present in the present case.!? The Respondent contests the Claimant’s
understanding of the term “immediate” and “proximate” as misleading. It wrongly

limits the peril to physical proximity.

Relying on the same case as the Claimant, namely the decision in Gabcikovo-
Nagymaros (1997), the Respondent emphasises that the ICJ decided that “a ‘peril’
appearing in the long term might be held to be ‘imminent’ as soon as it is established,

at the relevant point in time, that the realization of that peril, however far off it might

be, [is] certain and inevitable.” The Respondent contends that this approach applies to
the present case with respect to the risk of total blackouts that would have “certainly
and inevitably” occurred, had the Respondent not prioritised the needs of domestic

users in Egypt.

The Respondent also asserts, contrary to the Claimant’s suggestions, that the
prioritisation of gas supply to domestic needs was “the only way” to maintain public
order and basic services, as “the electricity sector in Egypt was largely dependent on
natural gas to fuel it.”'* If the Respondent had acted otherwise, it “would thus have
led to more numerous and prolonged blackouts, and even more severe accompanying
violent protests and demonstrations, further aggravating the perilous security
situation.”

The Respondent emphasises that a “balanced” interpretation of this factor is required,
otherwise it would be “virtually impossible” for a State successfully to invoke the

was the only way to respond to the situation, does not bar the State from invoking the

Spain: The Respondent submits that the prioritisation of the domestic electricity did
not impair an essential interest of the State towards which the obligation exists under
the Treaty, i.e. Spain.'? The Respondent asserts that its “essential interest in providing

the Claimant’s assertions in this regard fail to prove that Spain had an “essential
interest” in Egyptian gas and that such assertions had no support in the Ministry of

Petroleum’s statement invoked by the Claimant.?!

8.16 Citing the /mpregilo award (with several other awards that adopted the same
reasoning), the Respondent contends that the interests of one or more foreign
investors do not amount to essential interests of their home State for the purposes of
Article 25 of the ILC Articles.?? The Respondent also contends that the present case
does not involve any erga omnes international obligations, unlike Von Pezold v.

Zimbabwe (2015).7>

possibility for either State to rely on the defence of necessity.”

of the ILC Articles “must be sufficiently substantial and not merely incidental or

to the Egyptian revolution that was beyond its control and resulted in the overthrow of

President Mubarak’s regime.?”

basis for the determination of such contribution.”* The Respondent contends that the
Claimant’s assertions are misleading; the Claimant fails to demonstrate “a direct link”
between the Respondent’s policies and the economic and political crisis during the
Egyptian revolution.”” The Respondent further submits that it repeatedly tried to
control the situation, but the revolution left the Respondent with no discretion as to its

policies for the supply of gas to domestic users.*?

8.20 Compensation: The Respondent challenges the Claimant’s submission that the
Claimant is nonetheless entitled to compensation even if the necessity defence was
made out by the Respondent. That submission finds no support in the legal materials
upon which the Claimant relies. Rather, so the Respondent submits, these materials
merely provide for the possibility of compensation; it is not a requirement.*! Also,
there is no such compensation to investors or for investments required under the

Treaty.*? The Respondent contends that the Claimant must “bear the risk of the state

of necessity and its consequences and be denied the compensation it requests,”** as in

LG&E y. Argentina (2006) where the tribunal decided to the same effect.*4
8.21 In conclusion, the Respondent reiterates that:

[T]he state of necessity caused by the revolution that erupted in Egypt and
whose after-effects persist to this day precludes any wrongfulness of the
conduct alleged to constitute a violation of the Spain-Egypt BIT even if,
quod non, the conduct complained of were attributable to Respondent,
constituted an exercise of ‘puissance publique’ and were not in conformity
with obligations under the Spain-Egypt BIT.*°

(i) there was no essential interest of Egypt that was threatened by a grave
and imminent danger that required cutting off the gas supply to UFG; (ii)
Egypt's decision to prioritize the domestic market and to cut off all gas
supply to UFG was not the ‘only way’ to safeguard any purported
‘essential interest’ from a ‘grave and imminent threat’; and (iii) the
Respondent ‘contributed to the situation of necessity’ by adopting policies
that inflated demand for natural gas and depressed supply, thereby
directly causing its own gas shortages, and then it chose to cut off all gas
supply to UFG and failed to treat it proportionally to other commercial
and industrial customers. In addition, Spain itself has an interest in the
gas supply provided by UFG from Egypt, and that interest was impaired
by Egypt’s conduct.*°

The Claimant submits that, since the defence of necessity is a ground precluding the
wrongfulness of an act violating an international obligation, by invoking the state of

necessity the Respondent concedes that its acts

 

alleged by the Claimant are
wrongful.*” In support of this submission, the Claimant refers to the ICJ’s reasoning
in Gabcikovo-Nagymaros (1997), as well as several ICSID awards to the same

effect.**

As to the ILC Commentary on Article 25 of the ILC Articles and Gabcikovo-
Nagymaros (1997), the Claimant submits that necessity is an exceptional defence; and
that is subject to “stringent” conditions to avoid abuse. According to the Claimant,
this is reflected in the negative wording of Article 25 but also in the “only way”
requirement and the safeguard of an “essential” interest from a grave and imminent

peril.*°

The Claimant further submits that the Respondent should bear the legal burden of
proving the existence of a condition of necessity. It is a cumulative multi-element
standard. Accordingly, failing to satisfy any element should negate the application of

the defence of necessity. The Respondent has failed to prove any of these multiple

elements.*° In support of its submissions, the Claimant relies upon several awards
where tribunals have rejected the defence of necessity. The Claimant notes in this
regard that most of the cases that the Respondent invoked for its case did not in fact

find in favour of the defence of necessity.*!

Addressing the cumulative requirements of Article 25 of the ILC Articles, the
Claimant contends that the Respondent did not prove that the Egyptian revolution
constituted a grave threat to an essential interest; nor did the Respondent demonstrate
the causal link between the situation trigged by the revolution and the breaches of the
Treaty.” In particular, the Claimant submits that the Respondent has failed to prove
that cutting off the gas supply to the Plant was necessary to safeguard an essential
interest against a grave and imminent peril, i.e. to address the blackouts and the
violence such blackouts allegedly generated or to avoid even further violence.
According to the Claimant, the Respondent’s assertions are not proven on the

evidence adduced in this arbitration.

The Claimant contends that EGAS announced the reduction in the gas supply to the
Plant a year before the revolution began. Such reductions were the result of
“misguided” policies that caused an imbalance between the demand for and the
supply of gas in Egypt.4 Therefore, cutting off the gas supply to the Plant was

intended by the Respondent to address gas shortages and not blackouts.“

In addition, the Claimant submits that the revolution relates to a political crisis mainly
pertaining to the Mubarak and Morsi regimes and that the widespread protests, as
described by the Respondent, did not impact the Plant at Damietta. Thus, there was no

“imminent” or “proximate” danger relevant to the gas supply to the Plant.

Accordingly, the Respondent’s defence of necessity is unfounded and cannot excuse

the Respondent’s failure to comply with its obligations under the Treaty.*°

Further, the Claimant contends that cutting off the gas supply was not the “only way”
to safeguard the Respondent’s essential interest in maintaining public order and
providing basic services against a grave and imminent peril allegedly threatened by

the violent protests and the blackouts during the Egyptian revolution.

According to the Claimant, the Respondent had other alternatives. Citing Sempra v.
Argentina (2007), CMS v. Argentina (2005) and AWG vy. Argentina (2010), the
Claimant notes that the Tribunal does not need to determine policy alternatives that
the Respondent could have adopted. Rather, the Tribunal should only determine

whether the policy adopted was the only way to remedy the situation.4”
To that end, the Claimant submits that:

Egypt and EGAS could have set aside and provided for the warranted
supply — and the promised back-up supply — for the Claimant as
contracted. The Respondent could also have bought gas abroad and
supplied the Claimant; or at least it could have supplied [the Claimant]
proportionately with supplies to other users, as required by the SPA.
Finally, and at a minimum, [the Respondent] could have compensated [the
Claimant] for its costs of obtaining a replacement supply for [its
requirements in] Spain. But [the] Respondent took none of these actions,
preferring instead to force the full consequences of [its] decisions onto [the
Claimant], a foreign investor, whilst privileging other domestic
industries.**

In support of a strict interpretation of the “only way” requirement in Article 25(1)(a)
of the ILC Articles, the Claimant relies on the reasoning of the LG&E tribunal and the
commentary to Article 25 on State Responsibility. Both confirm, so it submits, that
the defence of necessity cannot be invoked if other means were available, even if they

were “more costly or less convenient.” That was the case here for the Respondent.”

8.33. The Claimant opposes the Respondent’s argument for a “balanced” interpretation of
the requirement for necessity, relying on the ICSID ad hoc committee’s decision in
Enron vy. Argentina (2010). In fact, so the Claimant contends, the “only way” being a
“reasonable probability requirement”, was one of the issues which the ICSID ad hoc

committee decided not to answer.*°

8.34 Based on the testimony of its expert witnesses, the Claimant contends that the
Respondent contributed to its alleged situation of necessity through its “ill-advised”
and “inadequate” gas policies that caused a demand-supply imbalance, hence the gas
supply shortages and the Respondent’s failure to comply with its obligations towards
the Claimant.*! In support of this assertion, the Claimant relies on the Jmpregilo

1.

tribunal’s decision to similar effect.°” The Claimant further asserts that the gas supply

shortages had an impact on Spain’s interest to provide gas for its citizens.**

8.35 The Claimant contends that the Respondent’s failure to comply with its obligations
persisted even after the alleged period of necessity. That continued failure does not
conform to the requirements of Article 25 of the ILC Articles, as it has been
recognized by several arbitral tribunals deciding the same issue.** The Claimant
contends that the Respondent provided no evidence as to the continuation of any

situation of necessity.**

8.36 Lastly, the Claimant submits that even if the defence of necessity were accepted by
the Tribunal, it could not relieve the Respondent from its obligation to compensate the
Claimant under the Treaty. The Claimant submits that such compensation is required
in Article 27 of the ILC Article. It is further confirmed in the ILC Commentary to the
ILC Articles, as well as the ICJ decision in Gabcikovo-Nagymaros (1997) and the
ICSID tribunal’s in EDF vy. Argentina (2012).*°

(4) The Tribunal’s Analyses and Decisions

8.37. The Respondent pleads “necessity” as an alternative defence to its primary case
denying any liability to the Claimant under the Treaty. It is none the worse for that. It
deserves to be addressed upon its own terms, however inconsistent it may be with the
Respondent’s primary case. Alternative cases are invariably inconsistent with primary

cases; the latter should not infect the former; nor vice-versa.

8.38 The Tribunal decides that the Respondent bears the legal burden of proving its
defence of “necessity” under customary international law, as a positive allegation.
Moreover, the elements of that defence, as listed in Article 25 of the ILC Articles, are
cumulative. In other words, it is for the Respondent to prove each of the relevant
elements and not for the Claimant to disprove any of them. That is clear from the
negative formulation of Article 25(1) and 25(2) (“may not be invoked”, “unless” and
“if”), together with elements that fall almost exclusively within the actual knowledge
of the State invoking the defence of “necessity.” This approach also accords with the
ILC’s Commentary applicable to Article 25 of the ILC Articles: see Chapter V at

Comment (8) and Comment (14) on Article 25.57

8.39 The first element is listed in Article 25(1) of the ILC Articles as “the wrongfulness of
an act not in conformity with an international obligation” of the State. Applied to the
present case, that “act” is the Respondent’s alleged breach of the Treaty’s FET
standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty. That breach allegedly consisted of the
Respondent’s interference with the supply of gas by EGAS to the Plant, thereby
frustrating the Claimant’s legitimate expectations based upon the Respondent’s
undertaking in the Ministry of Petroleum’s letter dated 5 August 2000 issued pursuant
to Article 21.1 of the SPA (as explained later in this Award).

8.40 That interference began before 2010 (i.e. before the Global Financial Crisis and the
Egyptian revolution). It has continued to the present day. During 2012 and 2013, of a

total gas production in Egypt of 58.8 Bema, only 0.3 Bema was supplied to the Plant.

As already found above, this minimal quantity compares starkly with supplies to the
Respondent’s preferred users of gas: 28.8 Bcma to Power Plants, 14.7 Bema to
industrial users and 5.7 Bcma to the Idku Plant.** There was no attempt by the
Respondent to ensure that the Claimant be treated “no worse,” for an indefinite
period, than any other purchaser of natural gas in Egypt, using the words of Article
15.2 of the SPA.

The second element listed in Article 25(1)(a) relates to “the only way for the State to
safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril.” In the Tribunal’s
view, the application of this second element to the present case raises important issues

of timing.

As the first issue of timing, the Egyptian revolution began during the spring of 2011
(when President Mubarak resigned from office). It was only by EGAS’s letter of
4 February 2013 to the Claimant that any suggestion was made that “the continuing
social and political instability in Egypt” was an event of “force majeure” under the

SPA, followed by EGAS’ formal notice of force majeure on 24 February 2013.

Yet, disruptions in the supply of gas to the Plant had begun in 2006, long before
EGAS’ invocation of force majeure under the SPA in 2013.

By 2012, there were temporary black-outs in Egypt, caused by the lack of electricity.
These were caused by an inadequate national grid and a lack of power generation
capacity, particularly at times of peak demand. This was well-known at the time. As
Professor Medlock testified, “[t]he tightened electricity market balance in Egypt over
the past several years is well documented.”*? This imbalance was in turn caused by
the Respondent’s earlier decisions not to promote the development of gas deposits in
Egypt, not to improve the national grid and not to build more power generating plants,
with a mix of fuels. By 2012, the black-outs required the Respondent to prioritise gas

supplies to generate electricity for consumers.

The Tribunal does not discount the fact of social unrest or the Respondent’s
reasonable concerns that serious unrest might ensue, still less the fact of the Egyptian

revolution beginning in early 2011. Yet, the curtailment of gas to the Damietta Plant

both pre-dated and post-dated the Egyptian revolution. It was not the proximate cause
for curtailing gas supplies to the Plant. That proximate cause lay in the Respondent’s
long-standing policies as to the development of gas deposits, electrical power
generation, the national grid and the preferential use of gas for users and consumers in

Egypt.

In other words, the “act” was not “the only way” for the Respondent “to safeguard an
essential interest against a grave and imminent peril,” using the words in Article
25(1)(a) of the ILC Articles. In contrast to the Claimant and the Damietta Plant, other
commercial users of gas remained preferred by the Respondent. This is confirmed by
the disproportionality in the reductions for delivered gas between the Damietta Plant
and other commercial users in 2012-2013; namely: 12% reductions for Industrial
users (receiving 14.8 Bema), 14% for Power users (28.9 Bema), 14% for Idku (5.7
Bema) and 60% (0.3 Bema) for the Damietta Plant (from a total production of 58.8
Bema); and the Plant’s reduction resulted in a curtailment of 96% in the Claimant’s
contractual volumes for export.®° In 2012-2013, if the “act” had been “the only way,”
it would have been equally necessary for the Respondent to curtail supplies to other
commercial users to a similarly minimal level as the Damietta Plant and the Claimant.

That was not done.

As to the second timing issue, the Egyptian revolution had ceased by 2015. Yet, the
resumption of gas supplies to the Plant did not then take place; nor has any such
resumption taken place to date. As confirmed by the ILC’s commentary on Article 27,

the defence of necessity under international law lapses “if and to the extent that the

In these circumstances, the Tribunal finds that the non-supply of gas to the Plant was
not attributable to the Egyptian revolution or social unrest; nor was it begun or
maintained as the only way to safeguard the Respondent’s essential interest against a

grave and imminent peril, within the meaning of Article 25 of the ILC Articles.

The third element listed in Article 25(1)(a) relates to an “essential interest” against a
grave and imminent peril. In the Tribunal’s view, for present purposes, the
Respondent’s relevant interest under Article 25 at the material time lay, not in the

maintenance of public safety, but in the shortage of gas in Egypt.

That shortage originated in the Respondent’s long-standing policies of subsidising
domestic users of gas and electricity, together with a statement of policy (but not

actual practice) to encourage the finding of gas deposits in Egypt.

These events had begun in the late 1990s, following the discovery of natural gas
deposits off the Egyptian coast. It led to a public statement of policy by the
Respondent to develop the use of natural gas as a substitute for liquid fuels in several
economic sectors.©? To encourage that use, the Respondent promoted the use of gas in
the electricity sectors of the Egyptian economy; and it subsidised users of natural gas,

both as gas itself and gas as a means of generating electricity.

As to the statement of policy intended to encourage new discoveries of natural gas,
the Respondent did not later translate that statement into policies sufficient to attract
producers to discover and develop new natural gas fields. There was sufficient gas in
existing fields and proven reserves to meet demand, at least up to 2017.°4 From 2000
to 2008, however, with the rise in oil prices, the Respondent introduced a price cap for
all-natural gas agreements.® Even when the costs to producers significantly increased

from 2004 onwards, the Respondent maintained the price cap.

The result was an imbalance between the supply and demand of Egyptian gas. It was
well established by 2006, as an increasing trend.®’ This was well known at the time.
Later, as already recited in Part V above, on 24 March 2014, the Minister of

Petroleum, subsequently Prime Minister (Mr Sherif Ismail) acknowledged that a

contributing factor to such imbalance had been the “irrational” consumption of

Egyptian gas due to “subsidy.”**

As to gas subsidy, when it was eventually reformed by the Respondent in 2014, the
World Bank calculated in 2015 that the reform had already yielded cost savings
equivalent to 3.3% of Egypt’s GDP.

As to gas supply, the imbalance could not be swiftly corrected, even if the Respondent
had been minded to do so. There is a significant time lag between the first discovery
of a new gas field and its first commercial production, particularly for offshore fields.
For onshore fields, according to testimony from Mr Davison and Mr Walkup, the time
lag is about six to seven years and, for offshore fields, about nine years.” Mr
Goncalves testified that it took longer in Egypt, up to 12 years.’! This time lag was

also well-known at the time.

Nonetheless, little or no steps were taken by the Respondent to encourage producers
to discover and develop new gas fields. As a result, Egyptian gas production reached
its apogee in 2009 and then began to flatten.”> This was before the Egyptian

revolution.

In the Tribunal’s view, the imbalance between supply and demand was not caused by
the Egyptian revolution or the Global Financial Crisis. That was not the proximate
cause of the non-supply of gas to the Claimant. The proximate cause was an overall
shortage of Egyptian gas, applied by the Respondent inequitably amongst different
users in Egypt.

Contrary to the Respondent’s submission, that shortage of gas was not the relevant
“essential interest” of the Respondent at the material time, sufficient to justify the
defence of necessity against “a grave and imminent peril” within the meaning of

Article 25 of the ILC Articles.

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 234 of 347

As to the fourth element listed in Article 25(2)(b) of the ILC Articles, the issue arises
whether the Respondent “contributed to the situation of necessity.” In the Tribunal’s
view, this concept does not fit easily with long term macro-economics, such as is

present in this case.

To an extent, a situation of necessity can always be traced back, as a matter of history,
to political and economic mistakes made by a State years, if not decades, earlier. It
may involve the State’s relations with one or more other States, including economic
and political factors lying outside its border (such as the Global Financial Crisis).
Ordinarily, at the time when such mistakes were made, the State may not know of the
consequences of its mistake, still less know that it has even made any mistake.
Accordingly, this element of contribution requires a common-sense interpretation,
placing the contributory event in chronologically proximity to the situation of
necessity. Also, as the ILC Commentary to Article 25 of the ILC Articles states, “the
contribution to the situation of necessity must be sufficiently substantial and not

merely incidental or peripheral.””?

The Tribunal is not inclined to find that the Respondent’s defence of necessity, if
otherwise made out, would fail under this fourth element of “contribution” under
Article 25. The Respondent did not subjectively intend that social unrest should take
place, leading to the Egyptian revolution and its consequences of 2011-2014. It did
not cause or foresee the consequences of the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2008.
Nor did the Respondent subjectively intend that there would be, independently from
these events, a shortage in electricity supply and a shortage of gas in Egypt. However,
it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to decide this fourth element, one way or the other,

given the Tribunal’s earlier decisions above.
(5) Summary of Decisions

For the reasons stated above, the Tribunal decides that the Respondent has not proven
the defence of “necessity” under customary international law, as expressed in Article

25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. In these circumstances, it is

PART IX: THE MERITS ISSUES
(1) Introduction

9.1 The Tribunal here addres:
defences under Articles 3(1), 4(1), 4(2) and 4(5) of the Treaty.!

 

's the merits of the Claimant’s claims and the Respondent’s

9.2 Article 3(1) of the Treaty requires the Respondent to protect in its territory the
investments made in accordance with its laws and regulations by investors of Spain
and “shall not hamper, by means of unjustified or discriminatory measures, the
management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, expansion, sale and if is the case, the

liquidation of such investments.”

9.3 Article 4(1) of the Treaty provides that the Respondent “shall guarantee in its territory
fair and equitable treatment for the investments made by investors of [Spain]” (the

“FET standard”).

9.4 Articles 4(2) and 4(5) of the Treaty address discriminatory or “less favourable”
treatment for the covered investments than that applied to investments by investors of

a third country or by Egyptian investors.

9.5 There is a substantial overlap between these respective protections, as applied to the
present case. For this reason, the Tribunal here focuses on the Claimant’s case under

the FET standard under customary international law in Article 4(1) of the Treaty.

(2) The Claimant’s Case

9.6 FET Standard: In summary, the Claimant contends that the Respondent breached the
FET standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty, through its actions and omissions and by
the acts and omissions of the Respondent and of EGAS, EGPC and their affiliates

attributable to the Respondent.”

9.7 In particular, the Claimant submits that the Respondent failed to afford fair and
equitable treatment to its investment in the Damietta Plant by: (i) creating and then

frustrating the Claimant’s legitimate expectations in the contractual performance of

Arab Republic of Egypt, [C-0001].

the SPA; (ii) failing to ensure an adequate gas supply to the Damietta Plant and
prioritising the domestic market and other gas consumers at the Claimant’s expense;

(iii) pursuing gas sector policies and market interventions that caused ge

 

shortages
and invoking them to avoid its obligations; and (iv) undersupplying the Damietta
Plant and allocating available gas in a discriminatory, disproportionate and non-
transparent manner. The Claimant also contends that the Respondent violated the
FET standard when it undermined the stability of the Claimant’s legal and business
framework by enacting Law No. 114 for 2008 that amended the Investment

Guarantees and Incentives Law and cancelled SEGAS’ Free Zone License.*

9.8 | The Claimant points to the ordinary meaning of “fair and equitable treatment” in the
FET standard as “just, even-handed, unbiased, legitimate, reasonable.”* It notes that
other tribunals have decided that the FET standard “ensures that the foreign investor is
not unjustly treated, with due regard to all surrounding circumstances, and that it is a
means to guarantee justice to foreign investors.”® The Claimant submits that the FET

standard is “inherently flexible” that may be implicated by “different types of host

”7

State misconduct,”’ and encompasses the protection of investors’ “legitimate

expectations.”* The Claimant emphasises that “no investment tribunal has ever

refused to find that the [FET] standard protects legitimate expectations.”? In response
to the Respondent’s argument that legitimate expectations are limited to a “specific

commitment,”!°

the Claimant replies that the concept is broader and claims that a
“State’s unilateral declarations, its regulatory framework, and other conduct and
circumstances can create legitimate expectations” and that each situation must be

evaluated individually. '!

The Claimant suggests a three-stage approach for discerning whether a host State has
breached the FET standard by frustrating an investor’s legitimate expectations: “(i)
Did the host State’s conduct create legitimate expectations on the part of the investor?
(ii) Did the investor rely on the State’s conduct at the time it invested? And (iii) did

912

the host State subsequently fail to honor the expectations it created
Citing Parkerings v. Lithuania (2007), the Claimant contends that:

[A] host State’s conduct can give rise to legitimate expectations if: (i) the
investor received an explicit promise or guarantee from the host State; (ii)
the investor received implicit promises or guarantees that it then took into
account in making its investment; or (iii) absent such assurances or
representations, the circumstances surrounding the investment were such
as to give rise to a legitimate expectation.'°

In the present case, the Claimant contends that the Respondent created legitimate
expectations that it would “ensure [the] availability of sufficient volumes of natural
gas for the fulfillment of the SPA and the operation of the LNG [Damietta] Plant”! in
several different ways, including explicit promises, guarantees, assurances and
representations.'° The Claimant points in particular to its contractual arrangement
with EGPC (later EGAS) and the Respondent’s conduct that created the legitimate

expectations that the Respondent would not interfere with the agreed upon

relationship and “a firm gas supply commitment over a period of 25 years” to supply

gas as reflected in the SPA.!°

9.12 On the ability of the SPA to create legitimate expectations, the Claimant submits that
the SPA is an “investment agreement” under international law that set out the legal
obligations, at least in part, that would apply to the Claimant’s investment in the
Damietta Plant.'’ The Claimant contends that because the SPA was concluded with
EGPC, a State-owned company the conduct of which is attributable to the
Respondent, the Respondent created legitimate expectations that it would comply with

the SPA.'*

9.13 In any event, the SPA articulated the Claimant’s legitimate expectations of

compliance with at least three ga

 

supply obligations: (i) to sell and deliver to the
Claimant 4 BCM of gas annually, (ii) to secure and maintain an adequate gas supply
to the Damietta Plant for the 25-year life of the project, and (iii) at all times keep a

reserve supply to meet an on-stream factor of 95% of the LNG Complex.'?

9.14 The Claimant further contends that EGPC (later EGAS) agreed never to treat the
Claimant worse than any other customer, including domestic consumers, in the event
of “force majeure” partially affecting its ability to supply natural gas.?° EGPC also
allegedly undertook to ensure that Egyptian authorities would not interfere with the
Project or the Claimant’s rights under the SPA, even in the case of a natural gas

shortage.7!

9.15 In support of its case that the Respondent created the Claimant’s legitimate
expectations, the Claimant points out that the Minister of Petroleum affirmed the

the term of the SPA at a competitive price.?? The Council of Ministers then
acknowledged these commitments in approving the Project following the conclusion
of the SPA between EGPC and UFG that reflected the principles, obligations and
rights of each party.?? The Government celebrated the SPA as a historical first
contract to export Egyptian gas;*4 and it further endorsed the SPA.*° The Claimant
maintains that the Respondent not only promoted a solicited investment in its natural
gas industry as a matter of general policy, it also “specifically encouraged UFG to

invest in Egypt” and “to build what was to become the largest-single-train liquefaction

facility in the world and the only such facility in Egypt.”?°

9.16 The Claimant asserts that it “heavily relied on Egypt’s conduct and representations
[...] when UFG undertook to make its investment in Egypt”; and that it was this
reliance that “was the final element that led to UFG’s legitimate expectation that the

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 241 of 347

It is the Claimant’s case that the Respondent is responsible for the lack of gas supply
to the Claimant. The Claimant submits that whilst the Government endorsed the SPA,
it also adopted policies that undermined EGPC and EGAS’ obligations to the
Claimant and used EGAS to implement the Ministry’s strategy of prioritising the
domestic market over the Claimant.?? The Claimant claims that the Government’s
policies, including subsidising gas usage across industries, over-stimulated demand
for gas and led to a domestic gas shortfall.*° Paired with the Government’s strategy of
giving local market demand priority — a strategy that did not exist when the SPA was
signed — the Government caused EGPC and EGAS to fall short of meeting their
obligations to the Claimant by 190 million MMBtus between 2006 and 2010, and to
fail to deliver any gas since 2012.*! In response to the Respondent’s argument that the
decision to cut off the gas supply to the Claimant did not involve sovereign authority,

the Claimant refers the Tribunal to its arguments on attribution (see below).

The Claimant also contends that EGAS prioritised the domestic market pursuant to the
Government’s political strategy and against its own commercial interest, further
supporting the notion that EGAS is not an autonomous commercial company, but is
rather subject to the Respondent’s sovereign policies.** The Claimant points to the
Respondent’s plea of necessity as an admission that the decision to prioritise the
domestic market, through EGAS, was a sovereign act, and not a commercial

decision.*?

Further, the Claimant alleges that the Respondent violated the FET standard by
revoking, by Law No. 114 of 2008, the Free Zone status of SEGAS originally
established under Law No. 8 of 1997, which excluded the profits and dividends of
projects established in free zones from Egyptian tax and regulations.*4 The Claimant
contends that it had relied on this status in making its investment in the Project and is

significantly harmed through its revocation.*>

9.20 Finally, the Claimant argues that “international trade law further confirms UFG’s
legitimate expectations” and refers to the World Trade Organization (“WTO”)
Agreements, including the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade of 1994
(“GATT”) “which sets out binding rules that limit the right of WTO Members to
restrict or prohibit exports to other Members.”°° The Claimant asserts that WTO
jurisprudence on Article XI:1 of the GATT “‘lays down a general obligation to
eliminate quantitative restrictions’ on trade” and “forbids not only outright

prohibitions on importation or exportation but also other ‘restrictions’,” including

“measures that create uncertainties and affect investment plans, restrict market access
for imports, or make importation prohibitively costly” or “ha[ve] a limiting effect.”>”
The Claimant thus concludes that “Egypt’s international obligation to ensure
compliance with WTO rules in good faith further confirms the [Claimant]’s legitimate
expectation that Egypt would neither require nor allow the prioritization or exclusive
allocation of natural gas for domestic use in violation of WTO rules” and “to suggest
otherwise is to suggest that the [Claimant] should have anticipated that Egypt would
violate its treaty obligations.”**
9.21 The Claimant concludes, on the merits, that the Respondent breached the FET
standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty by creating and then violating the Claimant’s

legitimate expectation, and consequently impaired its investment.

9.22 Attribution: In summary, as to attribution to the Respondent in regard to EGPC and
EGAS, the Claimant contends that their conduct, although for different purposes, is
attributable to the Respondent as a matter of international law. Thus, the Claimant
asserts that, whilst its main case is that “Egypt itself, through the Ministry of
Petroleum and other agencies and officials, made the decision to decrease (and then

stop altogether) the supply of natural gas to the [Claimant] in order to prioritize

36 Cl Rep Merits, Paragraph 335, citing in particular Article XI:1 of the GATT, which provides that “No
prohibitions or restrictions other than duties, taxes or other charges, whether made effective through quotas,
import or export licenses or other measures, shall be instituted or maintained by any contracting party on the
importation of any product of the territory of any other contracting party or on the exportation or sale for export
of any product destined for the territory of any other contracting party.”; see also Cl Rep Merits, Paragraph 260.

Egypt’s domestic market,” EGPC’s and EGAS’ conduct “equally implicates Egypt’s
liability for breaching the BIT.”*?

The Claimant submits that EGPC’s execution of the SPA is attributable to the
Respondent primarily because EGPC was an organ of the State under Article 4 of the
ILC Articles on State Responsibility (being declaratory of international law),*° and
thus that EGPC’s obligations under the SPA to supply gas are the basis of legitimate
expectations that the Respondent would assure such supply.*! The Claimant submits
that, despite the fact that EGPC “assigned” (novated) the SPA to EGAS in 2002
(effective as from 1 August 2001),*” EGPC remains “responsible for the obligations

under it.”43

The Claimant submits that EGAS’s failure to supply gas to the Claimant under the
SPA is also attributable to the Respondent, under international law, because EGAS,
too, is an organ of the State under Article 4 of the ILC Articles on State
Responsibility. According to the Claimant, EGAS’ decision to curtail supplies to the
Damietta Plant was an exercise of governmental authority under Article 5 of the ILC
Articles on State Responsibility; and that EGAS did so on the instructions of or under
the direction or control of the Respondent within the meaning of Article 8 of the ILC
Articles on State Responsibility. As a result, so the Claimant concludes, the
Respondent is itself responsible for the curtailment of supply of feed gas under the

SPA.

For the purpose of Article 4 of the ILC Articles, the Claimant contends that EGPC is

an organ of the Respondent under Article 4 by reason of the following factors:

(i) | The fact that EGPC enjoys separate legal personality under Egyptian law is not

determinative of its status as an organ of the State under international law;

(vi) The ICSID tribunal in Ampal v. Egypt (2017) decided that EGPC was an organ

(3) The Respondent’s Case

FET Standard: In summary, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has failed to
prove any of its allegations that the Respondent has breached Article 4(1) of the
Treaty.

The Respondent maintains that the “Claimant has failed to establish that the conduct
of EGPC and EGAS at issue in this arbitration constitutes an exercise of “puissance
publique.”*> According to the Respondent, the Claimant cannot identify “any act or
omission by EGAS or EGPC related to the present dispute that could not have been an
act or omission of a private contracting party.” The Respondent asserts that such
conduct “cannot engage Respondent's liability under the [Treaty], even if Claimant

could show, quod non, that EGAS or EGPC acted under Respondent's instructions.”*°

Consequently, absent the identification of a sovereign act by the Respondent, “such as
the enactment of a law, decree or judgment, that caused EGAS’s alleged violations of
the Natural Gas Sale and Purchase Agreement and related agreements,” the
Respondent dismisses the Claimant’s numerous references to the Respondent’s

alleged policie: “beside the point.”°’ The Respondent focuses its response to the

 

Claimant’s claims based on “legitimate expectations” and the change in SEGAS’ tax-

free status.**

The Respondent denies that it has breached the FET standard. It submits that the

Claimant has not established that the Respondent’s conduct gave rise to any

“legitimate expectations” on which it relied in making its investment; that the
Respondent frustrated these expectations; and that the Respondent has otherwise

violated the FET standard.*°

Whilst the Respondent accepts that legitimate expectations are an essential element of
the FET standard, the Respondent contends that the standard is not “flexible” (as the
Claimant argues), but rather presents a “high threshold”. According to the
Respondent, the Claimant has not met this threshold.®° The Respondent relies on
Waste Management v. Mexico II (2004) to argue that the standard requires “arbitrary,
grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic” conduct leading to “an outcome which offends

judicial propriety” to breach the FET minimum standard.°!

The Respondent maintains that the conduct of EGAS/EGPC is not attributable to the
State.©* Nevertheless, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has not
demonstrated that it had any “reasonable and legitimate expectations” with regard to
the gas supply obligations under the SPA, or with regard to the permanence of the tax
regime in place at the time of the “investment” in 2000.°° Additionally, the
Respondent asserts that the Claimant has not shown that the Respondent interfered
with the Claimant’s contractual relationship with EGAS or that the reduction and
ultimate shutdown of the gas supply was discriminatory, disproportionate or lacking
in transparency.™ Overall, the Respondent argues that the Claimant’s free zone claim,
gas policy claim, and gas supply claims are meritless; and that, in any event, the state
of necessity following the 2011 Egyptian revolution precludes any finding of

wrongful conduct related to gas shortages.

On the specific issue of “legitimate expectations,” the Respondent contends that the
FET standard requires the existence of specific, unambiguous commitments by the

State and the investor’s reliance upon these commitments in making the investment —

elements that are absent in this case.°° Responding to the Claimant’s allegations
regarding the Government’s support for the Project, the Respondent asserts that
expressing an interest in a nationally significant investment is not equivalent to
assuming any obligations under the SPA executed between UFACEX/UFG and
EGPC/EGAS, especially without the State’s involvement in the negotiation of the
SPA.”

9.33 The Respondent submits that the Claimant could not derive reasonable and legitimate

expectations of the Respondent itself

 

uming any obligations with respect to the
supply of gas under the SPA, because the Respondent is not a party to the SPA and
“[t]he contractual commitments of EGPC and EGAS are not Respondent’s
commitments.”°* Citing Parkerings v. Lithuania (2007), the Respondent contends that
any contractual expectations created by the SPA are not necessarily protected under
the Treaty and that redress for any frustration of those expectations should be sought

before national courts.”

9.34 The Respondent thus maintains that the Claimant has failed to establish any specific
representation made by the Respondent regarding the supply of gas to the Damietta
Plant and characterises any expectations that the Claimant may have had with respect
to a “firm” gas supply for 25 years or otherwise, as contractual and not protected

under international law.”°

9.35 Further, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant has failed to demonstrate that it
relied upon any representations by the Respondent in making its investment in Egypt.
The Respondent points out that the Claimant claims reliance upon a statement by the

Egyptian Minister of Petroleum in 2005, years after its investment in 2000, whilst its

witness on this point (Mr Fernandez Martinez) “was not involved in the negotiation
and drafting of the [SPA]” and thus cannot speak to the Claimant’s reliance on any
alleged representations at the time.”! The Respondent contends that expectations

arising after an investment is made are not protected under the FET standard.”

9.36 Turning to the Claimant’s Free Zone claim in respect of SEGAS, the Respondent
contends that the claim is meritless for four reasons: (i) absent a stabilisation
agreement, changes in the Respondent’s tax regulations cannot give rise to a violation
of the Treaty’s FET standard; (ii) it is undisputed that the Parties never entered into a
tax stabilisation agreement; (iii) the Claimant bears the consequences of its decision to
invest despite the lack of any stabilisation agreement and in any event fails to show
any investment-backed expectations; and (iv) the change in the legal framework
governing free zones was fair and equitable in light of the circumstances.”> The
Respondent further notes that this claim is absent from the Claimant’s Reply

Memorial on the Merits.”

9.37 Referring to the decisions in Perenco v. Ecuador (2014), Duke Energy v. Ecuador
(2008), and E/ Paso v. Argentina (2011), the Respondent maintains that the FET

 

standard does not guarantee that the legal and business framework will remain

unaltered; and, in any event, that it must be assessed objectively.”> Relying upon the
award in Encana Corp. v. Ecuador (2006), the Respondent asserts that, in the absence
of a specific commitment from the host State like a stabilisation agreement, the
foreign investor has no right or legitimate expectation that the tax regime will not
change during the life of the investment.”° In this regard, the Respondent notes that “it

is undisputed that the Parties never entered into a tax stabilization agreement” and the

of ongoing public demonstrations and popular discontent in the face of a social and

security crisis involving strikes and protests against rising food costs and low wages.*°

9.39 In response to the Claimant’s submissions about the Respondent’s gas policies, the
Respondent submits that these lack merit because (i) the Respondent’s gas polices
were known to the Claimant at the outset; (ii) the Claimant has not shown any
reasonable expectation of a 25-year firm gas supply vis-d-vis the Respondent; (iii) the
Claimant complaints that pre-existing gas policies are “consistent with the energy
policies of an emerging economy transitioning from reliance on liquid fuel to natural
gas”; and (iv) the 2011 Egyptian revolution made it impossible to “adopt new policies

in general, not to mention policies in a sensitive sector, such as the energy sector,

which is critical to the Egyptian population.” *!

9.40 With regard to the duration of the Respondent’s gas policies, the Respondent asserts
that gas and other subsidies have been in place for decades and are “historically

embedded in the social welfare system.”*? The Respondent points to this factor, to

argue that, to be protected, the Claimant’s expectations must be legitimate and
reasonable at the time the investment is made, taking into account all circumstances,
including the “political, socioeconomic, cultural and historical conditions prevailing

in the host State.”*

9.41 Further, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant has failed to establish that it was the
Respondent’s gas policies that cause the gas shortages, and not the Global Financial
Crisis of 2008 or the Egyptian revolution in 2011.** The Respondent notes that the
Claimant agrees that gas production decelerated and declined as a result of declining
investment in new production needed to offset declines in existing fields.** The
Respondent relies upon the expert reports showing that the Global Financial Crisis
and the Egyptian revolution were the primary causes of the stagnation and decline in
gas production during the relevant period.*° The Respondent further asserts that the
Claimant recognised the deep economic, political and social crisis unfolding in Egypt,
and even recognized the existence of force majeure circumstances, through its own

Managing Director’s statement made within Unién Fenosa.*”

9.42 On the Claimant’s invocation of the Respondent’s WTO obligations to derive
legitimate expectations, the Respondent asserts that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction
over such an international trade law claim; and, in any event, that the claim must fail

for much the same reasons as the Claimant’s FET claim under the Treaty.**

fair and equitable treatment standard.”*? Based on a weighing of the investor’s
reasonable and legitimate expectations and the State’s sovereign right to regulate in
the public interest, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has failed to show that
the Respondent’s conduct was “manifestly inconsistent, non-transparent, unreasonable
[...] or discriminatory” and thus has not established a violation of the FET standard in

the Treaty.°°

Moreover, the Respondent notes that “not all differential treatment is discriminatory”
and argues that, to establish unfair and inequitable treatment, the Claimant has to
prove that “investors (i) in like circumstances (ii) were treated differently (iii) because
of their nationality and (iv) without reasonable justification.” which the Respondent
alleges has not been proven by the Claimant within the meaning of the FET standard

in Article 4(1) of the Treaty (nor under Articles 3(1), 4(2) or 4(3) of the Treaty).°!

Attribution: In summary, the Respondent contests the Claimant’s characterisations as
to attribution under Articles 4, 5 and 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. It
contends that the standards of international law for determining attribution are

demanding; and that the Claimant has failed to meet any of them.

As regards EGPC, the Respondent denies that EGPC is an organ of the State; and it

 

maintains that, in any event, as a result of EGPC’s “assignment” (or novation) of its
rights and obligations under the SPA, no responsibility by EGPC for subsequent

conduct by EGAS can arise.”

As regards EGAS, the Respondent also contests that EGAS is an organ of the State;°>
that EGAS exercised any government authority by conduct” and that EGAS was

instructed or directed in such conduct by organs of the Respondent.”

organ of the State by reason of the following factors:

not an organ of the State, at least in the absence of exceptional circumstances;°°

(ii) State organs are entities that are part of the structure of the State and act on its

which is a commercial rather than a governmental activity.'°!

Central Audit Agency does not make it part of the structure of the State;!°?
indeed, it has “an independent planning budget prepared on the same pattern as

Egyptian administrative law is irrelevant to the question of whether the conduct
of EGPC at issue in this case is attributable to the Egyptian State under

(4) The Tribunal’s Analyses and Decisions

Introduction: As already indicated above, the Tribunal focuses on the Claimant’s
claim under the FET standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty. The Tribunal determines
the issues of attribution by reference to Articles 4, 5, 8 and 11 of the ILC’s Articles on
State Responsibility, being declaratory of customary international law, as argued by

the Parties.

The Tribunal first addresses the Claimant’s case under the FET standard in Article
4(1) of the Treaty. As already indicated, the Respondent denies any liability to the
Claimant under any provision in the Treaty, including Article 4(1). The Tribunal’s
analysis below should be read with the fuller description of material events in Part V
above, together with the complete text of the relevant legal provisions in Part III

above.

The FET Standard: Article 4(1) of the Treaty requires the Respondent, towards the
Claimant, “to guarantee in its territory fair and equitable treatment of the investments
made by investors of the other Party.” This FET standard provides a broad protection
to covered investments and investors. The Tribunal is content to apply under Article
4(1) the customary international law standard as prohibiting (inter alia) conduct by
the host State “which is unjust, arbitrary, unfair, discriminatory or in violation of due
process,” including conduct that frustrates an investor’s “legitimate expectations,” as

decided by the NAFTA tribunal in Merrill v. Canada (2010).!°°

Legitimate Expectations: As to “legitimate expectations,” the Tribunal is content to

107

adopt the statement, as cited by the Respondent in Philip Morris v. Uruguay

(2016): “It clearly emerges from the analysis of the FET standard by investment

tribunals that legitimate expectations depend on specific undertakings and

representations made by the host State to induce investors to make an investment.” !°8

The Tribunal has also been guided by several other decisions cited by the Parties,
including Parkerings v. Lithuania (2007), Glamis v. USA (2009)! and Mobil v.
Canada (2012).''° Applying these materials, in addition to the requirement for a
specific undertaking or representation attributable to the Respondent, the Claimant
must also establish that: (i) its expectations were reasonable in the circumstances; (ii)
it relied upon such undertaking or representation when it made its investment in
Egypt; and (iii) that the Respondent’s non-compliance with its undertaking or
representation violated the FET standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty. The Tribunal
does not consider that such a representation or undertaking amounts to a free-standing
part of the FET standard but, rather, that it is “a relevant factor” in assessing whether
or not the Respondent violated the FET standard, as was decided in Mobil v. Canada
(2012),""!

Whether such a factor applies to any particular case, however, must depend upon the
particular circumstances of that case, both as to the State and to an organ of the State
(including the question of whether it is an organ of the State). In the Tribunal’s view,

these several tests are largely fact-specific in the present case.

The Claimant emphasises that this “is not a contract case.”!!? If it were, the
Claimant’s contractual rights would be subject to the applicable laws and dispute
resolution provisions in its contracts. The Claimant contends, however, that the
Respondent violated the FET standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty under international
law. The Tribunal accepts, as the Respondent submits, that it has no jurisdiction to
decide any claim by the Claimant for breach any of contractual rights under any
agreement made by the Claimant and its associated companies subject to their

applicable municipal laws and provisions for dispute resolution before international

commercial arbitration tribunals. The Tribunal here asserts its jurisdiction under the
Treaty in respect only of alleged violations of the Respondent’s obligations towards

the Claimant under the Treaty.

The Claimant contends under international law that (inter alia) the Respondent
frustrated the Claimant’s legitimate expectations, in breach of the Ministry of
Petroleum’s undertaking of 5 August 2000, by interfering with the performance by
EGPC and subsequently EGAS of their contractual obligations under the SPA (with
the EGAS and UFG Tolling Contracts); by engaging in inconsistent conduct towards
the Claimant; by adopting discriminatory measures towards the Claimant; and by
conduct that lacked proportionality and transparency towards the Claimant. To that
end, the Claimant relies upon expectations derived from (but not based on) its
contractual rights, the Respondent’s own conduct and the status of EGPC and EGAS
as legal entities wholly-owned by the Respondent whose acts and omissions are

attributable to the Respondent under international law.

The Claimant’s case relies first, for its “legitimate expectations,” on the Ministry’s
undertaking of 5 August 2000 and rights derived from the SPA between the Claimant
(as UFICEX’s “assignee”) and the Seller (originally EGPC succeeded by EGAS),
whereby, in the Claimant’s submission, “EGPC/EGAS” (as the Seller) undertook
several obligations for the supply of natural gas to UFACEX/UFG during the SPA’s

term of 25 years. These included the following contractual terms:
(i) Under Article 5.1, the Seller agreed to sell and deliver 4 BCM of gas annually;

(ii) Under Article 5.1[5], the Seller “shall at all times keep a backup supply to

meet an on stream (load) factor of 95% of the LNG Complex.”

(iii) | Under Article 15.2 of the SPA, in the event of “Force Majeure” (as there
defined), the Seller “shall treat Buyer no worse than any other present or
future purchaser/s [sic] of NG”; and “[t]his right shall be binding upon the

Parties at all time, including the event of shortage of NG.”!!3

(iv) — Under Article 15.3(b):

Part IX — Page 20 of 46

9.58

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 256 of 347

In the case of the Seller, Force Majeure shall not include changes in
market conditions including, without limitation, changes that: (i) Directly
or indirectly affect the demand for or price of NG; (ii) Result in the
diversion of NG to other users; (iii) Are due to the inability of the
transportation system and/or pipeline (whether for reasons
maintenance, repairs or lack of capacity or otherwise) to meet consumer
demand and/or Buyer demand.

(v) Under Article 21.1:

EGPC undertakes to procure that the Egyptian authorities undertake not
to interfere with the rights of Buyer under this Agreement, and not to
dictate or promulgate any act or regulation which could directly or
indirectly affect the rights of Buyer under this Agreement, or affect the
capacity of Buyer to perform its obligations under this Agreement, even in
the case of a NG shortage in Egypt, save for Force Majeure situations as
defined in this Agreement.

(vi) Under Article 23.2:

Seller is the sole responsible [sic] for securing adequate supplies of NG for
performance of its obligations hereunder. Seller shall, throughout the
Term, provide Buyer or Lenders with such further assurances as Buyer or
Lenders may reasonably request from time to time regarding the continued
adequacy of NG supply sources relied upon by Seller to perform
hereunder. In no case this shall represent for Seller additional obligations
to those set forth in this Agreement.

(vii) Under Article 24.3, the Seller acknowledged that it:

is aware that the supply of NG to Buyer [...] is a key element of the
successful development of the Project, and therefore Seller represents and
warrants that its availability of NG will be sufficient to feed the Complex
under the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Also Seller represents
and warrants that it has, and will have during the Term, all the legal,
administrative and corporate rights, licenses and authorizations to deliver
the NG at the Delivery Point and to comply with all its obligations under
this Agreement.

Under the terms of the SPA, EGPC acted as a principal towards UFACEX in regard to
the SPA: Article 24.1(h). EGPC was not, however, an entity created and operating in
the private sector of the Egyptian economy. As already indicated, EGPC was wholly
owned by the Respondent. Yet, EGPC had a separate legal personality under Egyptian
law. Thus, Article 20 of the SPA addressed sovereign immunity; and the waiver of

such immunity clearly targeted EGPC (later, EGAS), rather than UFACEX (later, the

Claimant).

"4 Letter from Mini

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 257 of 347

The Respondent was not a contractual party to the SPA, as confirmed by Articles 21.1
and 24.1(h) of the SPA, and also the separate approval of the SPA by the
Respondent’s executive branch. Such separate approval would not have been
necessary if the Respondent were a contractual party to the SPA. As to such approval,
it took place by the Council of Ministers on 25 July 2000 (before the SPA was
executed) and by the Ministry of Petroleum’s letter dated 5 August 2000 to the

Claimant (shortly after such execution).

The Ministry’s letter dated 5 August 2000 provided, in material part:!!4 “On behalf of
the Ministry of Petroleum I have the pleasure to Inform you that the Egyptian
Government official [sic] endorsed the natural gas Sales and Purchase Agreement

signed on August 1, 2000 between UFACEX and EGPC.”

This letter uses the phrase (in English) that the Egyptian Government “official[ly]
endorsed” the SPA. It was a shorthand term signifying, in the circumstances known to
the Government, EGPC and UFACEX, something more specific. In the Tribunal’s
view, the Respondent was thereby

the terms of Article 21.1 of the SPA.

 

ciating itself, as a non-contractual party, with

Under this provision, EGPC expressly:

Undertakes to procure that the Egyptian authorities undertake not to
interfere with the rights of the Buyer under this Agreement and not to
dictate or promulgate any act or regulation which could directly or
indirectly affect the rights of Buyer under this Agreement, or affect the
capacity of Buyer [sic: Seller] to perform its obligations under this
Agreement, even in the case of a NG shortage in Egypt, save for Force
Majeure situations as defined in this Agreement [...]

The Tribunal emphases the phrase “to procure that the Egyptian authorities
undertake.” As a matter of ordinary English, this necessarily refers to a separate extra-
contractual “undertaking” by the Egyptian authorities, and not to an undertaking by
EGPC alone under the SPA. EGPC’s contractual undertaking was to procure the

undertaking from the Egyptian authorities. By the term “Egyptian authorities,” the

 

ry of Petroleum, First Undersecretary (Ismail Karara) to Unién Fenosa $.A., Chairman

Respondent falls within Article 24.1(f) and (g) of the SPA: it was not a “mutual representation” made between
EGPC and UFACEX as the contractual parties to the SPA.

contracting parties were referring to the Egyptian Governmental authorities, including

the Ministry of Petroleum.

EGPC discharged its undertaking to “procure” the undertaking by the Egyptian
Governmental authorities, in accordance with Article 21.1, in the form of the Ministry
of Petroleum’s letter dated 5 August 2000. The Respondent’s “official endorsement”
of the SPA is, in the circumstances, to be understood as comprising the separate,
extra-contractual undertaking required under Article 21.1 of the SPA. In the
Tribunal’s view, the juxtaposition of timing and the terms of Article 21.1 and the

letter exclude any other objective interpretation.

Moreover, the Respondent’s ‘undertaking’ was an important extra-contractual
condition for UFACEX’s participation in the Project. Without such an endorsement
from the Respondent, conforming to the undertaking required under Article 21.1 of
the SPA, the Damietta Project would not have proceeded beyond the signing of the
SPA. A breach of EGPC’s undertaking to procure the Respondent’s undertaking
would have amounted to the wholesale repudiation of the SPA and the immediate
renunciation of the Project. At the time, it does not appear that this requirement for the
Respondent’s undertaking was in the least controversial. The Respondent (by its
Ministry of Petroleum) was supporting the Project; and the Respondent’s Council of
Ministers had approved the draft SPA.

It was essential for the Claimant to receive natural gas under the SPA. There was no
other source of natural gas for the Plant. It was to be connected to the national grid;
and it was not to be supplied from its own gas field. Without such supply, the Plant

would become a “white elephant.”

In the Tribunal’s view, nothing could be clearer than the provisions in the SPA,
principally Article 24.3 recording the Seller’s awareness “that the supply of NG to
Buyer under this Agreement is a key element for the successful development of the
Project, and therefore Seller represents and warrants that its availability of NG will be
sufficient to feed the Complex under the terms and conditions of this Agreement.” It
is also evident from Articles 21.1, 24.1 and 24.3 whereby the Seller was responsible
for securing all necessary permits and support from the Respondent’s administrative

and other agencies, so as to perform its obligations to supply natural gas to the Plant.

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 259 of 347

9.67 All this was known to the Respondent at the material time, from its approval of the
SPA’s draft terms by its Council of Ministers on 25 July 2000 (based on the Minister
of Petroleum’s memoranda) and, particularly, at the time of the Ministry of
Petroleum’s letter dated 5 August 2000. As more fully explained in Part V above, the
Minister of Petroleum “endorsed,” i.e. approved, the decision of EGPC’s board of
directors dated 14 July 2000 authorising EGPC to execute the SPA.''5 The Minister’s
memorandum of July 2000 (otherwise undated but preceding EGPC’s execution of the
SPA on | August 2000) requested the Council of Ministers also to approve the signing
of the SPA, as there described.!!® Whilst the Minister was primarily concerned with
the pricing mechanisms under the SPA, it is inconceivable that both the Minister and
the Ministry of Petroleum were unaware of the draft SPA’s non-pricing terms,

including Article 21.1 of the SPA.

9.68 For all these reasons, the Tribunal discounts the Respondent’s attempts to downplay
the significance of the Ministry of Petroleum’s letter dated 5 August 2000. Given the
importance to UFACEX of the Respondent’s undertaking required under Article 21.1
of the SPA, if no such extra-contractual undertaking had been forthcoming from the
Respondent, there would have been prompt and strenuous protests from UFACEX at

the time. There were none.

9.69 Conversely, the Tribunal discounts the Claimant’s attempts to transform the terms of
the Ministry’s letter dated 5 August 2000 and associated conduct into a general
guarantee of EGPC’s contractual obligations as Seller under the SPA. Under the SPA,
EGPC was not acting as an agent for the Respondent but expressly as a principal, as
already noted above (see Article 24.1(h) of the SPA). Under Egyptian law as the
SPA’s applicable law (Article 1.1 of the SPA), EGPC’s contractual obligations under
the SPA did not accrue to the Respondent given EGPC’s separate legal status from the
Respondent. If it had been intended to bind the Respondent generally to the terms of
the SPA as a guarantor or primary co-obligor, it would have been easy for UFACEX,
EGPC and the Respondent to use contractual language to such effect. There was none

in the Ministry’s letter dated 5 August 2000 or the SPA.

Thus, the Tribunal returns to the Ministry’s letter dated 5 August 2000 and the
wording to which it relates, namely Article 21.1 of the SPA, as constituting a separate
extra-contractual undertaking made by the Respondent under the FET standard in
Article 4(1) of the Treaty.

In the Tribunal’s view, the effect of this undertaking was to preclude the Respondent,
in the absence of good faith over the 25-year term of the SPA, from: (i) interfering
with the rights under the SPA of the Buyer (UFACEX, later the Claimant); (ii)
dictating or promulgating any act or regulation which could directly or indirectly
affect the rights of the Buyer under the SPA; and (iii) affecting the capacity of the
Buyer to perform its obligations under the SPA, even in the case of a shortage of
natural gas in Egypt — subject to force majeure situations as defined in the SPA. Non-
compliance in bad faith with the undertaking, assessed objectively, would amount to a
breach of the Respondent’s obligations under the FET standard in Article 4(1) of the

Treaty.

The proviso regarding force majeure in the Ministry’s letter was clearly intended to
protect the Respondent from responsibility for a situation where the performance of
the SPA was suspended for force majeure under Article 15 of the SPA. It is

complicated definition, albeit subject to specific conditions.

First, as a matter of English, the proviso cannot swallow the Respondent’s
undertaking, so as to render it nugatory. It must be read (with Article 15 of the SPA)
as being subordinate to the undertaking, i.e. as an exception limiting but not

extinguishing the scope of the undertaking.

Second, Article 15.1 of the SPA provides that any “force majeure” event or
circumstance must lie “beyond the reasonable control of a Party or Parties (acting and
having acted with a reasonable level of due diligence).” It is a qualified protection. It
would not be open to the Respondent to breach its undertaking so as to cause a force

majeure event and then to assert force majeure as a defence under the FET standard.

Third, Article 15.2 provides relief “for so long as and to the extent” that a “force
majeure” event or circumstance exists. Its Sub-paragraph (A) provides similarly that
the Seller is relieved from liability only (inter alia) “for so long and to the extent that

due to ‘Force Majeure’ [...]. Seller is unable to make available the properly

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 261 of 347

nominated quantity of NG in accordance with [the SPA].” This is an important

temporal limitation.

Fourth, Sub-paragraph (A) also provides that where a “force majeure” event or
circumstance “partially affects” the Seller’s obligations to supply natural gas, the
Seller “shall treat Buyer no worse than any other present or future purchasers of NG
[...] including the event of shortage of NG.” This is, again, an important limitation,
excluding adverse discrimination in the supply of gas to the Buyer at times of

shortage.

Fifth, by Article 15.3(b) of the SPA, “force majeure” does not include “changes in
market conditions [...] that (i) [d]irectly or indirectly affect the demand for [...] NG;
(ii) [rJesult in the diversion of NG to other users; (iii) [a]re due to the inability of the
transportation system and/or pipeline [...] to meet consumer demand and/or Buyer

demand.” This is an important limitation as to the scope of force majeure.

Lastly, Article 15.4 requires a party seeking relief for “force majeure” to give prompt
notice with relevant information, including “full particulars of the Force Majeure
event, its effects on the affected Party, and the remedial measures proposed.” (It will
be recalled that EGAS gave written notice of force majeure under Article 15.4 of the
SPA on 31 January 2012 and 24 February 2013: see Part V above). For the purposes
of this Award, the Tribunal assumes that such notice complied with the formal

requirements of Article 15.4 of the SPA.

In the Tribunal’s view, the Respondent’ separate extra-contractual undertaking by the
Ministry of Petroleum’s letter dated 5 August 2000 extends, in accordance with its
terms, only to the SPA (as amended subsequently). It does not extend, in accordance
with its terms, to the EGAS or UFG Tolling Contracts or any other contractual
agreements relating to the Damietta Plant. Neither of these Tolling Contracts existed

at the time of the Ministry’s letter, being agreed later on 30 June 2003.

At the time when the SPA was executed on 1 August 2000, the Buyer was UFACEX.
Pursuant to Article 18 of the SPA, UFACEX assigned its rights to the Claimant on 30
June 2003. On 17 October 2002, EGPC gave notice that it had assigned (or novated)
its rights and responsibilities under the SPA to EGAS, to be effective as from 1
August 2000.

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 262 of 347

In the Tribunal’s view, upon this “assignment” by UFACEX, the Claimant acquired
the full benefits possessed by UFACEX in regard to the SPA, including the Ministry’s
letter of 5 August 2000 (addressed, in fact, not to UFACEX, but to Union Fenosa).
UFACEX was and remains the Claimant’s sister company, within the Union Fenosa
Group of companies, with Spanish nationality. The Claimant was not, therefore, a
stranger intervening in the Project. To the contrary, it had been involved in the
Project from the beginning. The Claimant therefore stands in the shoes of UFACEX,
as from 1 August 2000 onwards, in regard to the effect of the Ministry’s letter dated 5
August 2000.

As a party to the SPA, the Claimant (with members of the Union Fenosa Group)
entered into long-term agreements to supply natural gas to Spanish power plants and
other agreements to supply gas to Spanish industrial plants. It also proceeded to

complete the Plant (with SEGAS), at a cost of US$ 1.4 billion.

On the evidence adduced in this arbitration, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant
reasonably formed legitimate expectations based on the letter of 5 August 2000 from
the Respondent’s Ministry of Petroleum that, in the words of Article 21.1 of the SPA,
the Respondent (inter alia) would not interfere with the rights of the Buyer under the
SPA or dictate any act which could directly or indirectly affect the rights of the Buyer

under the SPA, save for force majeure situations as defined in Article 15 of the SPA.

The Tribunal also concludes that the Claimant reasonably relied upon those
expectations, to its subsequent considerable detriment. There can be no doubt that the
Claimant has been almost ruined by the non-supply of natural gas under the SPA.
From the time when the Plant’s commercial operations began on 15 October 2006 to
the end of 2010, the shortfall was 190 million BTUs;!!7 and from 2012 to 2014, the
supply was too limited to comprise even a single cargo. The Damietta Plant has lain

idle since 2014; and it remains idle to the present day.

The Tolling Contracts: The Claimant next relies upon the two Tolling Contracts (i)
between EGAS (as Toller) and SEGAS (as Owner) dated 30 June 2003!'® and (ii)

"7 Heads of Agreement between EGAS and UFG, 23 November 2011, [C-0010].

48 Tolling Agreement between SEGAS and EGAS, 30 June 2003, [C-0003], to be later amended on (inter alia)
31 March 2004; Amendment No. 3 to the Tolling Contract between EGAS and SEGAS, 31 March 2004,
(C-0174].

between SEGAS (as Owner) and the Claimant (as Toller) also dated 30 June 2003.!!°
The Claimant is not a party to the EGAS Tolling Contract. The Respondent is not a

contractual party to either Tolling Contract.

In theory, under these two Tolling Contracts, EGAS would supply feed gas for the
Plant to SEGAS and, indirectly to the Claimant. These Tolling Contracts became
effective on the date of the Plant’s Commercial Start Date; namely 15 October 2006

(see Part V above).

The EGAS Tolling Contract has its own provisions on applicable law and dispute
resolution. Article 11.1 provides for English law “as its applicable law”. Article 11.3
provides for ICC arbitration in Paris. (It gave rise to the “ICC Arbitration” described
above in Parts I and VI of this Award). As with the SPA, there is a provision on the
waiver of sovereign immunity (Article 12); and a representation and warranty that
SEGAS and EGAS were acting as principals and not therefore as agents of the
Claimant or Respondent respectively (Article 13(f)). There is no provision similar to

Article 21.1 of the SPA.

The Tribunal has already decided that the Tolling Contracts do not fall within the
terms of the letter dated 5 August 2000 from the Ministry of Petroleum. Hence, the
Claimant cannot make a direct claim for “legitimate expectations” under the FET
standard in respect of these Tolling Contracts. (Indirectly, the Claimant claims US$
404,745,000 as “unpaid dividends” payable by EGAS to the Claimant (as SEGAS’s
majority shareholder) derived, at least in material part, from tolling fees due, but
unpaid, under the EGAS Tolling Contract). The Tribunal considers other aspects of

this claim below.

SEGAS’ Lost Free Zone Status: SEGAS was granted its tax-free status in the Damietta
Free Zone on 9 December 2001. That status was revoked on 5 May 2008. As with the
Tolling Contracts, this claim for US$ 107 million does not, so the Tribunal decides,
benefit from the Ministry’s letter dated 5 August 2000; and it cannot therefore derive
support from the Claimant’s case on “legitimate expectations” under the FET

standard. The Tribunal considers other aspects of this claim below.

Attribution: It is appropriate to consider next the position of (i) the Respondent’s
executive branch and (ii) the positions of EGPC and EGAS under international law.

As already indicated, the Tribunal here addresses the Parties’ respective cases on the

  

basis of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.!?° These are generally accepted as
authoritatively reflecting the principles of customary international law as they relate to
attribution; as such, both the Claimant and the Respondent relied upon them in this

arbitration; and the Tribunal is here content to do the same.
Article 4 of the ILC Articles, “Conduct of Organs of a State,” provides:

(1) The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State
under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive,
judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the
organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the
central government or of a territorial unit of the State.

(2) An organ includes any person or entity which has that status in
accordance with the internal law of the State.

As to the Respondent’s executive branch as an organ of the Respondent, no
controversy arises as to attribution. Article 4 of the ILC Articles on State
Responsibility confirms that, under international law, the conduct of a State’s
executive branch shall be considered as an act of that State. Hence, the conduct of the
Ministry of Petroleum, as with other Ministries and the Council of Ministers, is

attributable to the Respondent.

According to the ILC Commentary to Article 4, “[t]he reference to a ‘State organ’
covers all the individual or collective entities which make up the organization of the
State and act on its behalf.”'?! Of course, a State may become subject to obligations
entered into on its behalf by entities other that organs of the State, but this is governed

by general principles of the law of agency (not attribution).

Entities considered to be organs automatically include “any person or entity which has

that status in accordance with the internal law of the State.”!”? This normally excludes

entities that enjoy separate legal personality under internal law.!?? However,
according to the ILC Commentary, “the conduct of certain institutions performing
public functions and exercising public powers (e.g. the police) is attributed to the

State even if those institutions are regarded in internal law as autonomous and

independent of the executive government.”!*4

9.95 Thus, as the tribunal in A/mds v. Poland (2016) decided: “[I]nternal status does not
necessarily imply that an entity is not a State organ if other factors, such as the
performance of core governmental functions, direct day-to-day subordination to

central government, or lack of all operational autonomy, point the other way.”!?5

9.96 At the same time, circumstances sufficient to connote the status of an organ of the
State to a separate legal person must be extraordinary, involving functions and powers
considered to be as quintessentially powers of Statehood, such as those exercised by
police authorities. As the International Court of Justice stated in the Bosnian Genocide
Case (2007), “to equate persons or entities with State organs when they do not have
that status under internal law must be exceptional, for it requires proof of a

particularly great degree of State control over them, a relationship which the Court’s

Judgment quoted above expressly described as ‘complete dependence’.”!?°

9.97 The Tribunal accepts that EGPC is not considered to be an organ of the State under
Egyptian law; and that it instead enjoys a separate legal personality under Egyptian

law.!?? The fact that it is wholly owned by the State is of no material consequence. '?*

corporate name.””); see also James Crawford, The ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and
Commentaries (Cambridge University Press, 2002), [CL-0185], 112, Comment (6) (“Since corporate entities,
although owned by and in that sense subject to the control of the State, are considered to be separate, prima facie
their conduct in carrying out their activities is not attributable to the State unless they are exercising elements of
governmental authority within the meaning of article 5.”).

Corporate state enterprises existing outside of the structure of the State are a common

phenomenon.

9.98 Nor does the Tribunal consider the facts that EGPC is denominated by Egyptian law

 

a “public authority” and is statutorily part of the Egyptian “Petroleum Sector” that
develops strategies for the natural gas sector to be sufficient to make it part of the
structure of the State, and thus one of its organs under international law. Both State
ownership of entities and their involvement in the development of State-owned
natural resource necessarily implicate public sector concerns. But participation in the
public sector is not the same thing as being integral to the State apparatus, as was

decided by the tribunal in Ulysseas v. Ecuador (2012).'?°

9.99  Implicating public concerns as they do, it is unsurprising that State-owned non-organs
would be subject to State-run financial auditing under the same mechanism that
applies to entities that are organs of the State. Nor is it dispositive that certain
decisions of an entity are subject to oversight under administrative public law, as is

alleged here by the Claimant, especially if other decisions it takes are not.

9.100 These specific factors were considered by the Ulysseas tribunal, which did not find
that they connoted the status of a State organ under Article 4 of the ILC Articles.!*°
Moreover, as the Respondent contends, there has been no proof that the conduct at
issue here, namely EGPC’s entering into the SPA, constituted an administrative law

decision. '*!

9.101 Nor can EGPC’s engagement in the development and exploitation of natural resources
be considered as a purely governmental activity, as opposed to a commercial activity.
It is uncontested between the Parties, as the Tribunal accepts, that EGPC has the
power to contract in its own name and for its own account, as a principal, as it did
with the SPA. It has an “independent schematic budget prepared on the same pattern
of commercial budgets” and “the Corporation funds are funds owned by the State
private ownership.”'*? As the Almds tribunal decided, “where an entity engages on its

own account in commercial transactions, even if these are important to the national

economy, this inference [that it is a de facto organ] will not be drawn.”!3

9.102 In support of its case that EGPC’s functions are governmental in nature,'** the
Claimant contends that “exporting natural gas in its natural state or liquefied, and its
derivatives, to international markets” is a “sovereign function.”'*> But, whilst “under
the Egyptian Constitution, all minerals, including solid, liquid and gaseous resources,
are the property of the [S]tate,” as the Claimant points out,!*° private companies
manage private natural gas resources as a matter of course and, notwithstanding the
fact that governmental export approval may be required, the act of exporting natural

gas in any form is not, by its own nature, a sovereign act.

9.103 Whilst the Parties agree that the “right to grant concessions [...] is certainly a

9137

governmental function, requiring a decision by the President of the Republic and

approval of the National Assembly,'** they differ on the role played by EGPC (and
later by EGAS). The Claimant submits that EGPC and EGAS “enter [...] into

concession contracts with producers and are “the vehicle by which Egypt grants

concession rights.”!4°

9.104 As already found by the Tribunal, the Government is a non-contractual party to the
SPA and other agreements concluded by EGPC and EGAS. As the Respondent
submits, the SPA itself is not a concession agreement, but a commercial agreement for
the sale of natural gas.'4! Indeed, the Claimant itself describes the SPA as among “the
contracts and commercial decisions and operations of [Egypt’s] State-owned
companies.” 4?

9.105 Moreover, whilst EGPC is “owned by and in that sense subject to the control of the
State,”'*> the Claimant has not proven with respect to EGPC a “direct day-to-day
subordination to central government, or lack of all operational autonomy,” in the

words of the A/mds tribunal.'“*

9.106 The Claimant relies on the fact that EGPC’s chairman and board members are
designated by Government officials and that the board members appointed include
Government officials. In the Tribunal’s view, these factors are insufficient to show
that EGPC is “lacking any real autonomy” and does not have at least “some qualified,
but real, margin of independence.”'*> Private parent corporations routinely appoint
their officers as members of the boards of directors of their wholly-owned subsidiaries

without thereby losing shareholder immunity from liability.

9.107 The fact that decisions of EGPC’s board of directors must be sent to the Minister of
Petroleum for possible ratification, amendment or rescission does not show that the
Minister actually used this authority (which is no different from a shareholder
override in a privately owned corporation) to supervise EGPC’s regular activities. For

example, the tribunal in Jan de Nul v. Egypt (2008) declined to find that the Suez

Canal Authority was an organ of the Egyptian State, despite the involvement of the

Egyptian Government nearly identical to that alleged there. 4°

9.108 This conclusion gives context to EGPC’s representation in the private offering
memorandum to potential investors, relied upon by the Claimant, that it had “the same
legal status as the Central Bank of Egypt and the Suez Canal Authority.” In the light
of the decision in Jan de Nul v. Egypt (2008), that representation is consistent with the
Respondent’s submissions in this case. Indeed, notwithstanding the fact that, as the
prospectus pointed out, EGPC was an “economic authority” and that “[aJll decisions
of the Board of Directors are required to be notified to the Minister of Petroleum for
approval,” the offering memorandum expressly states in the same passage that “[t]he

Arab Republic of Egypt and the Egyptian Government, however, are not legally liable

for EGPC’s obligations to third parties unless expressly guaranteed.” !47

9.109 The ICSID tribunal in Ampal v. Egypt (2017) came to a different conclusion with
respect to EGPC’s status as an organ of the Egyptian State within the meaning of

Article 4 of the ILC Articles.'** That tribunal cited as reasons EGPC’s designation as

a “public authority” “overseen by the Minister of Petroleum,” with capital consisting

of “[fJunds allocated to it by the State” and a chairman and board appointed by and
partially consisting of Government officials, with the Minister of Petroleum
“empowered to amend or cancel [Board] resolutions.”!“” However, the decision does

not explain why these factors show that EGPC is part of the structure of the State so

as to deny its autonomous existence. Indeed, as noted earlier, these factors all have
analogues in private companies that clearly do not have the effect of subjecting

shareholders to liability for corporate obligations.

In addition, as regards Article 4 of the ILC Articles, the Ampal award is
distinguishable from the circumstances of this case. The transaction at issue there
arose from an earlier agreement between the States of Israel and Egypt. A Council of
Ministers’ resolution in furtherance of that inter-State agreement expressly
“[a]uthorize[d] the Ministry of Petroleum represented by the Egyptian General
Petroleum Corporation to negotiate [...] and conclude the contract.”'*° An agency
relationship binds a State as principal whether or not the agent (EGPC) is an organ of
the State. Here, as the Tribunal has already decided, EGPC was expressly acting as a

principal and not as an agent for the Respondent in concluding the SPA.

For this same reason, in the Tribunal’s view, the Claimant’s reliance on the award in
Wintershall v. Qatar (1989) is misplaced.'*! While the tribunal there agreed with the
claimant’s argument in that contractual case that, “[a]s a matter of Qatari law it is
clear that QGPC operates as an arm or agent of the Government in respect of the

9152

concession areas held by it,”!°* its dispositive conclusion was that “QGPC was acting

as an agent of the Government of Qatar and, therefore, all actions attributed to QGPC

7153 and that “[t]he mere fact that

in this case must be attributed to the Government,
QGPC is acting as agent for the Government, rather than the Government itself so
acting, does not in any sense take away from the Tribunal’s jurisdiction in this
case.”!*4 Again, here, EGPC was not acting as the Respondent’s agent in concluding

the SPA.

For the above reasons, the Tribunal concludes that EGPC was not an organ of the
Egyptian State with respect to the SPA, within the meaning of Article 4 of the ILC
Articles on State Responsibility. The same reasoning applies to EGAS (as EGPC’s

“assignee” in October 2002), on materially similar facts. Thus, EGAS was not an

organ of the Respondent under Article 4 of the ILC Articles.

The Tribunal turns to Article 5 of the ILC Articles, “Conduct of Persons or Entities

exercising Elements of Governmental Authority.” It provides:

The conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under

Article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise
elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the
State under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in
that capacity in the particular instance.

The Tribunal does not consider that the Claimant’s case is separately advanced by
Article 5 of the ILC Articles in regard to EGPC and EGAS. The Claimant has not
established that EGPC or EGAS are “empowered” by Egyptian law to exercise
governmental authority. As the ILC Commentary explains, “the internal law in
question must specifically authorize the conduct as involving the exercise of public
authority; it is not enough that it permits activity as part of the general regulation of
the affairs of the community. It is accordingly a narrow category.” The ILC
Commentary also states that a situation falling within Article 5 “is to be distinguished
from situations where an entity acts under the direction or control of the State, which
[i] covered by Article 8.”!°5 The Tribunal has not been shown any provision of
Egyptian law ‘specifically authorising’ EGPC to conclude the SPA in the exercise of

the Respondent’s public authority.

The Tribunal therefore turns to Article 8 of the ILC Articles, “Conduct Directed or

Controlled by a State.” It provides:

The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of
a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact
acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that
State in carrying out the conduct.

Under Article 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, the conduct of a person
(not being an organ of the State) shall be considered an act of a State under
international law if the person is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the
direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct. Its application, as the

ILC Commentary states, depends upon “a specific factual relationship” between the

person engaging in the conduct and the State.'*¢

The ILC Commentary addresses the
position of state entities, as follows: “[...] The fact that a State initially establishes a
corporate entity [...] is not a sufficient basis for the attribution to the State of the
subsequent conduct of that entity.”!°7 Moreover, there is a distinction to be drawn
between the conduct of the State itself and the conduct of a person attributable to the

State, as was held by the ICJ in Nicaragua v. USA.'**

The Tribunal does not consider that the Claimant’s case is advanced by Article 8 of
the ILC Articles in regard to EGPC’s conclusion of the SPA. The factors identified
above in regard to Article 4 of the ILC Articles apply equally to Article 8.

The position in regard to EGAS is different, following the “assignment” between
EGPC and EGAS on 17 October 2002. Thereafter, as regards the curtailment in the
supply of natural gas to the Damietta Plant, the Tribunal considers that EGAS did act
on the instructions of and under the control and direction of the Respondent, namely
its Ministry of Petroleum, within the meaning of Article 8 of the ILC Articles. As to

that factual relationship, the Tribunal addresses EGAS’ role further below.

The Tribunal notes that, in the Ampal award, the tribunal likewise decided (inter alia)
that EGAS, in regard to the termination of its agreement to export natural gas to
Israel, did act under the direction and control of the Respondent, within the meaning

of Article 8 of the ILC Articles: '?

The Tribunal finds that there is overwhelming evidence that the decisions
of EGPC and EGAS to conclude and terminate the GSPA were all taken
with the blessing of the highest levels of the Egyptian Government. Such
acts are attributable to the Respondent pursuant to Article 8 of the ILC
Draft Articles on State Responsibility as EGPC and EGAS were ‘in fact
acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of’ the
Respondent in relation to the particular conduct.

The Claimant also invokes Article 11 of the ILC Articles, “Conduct Acknowledged
and Adopted by a State.” It provides:

Conduct which is not attributable to a State under the preceding articles
shall nevertheless be considered an act of that State under international
law if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct
in question as its own.

The Tribunal does not consider that Article 11 of the ILC Articles in regard to EGPC
and EGAS separately advances the Claimant’s case. As the ILC Commentary
explains, there is a difference between “acknowledgment and adoption of the conduct
in question as its own” and “cases of mere support or endorsement” by the State; and
that what is required is that “the State identifies the conduct in question and makes it
its own.”!© That was not so in regard to EGPC’s conclusion of the SPA, by reason of
the factors identified above in regard to Article 4 of the ILC Articles. As regards
EGAS’ performance of the SPA following the “assignment” in 2002, the matter is
covered by Article 8 of the ILC Articles to be addressed (on the facts).

Breach: It is appropriate to address separately the Claimant’s several claims that the
Respondent breached the FET standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty; namely: (i) the
curtailed supply of natural gas to the Damietta Plant under the SPA; (ii) the non-
payment of fees due to SEGAS under the EGAS Tolling Contract; and (iii) the loss of
SEGAS’ Free Zone tax status.

(i) Gas Supply: Under the SPA, the “Commercial Operations Date” of the Damietta
Plant occurred on 15 October 2006. There were, almost immediately, shortages in the
supply of gas to the Plant, leading to the Claimant’s letter to EGAS dated 26 January
2007, followed by the Claimant’s further letter dated 29 May 2007. Shortages
continued, leading to the first draft Side Letter of 11 July 2008 between the Claimant
and EGAS. The problem was not resolved, leading to the Claimant’s letter dated 26
August 2008 and the meeting with the Minister of Petroleum on 16 October 2008. All
this took place before the Global Financial Crisis and long before the Egyptian

revolution.

These shortages of feed gas to the Plant continued in 2009 to 2010. In late 2008, the
Global Financial Crisis had begun. In early 2011, the Egyptian revolution began.
Neither affected the Damietta Plant physically (then or later). Shortages continued as
from 2010 onwards, as described in Part V above. On 31 January 2012 and 24

February 2013, EGAS sent to the Claimant notices of force majeure under Article 15
of the SPA.

During this period, the Claimant (with SEGAS) regularly complained to EGAS,
EGPC and the Ministry of Petroleum: see the former’s letters and email messages
dated 13 January 2010, 26 January 2010, 26 January 2010, 16 February 2010 (with
the meetings on 16 March and 15 April 2010), 27 April 2010, 6 August 2010, 3
December 2010 (with the draft HOA of 23 February 2011), 13 August 2011, 4
November 2011 (with the HOA of 23 November 2011 and the meeting of 27 February

July 2012, 25 July 2012, 26 August 2012, 9 October 2012 (following the meeting with
the Minister of Petroleum on 16 September 2012), 17 October 2012, 6 November
2012, 15 November 2012, 16 November, 5 December 2012 (following the meeting
with the Minister of Investment on 14 November 2012 and the Minister of Petroleum
on 27 November 2012), 10 December 2012 and 12 December 2012. It is unnecessary
here to recite the terms and contract of these communications: these are set out, to the

extent relevant, in Part V above.

As already found by the Tribunal, the Claimant has been almost ruined by the non-
supply of natural gas to the Claimant under the SPA; and the Damietta Plant has
become a “white elephant.” The Tribunal identifies two overlapping phases of this

curtailed supply for natural gas feeding the Plant.

The first phase from early 2010 originated from the Respondent’s own policies. As
described more fully in Part VIII above, these were long-standing policies of
subsidising domestic users of gas and electricity, together with the failure to
encourage the finding of gas deposits in Egypt (notwithstanding a statement of policy
otherwise). Beginning before 2010, the Respondent over-stimulated local demand for
natural gas by providing subsidies to consumers of gas and electricity (generated from
gas) and by encouraging local industries to convert to gas; and, on the supply side, by
pricing and other policies that restricted the further development by local gas

producers of Egypt’s natural gas resources.

The results were foreseeable and actually foreseen in the Wood Mackenzie report of

28 May 2007 on SEGAS’ Damietta LNG Financing (see Part V above). It identified

Part IX — Page 39 of 46

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 275 of 347

(inter alia) a “supply-demand gap” emerging in the short term (2009-2010) unless
“progress is made on signing upstream GSAs and sanctioning new development
projects this year [2007].” The Respondent chose not to encourage the finding and
development of further gas deposits in Egypt; and, as a result, together with its
policies on subsidising domestic users of gas and gas-produced electricity, the

curtailment of feed gas to the Damietta Plant was inevitable.

9.129 These consequences were acknowledged by the Minister of Petroleum. In his public
address on 24 March 2014, the Minister recognised that there was in Egypt an
“irrational consumption due to subsidy.”'®! That “irrationality” had begun after the
SPA’s execution with the Ministry’s strategy to focus on the local demand for natural
gas and give it “absolute priority.” It was not reasonable foreseeable, nor actually

foreseen by UFACEX (or the Claimant) in August 2000.

9.130 As to this first phase, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent frustrated the
Claimant’s legitimate expectations derived from the Ministry of Petroleum’s

undertaking in regard to the SPA, in the form of its letter dated 5 August 2000.

9.131 The second phase began with EGAS notice of force majeure on 24 February 2013.
Before that date, the Respondent had decided to discriminate between users of gas.
Exercising its sovereign authority and public powers, the Respondent directed EGAS
to limit and eventually stop the supply of feed gas under the SPA to the Damietta
Plant. The Respondent’s decision to discriminate against the Plant placed an excessive
and disproportionate burden on the Claimant, in comparison to other non-consumer

users of gas supplied by EGAS in Egypt, both Egyptian and Non-Egyptian.

9.132 In his speech to the Egyptian Parliament on 15 October 2012, the Minister for
Petroleum explained that the Respondent had stopped the exporting of gas to Jordan
and Spain “because of increasing consumption in the domestic market.”!® The
reference to Spain clearly indicated the Claimant’s exports to Spain from the Damietta

Plant: it was the only exporter of Egyptian natural gas to Spain.

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 276 of 347

There had earlier been a meeting between the Claimant and the Minister of Petroleum
on 16 September 2012, in response to the Claimant’s letter dated 26 August 2012. The
meeting is described in the testimony of Mr Egea Krauel and Mr Saez Ramirez,!® as
also in the Claimant’s contemporary letter dated 21 September 2012. The Minister
stated that he was “in the process of reviewing the situation of every exporter [of
natural gas]” (including the Claimant), and that he was “analysing the contractual
frameworks and the legal conditions for stopping gas deliveries to one consumer in
order to improve supply to other gas users.” As recited in Part V, Mr Egea Krauel
testified that the Claimant realised from the Minister’s statements that “UFG had been
singled out as the offtaker of gas from the grid whose supply would be indefinitely

interrupted.”

Following this meeting and the absence of any material response from the Ministry of
Petroleum, the Claimant’s letter dated 9 October 2012 to the Minister stated (inter

alia) as follows:

UFG expresses concern to EGAS about EGAS’ discriminatory treatment
of UFG in the supply of gas. As we had the opportunity to discuss in such
meetings, UFG is deeply worried because of the current situation of the
feed gas supply to Damietta Plant since, despite of our constant spirit of
cooperation, the actual level of supply in the past few months has been
considerably lower than EGAS commitments in previous meetings and
tremendously below the contractual volumes under the SPA and the
agreed Minimum Feed Gas Commitment for the period. Far from
improving, the situation has further deteriorated to the point that no
supply of gas has been delivered to the Damietta Plant since 16 July 2012,
as explained in more detail below. Furthermore, this shortage of supply
represents a clear discriminatory measure against UFG by EGAS and the
Egyptian authorities, as evidenced by the fact that the supply of gas has
not been interrupted to other consumers (such as, for example, the
liquefaction plant in Idku) [...]

The Damietta Plant was shut down in early November 2013, for want of feed gas.
Subsequent public and private statements by the Minister of Petroleum further
confirmed that the Damietta Plant had been targeted by the Respondent in favour of
supplying gas to other users and consumers in Egypt, both Egyptian and Non-

Egyptian.

As reported in the press on 24 November 2013, the Minister of Petroleum stated that,

as regards “the Spanish Union Fenosa,” “we should first cover [the] local market’s
need from natural gas.”!® In a private meeting with the Claimant on 26 November
2013, so Mr Egea Krauel and Mr Saez Ramirez testified (as also confirmed in the
Claimant’s letter dated 5 December 2013 to the Minister), the Minister said that Egypt
will in fact not comply with its obligations in the near future and that “he could not
give us any gas because the Ministry had to prioritize the gas to power generation

plants throughout the country, as well as other industrial consumers.”!®

As the Claimant correctly concluded, it was politically more expedient for the
Respondent to curtail and cut supply to one large consumer (i.e. the Claimant) than to

apportion a reduction of supply across different users equitably.

In the Tribunal’s view, as regards both phases, the Respondent’s decisions to cut and
curtail gas supply to the Damietta Plant was, by its nature and purpose, a sovereign act
by the Respondent under international law. It was also, of course, a political decision
by the Respondent in the broadest sense. It was not a decision required by Egyptian
law; and it was not a commercial or operational decision originating with EGAS. It
was, in fact, a decision against EGAS’ commercial interest, given the higher prices
under the SPA and the lower prices for the subsidised Egyptian electricity sector. Nor
was the decision the enforced result of the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2008 or the
Egyptian revolution during 2011-2014: the decision would have been made without
these events or their consequences, given the Respondent’s earlier long-term policies
on the development of new gas field, compounded by gas subsidies favouring

domestic users, well established before 2010.

As regards the Respondent’s undertaking by reference to Article 15 of the SPA, the
Respondent’s discrimination against the Damietta Plant conflicted with the definition
of force majeure in Article 15.2, Sub-paragraph (A) of the SPA, precluding
discriminatory treatment compared to “any other present or future purchaser/s [sic] of

LNG”.

The fact of such discrimination was established by the expert testimony from Mr
Goncalves (of BRG) in this arbitration. He analysed four different categories of gas
users in Egypt: (i) industrial plants; (ii) power plants; (iii) LNG exporters of Egyptian
LNG; and (iv) pipeline exporters of Egyptian gas. He concluded that the curtailment

of gas to the Damietta Plant began first, lasted longer and was the most severe.

From a total of 58.8 Bema supplied in 2012-2013, the power plants received 28.9
Bema; industrial customers 14.8 Bema; the Idku Plant 5.7 Bema; and the Damietta
Plant 0.3 Bema.'97 As regards LNG and Pipeline export curtailments from 2006 to
2011, the Damietta Plant’s supply was curtailed by 60.5%, the Idku Plant by 6.6% and
the pipelines by 22.7%. °°

During the same period, the Damietta Plant’s supply of gas was curtailed by 96%,
whereas foreign-owned industrial plants were curtailed by 15% to 34%; namely EFC
(Netherlands) as to 28%, EBIC (Netherlands) as to 34%, Emethanex (Canada) as to
25%, and Lafarge (France) as to 15%.'° As to Egyptian-owned industries, there were
no curtailments or only minor curtailments; namely Alexandria FC none prior to
2014, Misr FPC none before mid-2014, Helwan FC none prior to mid-2015; Misr
BSC minor disruptions prior to late 2013, and SVC minor disruptions also prior to late

2013.17

The Respondent’s conduct also conflicted with the exclusion from force majeure,
under Article 15.3 of the SPA, of “market conditions” and suspensions of an

indefinite period extending beyond force majeure situations.

Thus, by reason of these three factors, the Respondent is not entitled to relief from
liability under the FET standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty based upon the proviso
regarding force majeure subsumed by the letter dated 5 August 2000 from the

Ministry of Petroleum.

In the Tribunal’s view, over these two phases of limited and non-supply of natural gas
to the Plant, the Respondent’s conduct failed to meet its obligations under the FET

standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty, taking into account as a relevant factor the

legitimate expectations generated by the Respondent’s undertaking in the form of the
Ministry of Petroleum’s letter dated 5 August 2000, as described above. The
Respondent’s undertaking is the decisive tipping factor in establishing the
Respondent’s breach of Article 4(1) of the Treaty. In the Tribunal’s view, it colours
the Respondent’s conduct as an exercise lacking good faith or, in the words of Merrill

v. Canada (2010) conduct that was materially “unjust”, “discriminatory” and “unfair.”

In the absence of such an undertaking, the Tribunal does not consider that the
Claimant has established on the evidence before this Tribunal any other violation of
Articles 3(1), 4(1), 4(2) or 4(5) of the Treaty. The Respondent’s conduct (by itself and
by EGAS attributable to the Respondent), absent this tipping factor, does not meet the
exacting test for a violation of the FET standard, as decided in Merrill v. Canada
(2010) and other legal materials cited by the Parties. In any event, having found the
Respondent liable under the FET standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty on the basis of
the Ministry’s letter dated 5 August 2000, it would be otiose for the Tribunal to
address these other claims by the Claimant: their grounds can add nothing material to

the Respondent’s liability under the FET standard under Article 4(1) of the Treaty.

(ii) Lost Dividends: The Claimant claims a total principal sum of US$ 404,745,000 for
injury in the form of “Lost Dividends” as a shareholder in EGAS resulting from the
non-payment of tolling fees by EGAS to SEGAS under the EGAS Tolling Contract.
This loss was indirectly consequential (at last in in material part) upon EGAS’
curtailment of feed gas to the Damietta Plant under the SPA. In principle, subject to
issues of compensation considered later in Part X this Award, the Tribunal decides
that this claim succeeds as regards a technical breach of the Respondent’s undertaking
(in the form of the Ministry of Petroleum’s letter dated 5 August 2000) of the FET
standard under Article 4(1) of the Treaty.

(iii) The Free Zone Claim: The Claimant claims a total principal sum of US$ 107
million for injury suffered from the revocation of SEGAS’ Free Zone status on 5 May

2008, by the Law No. 114.

As recited in Part V, SEGAS held a licence to operate “as a private Free Zone

Company” under Egyptian Law, namely Law No. 8 of 1997 on Investment

Part IX — Page 44 of 46

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 280 of 347

Guarantees and Incentives.!7! Under Article 35 of Law No 8, profits and dividends of
projects established in Free Zones “shall not be subject to the provisions of Egyptian

tax and regulations.”!’? SEGAS acquitted its licence on 9 December 2001.!73

9.150 Under Law No 114 of 2008, the Respondent revoked all Free Zone licences and tax
exemptions for companies in the natural gas industry.' As a result, SEGAS suffered
losses from increased taxes and the Claimant, so it submits, suffered consequential

losses of US$ 107 million.

9.151 The revocation of Free Zone licences did not target SEGAS. Such revocation was
applied generally to licence holders, following a budgetary decision by the
Respondent to increase national wages. SEGAS had no agreement with the
Respondent or its agencies for stabilisation of the tax regime. There was no guarantee,
under Egyptian law or the Treaty, that the tax regime in the zone would remain

forever unchanged during the 25-year term of the SPA.

9.152 As decided by the ICSID tribunal in E/ Paso v. Argentina (2011),'% “Such a standard
of behaviour, if strictly applied, is not realistic, nor is it the [Treaty]’s purpose that
States guarantee that the economic and legal conditions in which investments take
place will remain unaltered ad infinitum.” The UNCITRAL tribunal in Encana Corp.
v. Ecuador (2006) came to a similar conclusion: “In the absence of a specific
commitment from the host State, the foreign investor has neither the right nor any
legitimate expectation that the tax regime will not change, perhaps to its disadvantage,

during the period of the investment.”!”6

9.153 In the Tribunal’s view, the revocation of SEGAS’ licence was not discriminatory or
otherwise a breach of the FET standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty or of Articles
3(1), 4(2) or 4(5) of the Treaty. The Respondent’s undertaking in regard to the SPA
by the Ministry’s letter of 5 August 2015 to the Claimant did not extend to SEGAS’s

 

tax status. That status, subsequently acquired by a licence was independent from the

supply of gas to the Damietta Plant under the SPA. In short, there was no “legitimate
expectation” by the Respondent, still less SEGAS, that SEGAS’s tax status would not
be changed.

For all these reasons, the Tribunal dismisses the Claimant’s Free Zone Claim under
the Treaty incurred as a result of the revocation of SEGAS’ tax status as a Free Zone

company.
(5) Summary of Decisions

For the reasons set out above, subject to further issues addressed in the following
Parts of this Award, the Tribunal decides that the Claimant established the liability of
the Respondent for breach of its obligations under the FET standard in Article 4(1) the
Treaty, in regard to certain of its claims made by reference to Respondent’s

undertaking by its Ministry of Petroleum’s letter dated 5 August 2000.

The Tribunal does not consider that the Claimant established the liability of the
Respondent for breach of its obligations under the FET standard in Article 4(1) the
Treaty, absent the Respondent’s said undertaking.

The Tribunal dismisses as to liability under the Treaty the Claimant’s Free Zone

Claim in the sum of US$ 107 million.

In these circumstances, the Tribunal thinks it unnecessary to address the Claimant’s
case under Articles 3(1), 4(2) and 4(5) of the Treaty, which cannot affect any of the

decisions summarized above.

PART X: THE COMPENSATION ISSUES

(1) Introduction

10.1 In this Part X of the Award, the Tribunal summarises the Parties’ respective
submissions and applies the legal principles applicable to an award of compensation
under the FET standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty and international law. The
Claimants advances four alternative case as to compensation, all of which are put in

issue by the Respondent.

10.2 Primary Case: As to its primary case, the Claimant claims compensation for the
period from 2006 to 2015 in the total principal amount of US$ 3,219,458,000 (before
interest). This amount comprises: (I) US$ 2,814,713,000 as “Nominal Lost Cash
Flows on Contractual Rights,” i.e. incremental costs from the non-delivery of natural
gas under the SPA; and (II) US$ 404,745,000 for “Lost Dividends” as a shareholder
in SEGAS.!

10.3. The Claimant’s incremental costs under (I), against a “but for” delivery of natural gas
from the Seller under the SPA totalling 1,312 trillion BTUs between 2006 and 2015,
comprise: (i) US$ 678 million for increased operating costs from 547 trillion BTUs of
gas delivered in Egypt; (ii) US$ 1.745 billion for increased costs to purchase 459
trillion BTUs replacement gas for gas not delivered in Egypt; (iii) US$ 613 million for
306 trillion BTUs for losses from 306 trillion BTUs of gas not delivered in Egypt and
not replaceable by the Claimant; and (iv) US$ 107 million from the loss of SEGAS’
Free Zone status, based on “the nominal international damages claim of US$ 3.2

billion.”

10.4 As regards the latter claim for US$ 107 million, the Tribunal has decided that the
Respondent is not liable under the Treaty for such claim. Accordingly, this claim is

not considered as regards compensation in this Part X of the Award.

10.5 As to (i) increased operating costs, these comprised: (a) the cost of gas under the SPA;

and (b) shipping expenses and losses.?

As to (iii) gas not delivered in Egypt and not replaceable, the losses are calculated by
reference to the Claimant’s increased unit costs resulting from non-deliveries of gas
measured against the volume of gas which should have been delivered under
the SPA.°

The Claimant’s lost dividends of US$ 404,745,000 under (II), derive from fees
payable but unpaid by EGAS to SEGAS under the SEGAS Tolling Contract of 2003,
in the form of unpaid dividends payable by SEGAS to the Claimant (as SEGAS’

majority shareholder).

The Claimant acknowledged at the Hearing, that its figures should be reduced overall
by US$ 220 million to reflect the Claimant’s lesser need for working capital and
taxes, as submitted by the Respondent and its expert witness, Mr MacGregor (of

BDO).

First Alternative Case: In its first alternative case, the Claimant claims compensation
in the total principal amount of US$ 2,826,868,000 (before interest). This amount

compris (i) US$ 2,422,123,000 as “Nominal Lost Cash Flows on Contractual

 

Rights,” i.e. for the non-delivery of natural gas under the SPA (but here excluding
“lost profits” in the amount of US$ 613 million); and (ii) the same US$ 404,745,000
for “Lost Dividends” as a shareholder in SEGAS.*

Second Alternative Case: In its second alternative case, the Claimant claims
compensation in the total principal amount of US$ 2,580,991,000 (before interest).

This amount excludes from the Claimant’s primary case losses by UFGC, if not

suffered by the Claimant under international law (contrary to the Claimant’s

submission).”

Third Alternative Case: In its third alternative case, the Claimant claims
compensation in the total principal amount of US$ 2,418,036,000 (before interest).
This amount is calculated by reference to the limiting terms of the SPA as to
compensation for “lost profits” etc. It comprises: (i) US$ 2,013,291,000 as the
Claimant’s “Lost Cash Flows”;!° and (ii) US$ 404,745,000 as the Claimant’s “Lost
Dividends” (as a shareholder in SEGAS). It excludes the Claimant’s claim for US$
107 million for loss of SEGAS’ Free Zone status. It also excludes losses suffered by
UFGC prior to June 2013; but it includes the Claimant’s own “incremental costs
passed on by UFGC to UFG” from June 2013 onwards in the amount of US$
291,894,832.!!

The Claimant acknowledged that it is not entitled to “double-recovery” for amounts
awarded in the CRCICA and ICC arbitrations. As it acknowledged in its written
pleadings:
To the extent that UFG receives an award in the commercial arbitrations
that provides damages sought in this arbitration, this Tribunal may deduct
such an amount from its award in order to remove the possibility of
double-recovery. Similarly, to the extent this Tribunal awards damages

before the conclusion of the commercial cases, EGAS may seek an offset in
any award issued by the commercial tribunals. '*

The Tribunal summarises the Parties’ respective cases on compensation below. The
Tribunal emphasises, again, that these summaries are necessarily abbreviations of the

Parties’ respective full cases on compensation.
(2) The Claimant’s Case

In summary, the Claimant submits that it is entitled to full compensation, according to

the principles established in the PCIJ’s decision in Chorzéw Factory (1928).

10.16 In that case, the Permanent Court of International Justice expressed the general
principle of compensation as follows: “reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all
the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all
probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.” The Permanent Court

of International Justice also noted that “the compensation due [...] is not necessarily

 

limited to the value of the undertaking at the moment of dispossession, plus interest to

the day of payment.”

10.17 According to the Claimant, the Chorzéw Factory standard was adopted by the Iran-
US Claims Tribunal in Amoco v. Iran (1987):'4

According to the Court in Chorzéw Factory, an obligation of reparation of
all the damages sustained by the owner of expropriated property arises
from an unlawful expropriation. The rules of international law relating to
international responsibility of States apply in such a case. They provide for
restitutio in integrum: restitution in kind, or if impossible, its monetary
equivalent. If need be, ‘damages for loss sustained which would not be
covered by restitution’ should also be awarded.

10.18 The same standard was applied by the Tribunal in MTD v. Chile (2004)'° and in

several other decisions.

10.19 According to the Claimant, the Chorzéw Factory standard of compensation has been
applied with respect to treaty violations, other than expropriation. Specifically, it was
applied to a violation of the obligation to provide full protection and security, as in

AAPL vy Sri Lanka:'®

Both parties are equally in agreement about the principle, according to
which, in case of property destruction, the amount of the compensation
due has to be calculated in a manner that adequately reflects the full value
of the investment lost as a result of said destruction and the damages
incurred as a result thereof.

10.20 The Claimant relies on the decision in Compania de Aguas v. Argentina (2007),
where the tribunal decided that it was generally accepted that “regardless of the nature

of the illegitimate measure, the level of damages awarded in international investment

arbitration is supposed to be sufficient to compensate the affected party fully and to

eliminate the consequences of the state’s action.”!”

10.21 Finally, the Claimant cites the decision of the Annulment Committee in Azurix v.
Argentina (2009), as determining that the Tribunal has a discretion in determining

what approach it should take as to damages. '*

10.22 The Claimant contends that the application of the Chorzéw Factory standard to the
present case means that it is entitled to compensation representing the cash flows that
the Claimant’s investment would have generated had the Respondent not violated the
Treaty by curtailing and then stopping the supply of gas to the Damietta Plant, and by
depriving SEGAS of its status as a tax-free company in the Damietta Free Zone.'? In
particular, the Claimant contends that it is entitled to compensation under the
following headings:?°

(i) Lost cash flows arising from its failure to receive, and therefore inability to

on-sell, gas to which it was entitled under the SPA from 2006 to 2015; and

(ii) Dividends it would have received from SEGAS had the Damietta Plant received
the gas it should have received under the SPA, with the EGAS and UFG Tolling
Contracts, from 2006 to the end of 2014.

10.23 The Claimant relies upon the expert report prepared by Mr Kaczmarek and
Mr Sequeira (of Navigant) and the oral testimony of Mr Sequeira. These expert
witnesses calculated that the Claimant’s total damages from 2006 to 2015 amounted,
on its primary case, to the total principal sum of US$ 3,219,458 (post tax, without
interest). These expert witnesses made similar calculations on different hypotheses
(resulting in different figures) for the Claimant’s first, second and third alternative
cases. For the Claimant’s third alternative case, they calculated the total principal sum

of US$ 2,418,036,000 (post tax, without interest).

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 287 of 347

10.24 The Claimant submits that its lost cash flows were sustained with respect to three
different types of transactions it undertook to on-sell gas through its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. First, the Claimant and its subsidiaries had long-term supply contracts in
Spain with four further related companies (all subsidiaries of Gas Natural Fenosa or
“GNF”), which it had intended to satisfy with gas from the Damietta Plant. Instead,
the Claimant and its subsidiaries have had to buy more expensive gas in order to
fulfill their existing supply obligations. They also had to reduce their on-selling
commitments. Second, the Claimant and its subsidiaries sold gas to industrial
consumers in Spain under one-year renewable contracts. Sales pursuant to these
contracts had to be reduced. Third, the Claimant and its subsidiaries sold gas in the

international market, which had to be stopped altogether.”!

10.25 To the extent that some gas was still produced by the Damietta Plant during the
relevant period (2006-2015), that gas was more expensive for the Claimant, because
the Damietta Plant ran less efficiently with reduced capacity, the Claimant had to
make Toll-or-Pay payments to SEGAS under the UFG Tolling Contract when it could
not satisfy its allotted capacities, and the Claimant incurred additional logistical

costs.”

10.26 In their expert testimony, Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira concluded that, if the full
volumes of gas required under the SPA had been provided by the Seller, the Claimant
(with its subsidiaries) would have had additional cash flows from the sale of that gas
in the amount of US$ 2.881 billion. This figure was reached by predicting the total
income that the Claimant (with its subsidiaries) would have derived from sale of the
full volumes of gas, and then subtracting the income that was actually earned, as well

as the cost of operating expenses.”

10.27 The Claimant defends Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira’s testimony. It was not
“speculative,” contrary to the Respondent’s assertion. It is based on tangible historical
data showing the price that the Claimant was likely to have been able to sell the gas
volumes in a “but for” scenario. When arbitration tribunals have criticised damages

claims as being too speculative, they have referred to claims for future losses based on

Part X — Page 6 of 32

speculative predictions that the claimant company would make profits in the future,
even though there was no evidence that the company had made profits in the past. The
Claimant contends that the Respondent’s criticism of Mr Kaczmarek and Mr

Sequeira’s report as being “speculative” is therefore inapposite.”+

10.28 The Claimant also rejects the Respondent’s other criticisms of Mr Kaczmarek and Mr
Sequeira’s testimony, submitting that most of those criticisms related to formatting
matters. The Claimant notes that the few technical errors identified by the Respondent

result in a reduction of only 1.3% in the compensation claimed by the Claimant.”

10.29 Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira’s

 

ssumptions in calculating the Claimant’s income

and operating expenses but for the Respondent’s breaches, were as follows:

(i) | The volume of sales that would have been provided under the SPA but for the
Respondent’s breaches of the Treaty should be calculated without reference to
the HOA and the Transient Agreement, because both agreements were only

26

entered into in consequence of the Respondent’s breaches of the Treaty;

(ii) The Claimant’s operating costs would have been lower but for the Respondent’s

breaches of the Treaty, because (inter alia):?”

i. The price of purchasing gas from the Damietta Plant would have been

lower than the price of purchasing gas on the international spot market;

ii. The per-unit cost of producing LNG at the Damietta Plant would have

been lower had the Plant been operating at full capacity;

iii. If the Respondent had complied with obligations, the Claimant would not

have had to make Toll-or-Pay payments under the UFG Tolling Contract;

iv. If the Respondent had complied with its obligations, then the Claimant
(with its subsidiaries) would have been able to on-sell more gas by way of

the three types of transactions set out above. As it was, the Claimant had

to reduce each type of onsell to the extent possible. Mr Kaczmarek and Mr

Sequeira refer to these as the “unreplaced volumes”;?* and

v. All increases in the gas prices that the Claimant and EGAS agreed in side
letters and in the HOA amending the SPA would have occurred even if

supplies had not been reduced. The Claimant asserts that this is a

  

gi

. «99
conservative assumption.””

The Claimant contends that the losses suffered by its Spanish subsidiary (UFGC) are
attributable to the Claimant because international tribunals routinely treat companies
within the same group as comprising the same economic reality, when appropriate.
The Claimant relies on the “group of companies doctrine” applied in Dow Chemical
France (1982),*° where an arbitration agreement was extended to a non-signatory
because “irrespective of the distinct juridical identity of each of its members, a group

of companies constitutes one and the same economic reality.”>!

The Claimant distinguishes the award in Gemplus v. Mexico (2010),*? which (so the
Respondent submits) decided that a shareholder could not directly claim losses
suffered by another company, even where its has ownership interests; and that its
claim at most would be limited to demonstrable losses suffered to its shareholding in
that other company. The Claimant submits that here the position is materially

different, where the Claimant effectively owns and controls EGPC.**

UFGC is 99.99% owned by the Claimant. It has no employees; and it is run entirely
by the Claimant’s employees who see it as a “tool company.”*4 The Claimant is
required by Spanish regulations to have its gas marketed in Spain through an entity
separate from the members of the corporate group that participates in different

activities. This is the reason why the Claimant sold the gas to UFGC.** However,

UFGC’s activities form the comerstone of the Claimant’s business. Without its
profits, the Claimant would not be a viable company.*° When the Claimant negotiated
with the Respondent for the construction of the Damietta Plant and the supply of gas,
the Respondent was always aware that the Claimant’s purpose was to sell gas in

Spain. The Claimant would not have entered into the negotiations but for this purpose.

It is therefore appropriate to treat the Claimant and UFGC as functionally equivalent

entities because, to fulfill that purpose, the Claimant necessarily had to sell gas

through UFGC. In consequence, so the Claimant contends, it is appropriate to treat the

Claimant and UFGC as part of the same economic reality, and for the latter’s losses to

be treated as the Claimant’s losses for its claims against the Respondent.*”

10.33 Further, the Claimant contends that it is entitled to claim directly for UFGC’s losses
because it is contemplated in the SPA that the Claimant would be able to do so.
Article 8.1 of the SPA specifically permits the Claimant to claim for “third party’s
claims and penalties against [the Claimant].” As the Claimant absorbed UFGC’s
additional costs by way of adjustments to transfer pricing and, from mid-2012
onwards, by directly compensating UFGC for its losses, then if UFGC really is to be
treated as separate to the Claimant (as the Respondent submits), then UFGC is a
“third party” and all of these losses are “claims” within the meaning of Article 8.1 of
the SPA.**

10.34 Alternatively, the Claimant contends, its losses amounted to 99.99% of UFGC’s

losses.*

 

10.35 Alternatively, Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira have calculated the amount that the
Claimant directly lost in revenue, rather than the amount that UFGC lost in revenue.
This calculation is based on the Claimant’s submission that it always transferred any
of UFGC’s profits and losses to itself by way of its control of the transfer prices
charged to UFGC for sales of gas. The transfer prices the Claimant charged to UFGC

were consistently adjusted to maintain a consistent (and low) level of profits or losses

in UFGC. Therefore, losses suffered by UFGC as a result of the curtailment of supply

to the Damietta Plant were absorbed by the Claimant.*°

10.36 Moreover, some of the replacement gas purchased on the international spot market, in
order to replace the volumes of gas needed to satisfy UFGC’s supply obligations, was
purchased by the Claimant. Therefore, these losses were directly suffered by the

Claimant.*!

10.37 According to the Claimant, from mid-2013, UFGC’s losses were such that it the
Claimant recognised that it needed to amend its contract with UFGC. It therefore
executed an addendum which provided that it would compensate UFGC on a monthly
basis for costs associated with the purchase of replacement volumes of gas. Thus,
from mid-2013, all of UFGC’s losses incurred by having to purchase more expensive
gas, to replace the lost volumes from the Damietta Plant, were directly attributable to

the Claimant.

10.38 In its Reply, the Claimant responds to the Respondent’s argument that its cash flow
losses must be limited by the terms of the SPA. The Claimant says that this
misconstrues its claim. It is a claim for breaches of the Treaty by the Respondent. It is
not for breaches of the SPA by EGAS, even though the breaches of the Treaty also
involved breaches of the SPA.*? The Claimant cites, in support of this distinction, the
award in Kardassopoulos and Fuchs v. Georgia (2010).4

10.39 As this Tribunal was constituted under the Treaty and not the SPA, the Claimant
contends that the SPA’s provisions do not provide the legal framework for

determining compensation due from the Respondent under the Treaty.*5

10.40 The Claimant submits that the Respondent also misconstrues the Chorzow Factory

test by seeking to put the Claimant in the position it would have been in had it made a

claim under the SPA, not the position it would have been in had the Respondent not

violated the Treaty.*®

10.41 Further, Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira have calculated that, even applying the
SPA’s limitations on recoverable damages, the Claimant’s losses from reduced cash
flows amount to US$ 2,013,291,000.*’ (This is the part of the Claimant’s third

alternative case on compensation, described above).
10.42 These losses are calculated by reference to:

(i) | The Claimant’s increased costs of lifting and transporting gas from the Damietta
Plant (which were increased because the cost of processing gas remained
relatively fixed but because the Claimant could not lift full quantities of LNG

the lifting and transporting cost per unit increased);** and

(ii) The Claimant’s increased costs of purchasing replacement volumes of gas from

the international spot market.*?

10.43. The Claimant contends that it is entitled to claim these additional costs by reference to
Article 8.1 of the SPA. Although Article 8.1 limits the amount of damages the
Claimant can claim under the SPA to the value of 90% of gas volumes not supplied
by EGAS to the Damietta Plant, that value is greater than the Claimant’s losses.
Therefore, Article 1 does not impose a cap on the Claimant’s losses claimed in this

arbitration.

10.44 On the basis of Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira’s expert testimony, the Claimant
contends that, as at 2015, its post-tax lost dividends from SEGAS arising from the
Respondent’s breaches of the Treaty, amount to US$ 303,559,000. Grossed up to
account for the tax, the principal amount is US$ 404,745,000.

10.45 As to these lost dividends, the Claimant submits that SEGAS’ only sources of income
were Tolling Fees and Toll-or-Pay Fees, which are alternative fees that both the

Claimant and EGAS were required to pay SEGAS under the EGAS and UFG Tolling

Contracts. The Claimant contends that, from November 2012, EGAS stopped making
Toll-or-Pay payments to SEGAS under the EGAS Tolling Contract (even with respect
to payments then already overdue); and that EGAS has not made any such payments

since.

A portion of EGAS’ Toll-or-Pay payments for 2011, and the entire 2012, 2013 and
2014 Toll-or-Pay payments remain outstanding.*! This coincided with the complete
stoppage of all gas supplies to the Damietta Plant, meaning that neither EGAS nor the
Claimant were any longer required to pay Tolling Fees to SEGAS.

In the circumstances, EGAS’ failure to make its Toll-or-Pay payments put SEGAS in
financial jeopardy and rendered it unable to distribute any dividends, such that it
distributed only limited dividends to the Claimant in 2011 and 2012. Moreover, so
the Claimant contends, starting in 2008 and more frequently from 2012, SEGAS
requested advance payments under the Tolling Contracts from its Tollers to meet its
expenses (i.e., EGAS and the Claimant). The Claimant made these advance payments;
but EGAS has not.*?

The Claimant contends that the reduction in dividends paid by SEGAS was caused by
the Respondent’s breaches of the Treaty. Had the Respondent not curtailed the gas
supply to the Damietta Plant, then EGAS would have been liable to pay Tolling Fees,
rather than Toll-or-Pay Fees. If EGAS had paid Tolling Fees, then SEGAS would
have been put in a financial position to distribute dividends to the Claimant.*

Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira have calculated that, if the full volumes of gas to the
Damietta Plant had been supplied (and if SEGAS’ Free Zone company status had not
been revoked), then the Claimant would have received US$ 252.3 million more in
dividends from SEGAS.* This conclusion was reached by calculating what SEGAS’

income would have been, using the monthly tolling price under the Tolling Contracts.

The Claimant submits that this is a conservative calculation because:*°

(i) It results in a lower amount than an alternative method, using the Tolling
Contracts’ provision for the tolling price to be revised at the end of each year to

ensure an 11% return on equity to investors; and

(ii) Although a higher monthly tolling price was agreed in 2012, which would have
resulted in a greater than 11% return to investors, Mr Kaczmarek and Mr

Sequeira’s calculations from 2012 are capped at an 11% return on equity.

10.51 The Claimant contends that its claim for lost dividends cannot be curtailed by any
limitations on damages contained in the SPA, because the SPA does not govern

dividends paid out by SEGAS to its shareholders, including the Claimant.*°

10.52 The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s submission that the Claimant failed

unreasonably to mitigate its losses.

10.53. The Claimant reduced its downstream commitments, where possible, in order to

reduce the costs of buying more expensive replacement gas to fulfill those

1

by ‘hing for the cheapest possible gas,*” by allowing
supply contracts to expire and therefore reducing its market share in Spain,** and by
declaring force majeure to some of its customers in 2014.°° However, the Claimant’s
ability to do so was impaired by the Respondent’s and EGAS’ continual
representations from 2006 to late 2013 that EGAS would meet its contractual
commitments in future, including representations set out in various side-letters and

amendments to the SPA.“°

10.54 In these circumstances, it was reasonable for the Claimant to have waited until 2014
to declare force majeure on its downstream supply contracts, because of the doubts

that existed over whether an unpredictable, fluctuating and insufficient supply of gas

constituted a force majeure event.°!

The Claimant has also requested an order that the Respondent pay pre-award and
post-award interest, based on international commercial rates. The Claimant relies on

three alternative interest calculations performed by Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira:

(i) The LIBOR + 2.5% rate (which the SPA applies to late payments), and a form

of which international arbitral tribunals often apply;

(ii) The US Prime rate of interest + 2%, with the 2% addition to reflect the fact that
the US Prime rate is lower than that broadly available to the market. A form of

this rate is also used often by international arbitral tribunals;°> and

(iii) The yield on the Respondent’s sovereign bonds issued in US dollars, to reflect
the fact that the Claimant is effectively an unwilling lender to the Respondent.
As yields on US dollar denominated bonds of the Respondent were not available

for 2006-2009, a US Prime rate + 2% was used for this period.

The Claimant has requested that an award of interest be compounded. The Claimant
contends that an award of compound interest is the generally accepted standard for
compensation in international investment treaty arbitrations.®’ In support of this
proposition, it quotes from Middle East Cement v. Egypt (2002), Compania de Aguas
v. Argentina (2007), and Siag v. Egypt (2009).°*

The Claimant refers the Tribunal to the decision in Compania del Desarrollo v. Costa

Rica (2000) ® where two reasons were proposed for awarding compound interest:”°

(i) to ensure that a claimant receives ‘the full present value of the
compensation that it should have received at the time of the taking’; and
(ii) to prevent ‘the State [from being] unjustly [...] enrich[ed] [...] by
reason of the fact that the payment of compensation has long been
delayed.’

The Claimant also refers to Wena Hotels v. Egypt (2000),’! where the Tribunal

stated: 7

[A]n award of compound (as opposed to simple) interest is generally
appropriate in most modern, commercial arbitrations [...] ‘[A]lmost all
financing and modern investment vehicles involve compound interest. [...]
If the claimant could have received compound interest merely by placing
its money in a readily available and commonly used investment vehicle, it
is neither logical nor equitable to award the claimant only simple interest.

),’> where the

The Claimant relies on Bernardus Henricus v. Zimbabwe (2009
Tribunal decided that compound interest is a “‘mechanism to ensure that
compensation awarded to the Claimant is appropriate in the circumstances.’ This

explains why, in many ICSID cases, such compound interests have been granted.””*

In addition, the Claimant contends that the award of compound interest promotes
efficiency by removing an incentive for a respondent to delay the arbitral proceedings,
or payment of the award, so as to be able to profit from the use of money during that

time.”
(3) The Respondent’s Case

In summary, the Respondent contests the Claimant’s entitlement to compensation for

any liability under the Treaty, on four principal grounds.”®

First, the Respondent contends that a substantial portion of the damage of which the
Claimant complains was suffered by its subsidiary, UFGC, which was the Claimant’s
Spanish subsidiary. The Claimant sold the gas processed by the Damietta Plant to

UFGC, which then on-sold it to various Spanish customers.

It was UFGC, not the Claimant, that had contractual obligations to supply gas. Any
lost cash flow suffered by UFGC as a result of being unable to on-sell gas, that it

otherwise might have acquired, is a lost cash flow suffered by UFGC.

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 297 of 347

The Claimant’s calculation of its damages is therefore incorrect. It is based on prices
that UFGC would have charged to downstream customers, instead of the prices that

the Claimant would have charged to UFGC.

Further, it was UFGC, not the Claimant, that actually purchased gas on the
international spot market in order to fulfill its contractual obligations under its supply
contracts. Therefore, it was UFGC, not the Claimant, that incurred the higher cost of

that replacement gas.””

According to the Respondent, a claimant cannot directly claim losses suffered by

another company in which it has an ownership interest.

The Respondent relies on the decision in Gemplus v. Mexico (2010),”* in which the

ICSID tribunal decided:”

The Claimants’ claims for compensation derive only from their status as
investors with investments in the form of their respective minority
shareholdings in the Concessionaire, as distinct from any claim by the
Concessionaire itself. Perhaps inevitably, the Parties’ submiss
occasionally elided this important distinction, effectively treating the
valuation of the Concessionaire’s future profits (if any) as the relevant
exercise for the assessment of compensation due to the Claimants. The
exercise required of this Tribunal is, in contrast, the valuation of the
Claimants’ lost investments in the form of their shares in the
Concessionaire and not, as such, the lost profits incurred by the
Concessionaire under the Concession Agreement.

 

‘ions

In its Rejoinder, the Respondent contests the Claimant’s attempt to rely on Gemplus v.
Mexico (2010). The Respondent submits that the claimant in that case was allowed to
recover damages to a company in which it held shares only on the basis that the
shareholding was the investment protected under a BIT. That is not the case here in

regard to UFGC.*°

The Respondent’s Rejoinder also rejects the Claimant’s attempt to rely on a “single
economic reality” or “group of companies doctrine” to argue that UFGC’s losses

should be attributed to the Claimant. The Respondent contends that there is no

relevant authority supporting the use of such a doctrine in a situation like the present
case, where the subsidiary company that suffered losses was incorporated in a State

that was not the respondent State.*!

10.70 In particular, the Respondent contends that arbitral decisions concerning the scope of
private-party arbitration agreements are irrelevant to the question of attribution of
damages under international law.*? The fact that Spanish regulations require a
particular corporate structure is not relevant to deciding whether the Claimant should

be entitled to recover losses that were actually suffered by a different entity.**

10.71 The Respondent contends that the only way that UFGC’s losses can be relevant to
calculating compensation for the Claimant, is if the Claimant contends that its
damages arise from a loss of the value of its shareholding in UFGC. However, as the
Claimant has not asserted a claim for such damages, nor submitted any evidence on it,

this Tribunal cannot determine what such loss may amount to.**

10.72 On the Respondent’s case, the Claimant might also have made a claim for losses
suffered as a result of its transactions with UFGC. However, the Claimant has failed
to provide evidence relating to those transactions. It therefore cannot make such a

claim.*5

10.73. The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s contention that it is entitled under Article 8.1

of the SPA to claim for los:

 

s suffered by UFGC as a “third party” within the

 

meaning of that provision.*®

10.74 The Respondent contends that UFGC did not make any “claims” against the
Claimant, but rather: first, that the Claimant agreed to make payments to UFGC as
part of a commercial arrangement; second, that this agreement was driven by the
allocation of lost profits, which are not recoverable under Article 8.1; and that,
because the Claimant’s transfer pricing was motivated by a desire to keep UFGC’s

profits and losses at a particular level, that transfer pricing cannot have been caused

by any of the Respondent’s actions.8” Moreover, the Respondent contends that the
entitlement to losses for third party claims, under Article 8.1, does not apply if the

third party claims were the result of force majeure, as in this case.**

Second, the Respondent contends that the Claimant’s alleged losses are too
speculative and uncertain. It contends that Article 36(2) of the ILC Articles on State
Responsibility, codifying customary international law, only allows compensation for
assessable damage “insofar as it is established.”*? The Respondent also relies on the
ILC Commentary to Article 36, explaining that “[t]ribunals have been reluctant to

provide compensation for claims with inherently speculative elements.”””

Further, the tribunal in Amoco v. Iran (1987)?! decided:

One of the best settled rules of the law of international responsibility of
States is that no reparation for speculative or uncertain damage can be
awarded. [...] It does not permit the use of a method which yields
uncertain figures for the valuation of damages, even if the existence of
damages is certain. *

The Respondent submits that Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira’s testimony has failed
to establish the Claimant’s damages claim, because it contains errors, because its
calculations were not made on the basis of documents (but on the basis of
assumptions instructed by the Claimant’s Counsel), and because it uses spreadsheets
that are opaque, nearly incomprehensible, poorly supported, contain irrelevant
information, and omit useful information and important calculations. The Respondent

ds that there are s unexplained ii i ies between the figures Mr
Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira stated they were using, and the actual figures used in

their spreadsheets.

The Respondent concludes that Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira’s failure to

substantiate figures used in their calculations, and to explain those calculations, means

that the Claimant’s attempt to quantify its damages is too uncertain to be the basis of

any award by this Tribunal.”

10.79 Further, so the Respondent contends, there are speculative elements to the Claimant’s
alleged damages. First, Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira have assumed that the
Claimant or its subsidiaries would have been able to sell large volumes of gas in
Spain and on the international market, had it not been for the reduction of supplies to
the Damietta Plant. This is speculative, and not supported by the reality of the gas
markets, which saw a drop in prices and demand during the relevant period. Second,
because that demand for gas is speculative, it is also speculative for Mr Kaczmarek
and Mr Sequeira to have assumed that SEGAS would have processed gas to the

Damietta Plant’s full capacity during the whole of the relevant period.’

10.80 Another problem with Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira’s testimony, according to the
Respondent, is that they do not take into account price increases for natural gas agreed
by the Claimant, in the HOA and the Transient Agreement. Having agreed to them,

the Claimant cannot escape their terms.°5

10.81 With respect to the testimony of Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira, the Respondent
contends that the Claimant has not demonstrated a single instance of a supply contract
under which the Claimant was obligated to sell gas at a price that did not reflect the
price the Claimant actually paid for the gas. The Claimant’s expert reports are
presented in such a way that it is not possible to identify any such instances from

those reports.°°

10.82 Third, the Respondent contends that the Claimant’s entitlement to compensation is
limited by the terms of the SPA. The Respondent submits that the Claimant’s claims
are necessarily linked to the SPA because the compensation it seeks is essentially the
difference between (i) the SPA’s contractual volumes and pricing and (ii) the volumes
the Claimant contends it actually received and the prices it actually paid under the

SPA.’ Moreover, the Claimant, having elsewhere argued that the Respondent and

EGAS should be conflated, cannot now argue that the Respondent is not a party to the

SPA and abandon the SPA for the purposes of calculating its compensation.**

10.83. The Claimant’s legitimate expectations are also relevant to establishing the “but for”
scenario. The Respondent contends that those expectations are necessarily defined
and constrained by the terms of the SPA, because the volumes and prices on which
the Claimant has based calculations are ones that were agreed as a package that

included the SPA’s limitations on liability.°°

10.84 Put another way, the Claimant’s legitimate expectations were that EGAS would
comply with the SPA, and that compliance might be made either by providing the
agreed-upon gas volumes or by paying the agreed-upon damages.' In consequence,
any compensation to the Claimant for non-delivery of gas under the SPA should not

exceed the compensation the Claimant could have expected under the SPA.

10.85 Moreover, Article 8.1 of the SPA sets a cap on damages at 90% of the contractual
price of any gas not supplied, which was not taken into account in Mr Kaczmarek and
Mr Sequeira’s calculations. !°!

10.86 Article 8.1 of the SPA also excludes any entitlement to consequential damages and
loss of profits. The Respondent contends that this dooms the Claimant’s argument that
it is entitled to damages for both the unreplaced volumes of gas that it was unable to
on-sell, and for the replaced volumes of gas on which the Claimant and its
subsidiaries suffered losses by having to buy more expensive gas to meet downstream
supply obligations. Both types of damages are “lost profits.” The Respondent

ds that Mr K k and Mr Sequeira have ded that the claim for

unreplaced volumes is a claim for lost profits.'”

10.87 The Respondent contests the Claimant’s reliance on the decisions in Chorzéw Factory
(1928) and Kadassopoulos and Fuchs v. Georgia (2010) to argue that the SPA’s
limitations on recoverable damages do not apply to its claim. As these were cases

concerning expropriation of property, the question of how to assess damages was

completely different to the present case. Moreover, the Respondent contends that the
tribunal in the latter case did consider any contracts to be “relevant to the factual

matrix which underpins [the] claims.”!©

10.88 Fourth, the Respondent submits that the Claimant has failed to demonstrate that it has

mitigated any losses it suffered. The Respondent contends that, as the Claimant’s

 

downstream supply contracts were mainly with subsidiaries, it is unlikely that they
would have refused to cooperate if the Claimant had requested reductions in supply
commitments. The Respondent submits that the Claimant has not disclosed the
downstream supply contracts, nor provided information about its relationship with
downstream counterparties during the relevant period, such that the Claimant has not
proved it would have suffered any penalty had it failed to meet its supply
obligations. !
10.89 The Respondent contends that the Claimant’s business records show that its own
management thought that it should have declared force majeure on its downstream
supply contracts earlier than it did. By failing to do so until 2014, the Claimant failed

to mitigate its losses.'°°

10.90 Further, the Respondent contends that the Claimant had already purchased gas from
Oman, which was available for the Claimant to use to meet its downstream supply
obligations. Its failure to do so, and its purchase of more expensive gas on the
international spot market instead, is an instance of its failure to mitigate losses.!°°

10.91 Fifth, the Respondent attacks the amount of the Claimant’s asserted losses as a result
of reduced dividends paid from SEGAS. The Respondent contends that because there
was a force majeure situation, EGAS was no longer obliged to continue supplying gas
from either June 2012 (when that situation of force majeure arose) or from 24
February 2013 (when EGAS sent its second force majeure notice to the Claimant).

From one of those times, any loss of dividends to be paid by SEGAS cannot have

Claimant is not entitled to these damages. !°7

10.92 Sixth, the Respondent disputes the interest rates proposed by the Claimant, submitting
that a more appropriate rate would be: (i) the US T-Bill rate; or (ii) LIBOR + 1%, to

reflect the borrowing rate for companies like the Claimant. !°*

10.93 Lastly, the Respondent submits that any award of compensation to the Claimant
should be reduced to account for the severe economic difficulties faced by the

Respondent.!°

(4) The Tribunal’s Analyses and Decisions

10.94 Introduction: The Tribunal has determined that the Respondent has violated the FET
standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty. Its liability under Article 4(1) derives from the
Claimant’s legitimate expectations based upon the Ministry of Petroleum’s letter
dated 5 August 2003 in regard to Article 21.1 of the SPA. The assessment of
compensation therefore rests on the Respondent’s violation of Article 4(1) of the

Treaty. It does not rest upon the SPA itself.

10.95 Standard of Compensation: The Treaty does not set out a standard of compensation to
be applied in the case of any violations of the Treaty, save as regards expropriation
under Article 6 of the Treaty. Expropriation is not alleged by the Claimant to have

taken place, at least for the purpose of its present claims in this particular arbitration.

10.96 It follows that any compensation to be awarded by this Tribunal is to be decided by
applying principles of customary international law, namely “full reparation” to wipe
out, as far as possible, the consequences of the Respondent’s international wrongs
under the general principle long established in the PCIJ’s judgment in Chorséw
Factory (1928),''° as also confirmed by Articles 31 and 36 of the ILC Articles on

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 304 of 347

Article 36 of the ILC Articles provides:

1. The State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an
obligation to compensate for the damage caused thereby, insofar as such
damage is not made good by restitution.

2. The compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage
including loss of profits insofar as it is established.

The Tribunal also notes the Institute of International Law’s Resolution made in
Tokyo: “Legal Aspects of Recourse to Arbitration by an Investor Against the
Authorities of the Host State under Inter-State Treaties” of 13 September 2013.
Article 13, paragraph 3, provides: “[c]ompensation due to an investor for violation of
the FET standard shall be assessed without regard to compensation that could be
allocated in case of an expropriation, in accordance with the damage suffered by the

investor.”

Assessment of Compensation: The Tribunal accepts that both Parties’ expert witnesses
on the compensation issues, Messrs Kaczmarek and Sequeira (of Navigant) and Mr
MacGregor (of BDO), sought to assist the Tribunal in good faith, to the best of their
professional abilities. Many of their disagreements resulted from a different
appreciation of the factual evidence and different instructions from the Parties’
counsel as to the legal and other non-expert issues. Where there exist relevant
differences between these experts, save where otherwise indicated below, the Tribunal

has preferred to be guided by the testimony of Messrs Kaczmarek and Sequeira.

10.100 As is now not unusual for an investor-State tribunal, this Tribunal is confronted with

the awkward task of assessing compensation based on a multiplicity of factual, legal
and expert issues, as to which the Parties and their experts come to very different
figures. It is therefore necessary to explain at the outset the Tribunal’s general

approach to the assessment of compensation.

10.101 The assessment of compensation is rarely a science or an exercise of arithmetical

precision by an arbitration tribunal. Complex factual, legal and expert issues of
compensation, dividing the disputing parties and their expert witnesses, can require a
margin of appreciation by a tribunal applying the wording of a treaty and international
law. The required exercise can be therefore less than exact. For this case, the Tribunal

refers to the general approach taken by international arbitration tribunals, as recorded

Part X — Page 23 of 32

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 305 of 347

in the ICSID awards in Sistem v. Kyrgyz Republic (2009),''2 ADC y. Hungary
(2006),''3 and Gold Reserve v. Venezuela (2014).''4 The Tribunal has adopted that

general approach to the present case.

10.102 The Respondent’s Undertaking: As stated many times in this Award, the Claimant’s
claim for compensation is based on the Treaty under international law against the
Respondent. It is not based on the SPA or under Egyptian law. Accordingly, without
more, the Treaty and international law do not require the Tribunal to apply the SPA’s
contractual limitations on compensation for breach of the SPA by EGPC or EGAS, as
if the Claimant’s claim were making a contractual claim against its co-contractor,

EGAS.

10.103 Such was the decision reached by the ICSID tribunal in its award in Kardassopoulos
and Fuchs v. Georgia (2010):'!°

480. The Tribunal recalls that the Claimants’ claims are treaty-based.
Therefore the relevant provisions for the purpose of both liability and
quantum are contained in the treaties and, more broadly, international
law. Whilst the JVA and Deed of Concession are relevant to the factual
matrix which underpins those claims, the Tribunal has not been
constituted under the provisions of the JVA nor the Deed of Concession to
consider the Parties’ contractual dispute. Article 12 of the JVA and Article
21 of the Deed do not, therefore, as such, govern the legal framework
within which the Tribunal must consider the compensation owing to the
Claimants for breach of the ECT and the BITs.

481. This finding is without prejudice to a host State and an investor's
ability to contractually limit the compensation which may be owed
following an expropriation where a treaty is also in play. Indeed, the
Tribunal is loathe to accept the categorical denial of such an arrangement
urged by the Claimants as a matter of law. [...]

10.104 The Tribunal notes the tribunal’s significant qualifications in these passages.
Moreover, in the Tribunal’s view, the facts of this case lead necessarily to a different

conclusion.

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 306 of 347

10.105 As decided in Part IX above, the Respondent’s international wrong derives from its
undertaking in the letter dated 5 August 2000 from the Ministry of Petroleum to the
Claimant. That undertaking was made in regard to the Seller’s obligations under the
SPA, pursuant to Article 21.1 of the SPA. In this sense, the Respondent’s undertaking
limited the compensation that might be owed following an international wrong under
the Treaty to the compensation under the SPA as regards Article 4(1) of the Treaty.
The Respondent was not a guarantor of the Seller’s obligations under the SPA, still
less a primary co-obligor. It would an odd result if, in such circumstances, the
Respondent assumed a greater liability to pay compensation under the Treaty than the

maximum liability assumed by the Seller under the SPA.

10.106 Hence, the Tribunal selects the Claimant’s third alternative case on compensation as
the appropriate methodology for assessing the compensation payable by the
Respondent under the Treaty and international law, as summarised above at the
beginning of this Part X. Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects the Claimant’s primary
case and its first and second alternative cases on compensation, as there also

summarised.

10.107 In these circumstances, applying the “but for” test for causation, it follows that
compensation for the Respondent’s international wrong under the Treaty cannot
exceed the Seller’s obligations under the SPA. Those obligations, as to the Seller’s
liability for non-performance, are qualified (inter alia) by the limitations on

recoverable compensation under the terms of the SPA.

10.108 Article 8.1[1] of the SPA provides that, for a breach of the obligation to deliver the

stipulated quantity of gas, the Seller

shall be liable to Buyer for any damages, costs and/or expenses (to the
extent permissible under Egyptian laws, but excluding consequential
damages and loss of profits) arising from Seller’s failure to supply,
including (i) third party’s claims and penalties against Buyer, (ii) costs,
extra-costs, damages and expenses caused to the Complex arising from
Seller’s failure to supply, including operation and maintenance costs
(expressed in USD per MMBTU), and capital investment costs (expressed
in USD per MMBTU).

10.109 The cap on damages as to 90% of undelivered gas provided by Article 8.1[2] of the

SPA is not relevant to the Claimant’s claims made by reference to Article 8.1[1]. Mr

Part X — Page 25 of 32

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 307 of 347

Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira calculated the US$ value of this cap as US$ 3.04 billion,

an amount in excess of the Claimant’s total claims. !'®

10.110 The Tribunal turns to the SPA’s other limitations on recoverable damages later below.

10.111 Loss of Profits: As already noted above, the Claimant claims a total principal sum of
US$ 2,013,291,000 for damages recoverable by reference to the SPA; namely “Lost
Cash Flows” under its third alternative case on compensation. That amount excludes
any “loss of profits” on the calculations made by the Claimant and its expert
witnesses, Mr Kaczmarek and Sequeira. In the Tribunal’s view, by reason of Article
8.1[1] of the SPA, the Claimant was correct in not here claiming “loss of profits” (as

the Respondent contended).

10.112 SEGAS’ Lost Dividends: The Claimant also claims US$ 404,745,000 for “Nominal
Lost Dividends” from the Claimant’s majority shareholding in SEGAS.''’ These
losses were caused by two cumulative factors: (i) the failure of EGAS to pay fees due
to SEGAS under the EGAS Tolling Contract and (ii) the non-payment of dividends by
EGAS to the Claimant owing to to SEGAS’s precaurious financial condition, that

were not solely caused by EGAS (i.e. including SEGAS’ lost Free Zone status).

10.113 In the Tribunal’s view, by reason of Article 8.1[1] of the SPA, the Claimant cannot
here claim its nominal lost dividends unpaid by SEGAS, being “consequential

damages and loss of profits” (as the Respondent contended).

10.114 The Tribunal is also required, as to the assessment of compensation, to take account
of the ICC tribunal’s award in the ICC arbitration between SEGAS and EGAS (as
summarised above). As the ICC tribunal there decided, EGAS was not entitled to fees
from EGAS under the EGAS Tolling Contract by reason of SEGAS’ absolute
assignment of its contractual rights to HSBC. It must follow, as a matter of fact, that
no such fees could be passed by EGAS through SEGAS to the Claimant in the form of
dividends.

10.115 Accordingly, in the absence of such fees being due to SEGAS under the EGAS

Tolling Contract, it must follow that no such losses were incurred by the Claimant.

Part X — Page 26 of 32

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 308 of 347

The Respondent is not, of course, legally responsible for SEGAS’ absolute
assignment of its rights to HSBC under the Offshore Security Agreement.

10.116 UFGC: As to UFGC, it is a Spanish company forming part of the Union Fenosa group
of companies. It is owned as 99.99% by the Claimant; and it is managed by the
Claimant’s employees, subject to the operational control of the Claimant. UFGC was
formed by the Claimant for the specific purpose of allowing the Claimant to market

gas in Spain, as required by regulatory provisions of Spanish law.''*

10.117 Under the agreement between UFGC and the Claimant,'!? UFGC’s costs flowed
through to the Claimant. UFGC’s remitted receipts accounted for two thirds of the
Claimant’s revenue.'?? As a wholly owned and integrated subsidiary, the operating
costs and financial results of UFGC were consolidated into the Claimant’s financial
statements, so that any losses sustained by UFGC were directly reflected in the
Claimant’s financial statements. !*! In legal and contractual terms, however, UFGC

was a stranger, or third party, to the SPA.

10.118 As a factual matter, there is no doubt that losses sustained by UFGC were passed
through and directly suffered as losses by the Claimant. As the Respondent’s expert
witness (Mr MacGregor) accepted, if the Claimant had to reimburse UFGC for its
purchases from third parties (which UFGC otherwise would have purchased from the
Claimant), the Claimant could claim damages under the SPA by reference to the extra

costs incurred by UFGC. |

10.119 The Tribunal can see no logical reason why the same result should not apply under
the Treaty and international law. This is not a case of a claimant claiming as damages
a loss or expense incurred by a company in which it has only a minority interest and
no direct control over that company. In such circumstances, a minority shareholder
may make a claim for the diminution in the value of its shareholding; but it cannot
claim, even prorated according to the number of its shares, the damages suffered only

by the company. Such a claim is not pleaded by the Claimant in this arbitration.

10.120 Moreover, from June 2013 onwards, UFGC has in fact invoiced the Claimant on a
monthly basis for extra costs incurred in its purchases of replacement gas, in place of
the Claimant’s sales of gas to UFGC. The Claimant has paid those invoices.!?> The
claim in respect of costs incurred to EGPC is made for the period from June 2013

onwards, during this invoicing period. '*4

10.121 Article 8.1 of the SPA imposes a liability on the Seller for the “costs” incurred by the
Buyer from third parties. It follows that the Claimant’s costs incurred and paid to
UFGC would be recoverable from the Seller (EGAS) under the SPA and thus also

recoverable from the Respondent under the Treaty.

10.122 Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant’s third alternative case on
compensation, as supported by Mr Kaczmarek and Sequeira, correctly includes the
amount of US$ 291,894,831 as the Claimant’s own “incremental costs passed on by

UFGC to UFG” from June 2013 onwards.

10.123 The Free Zone Claim: The Claimant claims a total principal sum of US$ 107 million
for damages suffered from the revocation of SEGAS’ Free Zone status in May 2008.
The Tribunal has dismissed this claim, as to liability, in Part IX above. Hence, it is
here unnecessary to address and decide the Parties’ submissions as to compensation
regarding the Claimant’s Free Zone Claim. However, it is necessary to exclude this
claim and related claims from the assessment of compensation, To the Tribunal’s
understanding, the Claimant has done so in calculating its third alternative case on

compensation.

10.124 Mitigation: The Claimant cannot claim compensation from the Respondent to the
extent that the Claimant has failed unreasonably to mitigate its losss in accordance
with international law. In the Tribunal’s view, the legal test is based upon a
reasonable and not an absolute standard, as confirmed by Comment (11) to Article 31

of the ILC Articles and Article 39 of the ILC Articles.

Part X — Page 28 of 32

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 310 of 347

10.125 Article 39 of the ILC Articles provides:

In the determination of reparation, account shall be taken of the
contribution to the injury by willful or negligent action or omission of the
injured State or any person or entity in relation to whom reparation is
sought.

10.126 Moreover, the test is to be applied as at the relevant time, without the benefit of
hindsight. The legal burden of proving such unreasonableness in this arbitration rests

upon the Respondent.

10.127 The Respondent contends that the Claimant should have terminated or suspended
commitments to downstream buyers, if necessary using a defence of force majeure
based on events in Egypt occurring from 2011 onward. Applied generally, such
terminations and suspensions would have effectively closed down most, if not all, of

the Claimant’s business.

10.128 The Tribunal does not consider that the Claimant can reasonably be required to have
effectively closed down its business, in whole or in substantial part. Moreover, if it
had done so, it is not obvious that the overall amount of its claims would be reduced,
albeit perhaps differently formulated against the Respondent. It is even likely that the

amount of these claims could have increased.

10.129 Further, Mr Conti (of the Claimant) testified that the Claimant did take steps to adjust

its downstream sales, as follows: !?5

This imbalance between supply and sales forced us to restructure our
downstream portfolio to accommodate the change. One measure we took
was to reduce our sales volume downstream. Due to Egypt's breach we
have reduced our sales volumes in Spain since 2011 by more than 40
percent overall and almost 50 percent in the industrial sector. We also had
to adjust the type of customer we supplied. We had structured our
downstream sales expecting that we would benefit from a lower, long-term
sales price from EGAS, allowing us to charge lower prices to high-volume
customers. By supplying high-volume customers at a lower price, we
ensured that we could earn a profit and could also sell the entire 4.4 bem
we expected from Egypt. Now that we have to pay higher spot-market
prices, we cannot continue to service the same type of customer and/or the
same volumes - the prices are too low. Instead of supplying a limited
number of high-volume industrial customers, we now must supply low-
volume users to obtain a better downstream price. But because these are

5 Conti WS, Paragraph 17.

Part X — Page 29 of 32

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 311 of 347

low-volume customers, we must reach agreements with a substantially
higher number of individual customers to reach a volume, which, even if
much lower, allows UFG to at least to keep a structural presence in the
market and to optimize logistic parameters. So even though UFG has
substantially reduced its industrial portfolio in terms of volume - by about
half over the past few years - it has had to take on many more customers to
reach that lower volume. While UFG used to supply about 170 customers
in 2011 and 2012 (but supply a much higher volume), now it supplies
about 370 customers.

The Tribunal accepts the truth of this testimony. Mr Conti was not called by the
Respondent for cross-examination at the Hearing.

10.130 As also described by Mr Conti and assessed as at the relevant time, the Tribunal does
not consider the Claimant’s conduct unreasonable. In short, the Respondent did not
prove its case on mitigation, as to which (as decided above) it bore the legal burden of

proof.

10.131 ENI: The Respondent complains that the Claimant purchased replacement gas from
its parent company (ENI) and other affiliated companies, thereby leading to a possible
“windfall.” The Claimant explained that these purchases were transactions made at
arm’s length, at average prices lower than those available from other unrelated
companies. Overall, as Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira testified, the Claimant
thereby reduced its losses, which would have been greater if it had purchased the

same replacement gas from non-affiliated sellers. !7°

10.132 The Tribunal has considered the other matters raised by the Respondent to support its
allegation that the Claimant’s compensation should be reduced for its unreasonable
failure to mitigate its losses. The Tribunal rejects them all. As already indicated, the
legal test for mitigation applies a reasonable standard at the relevant time, not a
multitude of second-guesses made years applying an absolute standard to the
Claimant’s conduct with the benefit of hindsight. Moreover, it cannot be forgotten
that the Claimant’s predicament requiring such mitigatory conduct was caused by the

Respondent’s international wrong under the Treaty.

10.133 Conclusion: In conclusion, for the several reasons stated above, by reference to the

Claimant’s third alternative case on compensation, the Tribunal assesses the

'26 Navigant ERI, Appendix 1; Navigant ER2, Page 29, Figure 3.

Part X — Page 30 of 32

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 312 of 347

compensation due from the Respondent to the Claimant in the total principal sum of

US$ 2,013,071,000 (after tax, but before interest), as explained below.

10.134 The total amount of USS 2,013,071,000 comprises the amount of US$ 2,013,291,000
(as the Claimant’s “Lost Cash Flows”) that itself includes the amount of US$
291,891,832 (as the Claimant’s “own incremental costs passed on by UGPC” to the
Claimant from June 2013 onwards). It is reduced by US$ 220 million, as described in
Paragraph 10.9 above (as accepted by the Parties’ experts).

10.135 This total amount of USS 2,013,071,000 does not include the Claimant’s figure of
US$ 404,745,000 (as the Claimant’s “Lost Dividends” from SEGAS).That claim has
been dismissed by the Tribunal.

10.136 It also does not include - the Claimant’s claim for US$ 107 million for the loss of
SEGAS’ tax-free status in the Damietta Free Zone (not being a claim advanced under
the Claimant’s third alternative case on compensation and, in any event, a claim

dismissed by the Tribunal).

10.137 The Tribunal also dismisses the Claimant’s figures for its primary case on
compensation, together with its first and second alternative cases on compensation, as

summarised above.
(5) Interest

10.138 There is no prescribed rate of interest in the Treaty. The Tribunal decides to use
Three-Month LIBOR + 2.0% compounded quarterly as the appropriate rate for pre-
award interest. The Tribunal considers that rate to reflect a reasonable rate of interest
applicable to the Project as an investment by the Claimant, in concordance with the
principles in Chorzéw Factory (1928) and Article 36 of the ILC Articles on State
Responsibility. It is less than a commercial rate and the rate prescribed in the SPA, in
recognition that the Respondent is a State and not a commercial party, liable under the

Treaty and not under the SPA.

10.139 As regards the form of interest, as already indicated, the Tribunal decides to apply

compound interest. In selecting compound interest, the Tribunal adopts the reasoning

Part X — Page 31 of 32

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 313 of 347

in the awards in Compania del Desarrollo v. Costa Rica (2000) and Gemplus v.

Mexico (2000).

10.140 Applied to calculate pre-award interest, the Tribunal selects 1 January 2016 as the

commencement date and the date of this Award as the end-date.

10.141 As to post-award interest, the Tribunal decides to apply the same rate of Three-Month
LIBOR + 2.0% compounded quarterly, from the date of this Award until payment to

the Claimant.

10.142 In the event of the Claimant receiving any monies under this Award, the Claimant is
forever precluded from claiming against the Respondent or EGAS any compensation
in respect of the same monies in any legal or arbitration proceedings against the
Respondent, EGPC or EGAS, including the pending second CRCICA arbitration
(899) between the Claimant and EGAS. The Tribunal records that the Claimant has
undertaken in this arbitration, as stated in its written submissions and its submissions

at the Hearing, that it will not make any attempt at “double-recovery.”
(6) Summary of the Tribunal’s Decisions

10.143 The total principal sum of compensation to be paid by the Respondent is US$
2,013,071,000 (after tax, but before interest).

10.144 As to pre-award interest to be paid by the Respondent on the said principal sum, from
1 January 2016 to the date of this Award, the rate is Three-Month LIBOR + 2.0%

compounded quaterly.

10.145 As to post-award interest to be paid by the Respondent on the said principal sum,
from the date of this Award until payment, the rate is Three-Month LIBOR + 2.0%
compounded quarterly.

PART XI: THE STAY/SUSPENSION ISSUES

(1) Introduction

11.1 If the Tribunal were to decide that it had jurisdiction (as it has in Part VI above), the
Respondent contended that the Tribunal should decline to exercise its jurisdiction, or
at the minimum, order a stay (or suspension) of this arbitration pending the resolution

of the CRCICA and ICC arbitrations.'

11.2 On 22 December 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, reserving, for the
time being, its decision regarding the Respondent’s request for a stay of this

arbitration.

11.3. On 4 March 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 addressing the two
procedural issues of bifurcation and the stay of this arbitration. On the Respondent’s
application for a stay, the Tribunal requested that “it continue to be informed on

regular basis by the Parties of the progress made in the CRICCA [sic] and ICC

 

arbitrations (insofar as it may be permissible for each of them to do so). For the time
being, the Tribunal reserves its decision regarding the Respondent’s stay application

and makes no order for a stay of these arbitration proceedings.”

11.4 The Parties’ respective positions on the stay are summarised below, taken from their
written submissions. To a significant extent, at least as regards the ICC arbitration and
the first CRCICA arbitration (896/2013), these submissions have only an historical

value.
(2) The Respondent’s Case

11.5 In summary, the Respondent submits that this Treaty arbitration comes on top of four
arbitration proceedings initiated by the Claimant before different fora, namely the ICC
and CRCICA.? The Respondent submits that all these other arbitrations relate to a

dispute that arose out of “EGAS’s alleged failure to supply the Damietta Plant with

volumes of natural gas agreed under the Natural Gas Sale and Purchase Agreement.”4

The Respondent contends that this Tribunal “should decline to exercise jurisdiction or,
at a minimum, stay [this arbitration] pending the resolution of the Contractual [i.e. the

CRCICA and ICC] Arbitrations pursued and prioritized by Claimant.”>

11.6 Referring to international tribunals’ inherent power, discretion and pragmatic
approach to decline jurisdiction or to stay proceedings when appropriate, the
Respondent contends that such a power relies upon the principles of /is pendens,
comity, collateral estoppel and res judicata. These principles ensure sound judicial
administration, procedural efficiency and protection against abuses, conflicting

decisions, double recovery and duplication of costs. According to the Respondent, this

 

has been confirmed by several tribunals, as well as the International Law
Associations’ 2006 Recommendations on Lis Pendens and Res Judicata and

Arbitration (the “ILA Recommendations”).°

11.7 The Respondent submits that these concerns are further underscored by the ICC
partial award of May 2016, which decided that SEGAS did not have any rights under
the EGAS Tolling Agreement.’

11.8 In support of its submissions, the Respondent refers to the decisions of the arbitral
tribunal constituted under Annex VII of the UNCLOS in The Mox Plant Case (2003)
and also the ICSID tribunal in SPP v. Egypt (1985). There both tribunals stayed their
proceedings pending another court’s ruling in a matter related to their respective
dispute.* The Respondent also refers to several investment treaty cases, in particular

stayed the proceedings pending the resolution of the contractual claim by a different

forum.?

11.9 The Respondent contends that the Claimant’s common objective in the other
arbitrations is to vindicate its contractual rights allegedly breached under the SPA,
upon which its investment treaty claims before this Tribunal are predicated.'?
Accordingly, this Tribunal should decline jurisdiction or stay this arbitration.
Otherwise, it would be “inappropriate or, at the very least, premature for the Tribunal
to adjudicate Claimant’s duplicative treaty claims.”!!

11.10 In addition, the Respondent reiterates that if the Tribunal does not decline jurisdiction,
it should stay the proceedings pending the outcome of the contractual arbitrations

because:

(i) In the CRCICA and ICC arbitrations, the tribunals upheld jurisdiction and

 

several rounds of submissions and hearings on jurisdiction and admissibility

took place, respectively.!? Hence, their outcome would assist this Tribunal in

 

the determination of relevant factual and legal matters and would help avoid the

duplication of costs and the risk of contradictory decisions; !

(ii) A stay of this arbitration “would not materially prejudice” the Claimant. '* It was

the latter’s choice to “prioritize the Contractual Arbitrations over the ICSID

arbitration.”!> That was further confirmed by the Claimant’s acknowledgement

that this ICSID arbitration and the Contractual Arbitrations are inseparable and

“inextricably linked”;!° and

(iii) A stay of this arbitration is not barred by any other compelling reason given that

the Claimant’s contractual claims are granted due process in the Contractual

Arbitrations and the enforceability of these commercial awards under the New

York Arbitration Convention of 1958.!7
(3) The Claimant’s Case

In summary, the Claimant opposes the Respondent’s application for the dismissal or
the stay/suspension of this arbitration. It invites the Tribunal to reject the application
because: (i) the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel do not warrant the
dismissal of the Claimant’s claims or any stay of these arbitration proceedings; (ii) the
Respondent’s reliance upon the doctrine of /is pendens is inapposite; and (iii) judicial
comity and procedural efficiency require that these arbitration proceedings continue

without any stay.'*

The Claimant submits that the Respondent’s arguments are flawed because they are

based on the Respondent’s mischaracterization of the Claimant’s claims.

The Claimant contends that its contractual and treaty claims have different natures
with different factual backgrounds.'? The Claimant submits that the Claimant is not a
party to the ICC arbitration and that, in the current proceeding, “[the Claimant] is
seeking to engage Egypt’s international responsibility for violations of the Spain-
Egypt BIT. By contrast, in the Contractual Arbitrations, [the Claimant] and SEGAS
are seeking to engage EGAS’ contractual liability for breaches of the SPA, as
amended by the Heads of Agreements and the Transient Agreement, and of the
SEGAS [and UFG] Tolling Agreement.””?

The Claimant submits that the existence of certain overlapping facts between these
contractual and treaty claims does not mean that they are identical or constitute the
same dispute. Thus, the same facts could give rise to distinct claims before different

fora.

The Claimant submits that this has been generally known as the distinction between

“contract claims” and “treaty claims” and widely recognized by investment treaty

tribunals, inter alia, SGS v. Pakistan (2003) Impregilo v. Pakistan (2005) and Toto v.
Lebanon (2009). The Claimant submits that these tribunals all refused to grant a stay

of their proceedings.?!

According to the Claimant, the Respondent’s reliance on SGS v. Philippines is
unavailing, not only because it is an isolated and widely criticised case, but also
because the circumstances were different from the current proceedings. The tribunal
there had to address a breach of the treaty’s umbrella clause which made the outcome

of the contractual claim relevant for the determination of the treaty claim.?”

The Claimant dismisses the Respondent’s argument that the ICC tribunal’s partial
award (deciding that SEGAS has no rights under the EGAS Tolling Contract) impacts
the Claimant’s claims in the present proceeding. It should not affect the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction since the Respondent failed to state any cogent reasons for its

conclusion.”

The Claimant further contends that the Contractual Arbitrations will not have any
material impact on this Tribunal’s decisions. This Tribunal’s jurisdiction should not
be affected in the event that it decided that the Claimant’s contractual and treaty
claims have the same “fundamental basis” (which the Claimant restates that they do

not).74

The Claimant contends that the doctrine of res judicata only applies when there is an
earlier and final decision by a tribunal or a court. It contends that the doctrine of
collateral estoppel only applies when a particular fact or legal matter has been decided
by a prior action between the same disputing parties. In the present proceedings, no
decisions, let alone final ones, have been yet been rendered in the Contractual

Arbitrations.”°

11.20 In addition, given that the Claimant’s claims in these Commercial Arbitrations are
“legally distinct” from the claims before this Tribunal, “it is therefore doubtful that an

award in one of these cases could produce res judicata effect in the other case.” 7°

11.21 The Claimant also contends that the Respondent’s reliance on the /is pendens doctrine
is inapposite. The “triple-identity test” applicable to res judicata should also be
satisfied to warrant a stay based on /is pendens, which has been regularly recognized

by international tribunals and scholars.”

11.22 The Claimant further refers to the ILA Recommendations which state that a tribunal’s
power to stay a proceeding should “be [] exercised very sparingly.” It also refers to

the ILA Final Report of 2009 which states that lis pendens does not apply to “supra-

 

national tribunals.”?* Therefore, so the Claimant contends, this Tribunal should not

“subordinate its authority to that of private arbitral tribunals for reasons of alleged /is

9929)

pendens that the latter tribunals had already found inapposite.

11.23. The Claimant further submits that the ILA Recommendations state that the stay
should not materially prejudice the party opposing the stay. Contrary to the
Respondent’s argument, the Claimant contends that granting a stay of this arbitration
would add further delay in the adjudication of its claims. This would materially
prejudice the Claimant’s “financial viability.”*° Also, if this Treaty arbitration were to
be stayed, some of the Claimant’s damages claims that are only raised before this

Tribunal would remain unresolved.*!

11.24 For these reasons, the Claimant contends that the Respondent’s arguments based on
res judicata and lis pendens do not apply to the present case and, thus, do not justify a

stay of this arbitration.*?

As to the risk of double recovery raised by the Respondent, the Claimant contends
that the risk of double recovery does not suffice to justify the granting of a stay of
these proceedings, given the numerous ways developed by tribunals to prevent such a
risk.>? Adding that it is not its intention to collect any double recovery, the Claimant
states that in case such a risk were to occur, it would amend its claims for damages

accordingly.*4

The Claimant requests the Tribunal to dismiss the Respondent’s application for the
dismissal or stay of this arbitration as meritless; it does not afford procedural
efficiency; and the Respondent has failed to show that there is any compelling reason
that justifies granting any stay of this arbitration.*> To the contrary, the Claimant
contends that “[t]o grant a stay in application of these doctrines, one or more issues to
be decided in the Commercial Arbitrations must be crucial to the adjudication of

9936

UFG’s claims in this arbitration. The Claimant therefore submits that the

Respondent’s request is an improper attempt to achieve further delay.*”

For all the above-mentioned reasons, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal reject the

Respondent’s application for the dismissal or stay/suspension of this arbitration.**
(4) The Tribunal’s Analyses and Decision

The ICC arbitration and the first CRCICA arbitration (896/2013) are at an end. There
is therefore no question now of any stay or suspension of this arbitration to await the

end-result of these two arbitrations.

The second CRCICA arbitration (899/2013) is pending. Its proceedings, once stayed,
have resumed following the final award of the first CRICICA arbitration last

December 2017. The Tribunal is not aware of the likely timetable for the end-result of

this second CRICICA arbitration. Although hearings have been fixed for October and

December 2018, that end-result may well be one or more years away.

In these circumstances, given also that the second CRCICA arbitration involves a
different respondent (EGAS) from the Respondent in this arbitration, the Tribunal
considers that it would be inappropriate to stay or suspend this arbitration to await a
final award in the CRCICA arbitration. Although there are likely to be certain
overlapping factual, expert and other issues between the arbitrations, any likely
mischief would come from the risk of inconsistent decisions on similar issues and

double-recovery of compensation by the Claimant.

As to the risk of inconsistent decisions, that is the inevitable consequence of the long-
standing inability of consensual arbitration to address satisfactorily the problems of

multi-party disputes. It is not cured by dismissals, stays or suspensions.

As to res judicata, the Tribunal considers that none of its decisions, orders or award
can bind EGAS in the second CRCICA arbitration. There is insufficient privity

between EGAS, the Claimant and the Respondent in these two separate arbitrations.

As to the risk of double-recovery by the Claimant in respect of the same losses
claimed in this arbitration and the second CRCICA arbitration, the Tribunal has taken
steps in this Award, in accordance with the Claimant’s own stated unequivocal

position, to ensure that this will not happen.

The Tribunal sees no cause to dismiss this arbitration, on account of the pending

second CRCICA Arbitration.

Given the decisions in this Award, the Tribunal sees no risk of inconstancy or

procedural difficulty arising from the pending HSBC Arbitration.
(5) Summary of Decisions

Accordingly, the Tribunal decides not to dismiss, stay or suspend this arbitration
pending the end-result of the second CRCICA arbitration, as requested by the
Respondent. Nor the HSBC Arbitration. Its application is therefore dismissed,
together with all other grounds invoked by the Respondent in support such

application.

PART XII: THE COSTS ISSUES

(1) Introduction
12.1 Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:

In the case of arbitration proceedings, the Tribunal shall, except as the
parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in
connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those
expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the
charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision
shall form part of the award.

12.2 On the last day of the Hearing (11 March 2017), the Tribunal and the Parties discussed
issues of costs. Having heard the Parties, the Tribunal directed the Parties to file their
respective costs submissions simultaneously on 11 May 2017. ! The Parties
subsequently agreed to extend the deadline to 17 May 2017. They filed their respective

costs submissions on that date.

12.3. The Parties agreed to forgo submitting arguments regarding the allocation of costs in
their costs submissions and rely instead on their previous positions regarding costs, as
pleaded in their respective claims for relief in their earlier submissions. The Parties
similarly agreed to submit a table with their costs and fees, without supporting

documentation.
(2) The Claimant’s Case

12.4 In its submissions, the Claimant contends that the Respondent should bear in full the
total arbitration and legal costs incurred by Claimant.” In its costs submission of 17 May
2017, the Claimant submits that the fees and expenses incurred by UFG on an
aggregated basis totalling US$ 12,407,199.71 are broken down in the table provided by

the Claimant as follows:

Tr. D6 1789.

2 Cl Mem Merits, Paragraph 638(d) (“UFG respectfully equests thatthe Arbittal Tribunal: (..] Order Egypt to
pay all costs and expenses of this arbitration, including ICSID’s administrative fees, the fees and expenses of the
Arbitral Tribunal, the fees and expenses of UFG’s legal representatives in respect of this arbitration, and any other
costs of this arbitration [...].”); see also Cl Rep Merits, Paragraph 473(d). UFG has asked for the same
allocation of costs in the jurisdictional phase of this proceeding; Cl CM Jur, Paragraph 89(b) (“UFG
respectfully requests that the Tribunal: [...] Order Egypt to pay all costs and expenses of the jurisdictional
phase of this arbitration, including the fees and expenses of UFG’s legal representatives in respect of this phase
and any other costs.”).

and the fees and expenses of the Tribunal.

The Claimant advances its claim on the basis of the Respondent’s breaches of its
obligations to the Claimant under the Treaty.> The Claimant contends that other ICSID
Tribunals have awarded claimants their costs and fees on this basis where the claimants

have prevailed on their claims.‘

The Claimant further submits that while it seeks full recovery of its costs in the
arbitration in general, it is also “compelled to give a particular emphasis to the costs
relating to [the Respondent’s] corruption and illegality allegations, which are
completely baseless and which have been unjustly imposed on UFG.”> The Claimant
argues that the “inordinate resources — in time and money — spent on Egypt’s spurious
allegation of corruption and illegality”, should weigh heavily in favour of full cost order

against Egypt.®

In its costs submissions of 17 May 2017, the Claimant records that it has initiated three
separate proceedings related to the Damietta Plant: two Cairo Regional Center
proceedings, CRCICA Case 899/2013 and CRCICA Case 896/2013, and this

arbitration. The Claimant’s expert witnesses in this arbitration have also provided

expert testimony in one or both of the CRCICA arbitrations. he Claimant submits that
its Counsel and experts have used their best efforts to allocate fees and expenses to the
appropriate arbitration. The Claimant represents that in no instance has any fee or

expense been double-counted.

In its same submission, the Claimant also submits that the fees and expenses comprising
its legal costs were necessary for the proper conduct of this arbitration and that their
amounts are reasonable and appropriate given this arbitration’s complexities and the
amount in dispute. The Claimant also submits that all of these fees and expenses have
been invoiced to the Claimant; and that the Claimant has paid them all, with the
exception of the invoices for the month of March 2017, which the Claimant was still

processing at the time of its costs submissions of 17 May 2017.
(3) The Respondent’s Case

In its submissions, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to order the Claimant to pay
all the costs of this arbitration, as well as the Respondent’s legal costs and expenses in
connection with this arbitration (including but not limited to its attorney’s fees and
expenses and the fees and expenses of its experts) on a full indemnity basis. The
Respondent also claims interest on any costs awarded to it in an amount to be

determined by the Tribunal.”

In its costs submissions of 17 May 2017, the Respondent provides line items and then
a total of costs incurred by the Respondent, totalling €1,386,951.25; $159,959.13;

Convention and Arbitration Rules, the allocation of costs is left to the Tribunal’s

discretion.
(4) The Tribunal’s Analyses and Decisions

Legal Costs: In the absence of agreement between the Parties or any provision in the
Treaty otherwise, the Tribunal has a broad discretion in regard to the allocation and
assessment of the Parties’ legal costs under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention. The
Tribunal considers that the Claimant, as the successful party in this arbitration, should
in principle recover its legal costs from the Respondent; and, conversely, that the
Respondent, as the non-successful party in this arbitration, should in principle not

recover its legal costs from the Claimant.

The Tribunal bases this decision on the ‘loser pays’ principle applied by the majority of
ICSID tribunals to compensate a successful claimant for the expenses of bringing a
meritorious claim against a respondent. Without such compensation, a successful
claimant would be penalised for resorting to ICSID arbitration. In this case, the Tribunal
can see no reason to depart from the general principle that a successful claimant should
be reimbursed for its legal costs by an unsuccessful respondent. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Tribunal confirms that its decision is not based upon any desire to punish the
Respondent for procedural misconduct or for perversely defending a meritorious claim.
To the contrary, the Tribunal considers that both the Respondent and the Claimant
(together with their respective Counsel) conducted this complex arbitration in good

faith, without any impropriety.

  

As to the assessment of the Claimant’s legal costs, such costs must be reasonable in
amount and also reasonably incurred by the Claimant. For a case of this complexity and
size, both substantive and procedural, the Tribunal does not consider that the Claimant’s
claim for legal costs fails to meet these tests — but for one factor. There is a marked
discrepancy between the total legal costs claimed by the Claimant and the total legal
costs claimed by the Respondent. It is not fully explained on the materials before the
Tribunal. The Tribunal recognises that an ICSID arbitration is often more expensive for
a claimant (who bears the burden of proving its claim) than for a respondent and that
there are sometimes special factors in costing a law firm’s services to a respondent

State.

Part XII — Page 7 of 8

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 329 of 347

12.17 Taking this factor partially into account, the Tribunal considers that US$ 10 million is
a reasonable amount for legal costs reasonably incurred by the Claimant in this
arbitration. Accordingly, the Tribunal decides that the Respondent shall reimburse the

Claimant for its legal costs in the total amount of US$ 10 million.

12.18 Arbitration Costs: The costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the

Tribunal, ICSID’s administrative fees and direct expenses, amount (in US$) to:®

Arbitrators’ fees and expenses

Mr Veeder: USS 156,865.41

Mr Rowley: USS 128.055.09

Mr Clodfelter: USS 184,076.64
ICSID’s administrative fees: USS 138,00.00
Direct expenses (estimated):° US$ 83,083.05
Total: USS 690,080.19

 

12.19 These arbitration costs have been paid out of the advances totaling US$ 700,000.00
made by the Claimant to ICSID, following the Respondent’s default on all requested

advance payments to ICSID.!°

12.20 In accordance with the same principle applied above to the allocation of legal costs, the
Tribunal decides that the Respondent shall reimburse the Claimant for its arbitration
costs in the total amount of its advances to ICSID, namely US$ 700,000.00. The
Claimant, however, shall give credit to the Respondent for any reimbursement of its
advances by ICSID, whether by way of set-off against any sums due under this Award

or otherwise.

® The ICSID Secretariat shall provide to the Parties a detailed Financial Statement of the case account once alll
invoices are received and the account is final.

° This amount includes estimated charges relating to the dispatch of this Award (courier, printing and copying).
© The remaining balance shall be reimbursed by ICSID to the Parties in the same proportion to the payments
advanced by them to ICSID; i.e. in this case to the Claimant only.

PART XIII: THE OPERATIVE PART

For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal decides and awards as follows (by a

majority where marked thus “*”):

Jurisdiction and Admissibility:* As a matter of jurisdiction, the Claimant is a
protected investor with a protected investment under the Treaty and the ICSID
Convention, sufficient to establish the jurisdiction of ICSID and also the competence
of the Tribunal to decide on their merits in this arbitration the Claimant’s claims

against the Respondent pleaded under the Treaty.

As a matter of admissibility,* the Tribunal decides that it may exercise such
jurisdiction to decide on their merits the said claims pleaded by the Claimant in this

arbitration.

As matters of jurisdiction* and admissibility*, the Tribunal decides to dismiss the
Respondent’s objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction and the exercise of such

jurisdiction to decide on their merits the Claimant’s said claims.

Corruption:* On the evidential materials placed before this Tribunal, there was no

corruption against the Claimant (including UFACEX) proven by the Respondent.

Necessity: The Respondent did not prove the defence of necessity under customary
international law, as expressed in Article 25 of the ILC Articles of Sate

Responsibility.

Merits:* The Respondent violated its obligations under the FET standard in Article
4(1) the Treaty, rendering it liable to the Claimant as regards its claims made by
reference to Respondent’s undertaking by its Ministry of Petroleum’s letter dated 5
August 2000.

Compensation:* In respect of its said liability under the FET standard in Article 4(1)

of the Treaty, the total principal sum of compensation to be paid to the Claimant by
the Respondent is US$ 2,013,071,000 (after tax, but before interest).

Pre-Award Interest: As to pre-award interest to be paid by the Respondent to the
Claimant on the said principal sum, from 1 January 2016 to the date of this Award,
the rate shall be Three-Month LIBOR + 2.0% compounded quarterly.

Post-Award Interest: As to post-award interest to be paid by the Respondent to the
Claimant on the said principal sum, from the date of this Award until payment, the

Convention, the Respondent shall pay to the Claimant its legal costs in the total
amount of US$ 10 million; and as to arbitration costs the Respondent shall reimburse
the Claimant in the sum of US$ 700,000 paid by the Claimant to ICSID (or such

Dissenting Opinion of
Mark Clodfelter

in
Unién Fenosa Gas, S.A. and Arab Republic of Egypt

(ICSID Case No. ARB/14/4)

This case presents many complex issues of fact and law and the Tribunal has devoted
considerable attention to the relevant evidence and authorities. However, these efforts have
led me to conclusions that are dramatically different from those of my distinguished co-
arbitrators, on jurisdiction, liability and damages, and, accordingly, costs. Indeed, our
respective conclusions are so different that I feel compelled to set forth my views on the
most important differences in this dissenting opinion.

Jurisdiction

2.

we

>

an

My principal disagreement! with the majority regarding jurisdiction concerns the
overriding issue of whether or not the SPA was procured through corrupt means.

I fully concur with the majority’s determination that such corruption, if proven, would,
under the Treaty and as a matter of international public policy under international law,
defeat jurisdiction over the claims, deny their admissibility, and render them unmeritorious.

I also agree that the Respondent bears the legal burden of proving corruption under a
“balance of probabilities” test, whether by means of direct evidence or circumstantial
evidence. And I also agree that Respondent failed to meet its burden with respect to its
allegations of corruption in the award of the EPC Contract to Halliburton and in Mr.
Hussein Salem’s involvement with the SPA.

However, I believe that Respondent did meet its burden of proof with respect to Mr. Yehia
El Komy’s involvement with the project. The Respondent has demonstrated that there was
a huge disproportion between,

 

and, on the other hand, his apparent contribution
to the project. This demonstration of a classic red flag? was sufficient to require a plausible
and credible explanation from Claimant. But the explanations provided by Claimant were
neither plausible nor credible and have been rejected even by the majority. As a result, the

   

' T do not agree that the majority’s statement at para. 6.65 that Claimant is a “member of the Union Fenosa
association of Spanish companies” is relevant to the issue of whether or not Claimant is an “investor” within the
meaning of Article 1(1) of the Treaty. I also do not agree with the statement at para. 6.68 that Claimant’s
investment should be treated “holistically” as “one overall investment made by the Claimant comprising the
Damietta Project.”

Corruption, in SPECIAL ICC SUPPLEMENT: TACKLING CORRUPTION IN ARBITRATION (2013), page
22 [RL-0168]. To be sure, Respondent has also cited numerous other red flags that are unnecessary to address
here. See Respondent’s letter to the Tribunal dated 21 Dec. 2017, Annex I, pages 4-5.

only inference that can be drawn is the one Claimant has sought to avoid, namely that Mr.
El Komy’s high compensation was for the purpose of exerting improper influence upon
government officials in allowing the project and awarding the SPA.

His compensation as a local partner cannot be explained on the basis that he
was a net source of capital.

oo

. As the majority also points out, Mr. El Komy does not appear to have brought any particular
technical or other specialist expertise to the project. He had no personal expertise or
experience in the LNG industry, no relevant background in the production and sale of
natural gas, and his business experience in the petroleum industry generally was very
limited and had only recently been acquired. Moreover, while Claimant asserts that Mr. El
Komy was needed to help navigate the local permitting process and deal with national
regulations relating to the project site, it offered no evidence that he had any particular
ability or experience in this respect. Thus, none of these characteristics suggest a value to
the project justifying such compensation.

9. The evidence of what Mr. El Komy and EATCO actually did on the project also falls short
of demonstrating a contribution commensurate with the compensation he was given. The
majority cites, at para. 7.88, the facts that “EATCO took part in the preparation of the Pre-
Feasibility Study: it prepared studies on possible sites for the Plant; it was responsible for
the proposal from Chiyoda and APCI for the EPC contract: it negotiated and signed the
Damietta Port Agreement of 8 August 2000 between UFACEX and the Damietta Port
Authority; it procured licences from the Damietta Port Authority for SEGAS’s work in
December 2000 and March 2001; and it participated in the handover from the Damietta
Port Authority to SEGAS of the land plot and jetty in April 2001.” In my view these
assertions overreach the evidence and overstate the facts.

10. As evidence that Mr. El Komy assisted with a pre-feasibility study, Claimant cites the 9
March 2000 EATCO-UFG preliminary agreement, which states that “EATCO will support
UFACEX in the development of a pre-Feasibility Study” with “Technical Works.” But no
such works were introduced or even referred to in the evidence. Nor is there evidence that

EATCO prepared an “Analysis of the Sites,” as was contemplated in that Agreement.>
Indeed, Mr. El Komy seems to have played only a small role in the identification of a site;
he attended only the last of a series of meeting with technical consultants engaged to advise
on this and other technical questions® and Claimant seems to have struggled with how to
involve him more.’ Claimant’s official, Mr. Fernandez Martinez, testified that EATCO was
only one of many other participants in the site survey;® its role did not even merit a mention
in his written witness statements. In fact, the Damietta site was selected early on despite
Mr. El Komy’s preference for a different site, undermining the suggestion that his input
was indispensable as alleged.

. Similarly, Mr. El Komy’s role in involving Chiyoda Corporation appears to have been

merely as a go-between; in fact, another consultant already working with Claimant on the
project, Mr. Omar El Komy (no relation, but who later joined EATCO), was the one who
contacted Chiyoda and introduced both that company and APCI Company to Mr. Yehia El
Komy.? The latter’s other involvement appears to have been tangential at best.!°

. Moreover, there is no evidence whatsoever that Mr. El Komy negotiated agreements with

the Damietta Port Authority. At most, the evidence cited by Claimant shows that he signed
as a witness to Claimant’s own signature to such agreements and co-signed the eventual
license along with Claimant, both as owners on behalf of SEGAS which was then still in
formation.'! It is not even clear that Mr. El Komy was involved in the incorporation of
SEGAS (a task which in any event could have been accomplished by any competent law
firm), the only evidence being that he brought a photocopy of company registration papers
with him to a meeting.'? Other indications of Mr. El Komy’s involvement are of even less
importance. Indeed, while securing the SPA was his first identified duty,'> Claimant denies
that, after the initial meeting with the Petroleum Minister in January 2000, Mr. El Komy
“participate[d] any further in the substantive negotiations that led to the SPA.”

13. Thus, Claimant’s efforts to chronical Mr. El Komy’s “indispensable” role in implementing
the project, something that should have been easy to demonstrate if true, are actually
undermined by the weakness of the evidence it has provided.

14. Claimant’s further explanation for Mr. El Komy’s compensation. emphasized in its
Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility — that he had conceived of and originated the
idea for the project, was the “first mover” and was the person who initially brought the
project to Claimant!» — is rightly rejected by the majority, since the evidence so clearly
contradicts these assertions. Based on Claimant’s own evidence as recounted by the
majority, the project had been conceived by Claimant itself and had been developed on the
Claimant’s behalf by other consultants, who themselves later brought Mr. El Komy into
the mix.

15. Even more mysteriously, Claimant also alleges that Mr. El Komy had “decided to establish
an LNG facility in Egypt”!° himself and agreed to the “relinquishment of equal control in
the Project” in favor NM . as if he and not the government enjoyed the authority
to confer the rights to develop the LNG facility.!” Claimant does not explain how Mr. El
Komy’s “decision” to build the facility himself (despite his obvious lack of credentials for
doing so) gave him any measure of “control” to relinquish to begin with, much less how it
affected the relative “bargaining power of the parties” that Claimant says is reflected in the

® This is especially glaring in light of Claimant’s
denial that Mr. El Komy exercised any special access to government authorities.

16. As noted earlier, I agree with the majority that Respondent bears the burden of proving
corruption, and I agree that there has been no direct evidence of bribery or money passing
hands from Mr. El Komy or his company to others. But what the evidence does prove is
that there is a tremendous and unexplained discrepancy between Mr. El Komy’s
involvement in the project and the compensation he was awarded. This clear red flag is
sufficient, not to shift to Claimant a burden of proving that there was no corruption, as
worries the majority, but to require Claimant to go forward with, at very least, a plausible
and credible explanation.

17. It is not for the Tribunal to supply such an explanation. This is why I cannot accept the
majority’s conclusion that Mr. El Komy acted as a lobbyist with non-corrupt access to and

15 Cl. Rej. Jur., Paragraph 29 (“In reality, the payments to be received by EATCO pursuant to this contract were
the result of negotiations between UFACEX and Mr. El-Komy regarding the commercial terms of their
partnership.

 

reflected each party’s bargaining power at the time, and comport with the central role that Mr. El-
Komy played in conceiving the Damietta LNG Project and bringing this business opportunity to UFG’s
attention.”) (emphasis added); Id., Paragraph 30 (“UFG need not belabor the obvious: a first mover who presents
a potentially lucrative idea has leverage to capture a substantial amount of the economic gains.”).

16 7d., Paragraph 34.
17 Td., Paragraph 49.
18 Zd., Paragraph 29. Claimant’s reliance upon a clause in the UFACEX-EATCO preliminary agreement under
which both sides agreed for three years to pursue the project together, and not alone or with others, begs the

question of what gave Mr. El Komy the leverage to command such exclusivity. See id., Paragraph 40; Agreement
between UFACEX and EATCO, 9 Mar. 2000 [C-0439].

Case 1:18-cv-02395 Document 1-1 Filed 10/17/18 Page 337 of 347

influence over senior government officials. Not only is there no evidence of non-corrupt
influence, this is not Claimant's explanation and indeed flies in the face of Claimant’s own
denials that Mr. El Komy exerted any influence on government officials at all.

 

18. Nor is this a matter of second guessing a commercial decision, but rather one of
understanding the reasons for that decision in a situation where such understanding is
required. As the majority notes, unanswered queries may have innocent explanations. But
when the answers to queries that are actually proffered are not proven in circumstances
where, if true, it should have been easy to do so, or worse, when the evidence affirmatively
disproves them, I see no alternative but to infer that the true explanation is not an innocent
one.”

19. For these reasons, I believe that we should conclude that corruption has been established
by circumstantial evidence and that the claims should be dismissed.

Liability

20. I also disagree with the majority’s conclusions with respect to the Respondent’s liability
for a breach of the fair and equitable treatment provision in Article 4.1 of the Treaty. This
includes my disagreement with the standards accepted by the majority for establishing a
violation of this provision, which I will not address in light of the Parties’ mutual treatment
of the factor of legitimate expectations in assessing a violation of this particular treaty. I do
however agree with Respondent that, even accepting the role of legitimate expectations,
the threshold is high.?°

 

 

21.1 agree with the majority’s statement that “legitimate expectations depend on specific
undertakings and representations,” quoting the award in Philip Morris v. Uruguay?!
However, I do wish to set out in some detail why I do not believe that either the 25 July
2000 Council of Ministers decision,”? or the 5 August 2000 Ministry of Petroleum letter,”
both of which are relied upon by the majority, provide the basis for any legitimate
expectation that Egypt would forswear policies that either allegedly “over”-incentivized
NG consumption or “under”-incentivized NG production. I also do not believe that those
policies can be said to have caused the under-supply of gas to Claimant. Finally, I do not
consider that Claimant has proven that EGAS’s decision to deny gas to Claimant in favor
of domestic demand was directed or instructed by the government of Egypt.

 

 

'° This inference is not affected by the fact either that it was raised by Respondent only after arbitral proceedings
were begun or that criminal investigations of Mr. El Komy in connection with the project were only begun years
after the fact and are still ongoing.

22. It must be assumed that, at the time it pursued the project, UFACEX knew that it was a
national policy priority to guarantee the supply of domestic demand for natural gas.?4 To
overcome such a policy, a clear and specific undertaking by the government would have
been necessary. But the government was unwilling to provide UFACEX with a guarantee
of EGPC’s supply obligations to assure that gas would be supplied even if it meant domestic
demand was unmet. One of the goals of UFACEX’s January 2000 meeting with Minister
Fahmy was “identifying the support/guarantees that the Government of Egypt can provide
to the Project.”> But all they were able to obtain was Minister Fahmy’s personal “support”
and “commitment.”° Indeed, the 17 May 2000 MOU between UFACEX and EPGC is
express in stating that EGPC would be its own guarantor.”’ This is a repudiation of the
notion that the government was ever willing to guarantee EGPC’s SPA commitments.

23. Nonetheless, the majority accepts the proposition that the 25 July 2000 Council of Ministers
and the 5 August 2000 Ministry of Petroleum letter”? together amount to a
“specific undertaking” sufficient to support a legitimate expectation that the government
would tailor its policies to assure adequate supply to Damietta. But I do not think that such
a momentous undertaking can be inferred from these acts.

. The chronology of events shows that, apart from evidencing approval of the project in
general, the approvals given by the Ministry of Petroleum and the Council of Ministers
related specifically to the SPA’s prices for the volumes of gas to be sold, an issue which
was always, and expressly, subject to government approval.

Trends , 17 January 2000 [BRG-31] (“The following are the six points of the Master Plan, approved in October
1999 by the new government of Dr. Atef Obeid which expressed clear support for proposals to export gas in liquid
form and by pipeline as well as proposals to accelerate Egypt's shift from oil to gas for domestic energy and
industrial feedstocks:
1. Gas exports should at no time exceed 25% of Egypt's total output capacity. This means the domestic
gas requirements of Egypt - a top priority of the current Egyptian regime under President Hosni Mubarak
- will always be guaranteed.”) (emphasis added).

25. All of the basic economic terms of the SPA except price (i.e., volume, take-or-pay
percentage, performance stand-by letter of credit, start date) were already fixed in the 17
May 2000 MOU between UFACEX and EGPC; price was to be “finally agreed” in the
SPA30

26. Negotiations on the price and all other terms of the SPA were completed by 15 July 2000
when the SPA was signed in principle.*! At that point, the SPA was subject to government
approval only of “the agreements that have been made regarding the price of the gas.”>*

27. On 20 July 2000, the EGPC Board approved a memorandum that described the agreed price
and other basic economic terms of the SPA, and authorized action “to conclude the
contractual procedures as required.”*> But the Board was obviously concerned with the
maximum price provisions, because its decision was marked up to note that a further
meeting was to be held with UFACEX “in order to increase the maximum price ceilings.”*4
(As with all Board decisions, these conclusions were notified to and endorsed by Minister

28. As had been understood, the “conclusion of the contract procedures” required government
approval of the agreed prices. To this end, a memorandum was prepared by the Ministry of
Petroleum for the Council of Ministers that, again, summarized the basic economic terms
of the SPA, including the price terms as had been agreed on 15 July 2000, and requested
approval for the conclusion of a contract “according to the conditions and prices mentioned
in the memorandum to be paid in dollars.”*° Based upon this memorandum, on 25 July
2000 the Council of Ministers gave its approval to the “signing [of] a memorandum of
understanding with Union Fenosa Company to develop a project for the liquefaction of
natural gas for export to Spain.”>”

29. The majority considers at paras. 9.57 and 9.66 that the approvals of the government related
to specific provisions of the SPA by which, among other things, EGPC warranted an
adequate supply of gas to meet contract requirements (Sections 23.2 and 24. 3), agreed to

limitations on the invocation of force majeure (Sections 15.2 and 15.3(b)) and, most
importantly, committed “to procure that the Egyptian authorities undertake not to interfere with
the rights of Buyer under this Agreement, and not to dictate or promulgate any act or regulation
which could directly or indirectly affect the rights of Buyer under this Agreement, or affect the
capacity of Buyer to perform its obligations under this Agreement, even in the case of a NG shortage
in Egypt, save for Force Majeure situations as defined in this Agreement” (Section 21.1). But the
evidence indicates the government approvers were not even provided with the full terms
agreed-upon, but rather only with summaries of key terms necessary to evaluate the
adequacy of the price terms.

30. None of the particular terms cited is even described in the memorandum that went to the
EGPC Board** which, on 20 July 2000, approved “the contents of the memorandum” and,
on that basis, authorized the concluding of contract procedures.*? These were the decisions
“endorsed” by Minister Fahmy in his 24 July 2000 notation to the minutes.*°

 

31. These provisions were also not described in the similar memorandum that went to the
Council of Ministers on 25 July 2000, which requested approval for signing a contract
“according to the conditions and prices mentioned in the memorandum”; *! the Council’s
actual decision was to approve signing a contract for “a project for the liquefaction of
natural gas....”#? Minister Fahmy’s 27 July 2000 letter to the Prime Minister reported that
the contract had been agreed “according to the above mentioned [prices] and the main
conditions which were stated in the memorandum submitted to the Cabinet.”

32. The 29 July 2000 Technical Department Memorandum describes the decisions of EGPC’s
Board of Directors and the Council of Ministers as approvals of “the project” and does not
include any of these particular provisions in its summary of the “main characteristic[s]” of
the SPA.“

33. In short, while these particular terms were clearly binding on EGPC, there does not appear
to be any evidence that they were known to, much less approved by, the government
officials involved. Their concern was for the prices to be charged at the volume promised.

34. Most importantly, I do not believe that there is any basis for concluding that the 5 August
2000 Ministry letter to UFG’s Chairman constitutes in particular the undertaking of the
Egyptian authorities “not to interfere with the rights of [the] Buyer” that EGPC was

obligated to procure in SPA Section 21.1. The letter merely states, in full pertinent part,
“On behalf of the Ministry of Petroleum I have the pleasure to inform you that the Egyptian
Government official [sic] endorsed the natural gas Sales and Purchase Agreement signed
on August 1%, 2000 between UFACEX and EGPC.”5 This single sentence simply cannot
bear the weight assigned to it by the majority at para. 9.145 as the “the decisive tipping
factor in establishing the Respondent’s breach of Article 4(1) of the Treaty.”

we
a

. The letter makes no reference whatsoever to Section 21.1. It does not even use any of the
terminology of Section 21.1. There is no contemporaneous evidence at all that it was
intended or considered to implement Section 21.1.4°

w
a

. If Union Fenosa had actually considered it as such, it would certainly have cited it in its
letters to the Ministry seeking its help with regard to EGAS’s performance of the SPA,
especially after EGAS expressly noted in its 16 October 2005 letter to UFG that it
considered its supply commitment to be subject to “the priority given to local demand."
But, neither Section 21.1 nor the 5 August 2000 letter is ever mentioned in any of the
communications of complaint by Claimant listed in para. 9.125 of the award.

37. The absence of such evidence is even odder in light of the contention that a government
undertaking under Section 21.1 was a sine qua non to UFACEX’s agreement to the SPA.
If it was truly an “essential condition” of the transaction, Section 21.1 would have been
drafted as a condition precedent, not as an obligation to be performed in the future. It is
difficult to see how an investor could reasonably have understood such terms of the 5
August 2000 letter to constitute a specific assurance to make domestic demand a subsidiary
priority, and to have based a major investment on such terms.

 

38. In the end, for this reason, I do not believe that such an undertaking by the government,
while perhaps highly desirable, was an essential condition of UFACEX’s investment.*® In

Maria Amustategui), 5 August 2000 [C-169].

“© Nor do I consider that, as the majority maintains in para. 9.61, the Respondent was “associating itself” with

Section 21.1 by means of the 5 August 2000 letter in the sense that it was somehow agreeing to effectuate EGPC’s

obligation to procure a government undertaking. As noted in para. 9.121 of the Award, the commentary to the

ILC Articles explains that there is a difference between a State’s “acknowledgment and adoption of the conduct

in question as its own” and “cases of mere support or endorsement” by the State. See James Crawford, The ILC’s

48 Tt is notable that a government guarantee or non-interference undertaking was not among the “Main Principles”
set forth in the 17 May 2000 MOU. See id., Article 4 (“ARTICLE 4 MAIN PRINCIPLES OF THE NATURAL
GAS SALE AND PURCHASE AGREEMENT - The Natural Gas Sale and Purchase Agreement shall be
negotiated in good faith between the Parties and its content shall observe the basic terms and conditions set forth
in Appendix | hereto”) and Appendix 1. Nor were these mentioned in the MOU as one of the “Additional
Commitments.” /d., Article 5 (“ARTICLE 5 ADDITIONAL COMMITMENTS BY EGPC IN CONNECTION

issuing all necessary permits, licences and authorizations for the development of the Project in accordance with

making the investment, UFACEX appears to have justified taking the risk of under-supply
on the basis of considerations other than any specific assurance by the government, namely,
EGPC’s own promise to supply Damietta in preference to domestic demand and, most
importantly, the then-current optimistic projections of future natural gas production in
Egypt. This explains why there were no strenuous protests when a real Section 21.1
undertaking was not procured by EGPC.

 

w
So

. This is supported by provisions of the SPA. Section 24.1, entitled “Mutual Representations,”
states that UFACEX, as well as EGPC, represented and warranted that “(f) it has consulted
with its own legal, regulatory, tax, business, investment, financial, and accounting advisors
to the extent it has deemed necessary, and it has made its own investment, hedging, and
trading decisions (including decisions regarding the suitability of this Agreement) based
upon its own judgement and upon any advice from such advisors as it has deemed necessary
and not upon any view expressed by the other Party,” “(g) it understands the terms,
conditions, and risks of this Agreement and is capable of assuming and willing to assume
(financially and otherwise) those risks,” and “(h) it is acting as principal, and not as agent,
fiduciary, or any other capacity.” Section 25.9 would seem to describe the universe of
persons/entities bound by the terms of the SPA: “This Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.”

      

40. The majority considers that the juxtaposition of timing and the terms of Article 21.1, on
one hand, and the letter, on the other, excludes any objective interpretation other than that
the letter was the separate, extra-contractual undertaking required under Section 21.1. But,
in my view, there is a much simpler and likely interpretation.

41. As noted above, the EGPC Board’s 20 July 2000 decision to approve the memorandum on
the SPA noted that a further meeting was to be held with UFACEX “in order to increase
the maximum price ceilings.”>° In fact, the day after the meeting of the Council of Ministers,
on 26 July 2000, EGPC had such a meeting with UFACEX and the parties agreed to raise
the maximum prices from $1.00/MMBTU to $1.25/MMBTU.°*! However, as Claimant
states, “the executed version of the SPA contains a handwritten note from EGPC Chairman
Mohammed Tawila that ‘[t]he price [of gas] is subject to final approval by the Egyptian
Governmental authorities.”

42. Thus, at signing, the single remaining pre-condition to, and the only additional approval
required for, the full effectiveness of the SPA was approval of the final price. In this
circumstance, it was clearly the function of the 5 August 2000 Ministry letter to give notice

Egyptian regulations and applicable laws. 5.3 EGPC represents and warrants to UFACEX that its surplus of
natural gas will be sufficient to feed the Complex under the terms and conditions set forth in Appendix 1.”).

of the approval given for the new price terms. There has been no contention that such notice
of this outstanding approval was accomplished by any other means.

43. Thus, I believe that both the 25 July 2000 Council of Ministers decision and the 5 August
2000 Ministry of Petroleum letter must be read as approving the project generally and
approving, specifically, the price to be paid for the gas at agreed volumes, and nothing
else.*> I do not see a basis for concluding that they gave rise to any legitimate expectation
that Egypt would forswear its natural gas consumption and production policies in order to
guarantee EGAS’s supply commitments.

44. In the majority’s view, at para. 9.145, “the Respondent’s conduct failed to meet its obligations
under the FET standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty, taking into account as a relevant factor
the legitimate expectations generated by the Respondent’s undertaking in the form of the
Ministry of Petroleum’s letter dated 5 August 2000, as described above.” The majority finds
that Respondent frustrated Claimant’s legitimate expectations in two ways. First, it finds that
the shortages in gas supply to Claimant beginning in 2010 were due to “long-standing policies
of subsidising domestic users of gas and electricity,” which it says began after execution of
the SPA, “together with the failure to encourage the finding of gas deposits in Egypt” (paras.
9. 127 — 9.130). Second, it finds that, at some point before EGAS’s 24 February 2103 notice
of force majeure, the government had “directed EGAS to limit and eventually stop the supply
of feed gas under the SPA to the Damietta Plant.” I disagree with both of these conclusions.

4

a

. First, as verified by Claimant’s own expert,*4 domestic subsidies long predated the SPA and,
indeed, domestic energy pricing had not previously increased since 1993.55 More
importantly, Egyptian gas production under the government’s policies was obviously
sufficient to meet the requirements of the SPA, given that the demands of the Damietta Plant
constituted only a fraction of total production. Short of holding that Respondent had given
assurances to Claimant that it would guarantee enough production to supply a// customers,
there is no basis to say that these policies caused undersupply to Claimant. And this is aside
from the immensity of holding a State’s entire energy policy to constitute an FET violation.

 

46. Second, there is no direct evidence, and insufficient indirect evidence, that EGAS acted under
the government’s direction and control in curtailing supplies under the SPA.*” Respondent

5 This is not contradicted by the documents relating to the price increases in 2006, 2007 and 2008 (C-0320, C-
0392, C-0460, C-0462, C-0463), which cite Minister Fahmy’s involvement only in the final price negotiations of
26 July 2000.

56 Equating Damietta Plant issues with Claimant's particular issues is misleading since Claimant only has rights
to just under 60 % of Damietta tolling capacity, with EGAS itself enjoying the rights to the just-over 40%
remaining, Cl. Mem. Merits, Paragraph 172.

57 | do not consider the holding in the Ampal v. Egypt to support an opposite conclusion. Unlike the situation here,
in Ampal, as the Award notes in para. 9.110, the Ministry of Petroleum acted as the principal in the transactions
at issue by operation of a resolution of the Council of Ministers, Ampal v. Egypt, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1,

denies any such direction or instruction and produced witness testimony to support that
denial.*® None of the public statements by officials cited by the majority supports the
assertion that EGAS acted under instruction. The brief press report of Minister Kamal’s 15
October 2012 statement that “Egypt has stopped exporting gas to Jordan and Spain” does not
quote him, does not refer to any government decisions and correctly observes what was
happening within Egypt as a collective.*? Similarly, the equally brief press report
paraphrasing Minister Ismail’s 24 November 2013 statement in relationship to one of the
arbitrations commenced by Claimant that “we should first cover local market’s need from
natural gas,” also does not mention any government decision and at most speaks to the
consonant policies of EGAS and the government.”

The other statements attributed to government officials during meetings are similarly
deficient in their support of the majority’s conclusion. The testimony of Mr. Egea Krauel
that Minister Kamal’s alleged undertaking to study the situation made him realize that
Claimant was being singled out is a non sequitur and hardly proof of an instruction to EGAS.
Indeed he does not even corroborate Mr. Saez Ramirez’s testimony that Minister Kamal had
undertaken to “make a decision;”°! Mr. Sdez Ramirez fails in any case to state what the
subject matter of such a decision was to be. (The letter sent by UFG following this meeting
makes no mention of either of these statements attributed to Minister Kamal.°?)

 

 

The claim that Minister Ismail stated in a 26 November 2103 meeting that “Egypt will in fact
not comply with its obligations in the near future”® seems hard to credit and does not
corroborate an instruction to EGAS. Moreover, that such a statement was made was
vigorously denied in the reply by the Ministry.

Thus, I do not believe that there was a violation of the Treaty’s FET provision based upon
either the assertion that government energy policies caused the under-supply or the assertion
that EGAS acted to curtail supply under the direction and control of the government.°>

Damages

50.

wn
a

Regarding damages, I agree with the majority on the exclusion by operation of SPA Section
8.1[1] and other reasons of Claimant’s claims for lost dividends from SEGAS and loss of
profits on undelivered gas that was not replaced by UFG. I also agree, that as a result of our
unanimous decision to dismiss Claimant’s tax-free zone claim, we need not consider the
related claim to damages. However, I dissent from the majority’s ultimate conclusions with
respect to other damages that would be claimable if Egypt’s liability had been
demonstrated.

. The majority is of the view at paras. 9.84 and 9.126 that Claimant has been “almost ruined”

by the non-supply of gas under the SPA. But I think that this significantly overstates
Claimant’s situation. Indeed, the Union Fenosa Gas Group’s 2014 annual report states only
that “[t]he absence of Egyptian gas caused the Company’s supply costs rise [sic], reducing
profits compared with previous years.”°° The Group’s Directors’ Report for the financial
year ending on 31 December 2015 states that “[t]he absence of Egyptian gas, along with
the effects derived from the fall in the global energy scenario, has caused a notable
reduction in profits compared with previous years.”6’ Thus, far from being an issue of
Claimant’s survival, the Egyptian non-supply is a matter only of reduced profits.

. Similarly, I find Claimant’s presentation on quantification of damages to be greatly

overstated.

. First, while the majority prefers the approach of the Claimant’s experts, that approach, even

in its third alternative, suffers from a number of deficiencies that make it excessively
speculative. This is primarily because, rather than producing many of the underlying
transactional documents or even verifying them, it has relied upon print-outs from
Claimant’s own internal databases. This is particularly true with respect to documentation
of individual transactions on which Claimant may have suffered any actual loss;® there is
no ability for Respondent to contest whether Claimant allocated Claimant’s most expensive
replacement gas to replace the Egyptian gas to maximize the claim.

. Claimant’s experts argue that, because they are the product of a large company accounting

system, it has no reason to doubt the accuracy of the data,”° and that it would have been too

“burdensome” to produce many of the documents themselves.”! But, notwithstanding the
fact that Claimant’s accounts are audited for purposes of financial reporting, data produced
for litigation is not subject to audit for the purpose. Moreover, while “burdensomeness”
may well be a ground for objecting to discovery requests, it is the not a ground for failing
actually to prove damages suffered. In the context of a US$ 4 billion claim, producing such
documents, or at least a forensic audit of such data, for review by a respondent is not only
reasonable, but necessary.

. Second, the Tribunal finds that SPA Section’s 8.1[2]’s 90%-of-price limitation does not

affect damages because the Claimant’s experts calculated the limitation’s threshold to be
higher than the nominal amounts claimed for extra costs for delivered gas and costs of
replacing undelivered gas. But at the hearing, Respondent’s expert submitted, without
objection, a calculation based, not on monthly totals as used by Claimant’s expert, but on
transaction-by-transaction totals (using Claimant’s data), concluding that the resulting
limitation was US$ 567 million below the nominal amounts claimed.” I am persuaded that
such a basis more accurately tracks the actual costs suffered due to gas not delivered within
the meaning of SPA Section 8.1[2] and thus that the SPA provision limits the amount
claimable to US$ 1.853 billion.

 

 

. Third, I disagree with the majority that further efforts to mitigate damages could not

reasonably be required of Claimant. Respondent has provided sufficient evidence through
its experts to show that Claimant had plentiful opportunities beyond those identified by
Claimant’s financial executive Mr. Conti’ to reduce its delivery obligations that would
have allowed it to avoid substantial portions of its replacement costs. These include
renegotiating existing contracts in the favorable environment of declining gas demand in
Spain, declining to enter into new short-term contracts and invoking force majeure on
existing contracts. Without the benefit of contract terms known only to Claimant,
Respondent’s expert testified that short-term industrial contracts alone could have
accounted for as much as US$ 841 million of Claimant’s claimed losses.”* While these
changes would have necessitated further alterations to Claimant’s business model, the
temporary curtailment of particular lines of business does not imply that Claimant would
thereby have had to close substantially or completely its multi-line business.7>

 

Nor could invoking force majeure on its downstream contracts earlier than it did on 14
December 20147 be considered as unreasonable requirement. As early 20 March 2013, half

by definition, the question of mitigation never arises at all unless there has been some breach.

of Claimant’s Board of Directors and its CEO argued for taking just such a step.”’ The fact
that the other half of the Board squelched this idea cannot render it unreasonable, and any
costs incurred subsequent to that date should be considered as a business decision purely
to Claimant's account.

58. The area in which further mitigation by Claimant could have had its greatest impact would
have been in the diversion of all of the LNG it had under contract from Oman to down-
stream customers. While Claimant made the point that it is not claiming for any costs of
replacing Omani LNG, it never denied that diverting the 2.2 bema available from Oman
would have substantially reduced the need to purchase higher priced gas to replace
Damietta LNG. While this would have eliminated the profits that Claimant would otherwise
have gained from the sale of the Omani LNG on the Asian spot market, such lost profits
would not have been claimable here under the Tribunal’s decision. By the uncontested
calculation by Respondent’s expert, this would have reduced this head of damages to at
most US$ 241 million.
