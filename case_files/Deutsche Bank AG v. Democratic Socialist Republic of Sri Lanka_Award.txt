CHAPTER II. THE PARTIES’ CLAIMS AND PRAYERS FOR
RELIEF

The dispute has its origins in an oil Hedging Agreement dated 8 July 2008 (the “Hedging
Agreement” or the “Agreement”) between Deutsche Bank and Ceylon Petroleum
Corporation (“CPC”), Sri Lanka’s national petroleum corporation.

Deutsche Bank submits that Sri Lanka has violated Articles 2, 3, 4 and 8 of the Treaty
between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri
Lanka concerning the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments of 7 June 2000
(the “BIT” or “Treaty”). This is disputed by Respondent.

In the Request for Arbitration, Deutsche Bank requests the following relief:

1)

2)

3)

4)

5)

a declaration that the Respondent has violated Articles 2, 3, 4 and 8 of the Treaty, as
well as its obligations under general international law and Sri Lankan law;

an order that the Respondent make full reparation to Deutsche Bank for the injury to
its investment arising out of Sri Lanka’s violations of the Treaty and international law,
such full reparation being in the form of damages or compensation paid to Deutsche
Bank of USD 60,368,993, or alternatively such other amount as the Tribunal shall
determine;

interest in respect of paragraph (2) from 9 December 2008 to the date of the Award,
and thereafter until the date of payment at the rate set forth in its Memorial of 25
September 2009, or alternatively on such other basis as the Tribunal shall determine;
an order that the Respondent pay the costs of the arbitration proceedings including the
costs of the arbitrators and ICSID, as well as the legal and other expenses incurred by
Deutsche Bank including the fees of its legal Counsel, experts and consultants, as well
as Deutsche Bank’s own employees on a full indemnity basis, plus interest thereon at a
reasonable rate to be determined by the Tribunal; and

any other relief the Arbitral Tribunal may deem appropriate in the circumstances.

Deutsche Bank also requests the Tribunal to deny all relief sought by the Respondent.

Respondent requests the Tribunal to decide:

1)
2)

3)

that it lacks jurisdiction to hear the Claimant’s claims;

that the claim in contract based on CPC’s failure to pay amounts set to be due to

Deutsche Bank AG under the Hedging Agreement is inadmissible;

in the alternative:

a) that Deutsche Bank AG’s claim for damages under the Treaty fails and is
dismissed;

b) that the Claimant pay the Respondent’s costs of the proceeding, and the costs and
expenses of the Tribunal.

CHAPTER III. SUMMARY OF THE MAIN FACTS

The subsequent summary is intended to provide a general overview of the issues in dispute
between the parties. It is not intended to be an exhaustive description of all facts
considered relevant by the Tribunal. These will be addressed in the context of the
Tribunal’s analysis of the issues in dispute, and will be supplemented by relevant facts
including those provided by witnesses in the course of oral examination at the hearing.

The summary in this chapter is a chronology of events drawn from material submitted
jointly by the parties to this Tribunal.

SECTION I. THE HEDGING AGREEMENT

Sub-SectionI. The Regulatory Framework and Background of the Hedging
Agreement

As indicated above, the dispute has its origins in the Hedging Agreement concluded on 8
July 2008 between Deutsche Bank and CPC.

CPC is a 100% State-owned petroleum company established by an Act of the Sri Lankan
Parliament, namely Act No. 28 of 1961 (the “CPC Act”). Section 5 of the CPC Act states
the objectives of CPC as follows:

(a) to carry on business as an importer, exporter, seller, supplier or distributor of
petroleum;

(b) to carry on business of exploring for, and exploiting, producing, and refining of,
petroleum; and

(c) to carry on any such other business as may be incidental or conducive to the
attainment of the objects referred to in [the] paragraphs [above].

The Hedging Agreement was concluded in order to protect Sri Lanka against the impact of
rising oil prices. Indeed, between 2003 and 2008, oil prices followed an upward trend
rising from a monthly average of USD 28 per barrel in January 2003 to over USD 130 per
barrel in July 2008. Consequently, starting in August 2006, various government agents
advocated the conclusion of oil hedging transactions by CPC.

The regulatory framework for derivative products in Sri Lanka is constituted by the
“Directions on Financial Derivative Products in Foreign Exchange” issued in December
2005 by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (the “Central Bank”) (the “2005 Directions”)! The
explanatory notes to the Directions indicate that oil is among the commodities identified
for possible derivative transactions”. Prior to the issuance of the 2005 Directions,

Memorial on the Merits [hereinafter “Respondent’s Counter-Memorial”], para. 32.

derivative transactions required a transaction-by-transaction approval of the Central Bank
and the Controller of Exchange.

On 1 August 2006, Mr. Rodrigo of Deutsche Bank Colombo and Mr. Kelvin Wong of
Deutsche Bank Singapore* made a presentation on oil hedging to the Central Bank, and
other attendees including Mr. Lalith Karunaratne, Deputy General Manager (Finance) of
cPc’.

Following this presentation, Dr. H. M. Thenuwara, at the time the Central Bank’s Director
of Economic Research, gave a presentation to the Central Bank’s governing body, the
Monetary Board, and on 17 August 2006, the Central Bank’s Economic Research
Department produced a paper on “Hedging to Protect CPC Imports Against Oil Price
Volatility”®. The stated purpose of this paper was “to evaluate the need for hedging
mechanisms and recommend suitable mechanisms”. The paper recommended inter alia
that “the best option for Sri Lanka at the initial state will be ZC [zero cost] collar hedging’.
The paper further advised CPC to pursue the matter with counter parties based on quantum
of hedging and instrument offered®. The Central Bank subsequently requested indicative
quotes for swaps and zero cost collars from Deutsche Bank’s Colombo branch.

In early September 2006, A. N. Cabraal, Governor of the Central Bank, gave a presentation
to the President of Sri Lanka and the Cabinet of Ministers, explaining different hedging
mechanisms available to mitigate the impact of high oil prices'”, The Central Bank further
issued in late September 2006 a press release entitled “Protection from High Oil Prices”
dealing in some detail with oil-hedging instruments considered by it, During the fall of
2006, various Sri Lankan Government officials also made statements in the press
concerning the potential use of hedging instruments'”.

> Mr. Wong was at the time Director of Global Markets — Commodities Trading Division, Deutsche Bank
Singapore. As stated by the Claimant, “Deutsche Bank Colombo does not directly engage in derivative trades.
such as oil hedging transactions.” Claimant’s Memorial, para. 86.

L The Study Group Recommendations and the Cabinet of Ministers’ Decision

In October of 2006, the Parliament established a Cabinet Study Group to consider oil-
hedging. Its members included, inter alia, Dr. Thenuwara of the Central Bank, Ms.
Wijetunge of the Ministry of Petroleum and a Director of CPC, as well as Mr.
Karunarante'*. On 16 November 2006, the Study Group issued its report (the “Study
Group Report”), and submitted its findings to the Ministry of Finance.

The Study Group recommended the following: '*

- CPC to hedge the purchase of crude oil and refined petroleum products;

- use zero cost collar as the hedging instrument with the upper bound based on market
developments;

- commence hedging with smaller quantities for a shorter period and gradually increase
the quantity and duration;

- grant CPC authority to call for quotations for oil hedging, to decide on future prices
and to purchase hedging instruments from reputable banks; and

- grant CPC authority to change instruments based on the developments of the market.

In January of 2007, the Minister of Petroleum, Minister A. H. M. Fowzie, sought approval
of the Study Group’s Recommendations by the Cabinet of Ministers. By Cabinet Decision
of 24 January 2007, the Cabinet granted approval to the Recommendations, which were to
be implemented without delay’.

By letter of 29 January 2007, the Ministry of Petroleum sent the Cabinet’s decision to the
Chairman of CPC, which the parties to this arbitration both consider to amount to a
direction to CPC under section 7(1) of the CPC Act!®,

In February of 2007, CPC entered into its first derivative transaction with Standard
Chartered Bank (“SCB”).

I. CPC’s Board Resolutions of February and March 2007

On 9 February 2007, the Board of Directors of CPC held a board meeting, in the course of
which the following resolution was passed “The Board discussing this subject again
approved to take the hedge position of 0.05 Sin. Gas Oil on Zero Cost Collar or any other

suitable instrument for quantity of 450,000 bbls. for a period of 3 — 6 months” an

On 26 March 2007, the Board of Directors of CPC passed a further resolution
“empowering Chairman and Managing Director, Mr. Ashantha de Mel and Deputy General
Manager (Finance), Mr. Lalith Karunaratne to execute hedging transactions by using

appropriate hedging instruments 8

Governor Cabral and the Ministry of Petroleum requested Mr. de Mel to provide
information on hedging activities. Throughout 2007, Mr. de Mel sent to the Ministry of
Petroleum memoranda setting out proposed quotes and structures received from various
commercial banks (including Deutsche Bank, SCB and Citibank), and explained key terms
of certain derivative transactions entered into during 2007. Mr. de Mel also responded to
inquiries from Governor Cabraal regarding strategies to generate export income including
hedging to generate export income.

Sub-Section II. The 8 July 2008 Hedging Agreement and its Key Terms

Deutsche Bank, through its offices in Colombo and London, exchanged numerous
communications with CPC. Through late 2007 and 2008, several transaction possibilities,
such as target profit forwards (TPF) were discussed but not executed.

On 8 July 2008, oil prices stood at USD 137.52 per barrel. On the same day, Deutsche
Bank and CPC entered into the Hedging Agreement that lies at the core of the present
dispute. The Hedging Agreement consisted of the following documents:

(i) the 12 Month Target Profit Forward on Dubai Indicative Terms and Conditions (the
“Term Sheet”), dated 8 July 2008 (signed by Mr. de Mel and Mr. Karunaratne)””;

(ii) the Risk Disclosure Statement for Treasury and Financial Derivative Transactions (the

Karunaratne)”’; and

(iii) the Confirmation Letter with Term Sheet from Deutsche Bank to CPC confirming the
terms and conditions of the transaction (the “Confirmation Letter”), dated 10 July
2008 (signed by Mr. de Mel and Mr. Karunaratne and Deutsche Bank London),”!
which incorporated by reference the 2005 International Swap Dealers Association
(“ISDA”) Commodity Definitions, the 2000 ISDA Definitions, and the 1992 ISDA
Master Agreement (the latter however remaining unsigned and undated).

The relevant terms of the Hedging Agreement were as follows (using the summary by the
Claimant in para. 158 of its Memorial):

L The Term Sheet

The Term Sheet contained the key terms of the Hedging Agreement, providing as follows:

@
(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

(v)
(vi)

(vii)

The Hedging Agreement was effective from 1 August 2008 and was to terminate on
31 July 2009. (The trade date was not finalised in the Term Sheet.)

The Strike Volume (also called the Commodity Notional Amount), or the number of
barrels of oil that the Hedging Agreement applied to, was set at 100,000 barrels for
each of the parties.

The payments due under the Hedging Agreement were to be calculated on a monthly
basis, starting from the effective date of 1 August 2008 (the Calculation Periods),
and the Payment Dates were set for 14 Calendar days after the calculations. In
practice this would mean that payments were due monthly commencing on 14
September, subject to adjustment in accordance with Following Business Day
Convention.

The agreed Strike Price was USD 112.50 per barrel, with the reference for the price
of oil being the Specific Price per barrel of Dubai crude oil for delivery on the
Delivery Date published in the Platts Marketwire (the Benchmark Oil Price).

The Monthly Oil Price was the arithmetic average of the Benchmark Oil Price during
each business day of the calendar month of the relevant Calculation Periods.

The formula for calculating the floating payments due from each party on the
Payment Dates was set out in full. Where the Monthly Oil Price was greater than the
Strike Price, Deutsche Bank was obliged to pay CPC the difference between the
Strike Price and the Monthly Oil Price (up to a maximum price difference of USD10
per barrel), multiplied by the Strike Volume. Where the Monthly Oil Price was lower
than the Strike Price, CPC was obliged to pay Deutsche Bank the difference between
the Strike Price and the Monthly Oil Price multiplied by the Strike Volume.

CPC's Target Profit Level was set at USD 2,500,000 and therefore the trade
terminated if payout by Deutsche Bank reached this level.

(viii) CPC's failure to enter into and execute an ISDA Master Agreement with Deutsche

Bank on or before 90 days after the Trade Date would amount to a termination event.

IL. The Risk Disclosure Statement

The Risk Disclosure Statement identified the types of risks to be taken into consideration
prior to entering into such derivatives transaction”

Il. The Confirmation

The Confirmation Letter reflected the principal terms of the Term Sheet. In addition, the
Confirmation Letter identified the Trade Date as 8 July 2008, incorporated the 2005 ISDA
Commodity Definitions, and the 2000 ISDA Definitions.

The ISDA 1992 Master Agreement was further incorporated into the Confirmation as
follows: the “Confirmation...shall supplement, form a part of, and be subject to an
agreement in the form of the ISDA Form as if we had executed an agreement on the Trade
Date.”

The ISDA 1992 Master Agreement further states that each party “submits to the
jurisdiction of the English courts, if this Agreement is expressed to be governed by English
law,”?? while also stating that “nothing in this Agreement precludes either party from
bringing Proceedings in any other jurisdiction ... nor will the bringing of Proceedings in
any one or more jurisdictions preclude the bringing of Proceedings in any other
jurisdiction”.

The Confirmation Letter further indicated that, unless specified otherwise upon execution
of the ISDA Agreement, the governing law was English Law and the Termination
Currency was US Dollars.

With regard to early termination, the Confirmation Letter provided as follows:

“if the [ISDA Master Agreement] has not been executed by both Party A and Party
B within 90 calendar days following the Trade Date, then Party A may, but shall
not be obligated to, by at least five (5) Business Days prior notice (which notice, if
by telephone, shall be promptly confirmed in writing) to the other party set a date
to terminate this Transaction (which termination date shall be the Early
Termination Date with respect to this Transaction), whereupon a termination
payment shall be made on the Early Termination Date, as if such Transaction were
a Terminated Transaction and there were two Affected parties and, for this
purpose, Market Quotation applies’ 2

Sub-Section III. Subsequent Events Related to the Hedging Agreement

L Payments under the Hedging Agreement

On 15 July 2008, Dubai Crude Oil prices peak at USD 140.24 per barrel. On 19 September
2008, Deutsche Bank made a payment pursuant to the Hedging Agreement of USD
35,523.81 to CPC.

Oil prices began however to fall in late July and August 2008. CPC made payments under
the Hedging Agreement to Deutsche Bank in the amount of USD 1,659,636.36 on 17
October 2008, and USD 4,507,857.14 on 14 November 20087°.

On 13 November 2008, Deutsche Bank inquired with the Controller of Exchange of the
Central Bank whether approval of currency conversion of the upcoming payment by CPC
was required’. On 14 November 2008, the Controller of Exchange sent a letter to
Deutsche Bank, indicating that such approval was generally not required, unless special
circumstances have cast doubt on the respective transaction”®.

On 24 November 2008, the CPC Board further approved a payment under the Hedging
Agreement to Deutsche Bank; however such payment seems not to have been received by
the Claimant”.

I. Restructuring Discussions and Establishment of the Hedging Risk
Committee

In the fall of 2008 and against the background of falling oil prices, Deutsche Bank and
CPC discussed possibilities to restructure the Hedging Agreement, and Deutsche Bank
submitted various restructuring proposals to CPC, the last two of which were provided to
CPC on 25 November 2008.

On 21 November 2008, the Cabinet further established a “Hedging Risk Management
Committee” composed of members from the Ministry of Petroleum, the Treasury, the
Central Bank and CPC, which subsequently held meetings*”. The Committee was
established “for management of oil hedging risk in the interest of the country,*! and
deliberated proposals for managing risks associated with hedges in operations, submitted
by the Chairman of CPC*.

Tl. Early Termination of the Hedging Agreement

On 3 December 2008, Deutsche Bank terminated the Hedging Agreement with CPC. The
termination letter read in relevant part:

“Deutsche Bank hereby notifies [CPC] that, Deutsche Bank is exercising its right
to terminate the Transaction pursuant to the Confirmation as a result of a failure

by [CPC] to execute the ISDA Master Agreement within 90 days of the Trade
Date”.

By letter of 10 December 2008, Deutsche Bank calculated the close-out amount payable by
CPC to Deutsche Bank following the early termination as USD 60,368,993 o

SECTION II. THE SUPREME COURT PROCEEDINGS

On 26 November 2008, two fundamental rights applications were filed in the Supreme
Court of Sri Lanka*®. Fundamental Rights are identified in Chapter 3 of the Constitution of
Sri Lanka, and are vested in every citizen. Actual or imminent infringement of such right
may be brought before the Supreme Court®®,

In one such application, the petitioner sought to challenge the authority of CPC to enter
into the Hedging Agreement with Deutsche Bank (and the transactions entered into with
SCB and Citibank)”’. The grounds set forth by the petitioner included inter alia that (i)
CPC did not have the authority to enter into such derivative transactions, (ii) the Chairman
did not have authority to execute such transactions without specific approval by CPC’s
Board of Directors, and that (iii) the transactions were “prima facie iniquitous since they
are structured entirely for the benefit of the respective banks”**,

On 28 November 2008, the Supreme Court issued an Interim Order by which it granted the
petitioners leave to proceed, joined the two petitions, and adopted an Interim Order (the
“First Interim Order”) directing that: »

(i) all payments by CPC to Deutsche Bank and other banks be suspended;
(ii) Mr. de Mel, Chairman of CPC, be suspended for alleged misconduct;

(iii) President Rajapakse consider suspending Minister of Petroleum Fowzie for his

(iv) the Government directly purchase all petroleum products and distribute them through
the available network;

(v) _ the Secretary to the Treasury review taxes on petroleum products and submit a report
to the Supreme Court for the court to consider the possibility of a formula for the
pricing of petroleum products; and

(vi) the Monetary Board carry out an investigation “as regards the impugned transactions
and to take action thereon.”

The Supreme Court issued two further Interim Orders, one on 15 December 2008 (the
“Second Interim Order”), addressing the price of petrol and ordering the Monetary Board
to continue with its investigations of the transactions, and ordering the suspension of Mr.
Karunaratne from the position of Deputy General Manager (Finance) of cpc”.

On 17 December 2008 the Supreme Court issued a further Interim Order (the “Third
Interim Order”), fixing inter alia the price of petrol and ordering the Monetary Board to (i)
continue its investigations with the assistance of the Criminal Investigation Department of
the Police, and to (ii) refer the results of its investigations to the “Commission to
Investigate Bribery and Corruption".

On 27 January 2009, the Supreme Court made a Final Order (the “Final Order”),
terminating the Fundamental Rights proceedings and vacating all previously issued interim
orders. The Supreme Court noted that its decision was based on the fact that the Petitioners
would not pursue their applications “since the applications have been filed in the public
interest which would not be advanced in a situation of non-compliance of the order of
Court by the Executive”.

SECTION III. THE CENTRAL BANK’S ACTIONS
Sub-Section I. | Requests for information

In early November 2008, the Central Bank requested information from Deutsche Bank
Colombo relating to the 8 July 2008 Hedging Agreement. An official investigation into
this transaction was commenced by the Central Bank on 13 November 2008*7.

On 19 November 2008, Mr. Rohan Rodrigo, Head of the Global Markets Department,
Chief Country Officer of Deutsche Bank’s Colombo branch, attended a meeting at the

request of Governor Cabraal in connection with the investigation. As recalled by Mr.
Rodrigo in his witness statement, he was informed during this meeting that the Central
Bank believed that Deutsche Bank had not followed proper procedures in executing the
Hedging Agreement, and that the Central Bank would prepare an investigation report for
its Monetary Board®.

On 24 and 28 November 2008, the Central Bank sent requests for information to Deutsche
Bank regarding the Hedging Agreement, the ISDA Master Agreement, the CPC Board
Resolution authorizing the Hedging Agreement, and the approval from the Controller of
Exchange. Deutsche Bank responded to these requests by email of 26, 27 November and 2
December 2008.

Sub-Section II. The Central Bank’s Assessment of Compliance of 5 December 2008

Following a meeting on 5 December 2008 between officers of Deutsche Bank and
members of the Central Bank, the latter sent on the same day a letter to Mr. Rodrigo,
containing an Assessment of Compliance with the Provisions of the Directions Issued by
the Central Bank of Sri Lanka on Financial Derivative Products (the “Assessment of
Compliance”)**.

In the Assessment of Compliance, the Central Bank identified the following five non-
compliances in connection with the Hedging Agreement:

(i) “Failure of Deutsche Bank AG to provide adequate information to the Board of
Directors of CPC of the nature of their products and their inherent risks”*7;

(ii) “Failure of Deutsche Bank AG to carry out adequate credit risk assessment in the
case of CPC in line with internal credit policy and procedures”“*;

(iii) “Failure of [Deutsche Bank AG] to ascertain CPC’s ability to fulfill its obligations
arising from the downside risks associated with these hedging contracts”””;

(iv) “Failure of Deutsche Bank AG to provide adequate information on changes in risk
profile with market developments”; and

(v) Failure of Deutsche Bank AG “to ensure a high level of transparency with respect to
risks and other parameters associated with underlying hedging contract”?!

By letter of 11 December 2008, Deutsche Bank (London) objected to the Assessment of
Compliance™ (to which the Central Bank however never responded).

Sub-Section III. The Central Bank’s Directions of 16 December 2008

On 16 December 2008, the Monetary Board of the Central Bank sent a letter to Deutsche
Bank Colombo and other banks with which CPC had concluded derivative transactions
(the “16 December 2008 Directions” or “Stop-Payment Order”)**, Referring to the
Supreme Court’s Interim Order of 28 November 2008, which is described under Section II
above, the letter requested the banks “not to proceed with, or give effect to, these
transactions” as it considered those “materially affected and [...] substantially tainted.”
The letter also indicated that the Monetary Board would carry out further investigations in
light of the Supreme Court’s Order of 15 December 2008 (also addressed in C. of Chap.
VII, Section I, Sub-Section II).

On 27 January 2009, the Central Bank issued a press release confirming that the 16
December 2008 Directions to the banks would remain in force’.

Sub-Section IV. The Central Bank’s Investigation Report

Under cover of a letter of 6 January 2009, the Central Bank forwarded to Deutsche Bank
Colombo a report entitled “The Investigation Report on Oil Derivative Transactions
entered into by Deutsche Bank AG with the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (the
“Investigation Report”). The report states that the Central Bank’s investigation was based
on section 29(1) of the Monetary Law Act, and had been widened in scope, following the

Supreme Court Order of 28 November 2008°°.
The Investigation Report found that:5”

(i) Deutsche Bank failed to obtain the necessary undertakings from the Board of
Directors of CPC;

(ii) | Deutsche Bank failed to carry out adequate credit risk assessments;

(iii) it was possible the Hedging Agreement was heavily weighted/structured in favour of
Deutsche Bank;

(iv) the Chairman and the Deputy General Manager (Finance) of CPC did not possess the
necessary authority to enter into the Hedging Agreement;

(v) the internal policies and practices of CPC were not adequate to undertake nor
commensurate with the level of expertise required to undertake sophisticated
derivative transactions;

(vi) since Deutsche Bank had not signed the ISDA Agreement with CPC and not
obtained prior approval for this transaction, the Hedging Agreement does not appear
to be in line with best practices of the industry;

(vii) CPC and the banks were not in line with the Cabinet Decision of January 2007
relating to oil hedging;

(viii) CPC had not followed the proper and usual governmental procedure/processes in
entering into the Hedging Agreement, and that had Deutsche Bank carried out a
reasonable due diligence, it should have known about this situation.

In concluding, the Investigation Report stated that “the derivative contracts in issue entered
into by the Deutsche Bank AG with the CPC have been materially affected, thereby
seriously undermining the propriety of the transactions.”°*

Deutsche Bank objected to the Investigation Report by letter of 12 January 2009. By letter
of 13 March 2009, the Central Bank replied to Deutsche Bank’s letter’, to which Deutsche
Bank in turn responded on 25 March 2009.

By letter of 13 March 2009 and citing Section 44A of the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988, the
Central Bank informed Mr. Rodrigo that he was subject to an Assessment of Fitness and
Propriety”. Mr. Rodrigo responded on 25 March 2009, providing additional information.

CHAPTER IV. THE PROCEDURE

SECTION I. INSTITUTION OF THE PROCEEDINGS

The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”)
received on 17 February 2009 by email, and on 19 February 2009 in hard copy format, a
request for the institution of arbitration proceedings (the “Request for Arbitration”) under
the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of
Other States (the “ICSID Convention”) from Deutsche Bank AG, against the Democratic
Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.

Having received the necessary contact information from the requesting party, the Centre
transmitted on 25 February 2009 copies of the Request for Arbitration and_ its
accompanying documentation to the Republic in accordance with Rule 5(2) of the ICSID
Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (the
“ICSID Institution Rules’).

By letter of 11 March 2009, the Centre requested from Deutsche Bank AG certain
clarifications regarding the Request for Arbitration. By letter of 13 March 2009 addressed
to the Secretary-General of ICSID, Respondent objected to the registration of the Request
for Arbitration, submitting that the dispute as alleged was manifestly outside the
jurisdiction of the Centre and asking that the registration of the Request for Arbitration be
refused pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Institution Rule
6(1)(b). Deutsche Bank AG responded to the Centre’s inquiries and Respondent’s
objections by letter dated 17 March 2009.

On 24 March 2009, in accordance with Article 36 of the ICSID Convention, the Acting
Secretary-General registered the Request for Arbitration as supplemented by Claimant on
17 March 2009, and notified the parties of the registration in accordance with ICSID
Institution Rule 6(1)(a), inviting them at the same time to proceed as soon as possible with
the constitution of an Arbitral Tribunal.

Following several rounds of written communications, the parties reached on 19 May 2009
an agreement regarding the method of constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal in this
proceeding, pursuant to which the Arbitral Tribunal was to consist of three arbitrators, one
appointed by each party, and the third, presiding arbitrator appointed by agreement of the
two party-appointed arbitrators. Regarding the timeline, the parties agreed that each party-
appointed arbitrator was to be appointed within 21 days of Respondent’s letter of 5 May
2009, i.e., by 26 May 2009, and the President was to be appointed within 30 days of the
date the second co-arbitrator accepted his or her appointment. The parties’ agreement
further contemplated that if a party or the co-arbitrators failed to make an appointment
within the agreed timeframe, either party could request the Chairman of the ICSID
Administrative Council 0 to appoint the arbitrator(s) not yet appointed.

By letter of 25 May 2009 Respondent informed the Centre of the appointment of Mr.
Makhdoom Ali Khan, a national of Pakistan, as party-appointed arbitrator. By letter of 26

May 2009 Claimant informed the Centre of the appointment of Professor David A. R.
Williams, a national of New Zealand, as arbitrator. Mr. Khan accepted his appointment on
27 May 2009, and Professor Williams accepted his appointment on 28 May 2009.

On 29 June 2009, the Secretariat informed the parties that Professor Williams and Mr.
Khan had appointed Professor Bernard Hanotiau, a national of Belgium, as the President of
the Tribunal. Professor Hanotiau accepted his appointment on 2 July 2009.

On 6 July 2009, pursuant to Rule 6(2) of the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration
Proceedings (the “ICSID Arbitration Rules”), the ICSID Secretary-General informed the
parties that, having received from each arbitrator an acceptance of his appointment, the
Arbitral Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted and the proceedings to have begun
on that date.

By the same letter, Ms. Frauke Nitschke was designated to serve as Secretary of the
Tribunal. Between 12 March and 27 July 2012, Ms. Eloise Obadia served as Secretary of
the Tribunal while Ms. Nitschke was on leave.

SECTION II. PROCEDURAL RULES AND AGENDA: MINUTES OF THE FIRST
SESSION

Following an agreement by the parties and the Tribunal, a first session was held on 9
September 2009 by telephone conference.

The session considered various procedural matters regarding the conduct of the arbitration.
At the session, the parties expressed agreement that the Tribunal had been properly
constituted and stated that they had no objections in this respect. The parties further agreed
on a set of rules applicable to this proceeding as well as on a timetable for the filing of
written pleadings The session was recorded and sound recordings were subsequently
distributed by the Centre to the parties and the Members of the Tribunal. Summary
Minutes of the first session were prepared by the Secretary of the Tribunal and transmitted
to the parties following the session.

SECTION III. THE ISSUE OF BIFURCATION

In accordance with the timetable agreed upon at the first session, Respondent submitted on
14 December 2009 its Objections to Jurisdiction. As foreseen in the procedural calendar
agreed at the first session, Respondent also addressed the issue of bifurcation in its
submission, requesting the bifurcation of the proceeding between questions related to the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction and those related to the merits of the case.

By letter of 18 December 2009, Claimant requested certain clarifications concerning
Respondent’s position on jurisdiction as set forth in its 14 December 2009 submission.
Respondent answered Claimant’s inquiries by letter of 30 December 2009.

Claimant filed its submission on bifurcation on 14 January 2010, objecting to
Respondent’s request for the bifurcation of the proceeding.

On 26 January 2010, Respondent filed its observations on Claimant’s submission on
bifurcation, to which Claimant replied to on 9 February 2010.

Having duly considered the parties’ arguments in their written submissions on bifurcation,
the Tribunal denied in its Procedural Order of 25 February 2010 Respondent’s request for
bifurcation of the proceeding, and decided that the procedural calendar under alternative A
of Section 14 of the Summary Minutes of the first session was to apply to the remainder of
the proceeding. This calendar provided as follows:

- March 29, 2010: Respondent’s counter-memorial on the merits;

- May 10, 2010: Claimant’s reply on the merits and counter-memorial on
jurisdiction;

- June 21, 2010: Respondent’s rejoinder on the merits;

- July 26 - 30 (31), 2010 Hearing on jurisdiction and merits in Singapore (5 days and
1 day in reserve).

SECTION IV. CLAIMANT’S REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMEN
PROCEDURAL ORDER OF 9 APRIL 2010 AND DECISION OF 9 JUNE 2010

 

Subsequently, and in accordance with the procedure set forth in the Summary Minutes of
the first session, Claimant submitted a request for production of documents to Respondent
on 4 March 2010 (with minor clarifications submitted on 5 March 2010). Respondent
replied to Claimant’s request by letter of 22 March 2010. On 24 March 2010, Claimant
amended certain requests and requested Respondent to confirm by 29 March 2010 whether
it would accept any additional document requests, failing which the Claimant indicated
that it would raise the matter with the Tribunal. Respondent did not answer that letter.

On 1 April 2010, Claimant filed a request for production of documents with the Arbitral
Tribunal in the form of a Redfern Schedule, which set forth the positions of both parties
regarding each category of documents requested by Claimant. Respondent filed its
observations on Claimant’s request by letter of 6 April 2010.

In its Procedural Order dated 9 April 2010, the Arbitral Tribunal recorded the parties’
agreement on the production by Respondent of certain documents requested by Claimant,
and denied Claimant’s request for the production of certain other categories of documents.

By letter dated 26 May 2010, Claimant informed the Tribunal that Respondent had failed
to meet its document production undertakings and obligations as set forth in the Tribunal’s
Procedural Order of 9 April 2010, and requested the Arbitral Tribunal to order Respondent
to (i) produce these documents and to (ii) conduct specific searches of email accounts or in
the alternative confirm that such searches had been conducted by Respondent.

By letter of 28 May 2010, Sri Lanka responded to Claimant’s letter, stating, inter alia, that
Respondent had agreed to search for printed/hardcopy emails, but had not agreed to
conduct an electronic search, which in Respondent’s view was not required under the IBA
Rules of Evidence which the parties had agreed to be applicable to this proceeding.

Claimant objected to Respondent’s interpretation of the parties’ agreement and the
interpretation of the IBA Rules by letter of 1 June 2010.

Having taken note of the parties’ respective positions and arguments, the Arbitral Tribunal
decided on 9 June 2010 as follows:

[...] As pointed out by Claimant, emails are by nature electronic
documents, not hardcopy print outs. Consequently, Sri Lanka’s agreement
to search for emails necessarily amounts to an agreement to conduct a
reasonable electronic search for such emails. The Tribunal also agrees
that the usual interpretation of the term “Documents” in the IBA Rules of
Evidence includes electronic means of storing or recording information
and therefore emails.

We therefore invite Sri Lanka to proceed to a reasonable search of emails
complying with its undertaking to produce the documents requested [...].

SECTION V. RESPONDENT’S REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION OF
DOCUMENTS: PROCEDURAL ORDERS OF 23 JUNE AND 5 JULY 2010

In accordance with the procedure set forth in the Minutes of the first session, Respondent
submitted requests for production of documents directly to Claimant on 14 May 2010. By
letter of 28 May 2010, Claimant provided its response to these requests directly to
Respondent. On 31 May 2010 Respondent submitted a further request for production of
additional documents directly to Claimant (the “additional request”).

Under cover of a letter dated 3 June 2010, Respondent filed its requests for production of
documents with the Arbitral Tribunal for decision in the form of a Redfern Schedule. On
the same day, Claimant provided to the Arbitral Tribunal its position on Respondent’s
additional document production request of 31 May 2010 in the form of a Redfern Schedule
listing the position of both parties on Respondent’s additional document production
request.

On 10 June 2010, the Arbitral Tribunal denied Respondent’s additional document
production request.

By letter of 15 June 2010, Respondent informed the Arbitral Tribunal that Claimant had
agreed to the production of certain categories of documents identified in Respondent’s
request of 3 June 2010, and that Respondent no longer pursued a number of its other
requests, save for eight categories of documents. On 16 June 2010, Claimant responded to
Respondent’s letter, clarifying the categories of documents it agreed to produce while
recording its objections to certain other requests.

In its Procedural Order dated 23 June 2010, the Arbitral Tribunal decided the remaining
document production requests by Respondent, granting certain requests while denying
others.

On 24 June 2010, Respondent renewed its additional document production request, which
the Tribunal had decided on 10 June 2010. By letter of 29 June 2010, Claimant requested
that the Tribunal reject Respondent’s renewed request.

Having considered the parties’ views and arguments, the Arbitral Tribunal denied in its
Procedural Order of 5 July 2010 Respondent’s renewed request of 24 June 2010,
confirming its 10 June 2010 decision.

SECTION VI. EXCHANGE OF WRITTEN PLEADINGS

As mentioned above, Claimant filed a Memorial on the Merits (the “Cliamant’s
Memorial”) dated 25 September 2009 together with exhibits, legal authorities and the
witness statements of Messrs. Rohan Rodrigo, Sreenivasan Iyer, and Dhakshitha
Serasundera. On 14 December 2009, Respondent submitted its Objections to Jurisdiction

Gamage Dhammika Nanayakkara and Ms. Ranee Jayamaha.

By letter of 7 May 2010, the Arbitral Tribunal confirmed an amendment to the procedural
calendar agreed upon by the parties, according to which Claimant's Reply on the Merits
and Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction was to be filed on or before May 17, 2010; and
Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits was to be filed on or before June 25, 2010.

In accordance with the amended timetable, Claimant filed its Reply on the Merits and
Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction together with exhibits, legal authorities, the witness

until 27 August 2010 to file its Rejoinder on the Merits. Claimant objected to
Respondent’s application and request for an extension by letter of 4 June 2010. Each party
filed a further written submission on the matter on 8 June 2010.

Having examined the parties’ respective arguments, the Arbitral Tribunal decided on 9
June 2010 that a postponement of the hearing was not justified, and that the hearing as
originally scheduled was confirmed. The Arbitral Tribunal further decided to grant Sri
Lanka an extension until 7 July 2010 to file its Rejoinder.

In preparation of the hearing, the President of the Tribunal held a telephone conference
with the parties on 25 June 2010 concerning procedural matters related to the conduct of
the oral procedure.

Subsequently, by letter of 12 July 2010, both parties requested an adjournment of the
hearing originally scheduled to commence on 26 July 2010. The adjournment was
confirmed by the Tribunal on the same day.

On 12 and 13 July 2010, both parties filed observations regarding the allocation of costs of
the adjournment of the hearing. On 14 July 2010, the President of the Tribunal held a
telephone conference with the parties regarding the further procedure.

Following several rounds of correspondence between the parties and the Arbitral Tribunal
regarding (i) the allocation of costs for the adjournment of the hearing, and (ii) the parties’
and Tribunal Members’ availability for a 10-day hearing (four additional sitting days had
been requested by the parties), it was recorded on 16 August 2010 that the first possible
dates on which counsel and the Tribunal Members were available was 25 August to 7
September 2011. On 27 August 2010, the Arbitral Tribunal further decided to address
questions related to the costs of the adjournment in its award.

SECTION VII. CLAIMANT’S ADDITIONAL REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION
OF DOCUMENTS: PROCEDURAL ORDER OF 22 DECEMBER 2010

On 3 December 2010, Deutsche Bank filed a further request for production of documents
with the Arbitral Tribunal for decision. Claimant had submitted its requests directly to
Respondent on 3 August 2010, to which Sri Lanka responded by letter of 22 October 2010.
Claimant’s 3 December 2010 request contained the requested documents and the parties’
positions in form of a Redfern Schedule.

In its Procedural Order of 22 December 2010, the Arbitral Tribunal decided Claimant’s
document production requests, denying some and granting others.

SECTION IX. RESPONDENT’S REQUEST FOR RECONSIDERATION OF THE
TRIBUNAL’S PROCEDURAL ORDER: PROCEDURAL ORDER OF 9
FEBRUARY 2011

On 20 January 2011, Respondent requested the Arbitral Tribunal to reconsider certain
aspects of the Tribunal’s 23 June 2010 Procedural Order.

By letter of 26 January 2011, Claimant objected to Respondent’s request of 20 January
2011. Respondent filed a reply submission on production of documents on | February
2011, to which Claimant responded on 4 February 2011.

On 9 February 2011, having considered the parties’ respective submissions, the Arbitral
Tribunal issued a Procedural Order denying the Respondent’s 20 January 2011 request.

SECTION X. CLAIMANT’S FURTHER APPLICATION FOR AN ORDER IN
RELATION TO DOCUMENT PRODUCTION: PROCEDURAL ORDER OF 11
APRIL 2011

On 16 March 2011, Claimant submitted a request for on order by the Arbitral Tribunal in
relation to document production on the basis that Respondent had substantially failed to
discharge its document production undertakings and obligations. Respondent submitted its
observations on Claimant’s request on 25 March 2011. Claimant filed a further written
submission on the matter on 29 March 2011, to which Respondent replied on 6 April 2011.

Having considered the parties’ written submissions, the Arbitral Tribunal issued on 11
April 2011 a Procedural Order denying Claimant’s request and accepting Respondent’s
assurances of reasonable searches for the documents requested by Claimant. At the same
time the Arbitral Tribunal noted that it reserved the right to draw adverse inferences should
evidence be presented at a later stage in the proceeding disclosing that any of the
documents requested did in fact exist.

SECTION XI. THE PARTIES’ FURTHER APPLICATIONS FOR INCLUSION OF
EVIDENCE: DECISION OF 29 JULY 2011, PROCEDURAL ORDER OF 16
AUGUST 2011 AND PROCEDURAL ORDER OF 20 AUGUST 2011

Claimant’s application

In accordance with the procedural timetable leading up to the hearing, which had been
agreed upon by the parties and confirmed by the Arbitral Tribunal, each party filed further
evidence on 20 July 2011. Between 22 and 28 July 2011, the parties filed several rounds of
communications regarding the admission of further evidence. The parties were in
agreement regarding the inclusion of certain documents into the record, and, on 29 July
2011, the Arbitral Tribunal granted Claimant’s application for the inclusion of two further
expert opinions.

Respondent’s applications

By letter of 5 August 2011, Respondent requested the admission of further evidence into
the record, which included, inter alia, a copy of an English Court Order granting CPC’s
permission to appeal a judgment rendered on 11 July 2011 in the matter Standard
Chartered Bank v. Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (““SCB v. CPC”) in the English High
Court. A copy of the SCB v. CPC judgment had previously been introduced into the record
by the Claimant on 20 July 2011.

By the same letter, Respondent requested the admission of an award rendered on 1 August
2011 in an arbitration under the Rules of the London Court of International Arbitration
(“LCIA”) involving Citibank and CPC (the “Citibank award’).

Claimant objected to Sri Lanka’s request regarding the admission of the Citibank award on
the same day, and the parties exchanged further written submissions on this issue between
8 and 10 August 2011.

In accordance with the pre-hearing procedural calendar agreed by the parties, each party
filed a roadmap submission on 12 August 2011. By letter of 13 August 2011, Claimant
requested the Arbitral Tribunal to take note that Respondent had in its roadmap submission
made reference to the Citibank award and, should the Tribunal decide that the Citibank
award be inadmissible in this arbitration, Respondent should be directed to resubmit its
roadmap submission without references to the Citibank award. By letter of 14 August
2011, Respondent filed observations on Claimant’s 13 August 2011 letter.

In its Procedural Order of 16 August 2011, the Arbitral Tribunal confirmed that it had
refrained from reading the Citibank award submitted by Respondent on 5 August 2011.
The Tribunal decided that the Citibank award would not be admitted into the record of the
present arbitration, and that Respondent’s summaries thereof would also be excluded.
Respondent was further directed to resubmit its roadmap submission within two working
days of the Tribunal’s Order with all references to the Citibank award removed. The
Tribunal further admitted all other documents submitted by Respondent on 5 August 2011
into the record.

By letter of 17 August 2011, Respondent invited the Arbitral Tribunal to reconsider its
decision regarding the inadmissibility of the Citibank award. By letter of 18 August 2011,
Claimant objected to Respondent’s request and reaffirmed its position of the
inadmissibility of the Citibank award in this arbitration.

Having examined the parties’ submissions and arguments on the issue, the Tribunal
decided in its Procedural Order of 20 August 2011, to reconsider its 16 August 2011
decision and to admit the Citibank LCIA award into the record, and further authorized
references thereto and summaries thereof in the parties written and oral submissions.

SECTION XIII. POST-HEARING SUBMISSIONS; SUBMISSIONS ON THE
JUDICIAL COMMITTEE’S DECISION IN GECAMINES AND THE COURT OF
APPEAL’s DECISION IN SCB; CLOSURE OF THE PROCEEDINGS

At the end of the hearing and following the parties’ joint proposal, the Tribunal decided
that the parties were to file a first round of post-hearing briefs simultaneously on 25
October 2011, and a second round on 10 November 2011. Each party filed its post-hearing
submission in accordance with this calendar.

to the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, on appeal from the Court of
Appeal of Jersey, in La Générale des Carriéres et des Mines (Gécamines) v F.G.
Hemisphere Associates LLC which in Respondent’s view was directly relevant to the

CHAPTER V. JURISDICTION

Respondent submits that the Arbitral Tribunal does not have jurisdiction under the BIT and
under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. This is disputed by Claimant.

The parties have filed very extensive submissions on this issue as well as on the other
issues dealt with in the subsequent chapters. The summaries of the parties’ arguments set
out below are without prejudice of the parties’ full arguments as submitted in written
pleadings and presented at the hearing, which the Tribunal has taken into full consideration
in making its determinations.

SECTION I. CLAIMANT’S POSITION
Sub-SectionI. The Treaty
The Treaty provides in its Article 1 that for the purposes of this Treaty:

“7. The term “investments” comprises every kind of asset, in particular: ...
c) claims to money which has been used to create an economic value or claims to any
performance having an economic value and associated with an investment;

Article 11 of the Treaty provides that:

“7. Divergences concerning investments between a Contracting State and a national
or company of the other Contracting State should as far as possible be settled
amicably between the parties in dispute.

2. If the divergency cannot be settled within six months of the date when it has been
raised by one of the parties in dispute, it shall, unless the parties in dispute agree
otherwise, be submitted at the request of the national or company of the other
Contracting State for settlement under the Convention of 18 March 1965 on the
Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States.

L Investment under Article 1(1) of the Treaty

According to Claimant, the Hedging Agreement satisfies the definition of investment
under Article 1(1) of the Treaty. This Article provides that the term “investments”
comprises “every kind of asset” before setting out a list of illustrative categories. Claimant
submits that the Hedging Agreement is an asset, it is legal property with economic value
for Deutsche Bank that booked the Agreement as an asset at fair value in its accounts.

Claimant further submits that Article 1(1)(c) is simply an illustration of the reference to
“every kind of asset’. According to Claimant, the wording of Article 1(1)(c) cannot be
read, as alleged by Respondent, as requiring the receivables or claims to performance to be

25

134.

135.

136.

137.

138.

associated with a separate investment in order to qualify for protection. Such an
interpretation would render Article 1(1)(c) superfluous since it would depend on the
existence of an independent investment. Claimant asserts that Sri Lanka has cited no case
where a tribunal has read such language restrictively. According to Claimant, an
illustrative list of “assets” is precisely that and does not imply the exclusion of assets
which do not happen to be listed, or that the broad scope of protected investments should
be constrained by a narrow and restrictive construction of those listed.

According to Claimant, Deutsche Bank’s rights under the Hedging Agreement are
definitely an “assef’ and they comprise both “claims to money” and “claims to
performance” within Article 1(1)(c). Claimant submits that no tribunal has read the
circular language “associated with an investment” in the restrictive way Sri Lanka intends.
For its position, Claimant refers inter alia to CSOB v. Slovak Republic, where the Arbitral
Tribunal was faced with a similar language under Article (1)(c) of the Czech Republic-
Slovakia BIT and had no difficulty finding that “terms as broad as “asset” and “monetary
receivables or claims” clearly encompass loans”®, Claimant also refers to the Alpha
Projekt Holding v. Ukraine case™ in which the Arbitral Tribunal decided that loan
agreements can be considered an investment.

Finally, Claimant submits that even if the words “and associated with an investment” had
to receive the meaning given by Respondent, they only apply to “claims to performance”
and not to “claims to money”.

IL. Territorial nexus with Sri Lanka

Claimant submits that the jurisdictional provisions in Articles 1 and 11 of the Treaty do not
contain any territoriality requirement. Claimant accepts that some territorial nexus with Sri
Lanka was required in order to engage the substantive protections of the Treaty but
Claimant considers this to be a merits issue to be determined when considering the actions
of the relevant authorities in relation to the investment and that there was no independent
requirement for any investment to be physically located in Sri Lanka.

Claimant further submits that in any event, it is clear that the Hedging Agreement satisfied
any territoriality requirement, and that Sri Lanka’s suggestion that the Agreement cannot
be located in its territory because the Central Bank “did not and cannot regulate the seller
of the product, DB London’ is incorrect.

According to Claimant, there are several arguments for its position: First, Claimant
submits that in most treaty disputes, where the investment in question is a State contract,
the host State will not be able to regulate the foreign counterparty per se but merely its
activities in furtherance of the contract.

273 [hereinafter “Alpha v. Ukraine”.

26

139.

140.

141.

142.

Secondly, Claimant asserts that the legal parties to the Hedging Agreement were CPC and
Deutsche Bank AG and not Deutsche Bank London. The Central Bank is able and did in
fact regulate Deutsche Bank AG through its Colombo branch in relation to the contract.
The Central Bank assumed regulatory jurisdiction over Deutsche Bank AG’s contract and
the fact that it was achieved via its jurisdiction over Deutsche Bank AG’s branch in
Colombo is of no importance. Claimant refers in this respect to the testimony of Mr. Silva
and Mr. Rodrigo” .

Thirdly, according to Claimant, Sri Lanka overlooked the fact that the Hedging Agreement
could not have been concluded without Deutsche Bank Colombo. The minutes of the
Study Group make this clear. Mr. Karunaratne, member of the Study Group, confirmed in
his evidence that a local presence was indeed a requirement of the Central Bank. He made
clear that CPC would not have concluded the Hedging Agreement if Deutsche Bank did
not have a presence in Colombo, and it is precisely for this reason that it did not conclude
an agreement with Merrill Lynch. All five banks which concluded Hedging Agreements
with CPC had a local presence.

In Claimant’s view, Mr. Karunaratne also confirmed that in relation to the Hedging
Agreement, he only dealt with Mr. Serasundera, that all meetings took place at CPC’s
office and that he had no contact with Deutsche Bank London”. Further, Mr. Serasundera
spent more than 50% of his time over almost a two-year period working on various aspects
of the Hedging Agreement including overseeing the necessary internal approvals,
satisfying documentary requirements, obtaining quotes, liaising with CPC, and providing
market updates to CPC almost daily’. Claimant concludes that but for the existence and
involvement of Deutsche Bank Colombo, the Hedging Agreement could not have been
concluded and that Deutsche Bank Colombo played an indispensable role in relation to the
investment. According to Claimant, this was sufficient to establish the required territorial
nexus with Sri Lanka.

Claimant also insists on the global nature of Deutsche Bank’s operations which is reflected
in the presence of many branches and the centralisation of some of the functions in certain
centers, such as Singapore where all credit decisions are made with regard to Sri Lankan
clients. According to Claimant, the majority of the day-to-day interaction of Mr.
Serasundera in relation to the Hedging Agreement was with Mr. Wong, Mr. Ng, Mr.
Mazumder and Mr. Iyer, all of whom are based in Asia®. In Claimant’s view, the global

146.

nature of Deutsche Bank is also reflected in the fact that accounts are prepared for
Deutsche Bank AG as a whole and not for separate branches.

Claimant finally submits that the nature of any territoriality requirement must depend on
the investment at issue. In the case of financial instruments, Claimant asserts that it is well
established that the territorial nexus exists where the purpose of the transaction is achieved
in the host State. Abaclat confirmed this approach, holding that in the case of financial
instruments: “the relevant criteria should be where and/or to the benefit of whom the funds
are ultimately used, and not the place where the funds were paid out or transferred”.
Since the parties agreed that the reduction of volatility is the purpose of the hedging
transaction”’, and since the Hedging Agreement immediately reduced CPC’s exposure to
volatility by 9.04%, the defining feature of the Agreement occurred in Sri Lanka.
Moreover, according to Claimant, all other benefits of the Agreement such as the
improvement of CPC’s cash flow also occurred in Sri Lanka and all payments by Deutsche
Bank to CPC in order to offset the problem caused by high oil prices were required to be
made in Sri Lanka; let alone the fact that in this case, the territorial nexus also included
substantial activities on the ground in Sri Lanka.

Sub-Section II. Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention
Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that

“[t]he jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out
of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or
agency of the Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and the
national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in
writing to submit to the Centre”.

Claimant accepts the existence of a “double-barrel test” but only to a very limited extent. It
submits that it cannot have been the parties’ intention that Article 25(1) of the Convention
would restrict the broad definition of “investments” chosen in Article 1(1) of the Treaty so
as to frustrate the bringing of any claim.

Claimant further submits that the Salini”’ characteristics have been discredited and are not
a jurisdictional requirement but that in any case, they are satisfied here.

L Contribution

Claimant submits that the Hedging Agreement undoubtedly involved a contribution to Sri
Lanka for multiple reasons. First, it involved a binding commitment by Deutsche Bank to

pay up to USD 2.5 million. Secondly, according to Claimant, at prevailing prices, the
Hedging Agreement gave CPC and Sri Lanka access to oil at substantially below spot and
forward-curve prices.

Thirdly, Claimant points out that the Hedging Agreement provided a 9.04% reduction in
CPC’s exposure to volatility in relation to the 100,000 barrels hedged. Claimant further
submits that the serious negative consequence of un-hedged exposure to oil price volatility
for developing countries have been confirmed by the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund (“IMF”). In Claimant’s view, it cannot be disputed that the reduction in
exposure to volatility of oil prices immediately upon conclusion of the Hedging Agreement
was a benefit both to CPC and the Sri Lankan economy. In Claimant’s view, Mr. Grove’s
calculation, which had not been challenged by Sri Lanka, is that the Hedging Agreement
reduced CPC’s exposure to volatility by 9.04% immediately upon its conclusion in relation
to the 100.000 barrels hedged”. According to Claimant and contrary to what Sri Lanka
seemed to suggest, this reduction was not dependent on any subsequent movement in oil
prices, it was a measurable economic benefit which accrued to CPC at the moment the
Hedging Agreement was signed”.

Fourth, Claimant asserts that the Hedging Agreement provided cash flow benefits. The
structure of the Hedging Agreement ensured that CPC would not bear the full cost of oil
prices whilst they remained above USD 112.50 in respect of the 100,000 barrels hedged.

Fifth, Claimant submits that the Hedging Agreement required Deutsche Bank to extend a
substantial credit line to CPC. The amount of this credit line was calculated by Deutsche
Bank at USD 25 million on the date the Hedging Agreement was concluded as reflected in
the record and confirmed both by Mr. Iyer” and Mr. Grove”. Claimant disputes Sri
Lanka’s contention in its Closing Submission that “there was no provision of credit in any
sense of the word on 8 July 2008”7°. In Claimant’s view, there is no support for this point
of view. To the contrary, Claimant submits that Mr. Nanayakkara also confirmed that
Deutsche Bank assumed a credit risk under the Hedging Agreement”. According to
Claimant, it was for this reason that Credit Risk Management approval was required for
conclusion of the Hedging Agreement just as it would have been if Deutsche Bank had
extended a loan to CPC.

Finally, Claimant submits that the extension of credit had real and tangible benefits to
CPC. If CPC had not dealt directly with Deutsche Bank, but instead had obtained
derivatives from an exchange, it would have been required to make an upfront margin

deposit and faced further margin calls if the trade moved against CPC. According to
Claimant, this was confirmed by Mr. Karunaratne”* and admitted by the CPC Board”.

Claimant further considers that Sri Lanka’s allegation that there was no contribution by
Deutsche Bank because “if the risks faced by CPC were to arise, there would be no
contribution of any kind by DB London”, is without merit. According to Claimant,
immediately on conclusion of the Hedging Agreement, with oil prices levels of close to
USD 140 per barrel, Deutsche Bank relieved CPC of the risk that it would continue to pay
the full market price of oil whilst prices remained at such elevated levels. In Claimant’s
view, the Hedging Agreement provided CPC with an assurance that for a period of twelve
months it would be protected by up to USD 10 per barrel and an overall USD 2.5 million
for 100,000 barrels of oil whilst prices remained above USD 112.50. The obligations
assumed by Deutsche Bank which so reduced CPC’s risk were Deutsche Bank’s
contribution in this regard.

Claimant also submits that Sri Lanka wrongly attempts to equate a “contribution” by
Deutsche Bank to actual payments to CPC under the Hedging Agreement. The investment
must be assessed at its inception and not with hindsight. Moreover, there is no requirement
for a cross boarder flow of capital in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. According to
Claimant, the key point is that the conclusion of the Hedging Agreement gave CPC
immediate protection and without payment of a premium. The parties agree in this regard
that the date the Hedging Agreement was concluded is the relevant date to determine
whether there was an investment.

According to Claimant, Sri Lanka’s suggestion that the Agreement would result “in either
a contribution or a return” but not both, proceeds from the same flawed logic which
confuses subsequent payment by Deutsche Bank with its contribution on Day 1. In
Claimant’s view, it is also incorrect that Deutsche Bank’s return was conditional upon
market prices falling such that CPC made payments to Deutsche Bank. Claimant asserts
that the Agreement, like all derivatives concluded by banks, had a positive mark to market
value for Deutsche Bank immediately upon its conclusion as a result of the bid-offer
spread regardless of future movements in the market prices.

Claimant also disputes Sri Lanka’s allegation that the Hedging Agreement did not provide
CPC immediate access to oil at below market rate. In Claimant’s view, hedging contracts
by their nature directly correspond to an underlying physical exposure held by the hedger.
Claimant submits that in CPC’s case, this exposure was the purchase of 100,000 barrels of
crude oil at market rate. The Hedging Agreement, whose payment terms were derived from
market prices, had the effect of offsetting and discounting the actual price paid by CPC.
That this was achieved by separate contracts is irrelevant according to the Claimant.

Finally, Claimant disputes Sri Lanka’s position that derivative agreements which, by their
nature, involve uncertain pay-outs which are linked to movements in market prices, may
never fall within Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. According to Claimant, the
substantial benefits of such agreements, and oil-hedging contracts in particular, to
developing States have been emphasized repeatedly by the IMF, the World Bank and
others and that the United States Model BIT specifically identifies derivatives as
investments. Deutsche Bank however points out that the Tribunal need not find that all
derivatives constitute an investment. Claimant submits that the Hedging Agreement was a
unique contract, negotiated over some two years in order to further national policy. It was
concluded with substantial governmental involvement and oversight and for a specific
significant duration and was carried out on credit rather than payment of a premium or
margin.

IL. Duration

Claimant submits that Deutsche Bank worked towards delivering the Hedging Agreement
from August 2006, almost two years before its conclusion and the Agreement commitment
was for twelve months. In Claimant’s view, it is immaterial that under certain
circumstances, it might terminate before then. This will almost invariably be the case
where an investment is a contract.

Claimant objects to Sri Lanka’s submission that the Hedging Agreement was unilaterally
terminable by Deutsche Bank. According to Claimant, this is not correct. The Agreement
provides for termination only in the event of a few specifically identified “additional
termination events”.

According to Claimant, the fact that the Hedging Agreement was terminated by Deutsche
Bank after 125 days is irrelevant. The relevant date to determine the existence of an
investment is when the agreement is concluded. The Agreement involved a commitment
for twelve months and this is sufficient.

In any case Claimant submits that the drafters of the ICSID Convention specifically
rejected the imposition of a minimum duration. Claimant further argues that both ICSID
and non-ICSID tribunals have confirmed that a minimum duration should not be imposed”
and found that twelve months is a sufficiently long term commitment to be an

investment*’.

Il. Risk

Claimant submits that the Hedging Agreement involved various risks for Deutsche Bank:
credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operations risk, legal risk and political risk®?,

According to Claimant, Sri Lanka had no answer to the fact that Deutsche Bank faced a
substantial risk that it would pay up to USD 2.5 million to CPC.

IV. Contribution to economic development

According to Claimant, contribution to the economic development of the host State is not a
jurisdictional condition. It has been discredited and has not been adopted by a recent
tribunal. Indeed, whether a given transaction makes a positive contribution to economic
development introduces inacceptable subjectivism and is a matter on which economists
may often disagree.

In any event, Claimant argues that this criterion would clearly be satisfied in the present
case. The hedging program was designed and implemented in the national interest and the
Sri Lankan authorities, well aware of the terms of the transactions being concluded by
CPC, repeatedly attested to their benefits to CPC and the national economy.

V. Expectation of regular profit or return

Claimant submits that the criterion of profit and return does not constitute a jurisdictional
requirement. This was confirmed by the Tribunal in Malaysian Historical Salvors v.
Malaysia®. In any case, insofar as it is relevant, it should be more accurately stated as an
expectation of profit or return. For example, the Tribunal in Biwater Gauff™ found that,
although the business was never in fact profitable, the criterion was nonetheless satisfied as
“BGT intended the project to be profitable albeit with a relatively low rate of return’.

 

Claimant argues that Deutsche Bank concluded the Hedging Agreement with an intention
to make a profit. It had an immediate “mark to market” value for Deutsche Bank in the
form of a bid-offer spread®® :

VI. There is no “Ordinary commercial transaction” test

Contrary to what Sri Lanka alleges, Claimant submits that the Hedging Agreement is not a
sale of goods. It is a financial product along with many other financial instruments such as

bonds and loans. Claimant argues that the Fedax”, CSOB’’, Abaclat® and Alpha
Projektholding? Tribunals have all qualified loans and bonds as investments.

According to Claimant, there is good reason for a simple sale of goods not to be considered
an investment. There is no duration of any significance. Such sales are typically supported
by letters of credit or upfront payments such that there is little or no risk associated with
the sale. The only contribution is the transfer of title to goods against full and immediate
payment at market rate. There are therefore good reasons why a simple sale of goods is not
considered an investment which do not depend on any alleged “ordinary commercial
transaction” test. However, Claimant argues that where a sales agreement includes special
features such as a bespoke product or the provision of a credit line, it is difficult to see why
it should not be considered an investment”.

Deutsche Bank insists that there is no “ordinary commercial transaction” test, suggesting
an exclusion of activity which is normal or routine for the investor. Such a reference is in
Claimant’s view imprecise and would be unworkable. The international government bond
market is worth many trillions of dollars, with such bonds being traded in high volumes on
a daily basis, but this, so Claimant submits, has not prevented tribunals concluding that
bonds are an investment. Similarly, granting loans is a normal activity for banks, but this
has not prevented loans from constituting an investment.

In any event Claimant argues the Hedging Agreement was in no sense an “ordinary
commercial transaction”. The hedging program was negotiated over a period of two years
at the instigation and with the approval of the very highest authorities in Sri Lanka to
further the national interest.

Finally, Claimant submits that Sri Lanka may not rely on Professor Abi-Saab’s opinion in
the recent Abaclat case”'. The facts of Abaclat were different since the bonds were
purchased on the secondary market and there was no activity by the investors in the host
State nor any direct dealings with Argentina. In Claimant’s view, the same concerns do not
arise in this case where substantial and indeed indispensable activities were carried out in
Sri Lanka. Deutsche Bank dealt directly with both CPC and the Central Bank in relation to
the conclusion of the Hedging Agreement.

VII. The Hedging Agreement is not a “Contingent Liability”

Claimant denies Sri Lanka’s argument that the Hedging Agreement cannot amount to an
investment as it involves a purely contingent future liability. According to Claimant, none
of the cases on which Sri Lanka relies is authority for Sri Lanka’s position. Furthermore, it
is clear to Claimant that as a matter of accounting practice as well as ordinary construction,
the Hedging Agreement was not a contingent liability: it created immediate rights and
obligations and created value from the outset.

According to Claimant, Respondent stretches beyond recognition the notion of
“Contingent Liability”. The term has a specific meaning as a matter of accounting
treatment. International Accounting Standards (“IAS”), in particular IAS 37, defines
“Contingent Liabilities” in the following terms:

“A possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be
confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain
future events not wholly within the control of the entity; or

a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognized because:

(i) it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will
be required to settle the obligation; or

(ii) the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability”.

The Hedging Agreement is according to Claimant not considered as a “Contingent
Liability” in financial practice. Derivatives fall within the scope of IAS 39: “/t]he basic
principle in IAS 39 is that all derivatives are carried at fair value with gains and losses in
the income statement”**. Claimant submits that the IMF also confirms that

“[c]Jontingent assets and liabilities are contractual financial arrangements between
institutional units that do not give rise to unconditional requirements either to
make payments or to provide other objects of value. They are not recognised as
financial assets or liabilities prior to the condition(s) being fulfilled. ... Although
the value of future payments arising from equity, financial derivatives ... are
recognised as financial assets rather than as contingent assets. ... [T]he liability
exists, but the amounts payable depend on subsequent events””>,

Claimant points out that this position is consistent with Deutsche Bank’s internal treatment
of the Hedging Agreement”, CPC’s Annual Report 2007 does not include the hedging
arrangements in its list of “Contingent Liabilities”®>. They are listed in the profit and loss
account.

Sub-Section III. Is the Hedging Agreement valid? Did CPC have the capacity to
enter into it?

This third issue involves two separate sub-issues:

on the one hand, is Sri Lanka entitled to dispute the validity of the Hedging Agreement
given its active involvement and knowledge of the hedging program and the public
credit and financial benefits it took from it until the day where it had to make payments
to Deutsche Bank?

On the other hand, is the Hedging Agreement void because it was outside CPC statutory
authority?

L Is Sri Lanka entitled to dispute the validity of the Hedging Agreement?

(A) — Sri Lanka’s denial of the validity of the Hedging Agreement is
unconscionable in light of its involvement and knowledge of
CPC’s hedging program

According to Deutsche Bank, Sri Lanka initiated and promoted CPC’s hedging program
for its own national interest; it was kept fully informed of it including the features it now
complains of; it took public credit as well as substantial benefits from such agreements;
and it deliberately chose to intervene only when the unexpected fall in oil prices reversed
the flow of payments to CPC.

1) The hedging program was initiated by Sri Lanka in the
national interest

Claimant submits that the hedging program was initiated by the Central Bank in a national
interest and implemented in accordance with Cabinet approval. Following the
discontinuance of the Government’s subsidies, it became imperative to consider alternative
strategies which led to the Central Bank’s interest in oil hedging”®.

As stated above, in late July / early August 2006, the Central Bank invited Deutsche Bank
and other banks to make presentations on hedging and later called for quotes from the
banks directly”. The Central Bank was the driving force behind the hedging program,
promoting it to the public, the Cabinet and the President®®. The hedging program was said
to be in the national interest, i.e., to safeguard Sri Lanka’s balance of payments position
and foreign reserves, to address macroeconomic imbalances associated with rising oil
prices and to reduce the risk of social instability”.

By October 2006, the Central Bank was confident that there was sufficient expertise and
knowledge within the Bank and other Government institutions to implement this type of
scheme!” According to Mr. Karunaratne, the Central Bank had decided that CPC would
be required to hedge even before the Study Group was set up in October 2008 and
regardless of CPC’s own opinion!” This view was shared by Mr. de Mel and Minister
Fowzie who confirmed that the Central Bank was “responsible” !™,

2) Sri Lanka was kept fully informed of CPC’s hedging
program

Deutsche Bank submits that Sri Lanka was kept fully informed of the details of CPC’s
hedging program from the very start. The first agreement concluded by CPC with the
Standard Chartered Bank on 7 February 2007 was a seagull or three-way collar with a
USD 2 per barrel cap for a three-month period! In response to a request from the
Ministry of Petroleum'™, CPC provided a draft Cabinet Memorandum setting out the
terms of the transaction, including the USD 2 seagull!®, Minister Fowzie has recognised in
his witness statement that he was aware that CPC was entering into agreements with a cap
on the upside!

According to Claimant, the full details of the first agreement were published in a joint
press release by CPC and SCB in February 2007'°7. On 20 February 2007, Dr. Thenuwara,
Assistant Governor of Central Bank, Study Group Member and Observer to the CPC
Board, spoke at a press conference where the terms of the trade were explained!*. Mr.
Ranasinghe confirmed during his testimony that he saw the press release and it was clear
from this that CPC had capped the upside (potential payments were limited to USD
900.000) to USD 2 per barrel without limiting the downside (payments by CPC to SCB
were in theory up to USD 30,375,000)'. Mr. Ranasinghe also confirmed that the
reference in the Central Bank’s Annual Report 2006 to the conclusion of zero cost collars
“with a ceiling price” refers to this cap on the upside!!,

Claimant recalls that shortly before the conclusion of the first transaction, Governor
Cabraal referred to the need to accept a cap on the upside as a “trade-off we had to work
out for pricing reasons” !"', Consequently in Claimant’s view, both the Ministry of
Petroleum and the Central Bank were aware that CPC was capping its upside. According to
Claimant, this was the feature that Sri Lanka put forward to argue that the Hedging
Agreement was speculative and ultra vires while at the time, there was no criticism nor
any suggestion that it might be so!!?,

Claimant further points out that the Sri Lankan authorities continued to receive updates
regarding the agreements which were concluded. As an example, Dr. Thenuwara actively
discussed hedging at the CPC Board Meeting on 20 August 2007 where Board Paper No.
30 was approved''?, Ms. Wijetunge, Additional Secretary to the Ministry of Petroleum and
Study Group Member, and Mr. Perera, Chairman of the Board of Investment, were also
present. The Board Paper referred to CPC’s first two trades with Citibank which included
Seagull and TPF features. The trades were also leveraged. Claimant submits that no

objection was made by any attendee!*,

Claimant also emphasizes that Mr. de Mel testified that as a matter of practice, he kept

Minister Fowzie informed of the basic details following the conclusion of CPC’s trades,
including the Hedging Agreement itself! >.

Deutsche Bank further submits that full details of CPC’s two trades with Peoples’ Bank
were sent directly to the Central Bank on 18 August and 10 October 2008'!°. The trades
included, like the Hedging Agreement, Seagull and TPF features and an additional feature:
the use of leverage on the downside. According to Claimant, there is no evidence of any
objection by the Central Bank.

3) Sri Lanka took public credit and financial benefits from the
Hedging Agreements

Deutsche Bank submits that despite this knowledge of CPC’s hedging program, the Sri
Lankan authorities raised no complaints at the time that such agreements might be ultra
vires and invalid. To the contrary, they took the credit but also the financial benefits from
such agreement throughout 2007 and much of 2008, during which time CPC received
payments of tens of millions of dollars from the Bank, including the USD 21.9 million for
January-September 2008 alone nT

According to Claimant, Governor Cabraal was keen to assert the Central Bank’s
“instrumental” role in the hedging program''® and to comment on CPC’s Hedging
Agreement in press!!”, The Assistant Governor of the Central Bank, Dr. Thenuwara, took
centre stage at the first press conference'”’. The Central Bank continued to report on the
success of hedging in its Annual Reports!”

Claimant submits that Minister Fowzie was happy to take credit for the success of the
program. For example, at a press conference on 20 April 2007, he was photographed
receiving a mock check for USD 300,000 from SCB '22 He was also frequently qyored in
the press in relation to the hedging program and its benefits to CPC and Sri Lanka!

Claimant further recalls that at another press conference on 30 May 2008, SCB presented
another mock check to CPC for USD 2.8 million’ and Minister Fowzie declared at this
occasion that hedging “has helped the country face the challenge of balancing fuel prices
amidst sky-rocketing rates in the world’s markets”!

According to Claimant, the Government was also keen to promote its role in the success of
the hedging program. In a presentation to investors in October 2008, CPC’s hedging gains
of Rs. 1.9 billion in the first half of 2008 were referred to under the heading “Government
taking pro-active approach to increasing the flexibility of the expenditure base”'°,

4) Sri Lanka intervened only when payments by CPC were
required
Deutsche Bank submits that it is only after the sudden fall in world oil prices in September
2008 that the Sri Lankan attitude changed abruptly. Mr. de Mel admitted this during the
hearing'?’ and Minister Fowzie also stated to Parliament on 3 December 2008 that “[hJad
the price increase gone up to US Dollars 200 as predicted by dealers [the] world over,
nobody would have complained’ 7128

Deutsche Bank further submits that at the time, none of the relevant actors considered that
there had been any wrongdoing by CPC or the banks. Claimant recalls that at the 20 and 24
November 2008 meetings, the CPC Board noted that the program was conducted in
accordance with the instructions of the Cabinet and that the Central Bank had approved
payments under the agreements'”. According to Claimant, Minister Fowzie also insisted
that the program had been carried out as originally intended, “on the advice of the
Governor of the Central Bank and the approval of the Cabinet”. He added that the losses
resulted from “totally unforeseeable events” and cautioned Parliament not to be “misled by
the mountain of prejudice built around this sue”'*°. Claimant submits further that Mr. de
Mel and Mr. Karunaratne as well as Minister Fowzie have also confirmed in their
SupremeCourt affidavits in 2009 that there had not been wrongdoing in relation to the
hedging program'*!,

  

(B) Sri Lanka may not deny the validity of the Hedging Agreement as
a matter of international law

On the basis of the above, Deutsche Bank alleges that there are three separate reasons why
Sri Lanka may not rely on the alleged invalidity of the Hedging Agreement as a matter of
international law:

First, the alleged illegality is attributable to CPC which, on Sri Lanka’s case, acted
beyond its capacity, and is not attributable to Deutsche Bank;

- Second, CPC is a State entity and Sri Lanka may not rely on the alleged illegality of the
acts of a State entity under its own national law, particularly so when the facts giving
rise to the alleged illegality were well-known to the State;

Finally, in light of a) Sri Lanka’s direction and knowledge of the hedging program
including the terms of the Hedging Agreement; b) the benefits Sri Lanka derived from
such agreements including the latter; and c) the representations made to Deutsche Bank
by CPC and the Central Bank, Sri Lanka is estopped from denying the validity of the
Hedging Agreement.

1) The alleged illegality is attributable to CPC and not to
Deutsche Bank

According to Deutsche Bank, a distinction has to be made between alleged unlawfulness of
the investment for which the investor is responsible and that which is attributable to
another entity. According to Claimant, in this case, the alleged invalidity was the
responsibility of CPC. Sri Lanka may not therefore invoke this alleged invalidity. Deutsche
Bank relies for its analysis on Inmaris v. Ukraine '32 and on Abaclat v. Argentina’,

2) Sri Lanka may not rely on a breach of domestic law by it is
own State entity

Secondly, Deutsche Bank submits that Sri Lanka is a State entity and may not therefore
tely on the alleged illegality of the acts of CPC under its national law, particularly so when
the facts giving rise to the alleged illegality were well-known to the State. For this
proposition, Claimant relies on Kardassopoulos v. Georgia in which the Tribunal decided
that Georgia was not permitted to assert that its State-owned enterprises violated Georgian
law by exceeding their authority and that therefore the investment was entitled to
protection under the BIT regardless of whether it was void as a matter of Georgian law;
as well as on Metalclad v. Mexico'** and Inmaris v. Ukraine!”

3) Sri Lanka is estopped from denying the validity of the
Hedging Agreement

According to Deutsche Bank, Sri Lanka is estopped from denying the validity of the
Hedging Agreement given its active involvement and knowledge of the hedging program
and its decision to terminate only when payments by CPC were required and given
Deutsche Bank’s reliance on Sri Lanka’s promotion and knowledge in concluding the
Hedging Agreement. Deutsche Bank relies for this conclusion on Kardassopoulos v.
Georgia 137 “Southern Pacific Properties v. Egypt'** and Inmaris v. Ukraine!®’.

Deutsche Bank also founds its estoppel’s argument on Article 4(v) of the Term Sheet and
the Confirmation Letter in which CPC expressly represented to Claimant that the purpose
of the Agreement was to hedge its liabilities and not speculation and that the Hedging
Agreement complied with all applicable law and regulations.

I. Is the Hedging Agreement void because it was outside CPC’s statutory
authority?

According to Deutsche Bank, the proper enquiry is whether CPC had capacity to enter into
the Hedging Agreement in accordance with its objects and powers under the CPC Act. It

was both incidental and conducive to CPC’s business. And even if the hedging/speculation
distinction is relevant, the Hedging Agreement was a hedge and therefore fully valid.

(A) The Hedging Agreement was both “incidental” and “conducive”
to CPC’s business

The parties agree that CPC’s capacity is a matter of Sri Lankan law!*®,

Deutsche Bank submits that CPC’s objects are broadly defined by Section 5(c) of the CPC
Act to include “any such other business as may be incidental or conducive” to the carrying
on of CPC’s business as “an importer, exporter, seller, supplier or distributor of
petroleum”.

On the other hand, Section 6(1) entitles the CPC Board to determine which transactions are
so conducive to CPC’s business. It enables CPC “to enter into any agreements with any
bank ... that may seem to the Board to be conducive for the purposes of the corporation”.

Deutsche Bank submits in this respect that contrary to Sri Lanka’s position, Sections 5 and
6 of the CPC Act are very closely linked because the powers of a corporation are
intimately bound up with its objects. It quotes Anthony Amerasinghe’s statement that an
act will be conducive to CPC’s business: “... if the Directors honestly formed the view that
it can be advantageously combined with other objects, even though the Directors are
mistaken and in fact the business in question cannot be carried on as the Directors
believe”'“', For Deutsche Bank, it is not correct to say that the Act must be objectively
conducive to CPC’s business. Claimant submits that Section 6 refers to the power of the
Board to enter into agreements with any bank that may seem to the Board to be conducive
for the purposes of the corporation.

Deutsche Bank also relies on Bell Houses Ltd. v. City Wall Properties Ltd.'? where the
Directors were granted the power to determine what it is advantageous to the company.
The Court held that

“[p]rovided they form their view honestly, the business is with the plaintiff company’s
objects and powers... It may be that the directors take the wrong view and in fact the
business in question cannot be carried on as the directors believe. But it matters not how
mistaken the directors may be’.

In the same vein, in Den Norske Creditbank v. The Sarawak Economic Development
Corporation", the Court considered that a guarantee provided by respondent to claimant

was within the statutory powers of the corporation, that the latter had capacity to enter into
the guarantee so long as it considered it incidental or conducive to its objects.

Claimant further submits that it does not mean that the directors have the power to do
anything they choose such as gambling on horses or orange juice futures. Rather, in
Claimant’s view, the directors have the right to decide whether in their good faith opinion
an act may be capable of hedging its liabilities or reducing a risk it faces and as such be
incidental or conducive to CPC’s oil business. Whether it was so in fact is immaterial.

According to Claimant, the evidence reveals that the CPC Board did believe that the
Hedging Agreement was capable of being conducive to CPC oil business as an oil
importer. As a result CPC was capable of entering into hedging agreements such as the
Hedging Agreement and delegated authority to Mr. de Mel and Mr. Karunaratne to do
so! The Hedging Agreement was entered into pursuant to and within the scope of the
Board authority‘. Therefore, in Claimant’s view, CPC was not acting beyond its capacity
when entering into the Agreement.

Deutsche Bank submits that it is common ground that it was within CPC’s capacity to
enter into derivative transactions for the purposes of hedging'*. Sri Lanka has also
accepted on numerous occasions that the Hedging Agreement reduced volatility of oil
prices to some extent!*”, According to Claimant, there can therefore be no doubt that the
Hedging Agreement hedged CPC’s exposure to volatility and reduced its risk. It was in
Claimant’s view reasonable for the Board of CPC to conclude that the Hedging Agreement
was capable of falling within CPC’s objects and for that reason it cannot be deemed ultra
vires.

Deutsche Bank finally objects to Sri Lanka’s allegation that the Hedging Agreement was
ultra vires as it was not “necessary” to the attainment of CPC’s objects!“ . Claimant points
out that it is only under Section 6(q) where the “necessary” requirement appears. Under
Section 6(1), the necessary requirement is not present, the directors must only believe that
an action is capable of being conducive to CPC’s business. According to Claimant, the test
is subjective and not objective.

(B) The Hedging Agreement was a real hedge and did not amount to
speculation

Deutsche Bank submits that the issue of CPC’s capacity to enter into the Hedging
Agreement has been raised as a positive defense by Sri Lanka to avoid the implications of
the validity of the Hedging Agreement. Claimant argues that Sri Lanka has therefore the
burden of proving that by entering into the Agreement, CPC was acting ultra vires.

As noted above, Sri Lanka’s primary position is that the hedging/speculation distinction is
irrelevant. However, Sri Lanka contends that even if it were relevant, the Hedging
Agreement was not a hedge. Deutsche Bank disagrees with this conclusion.

Claimant submits that it is common ground that hedging is about managing risk where the
hedger has an underlying position and seeks to reduce the risk or uncertainty of that
position'”, As an oil importer, it is also common ground that CPC had an underlying
exposure to which the Hedging Agreement related'*°,

According to Deutsche Bank, a transaction either reduces risk and uncertainty or it does
not. The extent to which a hedger may be able to reduce risk through hedging depends on
the position of the market at the time and the resources it has available. Claimant submits
Sri Lanka, however, seeks to impute a further condition that a reduction in risk does not
prevent a transaction from being speculative unless it is “meaningful”. In Claimant’s view,
Respondent’s expert Mr. Benigni was unable in cross-examination to offer any explanation
for this proposition'*!. Claimant argues that the definition of a Hedging Agreement in
International Accounting Standards No. 39 does not contain a de minimis or effectiveness
test as Mr. Benigni sought to infer. Moreover, as the expert accepted, the imposition of a
meaningful test would result in the classification of a transaction being dependent on the
financial position of the hedger'”?, ‘What would be a hedge one day could be speculation
the next, a position which would in Claimant’s view create substantial uncertainty and
would be unworkable in practice.

Deutsche Bank submits that when the Hedging Agreement was concluded, oil prices were
already more than USD 57 above the USD 80 per barrel described by the Study Group as
unbearable'*’. The risks CPC faced were sustained high prices and the volatility of
expenditure for oil. This was underlined by the Study Group report. Claimant points out
that CPC faced a huge oil bill irrespective of whether prices remained high or increased,

putting pressure on Sri Lanka’s foreign exchange reserves and the exchange rate!™*,

Claimant argues that the protection provided by the Hedging Agreement must be assessed
on the date it was entered into and not in light of subsequent price movements!*>. Further,
Claimant submits that the transaction must be considered as a whole. To do otherwise
would preclude any transaction from being a hedge, as there will always be a downside
obligation which, when viewed in isolation, will increase risks !°, According to Claimant,
the reality is that the Hedging Agreement reduced CPC’s exposure to volatility in oil
prices'*” and this was recognized by Mr. Benigni!**. Claimant concludes that a transaction
which reduces the risks associated with volatility to an existing underlying exposure
constitutes a hedge.

The Hedging Agreement provided protection against both sustained high prices and rising
prices, giving a USD 10 per barrel protection to CPC on oil prices above USD 122.50 per
barrel and up to USD 10 per barrel between USD 112.5 and USD 122.5. Claimant argues
that it is not correct that the Agreement gave no protection against rising prices. As the
English High Court in SCB v. CPC held, the correct comparison is with the situation had
the Hedging Agreement not been concluded’. If oil prices had risen to USD 180, CPC
would have paid USD 170 with the Hedging Agreement; without the Hedging Agreement,
it would have paid in full. According to Claimant, the Hedging Agreement was therefore
clearly hedging and not speculation.

In relation to the English Court of Appeal decision in SCB v CPC, issued in July 2012, in
which the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court decision of Hamblen J., Claimant notes
that the Court of Appeal found it unnecessary to determine whether the transactions at
issue were speculation or hedging as it regardless fell within CPC’s capacity as set out in
Sections 5 and 6 of the CPC Act. Claimant submits that this is the proper enquiry, but in
any case the Hedging Agreement was not speculative, as demonstrated by the evidence
presented by the Claimant during the arbitration.

SECTION II. RESPONDENT’S POSITION

Sri Lanka considers that the Hedging Agreement was not valid and therefore develops its
arguments on jurisdiction only for the case where the Arbitral Tribunal would find the
transaction valid.

Deutsche Bank submits that the acts of CPC in entering into the Hedging Agreement are
attributable to Sri Lanka. This is disputed by Respondent. It submits that the Arbitral

Tribunal does not have jurisdiction under the BIT and under Article 25(1) of the ICSID
Convention.

Sub-SectionI. The Treaty

L Investment under Article 1(1) of the Treaty
Sri Lanka submits that Article 1(1) of the BIT defines “investment” as follows:

“The term “investments” comprises every kind of asset, in particular: ...
c) claims to money which has been used to create an economic value or claims to
any performance having an economic value and associated with an investment ...”.

According to Respondent, it is therefore not enough to have a claim to money, that claim
must have been “used to create an economic value” or must have derived from
“performance having an economic value’, and it must be “associated with an investment’.
Respondent argues that by clear inference, claims to money under a contract are not, as
such, investments under the BIT. In this case, the Hedging Agreement was not part of a
larger aggregate of activities constituting an “investment”. It was a stand-alone financial
product.

Sri Lanka also relies on the dissent of Professor Abi-Saab in the recent Abaclat decision'
supporting the position taken by Sri Lanka that the Hedging Agreement does not constitute
an investment for the purposes of either the BIT or the ICSID Convention.

IL. Territorial nexus with Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka points out that the Preamble to the Germany-Sri Lanka BIT expresses the State
parties’ intention “to create fe ble conditi for in by ionals and
companies of either State in the territory of the other State...”. According to Respondent,
the territorial link is further established in the main substantive protections of the Treaty,
ie., in its Articles 2(1) and (2), 3(1) and (2), 4(1), (2), (3) and (4), 8(2) and 9.

According to Sri Lanka, the territorial nexus requirement is either a predicate to
jurisdiction or conditions the scope of application of the various substantive requirements
of the BIT. Respondent considers that the better approach is that such a requirement is
jurisdictional. Whichever approach is correct, the Tribunal is required to decide the issue
whether the Hedging Agreement constitutes an investment “within the territory” to find
that it has jurisdiction over the present dispute and as a precondition to any consideration
of the merits.

According to Respondent, the Agreement was explicitly entered into by Deutsche Bank
London and all those involved proceeded on the basis at all times. Respondent argues that
the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has no regulatory authority over Deutsche Bank London. Its

investigation was limited to Deutsche Bank Colombo’s intermediary role and did not
purport to investigate the conduct of Deutsche Bank London.

Respondent submits that since the Central Bank did not and cannot regulate the seller of
the product, Deutsche Bank London, it cannot be the case that financial products
emanating from Deutsche Bank London are located “within the territory” of Sri Lanka for
the purposes of the BIT. The purpose of the BIT was not to provide a method of
enforcement for transnational debt claims but to protect foreign investment, i.e., inward
investment, from regulatory abuse. A commercial transaction with a foreign entity, falling
outside the regulatory jurisdiction of the host State, is not covered by the BIT in
Respondent’s view.

Sri Lanka further points out that Deutsche Bank Colombo was not the counterparty to the
Hedging Agreement. Deutsche Bank Colombo did not provide the financial product in
question. As recognised by Claimant, the Colombo Branch “does not directly engage in
commodities derivative trades such as oil hedging transactions” tol Respondent recalls that
the payments made by CPC to Deutsche Bank were remitted to Deutsche Bank London
and not Deutsche Bank Colombo'®. Deutsche Bank Colombo did not receive any
commission'®, did not assume any risk in relation to the Hedging Agreement!“ and did
not have any budget for expenditure on either hedging in general or for intermediary role
that Deutsche Bank Colombo had undertaken to play!° .

Respondent argues that the claimed USD 60 million is owed to Deutsche Bank London not
Deutsche Bank Colombo! and when a dispute arose over whether CPC should continue
to pay out moneys to Deutsche Bank, it was again the Deutsche Bank office in London
which was the focus of activity. Respondent submits that nearly every material
communication from Deutsche Bank on the subject of the dispute came from London,
Singapore, or Hong Kong, not from the branch office in Colombo.

Sri Lanka further points out that the Hedging Agreement itself was evidenced by:

- the Term Sheet coming from Deutsche Bank London. It designated “Deutsche Bank
AG, London” as “Party A”. Business days for the instrument were designated as those
recognised in “London, New York”; and

- the Confirmation Letter coming from Deutsche Bank London. It, too, identified
Deutsche Bank London as “Party A”. The letter was signed by two officers of the

Deutsche Bank Structured Product Department, based in London, it identified the
governing law as English law.

Respondent also submits that it was not a requirement that CPC enter into hedging
contracts with local banks, as evidenced by the following:

a) In contrast to the suggestion at the First Study Group Meeting that “international
banks that have local presence be invited to submit indicative proposals and
suggestions for oil hedging”'*’, the Study Group report and the Cabinet Decision
approving it! recommended only that CPC enter into transactions with “reputed
banks”; and

CPC entered into the Hedging Agreement with Deutsche Bank London and could
have made payments to Deutsche Bank London through any mechanism; there was
no requirement to use a local branch’.

b

In conclusion, it is Respondent’s position that even if the marketing of the Hedging
Agreement involved the Colombo office, that did not turn into local “investments” the
marketed products. London was the locus of the Agreement and Deutsche Bank handled it
throughout from London. The benefits Deutsche Bank suggests “accrued in Sri Lanka!”
do not serve to locate the Hedging Agreement in Sri Lanka.

Sub-Section II. Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention

To determine whether the Hedging Agreement constitutes an investment pursuant to
Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, Sri Lanka relies on the Salini!”’ indicia and
concludes that they are not fulfilled in the present case.

L Contribution

According to Respondent, Deutsche Bank made no contribution constituting an
investment. As of 8 July 2008, no contribution had been made by Deutsche Bank. On 8
July 2008, CPC and Deutsche Bank London agreed to pay one another an amount of
money to be determined depending on the average price of oil, calculated over a month.
Each party bore an opposing risk, contingent on price movements in a foreign market. On
the terms of the Hedging Agreement, there was no contribution except in circumstances in
which the risk faced by Deutsche Bank London materialized. On the other hand, if the
tisks faced by CPC were to arise, there would be no contribution of any kind by Deutsche
Bank London.

According to Respondent, the Hedging Agreement is to be contrasted to a Government
bond (as in Abaclat). When a Government bond is issued, a contribution is paid upfront; an
amount on which the investor expects to generate a return. The Government counterparty
can then use the funds raised by the issue of the bonds to finance its governmental needs.
The same applies for promissory notes of the type at issue in Fedax'"”. On the other hand,
the Hedging Agreement results in either contribution or a return. It does not generate one
from the other.

According to Respondent, the Tribunal should reject each of the ways that Deutsche Bank
contends that it made a contribution.

In the first place, Sri Lanka disputes Claimant’s allegation that the Hedging Agreement
provided oil to CPC or access to oil at substantially below spot market rate. Respondent
argues that the Hedging Agreement did not provide oil or reduced the purchasing price of
oil. It was not for the sale or supply of oil. The transaction was simply a paper instrument,
based on the market price of oil, requiring either CPC or Deutsche Bank to pay the other
an amount of money each month, to be determined by reference to the price of oil.

In the second place, Respondent submits that it is incorrect to say that the Agreement
offered to CPC “cash flow benefits”. Respondent points out that any contribution was
contingent on the price of oil remaining above USD 112.50 and there was therefore no
guarantee that Deutsche Bank would in fact have to make any contribution.

Third, Respondent also disputes that the Hedging Agreement reduced CPC’s exposure to
volatile prices. For 100,000 barrels, CPC could have hoped for nothing more than USD 10
per barrel payment, whether the price of oil dropped to USD 122.50 or increased to USD
200, and this was further limited by the target accrual of USD 2.5 million. It was only in
the narrow band between USD 112.50 and USD 122.50 that there was any reduction of
volatility of benefit to CPC.

Fourth, Respondent objects to Claimant’s allegation that the Agreement provided in effect
a credit line. It considers that its contingent nature bears no relation to a line of credit. The
fact that one is exposed to credit risk does not necessarily means that one is extending
credit.

IL. Duration

According to Respondent, the Hedging Agreement was of short duration, pegged to
monthly events and unilaterally terminable by Deutsche Bank London and as such is not of
the requisite certain duration that is normally to be expected of an investment.

Respondent argues that the Agreement might have lasted twelve months at most. However,
had the price of oil remained above USD 122.50, the contract would have lasted three
months before the Target Profit accrued and the Agreement would have terminated in

'® Fedax N.V. v. Venezuela - Award, supra note 86.

48

240.

241.

242.

243.

244.

accordance with its terms and CPC would receive no further payments. In the end,
Respondent recalls that the Hedging Agreement in fact lasted for only 125 days before it
was unilaterally terminated by Deutsche Bank London.

Il. Risk

Respondent argues that risk, in the ordinary investment sense, is the risk of failure by an
investor to make a return on its contribution. It is a risk that the venture might not be
profitable or that it might cost more than originally anticipated. According to Respondent,
tisks of this type, with a correlation between contribution and return, were not present in
the Hedging Agreement. On the one hand, Deutsche Bank London faced a risk that they
would have pay USD 2.5 million. On the other, CPC faced a risk that they would have to
pay Deutsche Bank London a virtually unlimited amount.

The only identifiable risk was in Respondent’s view that of default or non-payment by
CPC should the oil price drop. That is a risk faced by any contracting party. It is not an
investment risk.

IV. Contribution to economic development

According to Respondent, it is insufficient that hedging might be generally in the national
interest to constitute contribution to economic development. Sri Lanka was extraneous to
the performance of the Hedging Agreement and the single contract in no way contributed
to the growth of economic prosperity in Sri Lanka. It was merely a private, neutral and
speculative transaction. In any case, Respondent argues that the fact that a transaction is
“seen to further the policy priorities of the purchasing State does not bring about a
qualitative change in the economic benefit that all legitimate trade brings in its train".

V. Ordinary commercial transaction

It is also Respondent’s position that the Hedging Agreement was an ordinary commercial
transaction which does not constitute an investment for the purposes of the ICSID
Convention.

Respondent submits that it was a sale, even if the product was intangible. It was made up
of a bundle of “put” and “call” options. CPC sold one and bought the other. It is irrelevant
that CPC did not in fact make any payment upfront in order to buy its call option. The
structure of the particular transaction was such that the price paid for the call option was
the granting of the put options to Deutsche Bank.

VI. Purely contingent financial instrument

According to Respondent, the value of the hedging products sold by Deutsche Bank was
entirely contingent. It was a derivative financial structure, consisting of selected options on
the price of oil, the value of which (or the costs of which) to CPC was wholly speculative,
depending upon the future price of that underlying commodity as determined by the world
market and limited by further contractual terms. It had no association to any underlying
asset which might have been characterized as an investment. Respondent submits that
contingent future value does not constitute an “investment”.

In conclusion of the above, Respondent submits that the Hedging Agreement did not
display the characteristics of an investment for the purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention.

Sub-Section III. Is the Hedging Agreement valid? Did CPC have the capacity to
enter into it?

L Is Sri Lanka entitled to dispute the validity of the Hedging Agreement?

Sri Lanka submits that if an agreement is void, for lack of capacity, it cannot be estopped
from arguing its invalidity.

In the first place, Sri Lanka considers as misconceived Deutsche Bank’s allegation that Sri
Lanka may not rely on a breach of its national law to defeat its international obligations,
invoking Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. In this regard,
Respondent argues that Article 27 is concerned with the failure to perform an international
obligation. The international obligations at issue in the present dispute arise under the BIT.
They only apply to a valid investment. In respect of Article 8(2) (containing the Umbrella
Clause), the BIT requires that States observe the obligations they have assumed; this in
Respondent’s view likewise requires that the obligations in question exist, and therefore
that the Hedging Agreement is valid.

As such, Sri Lanka does not rely on its domestic law to avoid performance of its
international obligations. The question is the preliminary one of whether there is anything
on which those international obligations can operate.

Secondly, Sri Lanka disagrees that it would be estopped as a matter of international law
from relying on CPC’s incapacity to conclude the Hedging Agreement. Deutsche Bank
relies principally for its argument as to estoppel on the representations made by Mr. de Mel
and Mr. Karunaratne in signing the Term Sheet and Confirmation. To succeed, Deutsche
Bank would have to establish that the acts of Mr. de Mel and Mr. Karunaratne in signing
the contractual documentation were attributable to Sri Lanka. However, Respondent
submits that Deutsche Bank is unable to substantiate that proposition for several reasons.

Respondent further submits that neither CPC nor Mr. de Mel and Mr. Karunaratne were
organs of Sri Lanka. They were not exercising elements of governmental authority in

50

252.

253.

254.

255.

256.

signing the relevant contractual documentation and finally, they were not acting on
instructions or under the specific and close direction and control of any organ of Sri Lanka
in carrying out those specific acts of the type necessary for attribution on that basis as a
matter of international law.

Sri Lanka submits that in that regard, the evidence of Mr. de Mel was that:

a) he had not informed the Central Bank and he did not recall having informed the
Minister that he was contemplating entering into the Hedging Agreement with
Deutsche Bank London M4,

b) he had not informed the Central Bank or the Minister of the detailed terms of the
Agreement prior to concluding it'”; and

c) he had not received any instructions from either the Minister or the Central Bank to
enter into the Hedging Agreement!”®,

The acts of Mr. de Mel and Mr. Karunaratne are not attributable to Sri Lanka for the
purposes of international law. No estoppel can therefore arise on that basis.

Respondent further argues that as far as the actions of the Cabinet and the Central Bank are
concerned, their announcements were made to the world at large, well in advance of the
conclusion of the Agreement and were expressly premised on the basis that CPC was
required to engage in hedging and not speculation. Respondent recalls that neither the
Cabinet nor the Central Bank made any representation that the Hedging Agreement,
containing these terms, was within CPC capacity and there is no evidence that anyone from
Deutsche Bank believed that they had made any representation.

According to Respondent, given that no specific instructions were given to CPC to enter
into the Agreement and CPC was clearly not acting under the direction and control of Sri
Lanka in doing so, it cannot be contended that Sri Lanka is estopped from raising the
question of CPC’s capacity to do so. Moreover, Deutsche Bank cannot sensibly suggest
that it relied on any representation by CPC. Deutsche Bank were the experts on hedging,
not CPC, and any representation by CPC on this point would be inherently unreliable.

Finally, Sri Lanka submits that Deutsche Bank’s argument of contractual estoppel based on
Article 4(v) of the Term Sheet and the Confirmation Letter is hopeless as a matter of
English law for the reason that, just as it is not possible for an agent to clothe himself with
an authority he does not have, so a corporation cannot create capacity where none exists,
simply by making an untrue assertion that it has capacity. In Respondent’s view, if the
Hedging Agreement was void as outside capacity, it was void for all purposes and cannot
serve as the basis for a contractual estoppel.

262.

Finally, Sri Lanka objects to Deutsche Bank’s suggestion that a defense can be disregarded
if the defence is considered to be one upon which it is unconscionable to rely. If a contract
is ultra vires, it is void ab initio and unenforceable. There is no exception for cases where
the position adopted by the defendant is considered to be unconscionable.

I. Is the Hedging Agreement void because outside CPC statutory authority?

(A) Was the Hedging Agreement “incidental” or “conducive” to
CPC’s business?

In the first place, Sri Lanka alleges that contrary to the position taken by Deutsche Bank,
the burden of proof in relation to capacity is on Deutsche Bank and that any doubt as to
whether the Hedging Agreement was within CPC’s capacity is to be resolved in favour of
Sri Lanka.

With respect to the test set out in Section 5 of the CPC Act, Sri Lanka accepts that it was
within CPC’s capacity to enter into derivative transactions for the purpose of risk
management. However, it contends that the Hedging Agreement was not a transaction
which managed CPC’s risks but amounted to speculation. Such a transaction cannot be
conducive or incidental to CPC’s business as an oil importer. Indeed, speculative
derivative transactions are far removed from CPC’s petroleum business. They are not
necessary for the attainment of its objects.

Respondent points out that CPC’s “objects” are set out in Section 5 of the CPC Act.
Section 6(1) was one of a number of powers expressly confirmed on CPC and gave CPC
power to “enter into any agreements with any bank... in order to obtain any rights ... that
may seem to the Board to be conducive for the purpose of the Corporation”. Deutsche
Bank has also relied on Section 6(q) which gave CPC power “to do all other things which,
in the opinion of the Corporation, are necessary to facilitate the proper carrying on of its
business”.

According to Sri Lanka, Sections 6(1) and 6(q) of the CPC Act are not expressed to be
“objects” of CPC. They are ancillary powers which may be exercised in order to pursue the
“objects” set out in Section 5. In Respondent’s view, ancillary powers tell you what
activities a company may carry out in order to pursue the company’s objects but it is not
sufficient that a transaction falls within an ancillary power.

The words at the end of Section 6(1) of the CPC Act “in order to obtain any rights ... that
may seem to the Board to be conducive for the purposes of the Corporation” do not widen
the “objects” of CPC, but set out an additional requirement which must be satisfied. As to
Section 6(q), in Respondent’s view, the word “necessary” is much stronger than
“expedient” or “desirable” and conveys that the step taken must be essential to enable CPC
to carry on its business. There is no evidence that CPC considered that the Hedging
Agreement was “necessary” or essential to facilitate the proper carrying on of CPC’s
business.

Respondent argues that the fact that CPC’s March 2007 Board’s resolution authorized Mr.
de Mel and Mr. Karunaratne to enter into hedging transactions provides no support for
Deutsche Bank’s case. The resolution was an authorisation to enter into hedging
transactions, not transactions which amounted to speculation.

Sri Lanka further considers that Deutsche Bank’s reliance for its position on Bell Houses
Ltd. v. Citywall Properties Ltd.‘ and Den Norske Creditbank v. Sarawak Economic
Development Corporation is misplaced. None of these decisions is relevant to the
present case. On the other hand, Respondent relies on the SCB judgement and particularly
its paragraphs 405 to 408. According to Sri Lanka, the judgement contains an authoritative
decision that under English law, Section 6 of the CPC Act does not confer on CPC
capacity to enter into a speculative oil derivative transaction with a bank.

Sri Lanka further submits that even if it is correct that the Study Group Report referred to
high oil prices, it referred only to two types of hedging instruments as being “the available
options” 7. the cap and the zero cost collar. It referred to the latter as having an upper
bound and a lower bound. According to Respondent, there was no mention of any type of
hedging instrument in which a) there were more than two levels, b) there was a cap on the
upside protection, c) the transaction was structured in such a way as to give an immediate
guaranteed return to CPC unless the oil price collapsed and to knock out after three
months, and d) the transaction was designed to provide cash for CPC as opposed to
protection from high prices.

Respondent recalls that recommendation | made by the Study Group was that CPC should
hedge the purchase of petroleum products. Recommendation 2 was that the hedging
instrument was to be zero cost collar. Recommendation 5 gave authority to CPC to change
the instrument based on the developments in the market. In the context of
Recommendations 1 and 2, Respondent argues that it could therefore only be understood
as meaning that CPC should be authorized to change from zero cost collar to cap based on
developments in the market. It cannot be read as giving CPC authority to enter into the
type of transaction entered into with Deutsche Bank, or to change the objective of hedging.
Further, Respondent submits that a plain vanilla zero cost collar could not have been used
to provide protection against an existing high price, as it would not be possible to structure
a plain vanilla zero cost collar to provide an immediate benefit to CPC unless the oil price
fell.

(B) Was the Hedging Agreement a transaction which managed CPC’s
risks or did it amount to speculation?

According to Sri Lanka, the following points are common ground between the parties’ two
experts, Mr. Grove and Mr. Benigni:

a

hedging is concerned with the elimination or reduction of market risk, i.e., volatile
and adverse market prices;

the primary purpose of an oil hedging program is to reduce the risks from the
volatility of crude oil or oil products;

speculation involves the creation of a new exposure to market risk or an increase in
an existing exposure to market risk; and

depending on price movements, a hedging transaction may also provide the benefit
of reducing the purchasing costs of an oil consumer or importer, but this is not the
goal of a hedging program, and a transaction will not be a hedging transaction if it
is designed to reduce purchasing costs but does not reduce volatility.

Sri Lanka submits that it was impossible for the Hedging Agreement to provide any
reduction in volatility or increase in certainty when the oil price exceeded USD 122.50. In
that scenario, the price paid by CPC would simply track the global market price with the
discount of USD 10, until the target of USD 2.5 million was reached.

According to Respondent, it is correct that there would have been a reduction in volatility
of CPC’s purchasing costs and increase in certainty when the oil price was below the strike
price of USD 112.50. This reduction in volatility arose only as a result of the sale of the
put option which was required in order to finance the purchase of the call option which
provided the expected USD 2.5 million payoff to CPC. This was of no benefit to CPC. On
the contrary, it was a detriment to CPC since it meant that CPC had to make payments to
Deutsche Bank and could not benefit from a fall in oil price for the number of barrels
covered by the Agreement.

Respondent argues that as a consequence, the only range in which it was possible for CPC
to benefit from a reduction in volatility was the range between USD 112.50 (the strike
price) and USD 122.50 (the level of the seagull). However, in Respondent’s view even
within this range, there would be a vast number of scenarios in which CPC could not in
fact experience any reduction in volatility. If, for example, the oil price fell gradually from
USD 137.50 over twelve months, CPC would have received its expected payoff of USD
2.5 million in the first three months and the Hedging Agreement would have knocked out.

According to Respondent, CPC could not benefit from a reduction in volatility unless the
oil price fell steeply to below USD 122.50, the level of the seagull, and could not benefit
any further once the target of USD 2.5 million was reached. But the prediction at that time
was that prices would remain fairly stable or increase. Such a potential increase was
CPC’s, the Central Bank’s and the Government’s concern.

Sri Lanka does not deny that a payoff of USD 2.5 million might have provided a limited
benefit to CPC. It considers however that a transaction which might provide a reduction in
the volatility of CPC’s purchasing costs if the oil price fell by over USD 15 to a price ina
relatively narrow USD 10 range could not be a transaction which managed CPC’s risk, as
confirmed by Mr. Benigni’s opinion '*°, Respondent further submits that it is appropriate in

'89 Benigni Report II, supra note 155, para. 52, and Slide 21; Transcript Day 6, p. 208, lines 8 to 14.

this respect to compare the USD 2.5 million amount with CPC’s total annual costs of
importing oil. According to Mr. Benigni'*', that total annual cost would have been USD
3,756,690,000 if the oil price had increased in line with the forward curve. In the context of
the Sri Lankan economy as a whole, USD 2.5 million could not be a significant amount.

Sri Lanka also relies on the award rendered by the arbitral tribunal in the Citibank
arbitration to the effect that a transaction which was designed to provide relief from a
prevailing high oil price by way of a discount on the market price was not an exercise in
risk management but in speculation '*?, It submits that this Tribunal should reach the same
decision for a number of reasons.

In the first place, Respondent submits that a high market price is something which has
already happened. It is not possible to enter into a hedging transaction in order to protect
against something which has already taken place. Moreover, Claimant’s expert, Mr. Grove,
also considered that a transaction will not be a hedging transaction if it is designed to
reduce purchasing costs but does not reduce volatility.

In the second place, Respondent argues that in order to structure a transaction so that it
may mitigate the consequences of an existing high price, it is necessary either to agree to
limits which eliminate or greatly reduce the protection from volatility on the upside, or
agree to greater risks on the downside (such as leverage). And in order to try to mitigate
the consequences of an existing high price with a derivative transaction, it is necessary to
pursue a short-term strategy based on trying to predict future price movements correctly. In
Respondent’s view, this is speculation. The disproportionate losses suffered if the
prediction is wrong show clearly that a transaction has been a failure. Respondent submits
that a hedging transaction on the other hand can achieve its object whether the oil price
rises or falls.

Sri Lanka also disputes Claimant’s allegation that the reasoning of the Citibank Tribunal
depended on the fact that the two transactions in dispute were leveraged. It points out to
the fact that 5 of the 16 Citibank transactions were not leveraged (Nos. 3 to 7). The
Citibank Tribunal held that all the Citibank transactions were speculative '**,

Sri Lanka submits that for a risk management transaction to be genuine hedging, the
protection it provides must be more than minimal. According to Respondent, if the
transaction is structured in such a way that it provides (i) a payoff on the upside with a
very high degree of probability if a prediction of future oil price is correct and (ii) a
measurable but literally insignificant reduction of risk, it cannot be characterized as
anything other than speculation.

281.

In Respondent’s view, this was the case here. As Mr. de Mel explained in his witness
statement'**, CPC was prepared to enter into a transaction presenting such asymmetric
risks and benefits because it believed that so long as the transaction was still in the money,
CPC would be able to exit it without having to make a payment to the bank and CPC
would only have to make a payment if the price fell very steeply in a single day. This
turned out to be a mistaken belief.

Sri Lanka considers that Claimant’s reliance on the judgment of Hamblen J. in the SCB
action cannot provide support for Deutsche Bank’s case since he approached the case on
the basis that “a hedge need not be against volatility’'®* while it is common ground that
this is not correct. Moreover, in numerous passages, the Judge referred to individual
elements of the transaction as not necessarily being indicative of speculation while it is
common ground that any consideration of the effects of the transaction requires
consideration of the totality of its features together, as opposed to considering the
individual features one by one!*®,

Respondent further submits that Hamblen J. was wrong in numerous other respects. He
failed to make the distinction between hedging and speculation, finding that it was too
difficult to distinguish the two concepts. He further ignored many of the factors relied on
by CPC to establish that the transactions were speculative on the basis that they related to
the actual or subjective state of mind of those entering into the transactions, which CPC
had accepted was not a relevant factor to take into account. The Judge also held that the
transactions provided potential benefits to CPC including foreign exchange to mitigate
exchange risk and cash flow that its business needed at the time. According to Sri Lanka, it
is obvious that if the objective of the transaction was to make money and earn foreign
exchange for CPC, then it was definitely speculative.

In August 2012, Sri Lanka provided additional submissions on the English Court of
Appeal’s decisions in the SCB case, noting that the result of the case was “surprising”. It
noted that, while the Court found it unnecessary to make a final determination as to
whether the transactions in that case were hedges or speculation, had it been required to do
so on balance it would have been inclined to the view expressed by the Citibank Tribunal
that the transactions were speculative. The Respondent also stated that it understood that
CPC would appeal the decision to the United Kingdom Supreme Court and that the
correctness or otherwise of the Court of Appeal’s decision should be tested in proceedings
to which CPC is a party — that is, in the English courts. The Tribunal in this case should
therefore delay issuing the Award until after the Supreme Court decision in the SCB case.

In conclusion, Sri Lanka sets forth that the question for the Tribunal is ultimately the
following: considering the position at the date the Hedging Agreement was entered into,
was it a) a hedging transaction by which CPC obtained protection from the risks which it
faced, or b) a transaction structured in such a way as to provide for CPC, with a high
degree of probability, a profit of USD 2.5 million by correctly predicting that the oil price
would go up, and would in any event not fall to below USD 112.50, in return for CPC
exposing itself to the risk of having to make massive payments to Deutsche Bank if the oil
price did so fall? Respondent submits that if the latter, the transaction was speculative.

SECTION III. THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS AND DECISION

In order to determine whether it has jurisdiction and whether the claims are admissible, the
Tribunal will analyze successively the three issues addressed by the parties:

- whether it has jurisdiction under Articles 1 and 11 of the BIT;

- whether it has jurisdiction under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention; and

- whether the Hedging Agreement is valid and in this respect whether CPC had the
capacity to enter into it.

Sub-SectionI. The Treaty

Article 1 of the Treaty'*” provides that the term “investments” includes “every kind of
asset” and gives a list of illustrative categories, preceded by the words “in particular’.
These categories include “c) claims to money which have been used to create an economic
value or claims to any performance having an economic value and associated with an
investment”.

The Arbitral Tribunal considers that the Hedging Agreement is an asset. It is a legal
property with an economic value for Deutsche Bank. It is a claim to money which has been
used to create an economic value.

The Arbitral Tribunal does not agree with Respondent that in order to qualify for
protection the claim to money must be associated with a separate investment. The
categories enumerated are just an illustrative list of “assets”, every kind of which is
considered to be an “investment”. Defining an investment by reference to an investment
would be a circular reasoning. The Tribunal does not see any reason to interpret Article
1(1)(c) in the restrictive way suggested by Respondent. Moreover, even if the terms “and
associated with an investment” were to receive the meaning proposed by Respondent, the
Tribunal considers that they would only apply to “claims to performance” and not to
“claims to money”.

The Arbitral Tribunal admits that the existence of a territorial nexus with Sri Lanka is a
condition of its jurisdiction.

The test to be applied to determine whether such a nexus exists in the case of a financial
investment, has been clearly expressed by the majority in the Abaclat case!**, as follows:

“374. The Tribunal finds that the determination of the place of the investment firstly
depends on the nature of such investment. With regard to an investment of a purely
financial nature, the relevant criteria cannot be the same as those applying to an
investment consisting of business operations and/or involving manpower and
property. With regard to investments of a purely financial nature, the relevant
criteria should be where and/or for the benefit of whom the funds are ultimately
used, and not the place where the funds were paid out or transferred. Thus, the
relevant question is where (sic) the invested funds ultimately made available to the
Host State and did they support the latter’s economic development”

The Abaclat Tribunal further decided that it was not necessary that an investment of a
purely financial nature be further linked to a specific economic enterprise or operation
taking place in the territory of the host State. It considered that from the moment the Italy-
Argentina BIT designated financial instruments as an express kind of investment covered
by the BIT, it would have been contrary to the BIT’s wording and aim to attach a further
condition to the protection of financial investment instruments.

Applying the above test, the majority noted that the funds generated by the bonds issuance
process had been ultimately made available to Argentina and had served to finance its
economic development. It therefore reached the conclusion that it had jurisdiction over the
claims of the bondholders. The third arbitrator dissented on the basis that at the difference
of the situations which had confronted the Tribunals in the Fedax v. Venezuela, SGS v.
Pakistan and SGS v. Philippines cases, the security entitlements in question were free-
standing and totally unhinged, that they were not linked to an underlying specific

economic project, operation or activity taking place in Argentina!®®.

It is the Arbitral Tribunal’s opinion that the territorial nexus condition is fulfilled in the
present case. The reality of today’s banking business is that major banks operate all over
the world. The fact that one particular subsidiary or branch does the paperwork does not
mean that the financial instrument is located in the country concerned. Here, the
preliminary engagement took place in Sri Lanka and it is there too that the investment had
its impact. The fact that various Deutsche Bank branches all over the world, including
Singapore, participated in the preparation and finalization of the investment, does not alter
this conclusion. Nor does the fact that the parties selected English law and English
jurisdictions in their agreement. It is a reality of modern banking that London is the
world’s first financial place. Its courts have great experience in financial transactions and

its law in that area offers great security to bankers and investors. It is the reason why,
notwithstanding the territory where the investment takes place, parties to financial
transactions often select English law and the English courts in their agreements.

In the present case, it is undisputed that the funds paid by Deutsche Bank in execution of
the Hedging Agreement were made available to Sri Lanka, were linked to an activity
taking place in Sri Lanka and served to finance its economy which is oil dependent. The
Tribunal therefore decides that the condition of a territorial nexus with Sri Lanka is
satisfied.

Sub-Section II. Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention

The Tribunal notes that the parties agree that its jurisdiction should be determined not only
on the basis of the provisions of the BIT but also by application of Article 25(1) of the
ICSID Convention. However, Claimant only accepts the existence of this “double-barrel
test” to a very limited extent, considering that it could not have been the Parties’ intention
that Article 25(1) would restrict the broad definition of “investments” adopted in Article
1(1) of the Treaty so as to frustrate the bringing of any claim.

Indeed, as the Arbitral Tribunal has noted in Biwater v. Tanzania’, it is clear from the
travaux préparatoires of the Convention that several attempts to incorporate a definition of
“investment” were made but ultimately did not succeed. Since the Convention was not
drafted with a strict, objective, definition of “investment”, it is doubtful that arbitral
tribunals sitting in individual cases should impose one such definition which would be
applicable in all cases and for all purposes!*'. There is therefore no basis for a strict
application in every case of the five criteria that were originally suggested by the Arbitral
Tribunal in Fedax v. Venezuela’” and restated (notably) in Salini v. Morocco’, namely
(i) a substantial commitment or contribution, (ii) duration; (iii) assumption of risk; (iv)
contribution to economic development; (v) regularity of profit and return, in order to
determine the Tribunal’s jurisdiction under Article 25(1). These criteria are not fixed or
mandatory as a matter of law. They do not appear in the ICSID Convention. If transactions
were to be presumed excluded from the ICSID Convention unless each of the five criteria
were satisfied, this would entail the risk of arbitrarily excluding certain types of
transactions from the scope of the Convention.

The development of ICSID case law suggests that only three of the above criteria, namely
contribution, risk and duration should be used as the benchmarks of investment, without a
separate criterion of contribution to the economic development of the host State and

299.

without reference to a regularity of profit and return'™*. It should also be recalled that the
existence of an investment must be assessed at its inception and not with hindsight.

The Arbitral Tribunal considers that the three above criteria are fulfilled in this case.

In the first place, the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that the Hedging Agreement involved
a contribution to Sri Lanka. A contribution can take any form. It is not limited to financial
terms but also includes know-how, equipment, personnel and services. In RFCC v.
Morocco’, the Tribunal found that the investor had made a “... contribution in cash, kind
and labour”'®’. And the Tribunal in Bayindir v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan'*" held that
the investor had “... made a significant contribution, both in terms of know-how,
equipment and personnel and in financial terms” °8, In L.E.S.1. S.p.A. & Astaldi S.p.A. v.
People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria’, the Tribunal also confirmed that the
contributions could “consist of loans, materials, works, services, as long as they have an
economic value. In other words, the contractor must have committed some expenditure, in
whatever form, in order to pursue an economic objective”.

The record confirms that Deutsche Bank made a substantial contribution in connection
with the Hedging Agreement. By concluding the Agreement on 8 July 2008, Deutsche
Bank immediately committed to pay USD 2.5 million if CPC’s costs of importing oil
remained above USD 112.50 per barrel. The commitment was made in the context of oil
prices that were USD 137.52 per barrel when the Agreement was concluded. The
immediate effect of the transaction was to allow CPC to purchase oil over the following
twelve months at a price substantially below both the current market price and the forward
curve. The benefit of the Hedging Agreement to CPC and Sri Lanka was also immediate. It
immediately reduced their exposure to oil price volatility and improved the predictability
of their cash-flow.

Deutsche Bank’s commitment of resources pursuant to the Hedging Agreement continued
after its conclusion. Deutsche Bank made payment of USD 35,523.81 to CPC on 19
September 2008 pursuant to the terms of the transaction.

Deutsche Bank also committed resources of substantial economic value to Sri Lanka.
Deutsche Bank’s employees engaged in over two years of regular meetings, negotiations
and correspondence with CPC and the Central Bank. Furthermore, once it became clear
that CPC would be required to make substantial payments pursuant to the Hedging
Agreement, Deutsche Bank invested substantial resources in seeking to mitigate the costs
to CPC. It organised a number of meetings between the Bank and CPC and examined
various alternative structures which might reduce the required payment.

As far as risk is concerned, the Arbitral Tribunal takes note of Professor Schreuer’s
observation that “the very existence of the dispute is an indication of risk”. Moreover, as
assessed by the Tribunal in Kardassopoulous v. Georgia, “the risk component is satisfied
in light of the political and economic climate prevailing throughout the period of the
investment”.

It cannot be seriously disputed that Deutsche Bank’s investment involved a risk. The bank
indeed faced a substantial risk that it would pay up to USD 2.5 million to CPC.

With respect to duration, the Tribunal once again agrees with Schreuer that “[duration] is a
very flexible term. It could be anything from a couple of months to many years”?”>,
Further, the Tribunal concurs with the statement made by the Tribunal in Romak SA v.
Republic of Uzbekistan™, holding that “short-term projects are not deprived of
“investment” status solely by virtue of their limited duration. Duration is to be analysed in
light of all the circumstances, and of the investor’s overall commitment”. While this
Tribunal is aware that Romak was not an ICSID case, the analysis equally applies to
proceedings under the ICSID Convention. As the ICSID Tribunal noted in MCI v.
Ecuador, the ‘duration’ characteristic is not necessarily an element that is necessarily
required for the existence of an investment, but is to be considered a mere example of a
typical characteristic. 205

The Arbitral Tribunal is persuaded that the duration criterion is satisfied in this case. The
Hedging Agreement commitment was for twelve months. Moreover, Deutsche Bank had
already spent two years negotiating the Agreement. The fact that it was terminated after
125 days is irrelevant. As pointed out by the Tribunal in L.E.S.1. S.p.A. and Astaldi S.p.A.
v. People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria, “the fact that the contract was suspended and
then terminated prematurely changes nothing; in order to judge the importance of the

contribution, it is necessary to focus on the duration that was agreed in the contract, which
determines the nature of the contribution”. In other words, it is the intended duration
period that should be considered to determine whether the criterion is satisfied.

With respect to the other Salini criteria, the Tribunal notes that most of the recent decisions
have generally refused — rightly so — to take into consideration “regularity of profit and
return”. Indeed, some investments can qualify as such although they were loss leaders.
Others may indeed be contingent on extraneous events, such as the discovery of natural
resources or, as here, the evolution of the oil price on the world market. The criterion
should rather be qualified as an expectation that the investment will be profitable. This was
undoubtedly the expectation of Deutsche Bank.

Finally, the criterion of contribution to economic development has been discredited and
has not been adopted recently by any tribunal. It is generally considered that this criterion
is unworkable owing to its subjective nature. Indeed, whether or not a commitment of
capital or resources ultimately proves to have contributed to the economic development of
the host State can often be a matter of appreciation and can generate a wide spectrum of
reasonable opinions””. Moreover, some transactions may undoubtedly be qualified as
investments, even though they do not result in a significant contribution to economic
development in a post hoc evaluation of the claimant’s activities.?°°, This is for example
the case of mergers and acquisitions or of failed construction projects””.

What is important is the commitment of the investor and not whether he positively
contributed to the economic and social development of the host State. In this respect, the
Tribunal has no doubt that the hedging program was designed and implemented in the
national interest, as was repeatedly attested to by the Sri Lankan authorities.

Finally, the Arbitral Tribunal considers, contrary to Respondent’s submission, that the
Hedging Agreement was neither an ordinary commercial transaction nor a contingent
liability.

As the Tribunal pointed out in the Pantechniki case, the same product can be an ordinary
sale of goods or an investment depending on the attending facts and circumstances of the
case: “[i]t is admittedly hard to accept that the free-on-board sale of a single tractor in
country A could be considered an “investment” in country B. But what if there are many
tractors and payments are substantially deferred to allow cash-poor buyers time to
generate income? Or what if the first tractor is a prototype developed at great expense for

the specificities of country B on the evident promise of amortisation? Why should States
not be allowed to consider such transactions as investments to be encouraged by the
promise of access to ICSID?” 210,

In other words, where a sales agreement includes special features such as a bespoke
product, it will usually be considered an investment. In the present case, the Hedging
Agreement was negotiated over a period of two years, and took into account the
recommendations made by the Cabinet Study Group. It was instigated and approved by the
highest authorities in Sri Lanka to further the national interest. It is therefore in no sense an
ordinary commercial transaction.

The Hedging Agreement also does not fall in the definition of contingent liability in IAS
37 but rather in the definition of derivatives in IAS 39. As confirmed by the IMF,
contingent assets and liabilities are contractual financial arrangements between
institutional units that do not give rise to unconditional requirements either to make
payments or to provide other objects of value. They are not recognised as financial assets
or liabilities prior to the conditions being fulfilled. On the other hand, the value of future
payments arising from equity and financial derivatives are recognised as financial assets
rather than as contingent assets. The liability exists, but the amounts payable depend on

subsequent events”"!.

Aside from its decision that the three criteria used as the benchmark of investment are

fulfilled in this case, the Tribunal further decides that the other jurisdictional requirements
set forth in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and the BIT are also fulfilled, namely:

(i) Sri Lanka is an ICSID Contracting State since 11 November 1967. Deutsche Bank AG
is a judicial person incorporated under the laws of Germany. As a national of
Germany, Deutsche Bank AG is a national of an ICSID Contracting State for purposes
of Article 25(1) of the Convention.

(ii) The parties to the present proceeding disagree about whether Sri Lanka complied with
its obligations under the BIT and the Hedging Agreement. Hence, since the Tribunal
is of the view that the Hedging Agreement qualifies as an investment for the purposes
of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, a legal dispute exists between the parties
that arises directly out of an investment.

(iii) Deutsche Bank AG and Sri Lanka have consented in writing to ICSID arbitration.
Claimant’s consent is contained in the Request for Arbitration. Claimant argues that
Respondent’s consent is contained in Article 11 of the BIT. Given that the Tribunal
also considers the Hedging Agreement an investment under the BIT, and Respondent
does not dispute that the other pre-requisites of Article 11 of the BIT are fulfilled, the
Tribunal concludes that the parties have consented in writing to ICSID jurisdiction in
accordance with Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.

Sub-Section III. Is the Hedging Agreement valid? Did CPC have the capacity to
enter into it?

The central issue with respect to the validity of the Hedging Agreement is to determine
whether the transaction was within or outside of CPC’s statutory authority. The parties
agree that this issue is a matter of Sri Lankan law.

(A) Was the Hedging Agreement “incidental” or “conducive” to
CPC’s business?

Section 5 of the CPC Act defines the objects of CPC. Section 5(c) extends these objects to
“any such other business as may be incidental or conducive” to the carrying on of CPC’s
business as “an importer, exporter, seller, supplier or distributor of petroleum”.

On the other hand, Section 6(1) of the CPC Act defines the powers of the corporation. It
entitles the CPC Board to determine which transactions are so conducive to CPC’s
business. It enables CPC “to enter into any agreements with any bank ... that may seem to
the Board to be conducive for the purposes of the corporation”.

Under Section 6, the CPC Board is empowered to determine what, in its best judgement, is
incidental and conducive to CPC’s business. Provided the Board form their view honestly,
a transaction which has been so determined to be incidental and conducive to CPC’s
business is within the company’s objects and powers, even if the directors have taken the
wrong view. The transaction will only be considered ultra vires if it can be said that no
reasonable board could have genuinely considered that the transaction was incidental and
conducive to CPC’s business.

Sri Lanka has acknowledged that CPC had the capacity to enter into a hedging transaction
but contends firstly that the Hedging Agreement was ultra vires because it did not comply
with the Study Group Recommendations and secondly, that it amounted to speculation and
therefore CPC had no capacity to enter into it and that the Agreement is consequently void.

As to the first argument, the Arbitral Tribunal notes that the Study Group
Recommendations were just that: they “recommended two types of hedging instruments:
the Cap and the Zero-Cost Collar’. Moreover, Recommendation 5 gave authority to CPC
to change the instrument based on the developments in the market.

The Tribunal interprets these Recommendations as having given CPC the broad parameters
to comply with. It then belonged to the Board of CPC to study the available instruments
and decide what was best in the interest of the company. In the present case, 18 months
had elapsed between the adoption of the Recommendations in January 2007 and the
conclusion of the Hedging Agreement in July 2008. The market had changed and the price
of oil had considerably increased. Taking into consideration Recommendation 5, it was
reasonable for CPC to adopt a form of hedging that it considered to be more in conformity
with developments in the market.

As Mr. Grove has pointed out in his first expert report:
64

321.

322.

323.

324.

325.

“in sum, the Hedging Agreement entered into by CPC and Deutsche Bank resembled a
Zero-Cost Collar and a Swap, albeit one in which CPC agreed to limit on its potential
payments in exchange for a lowering of the rate above which it would receive payments (a
benefit to CPC) and a lowering of the rate below which it would be required to make
payments (another benefit to CPC). With oil prices at historically high levels and with the
forward curve pricing oil at even higher levels in the immediately following months, it was

not illogical for CPC to agree to these limits in exchange for these benefits”?

The Arbitral Tribunal is convinced that at the time it took the decision to hedge, the CPC
Board formed the bona fide view that the Hedging Agreement was capable of falling
within the objects of the company, that it was incidental and conducive to CPC’s business.

The next question to be determined is whether the Hedging Agreement was a genuine
hedge or amounted to speculation. This issue is addressed below.

(B) Was the Hedging Agreement a transaction which managed CPC’s
risks or did it amount to speculation?

Before analyzing the issue, the Tribunal notes that the Hedging Agreement is prima facie a
valid hedging transaction. The Tribunal considers that the burden is therefore on the
Respondent — as the party asserting that the Agreement is invalid — to demonstrate that
CPC was speculating, rather than hedging, when it entered into the Agreement.” As
such, any doubt as to whether CPC had the capacity to enter into the Agreement will fall in
favor the Claimant.

The Tribunal has received extensive submissions — both written and oral — from the parties
and their respective experts on this matter. At its heart is the ability to distinguish a
genuine “hedge” from market speculation. In relation to this distinction it is important to
note that there is much that the expert witnesses for both parties agree upon. However,
before turning to this in detail, it is useful to revisit the nature of the transaction itself. As
noted in paragraph 30 above, the transaction in the present case involved CPC buying a
call option at a strike price of USD 112.50 and selling a put option at the same strike price
(which has variously been referred to as creating a “zero cost collar”, a “synthetic long
position” or a “swap”?!4), CPC also sold a call option with a strike price of USD 122.50,
effectively creating a “seagull” or a USD 10 limit on the upside of the transaction. The
transaction would terminate if the Claimant paid to CPC a total of USD 2.5 million
(effectively a ““TPF’). As the market price on 8 July 2008 was USD 137.52, the call option
was “in-the-money” as at that date.

It is noted that the parties agree that, provided the Hedging Agreement was a hedge and not
speculation, then CPC had the capacity to enter into it.” This is the case regardless of

whether the call/put options each at USD 112.50 constituted a zero cost collar, a synthetic
long position or a swap. Therefore, the Tribunal is not required to decide this point.

The above description contains a number of “jargon” terms commonly used by those
familiar with derivatives. To explain these terms more fully, the Tribunal quotes below
from the English High Court Judgment of Hamblen J in Standard Chartered Bank v
Ceylon Petroleum?!° where an explanation of these terms — in particular “zero cost collar’,
seagull, TPF (referred to below as TRF) and “in-the-money” — and how each mechanism is
structured was helpfully set out by the Judge:

“26. An alternative method is for the customer to purchase a call option, not
in consideration of a premium, but by selling a corresponding put option to
the bank, giving the bank a right to buy oil at a specified price from the
customer if the market price of oil is below the strike price of the put option. A
transaction involving the purchase of a call option by the customer in
consideration of the sale of a put option is sometimes called a Zero Cost
Collar or ZCC.

27. Under a simple ZCC, the customer, a purchaser of physical oil, buys a
call option from the bank, that is a right to buy oil if the oil price is higher
than the ‘strike price’ of the call option. The strike price of the call option is
often referred to as “the ceiling”. The customer does not pay an upfront
premium for the call option that it is buying (hence the transaction is, in this
sense, “zero-cost”), but pays for it by selling a corresponding put option to
the bank. Under the put option, the customer must pay the bank if the oil price
falls below the strike price of the put option. The strike price of the put option
is often referred to as “the floor”.

28. The effect of a simple ZCC is that:

(1) If the market price of oil is above the ceiling (i.e. above the strike price
of the call option bought by the customer), the bank is required to
make a payment to the customer.

(2) If the market price of oil is between the ceiling and the floor, neither
party is required to make a payment to the other.

(3) If the market price of oil is below the floor (i.e. below the strike price
of the put option sold by the customer), the customer is required to
make a payment to the bank.

29. The effect of a ZCC is that the customer acquires upside rights exercisable
when oil prices are high (and when its costs for physical oil are high) in

21 Core 10/355.
66

consideration for selling downside obligations exercisable by the bank when
the oil price is low (but when its costs for physical oil are low). In this way,
the customer hedges the risks arising from its physical position

30. Unlike the position where a party purchases a call option in exchange for
a premium, it is inherent in a zero-cost structure that the customer accepts an
uncertain downside risk. The consideration that the customer provides to the
bank is not the payment of a fixed sum by way of premium, but the sale of
rights that will require it to make payments to the bank if, but only if, oil
prices are low.

31. The parties may modify the precise terms of the upside rights which are
bought, and as a result the precise terms of the downside obligations which
are sold, or vice versa.

32. Thus, if, for example, the customer wishes to reduce the risk of its
downside obligations, by lowering the floor (i.e. the oil price at which it will
start making payments to the bank), one means of doing so is by reducing the
value of its upside rights that it seeks to purchase. There are a number of
ways in which it may seek to do so, including the following:

(1) It may cap the amount that the bank will have to pay per notional
barrel of oil if the oil price is above the strike price of the call option.
A ZCC which contains this additional feature is sometimes called a
“Seagull” (or “3-way”). The strike price at which the Seagull
operates is sometimes called “the cap”. The effect of a Seagull is that,
if the market price is between the ceiling and the cap, the customer
receives the difference between the ceiling and the market price. If the
market price is greater than the cap, it continues to receive payment,
but capped at the agreed maximum amount per barrel. A customer
may consider a Seagull sensible where, for example, it considers that
oil prices are unlikely to rise beyond a particular amount (the level of
the cap) or is not willing or able to pay for full protection above that
level.

(2) Another way is by capping the total amount that the bank will have to
pay in respect of the transaction as a whole when the oil price is above
the strike price of the call option. In this situation, if and when the
total amount (or “target”) is paid to the customer, the structure then
terminates or “knocks-out”, and there are no continuing obligations
either way. A ZCC that contains this additional feature is sometimes
called a “Target Redemption Forward” (or “TRF”).

33. In each such case, because the customer is buying upside rights by selling
downside obligations, a modification to its upside rights will usually require a

67

327.

328.

modification to the amount of its downside obligations (and vice versa) so that
the two packages of rights agreed by the parties continue broadly to be
matched.

35. One factor that affects the value of the upside risks concerns the
relationship at the trade date between the market price for oil and the strike
price for the call option being purchased from the bank.

(1) It is, for example, possible for a customer to obtain a strike price for
the call option that it is buying that is below the market price at the
time of the trade. Such a trade is described as being “in the money” or
“ITM”.

(2) Given that an ITM trade increases the value of the customer’s upside
rights, by lowering the price at which the bank will have to make
payment to it, it will need to pay for this, either, for example, by
capping the amount of its upside (by including, for example, a Seagull
or TRF), and/or by increasing the amount of its downside (by
including, for example, leverage).

(3) By entering into such a trade, the customer may obtain a higher
prospect of receiving a (smaller) payment from the bank, in exchange
for undertaking a lower risk of having to make a (larger) payment to
the bank...”

Having clarified the nature of the transaction at issue in this case, the Tribunal must now
determine whether this transaction was a hedge or speculation. To do this, the Tribunal
has considered in detail the evidence provided by the two expert witnesses presented by the
parties: Mr. Grove and Mr. Benigni. There are two important aspects of a “hedge” that

both Mr. Grove and Mr. Benigni agreed upon:

a) A hedge must reduce the risk of the hedger.7!” Tf a transaction increases risk or

exposure, then it is speculation.

b) The hedger must have an underlying exposure to the physical market relevant
and as a result the hedge manages (i.e., reduce the uncertainty

to the hedge,”"*

of) that underlying exposure.?!?

Returning to the circumstances of this case the first step is to consider whether the Hedging
Agreement meets these agreed qualifications. It is clear that, as an oil importer, CPC had a
physical position to protect and an underlying exposure or risk to fluctuations in the oil
price. It is this exposure that CPC sought to manage through the Hedging Agreement and

2!7 See Transcript Day 6, p. 25, line 17.

329.

330.

331.

there is no question that the amount being hedged was always less than CPC’s actual
physical exposure.””” As such, the Agreement did not increase or extend CPC’s exposure,
but is reflective of the already existing exposure.

Leaving aside the issue of whether CPC should have sought to reduce its exposure to
increasing prices or high prices more generally (this is addressed at paragraph 340 below),
the Tribunal is also satisfied that the transaction did in fact reduce CPC’s risk or exposure,
rather than increase it.

Any assessment of whether the Hedging Agreement reduced risk must be made as at the
date the transaction was entered into — 8 July 2008 — and cannot take account of the benefit
of hindsight. It is clear that, in July 2008, the forward curve was predicting that prices
would remain high. Mr. Grove demonstrated convincingly that, based on the forward
curve, the transaction resulted in a reduction of risk as the price CPC would pay for oil was
reduced if the market price remained above USD 112.50 (as it was expected to do).77!
Under cross-examination, Mr. Benigni agreed that, as at 8 July 2008, the most likely
outcome of the Hedging Agreement, based on the forward curve at the time, was that CPC
would receive a 6% contribution towards the cost of purchasing oil over the relevant 3
month period of the Agreement.” The Tribunal considers Mr. Benigni’s alternative
analysis which considered the transaction in relation to annual imports (without any
reference to CPC’s overall hedging program) unconvincing and of minimal (if any)
relevance.””* The Tribunal therefore finds that the Hedging Agreement was risk reducing.
Consequently, the two agreed criteria as set out above have been met.

The Tribunal now turns to the key areas of disagreement between the experts. Although
the experts agreed on the need for a hedging transaction to be risk reducing, they disagreed
as to the nature of the reduction required. Mr. Grove contended that a transaction is either
tisk reducing or it is not: “7 think ... you are either hedging or you are speculating, that
there is a bright line, and we can look at a transaction objectively and we can determine
objectively whether that transactions reduces risk or increases risk; and if it reduces risk,
it’s hedging, and if it increases risk it’s speculation.”?> Mr. Grove’s contention was that
this judgment should be made objectively and that subjective issues, such as the intention
of the person entering into the transaction, should not be taken into account.””°

Mr. Benigni, on the other hand, contended that something more was required to constitute
a genuine hedge — he stated in his second report that “[t]he hedging transaction has to
reduce the risk of the hedging party meaningfully”?”’ and that the Study Group’s
Recommendations “must mean that [they] required CPC to enter into a transaction which
meaningfully reduced its risk in the physical market to rising prices” (emphasis added).?”

The Tribunal is not convinced by Mr. Benigni’s addition of a “meaningfulness” or
“effectiveness” requirement. Although, Mr. Benigni referred during the oral hearing to
Article 39 of the International Accounting Standards to justify his “meaningful” (or
effectiveness) requirement,” the Tribunal can find no reference to any such test in the
Accounting Standards, nor has it been referred by the parties or the experts to any literature
or authoritative documents which endorse an effectiveness or meaningfulness test.

In addition, Mr. Benigni could give no indication as what would constitute a meaningful
risk reduction or an effective hedge and admitted that some hedges were “more effective”
than others.**° Instead, he considered that “the Tribunal will make its own view on putting
things in perspective”! and that the meaningfulness of a hedge to any given hedger would
be different depending on that hedger’s particular circumstances.” The Tribunal finds it
an extremely unattractive proposition that the difference between a hedge and speculation
should be based on such a subjective and ever-changing requirement.

It cannot be correct that whether a transaction is a hedge or speculation depends entirely
upon the subjective view of the person making the assessment. If this were so, CPC could
never be sure whether it had capacity or not to enter into what it considered to be a
“hedging” transaction. Moreover, the introduction of an effectiveness analysis could
mean, as Claimant’s Counsel pointed out during the Closing oral submissions, that a
transaction might be considered a hedge one day and speculation on some other day
because the hedger’s position had changed.” This inherent uncertainty is undesirable.

We agree with the Claimant that the introduction of a subjective effectiveness test is
unworkable. In essence, the hedger would never know if they had entered into a hedge
until a court or tribunal had proclaimed as such. Such a position is simply uncommercial.
Mr. Grove, on the other hand, stressed the objective nature of assessing the difference
between a hedge and speculation. He considered that whether a transaction was a hedge
could not depend upon the intention of the party entering into the transaction, but must be
assessed using objective economic criteria — as such, he created a simple workable solution

whereby if a transaction was risk reducing (which itself required the hedger to have an
underlying physical exposure) then it was a hedge, and if the transaction increased risk it
was speculation. The Tribunal finds this so-called “bright line” test preferable.

However, even if an effectiveness test were required, the most likely outcome of the
Hedging Agreement as at July 2008 was a 6% cost reduction for CPC over the next three
months. Such a reduction would surely meet an “effective” or “meaningful” risk reduction
test. In his first expert report, Mr. Benigni attempted to demonstrate the lack of
“meaningful” risk reduction by presenting a graph which showed the “proportionality
between the loss and gain potential under [the] structure”.?** Under cross-examination,
Mr. Benigni acknowledged that this graph dealt only with absolute numbers and did not
take any account of the probability of those numbers (and in particular of the downside
numbers) occurring.” Similarly, his graph at Figure 3 of his Second Report only reflected
“potential payments” in absolute terms, with no reference to the likelihood of those
payments occurring.”*° Given that hedging is about the reduction of risk, a graph which
does not take into account the probability of the upside occurring as opposed to the
downside is of little value to the Tribunal and certainly does not assist in demonstrating
that the Hedging Agreement did not create a meaningful reduction in risk. As such, the
Tribunal finds that Mr. Benigni’s graphs are unpersuasive.

In addition, Mr. Benigni was unable to suggest any serious alternative structures that were
realistically available to CPC at the time. The structures he suggested, which involved
hedging transactions in February 2007 or February 2008, the payment of significant
premiums or protection against only a significant rise in prices, were simply not an option
for CPC in July 2008, as Mr. Benigni largely accepted under cross examination.”*” This is
particularly so given the constraints imposed on CPC (and in particular on Mr. de Mel) by
the Government. These included the requirement that CPC enter into hedging
arrangements without delay, that it must not pay any premium for these hedges or make
any payments to banks (i.e., the floor price of any zero cost collar instrument (the only
instrument whereby no premium was paid) had to be low in order to minimize the risk of
making a payment). In addition, evidence of the need to ease the severe cashflow
problems faced by CPC is a relevant consideration in relation to these constraints. These
restraints only emphasize that an expected 6% cost reduction over three months would be
considered meaningful in CPC’s circumstances.

The Tribunal is also not convinced by Mr. Benigni’s suggestion that there is something in
the combination of factors found in the present transaction (such as the seagull, the TPF
and the fact that it was in-the-money) which leads to the conclusion that it was speculation
rather than hedging. There is no evidence to support a contention that, just because certain
legitimate hedging mechanisms are combined, the transaction loses its classification as a

hedge or somehow transforms into a speculation. Mr. Benigni acknowledged during cross-
examination that these mechanisms are used in legitimate hedges and that the combination
was, to his mind, only indicative — not determinative — of speculation.?** In the Tribunal’s
view, the probability of the upside (and conversely the downside) occurring are critical
factors that Mr. Benigni failed to take into account (as demonstrated by his graphs
discussed at paragraph 337 above). The introduction of features such as a TPF and a
seagull are not unexpected given the constraints on CPC and where the forward curve
clearly predicted that the transaction was most likely to result in payments to CPC of USD
2.5 million in the first three months of the transaction.

As mentioned briefly above, another important difference between the experts was what
each expert considered to be the purpose of the hedge, which in turn was linked to the
mandate provided to CPC by the Study Group in its Recommendations.2*° Mr. Benigni
considered that CPC should have entered into hedging transactions which protected it
against rising oil prices, as opposed to sustained high prices. He opined that, as the
Hedging Agreement was an “‘in-the-money” transaction which provided protection to CPC
when the oil price was between USD 112.50 and USD 122.50, but provided no additional
protection above USD 122.50, it did not protect against rising prices. As noted above, the
market price for oil on the date the transaction was agreed (8 July 2008) was around USD
137.

Conversely, Mr. Grove and Claimant considered that protection against sustained high
prices (not just an increase in the price) was also part of the mandate provided to CPC by
the Study Group in its Recommendations. Mr. Grove pointed out that it was not an
increase in prices that was an issue per se (for example, a price increase when prices were
low would not necessarily be of concern), but prices that were high for a sustained
period.” He also maintained that protection against the risk of continuing high prices (as
well as an increase in the price) was an appropriate reason to hedge, as an exercise in risk
management."

The Tribunal agrees with Claimant and Mr. Grove that the Recommendations themselves
clearly indicate that sustained high prices were of concern to the Sri Lankan Government
and that hedging arrangements which reduced the exposure to these high prices were
within the mandate of CPC. This is clear from the text of the Recommendations
themselves which include statements such as: “Jn view of escalation of oil prices...
hedging provides insurance cover for very high oil prices ...”; “In the case of high oil
prices the cost is very severe...”; and “the benefits of protection from high oil prices are
greater than the cost of hedging”.°” The Tribunal also accepts Mr. Grove’s evidence that

346.

the Hedging Agreement did in fact protect against a rise in prices, even though this
protection was limited. Therefore, the Tribunal considers that CPC was mandated to hedge
in order to protect both against sustained high prices and against rising prices and that the
Hedging Agreement therefore fell within this mandate.

Additionally, both experts agreed that a reduction in the risk of price volatility was also a
legitimate aim of CPC. Mr. Grove demonstrated convincingly with his graphs at figures
5.5 and 6.4 of his Expert Report that volatility was reduced by the Hedging Agreement and
Mr. Benigni acknowledged this under cross examination.* The Tribunal accepts Mr.
Grove’s evidence and finds that the Hedging Agreement did indeed reduce CPC’s
exposure to price volatility in the oil market, which was a legitimate aim of CPC’s hedging
program.

As noted above, Sri Lanka has the burden of proving that the Hedging Agreement — which
prima facie constitutes an investment — was speculation and therefore outside of CPC’s
capacity. It has failed to do so. The Tribunal finds that CPC had capacity to enter into the
Agreement which constituted a valid hedging transaction.

The Tribunal has reached this conclusion on the basis that the Respondent’s position that
CPC does not have capacity to enter into speculative transactions is correct. There is,
nonetheless, an alternative argument that the distinction between hedging and speculation
is irrelevant and that all that matters is that the Hedging Agreement was “incidental or
conducive” to CPC’s business, as required by Section 5 of the CPC Act. In other words,
both hedging and speculation may fall within the activities that are conducive or incidental
to CPC’s business, particularly if the distinction between the two is often blurred. This is
the approach taken recently by the English Court of Appeal in SCB v CPC, where the
Court decided that the transactions in question in that case clearly fell within CPC’s
capacity as they were incidental or conducive to its business, regardless of whether they
were speculation or hedging. This approach has much merit and serves as an alternative
basis on which the Tribunal could have reached the same conclusions it has come to above.

Nonetheless, as the Tribunal has decided that the Hedging Agreement constituted a hedge
rather than speculation, and as both parties clearly acknowledged that such a hedge is
within CPC’s capacity, there is no need for the Tribunal to decide definitely whether a
speculative transaction would nonetheless have fallen within CPC’s capacity, as defined in
the CPC Act.

Aside from the Court of Appeal decision mentioned briefly in the previous paragraph,
during the hearing, and in written submissions, both parties also referred to the LCIA
Award in Citibank v. Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and the English High Court judgment
of Hamblen J in Standard Chartered Bank v. Ceylon Petroleum. The Tribunal notes that,
aside from quoting relevant definitions from the High Court judgment, this Tribunal has
not placed significant reliance on those previous decisions in determining the issues before
it in the present case. The financial instruments at issue in those cases were different to the

instrument at issue here and it would be therefore dangerous to apply the conclusions
reached in those cases to the present case. Ultimately, the Tribunal considers that it has a
duty to reach its decisions based on the specific facts of this transaction and the evidence
advanced by the parties and their experts, and has therefore refrained from relying on
previous decisions.

(C) Conclusion

Respondent has not met its burden of proof, i.e., that the hedging transaction was
speculation rather than hedging. In the Tribunal’s opinion, the CPC Board honestly took
the view that the Hedging Agreement was conducive or incidental to CPC’s business. Its
decision was reasonable and within its powers under Article 6 of the CPC Act. The
Agreement is therefore valid. There is no need to further examine Claimant’s other
arguments and in particular whether Respondent is estopped from invoking the invalidity
of the transaction.

Sub-Section IV. Conclusion on Jurisdiction

The Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear Deutsche Bank’s claims. These claims are admissible.

CHAPTER VI. ATTRIBUTION

SECTION I. CLAIMANT’S POSITION

Sub-Section I. The issue of attribution for a general conduct in relation to the
hedging program

L Is Sri Lanka responsible for actions of the Cabinet, the Ministry of
Petroleum, the Central Bank and the Supreme Court?

Article 4 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on the Responsibility of States
for Internationally Wrongful Acts (the “Articles on State Responsibility” or the “ILC
Articles”) provides:

“TI. The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under
international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other
functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its
character as an organ of the central Government or a territorial unit of the State.

2. An organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the
internal law of the State”.

Claimant submits that the actions of each of the Cabinet of Ministers, Ministry of
Petroleum (including Minister Fowzie), Central Bank (including its Governor), and the
Supreme Court are attributable to Sri Lanka, given that these are organs of the State under
Article 4 of the Articles on State Responsibility.

I. Is Sri Lanka responsible for the actions of CPC? Are Articles 4(1) and (2)
of the ILC Articles satisfied on the facts? Or alternatively, Article 5 or
Article 8?

(A) — Sri Lanka’s responsibility under Article 4

According to Deutsche Bank, for an entity to be considered an organ of the State, it must
act in “complete dependence on the State of which it is ultimately merely the
instrument”™, Complete dependence can be demonstrated where the State exercises its
control to the extent that the relevant entity lacks any real autonomy”*>. According to
Claimant, this is the case here.

In this respect, Claimant recalls that CPC is a 100% State-owned entity established by
statute. It is subject to all pervading Government direction and control. The Minister of

 

oe ication of the C on the Prevention and Puni of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and
Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment of 26 February 2007, at para. 392 [hereinafter “Bosnia
and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro”.

Petroleum appoints the entire board. It has immunity for any act which in good faith is
done or purports to be done under the CPC Act. Its income and its expenditure are
Government-controlled. Its exchange dealings are subject to instructions from the Treasury
and the Central Bank. It even acts against its own interests when it is directed to do so by
the Government, for example granting discounts to the Ceylon Electricity Board and
refusing to charge any interest on the very substantial overdue amounts from the same.

Deutsche Bank objects to Sri Lanka’s allegation that ILC Article 4 does not apply to CPC
because it only relates to the central organs of government and not to other separate
entities. Claimant refers to the Commentary to ILC Article 4 that the term “organ” is to
have a very broad meaning and is not limited to the organs of the central Government but
extends to organs of Government of whatever kind of classification, exercising whatever
functions, and at whatever level.

Deutsche Bank also submits that contrary to Sri Lanka’s suggestion, nothing turns on
CPC’s separate legal personality. The term “person or entity” includes in Claimant’s view
any natural or legal person?*’,

According to Claimant, it is also incorrect to suggest, as Sri Lanka does, that commercial
entities cannot be State organs for the purposes of ILC Article 4. The Commentary plainly
states that it is irrelevant that the conduct of a State organ may be classified as
commercial”*, The key requirement relevant to ILC Article 4(1) is control of the entity by
the State. According to Deutsche Bank, this is the case here. The facts confirm that Sri
Lanka controls CPC.

Claimant further submits that ILC Article 4(2) also confirms that CPC is an organ of the
State. Where a State’s internal law positively identifies an entity to be a State organ, as it is
the case here, it is also a State organ for the purposes of Article 4 regardless of the outcome
of the ILC Article 4(1) analysis. In Claimant’s view, this is clear from the Commentary to
ILC Article 47” and the Sri Lankan case law. In Dahanayake v. De Silva, the Sri Lankan
Supreme Court confirmed that CPC is:

 

 

“a legal hybrid bred by the Government to enable it to engage in commercial business-
tailor made to suit its style of business. It is a Government creation clothed with juristic

personality so as to give it an aura of independence, but in reality it is just a business
house doing only the State’s business for and on behalf of the State”””®,

(B) Sri Lanka’s responsibility under Article 5
Article 5 of the ILC Articles provides that

“[t]he conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under Article 4 but
which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental
authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law, provided the
person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance”.

According to Deutsche Bank, Sri Lanka is also responsible for the conduct of CPC under
ILC Article 5.

On the one hand, Claimant recalls that the CPC Act empowers CPC to exercise public
functions:

- It grants CPC the exclusive right to import, export, sell, supply or distribute petrol,
kerosene, diesel oil or furnace oil, which fulfils the public purpose of allowing the
Government of Sri Lanka to control petroleum prices (CPC Act, sect. 5 B). In this
respect, Claimant points out that Sri Lanka imports over 87% of Sri Lanka’s total
crude oil and petroleum requirements. Moreover, CPC’s expenditure on oil imports
is the largest portion of Sri Lanka’s total import spending, and at times, is
equivalent to more than a quarter of Sri Lanka’s export earnings. The fact that CPC
no longer has a total monopoly is not determinative. This is merely one factor to be
considered in the aggregate with all others;

- CPC is granted powers of compulsory acquisition of property (CPC Act, Part IIT);

- CPC is directly accountable to the Minister of Petroleum and must follow the
Minister’s written directions (CPC Act, sect. 7(1)).

On the other hand, according to Deutsche Bank, “‘governmental authority” does not have a
prescriptive meaning but depends on “the way [the powers] are conferred on an entity, the
purposes for which they are to be exercised and the extent to which the entity is
accountable to Government for their exercise”>!. Claimant submits that in this case, the
power to hedge was conferred on CPC directly from the Government by the Cabinet
decision. The purposes for which the hedging powers were to be exercised were also
governmental: not to generate money for CPC but to shield the public from high and
fluctuating oil prices. Further Claimant argues that in the exercise of its hedging powers
CPC was accountable to the Government to the fullest extent possible. First, under statute

250 Dahanayake v. De Silva and others, [1978] 1 SLR 41, 10 September 1979, paras. 53-54 [hereinafter
“Dahanayake v. De Silva”).

5! Crawford, supra note 246, p. 102.
77

361.

362.

363.

364.

365.

CPC is accountable to the Minister of Petroleum in respect of all or any of its activities.
Second, the record clearly shows that the Government supervised the implementation of
the hedging program. Thus, all the facts indicate that CPC was primarily exercising
governmental authority when carrying out the hedging program.

(C) Sri Lanka’s responsibility under Article 8
Article 8 of the ILC Articles provides that

“[t]he conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of State under
international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of,
or under the direction of or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct”.

According to Claimant, even if the Tribunal does not consider CPC to be an organ of the
State for the purposes of ILC Articles 4 and 5, Sri Lanka is still responsible for the conduct
of CPC in relation to the Hedging Agreement because at all times CPC was acting on its
instructions and/or under its direction and control under ILC Article 8. As the words
“instructions”, “direction” and “control” are to be read disjunctively, it is only necessary
for Deutsche Bank to establish that one of these elements was present.

Deutsche Bank submits that the Hedging Agreement was the direct result of the State’s
instructions. Mr. de Mel testified at the hearing that the “decision to enter into hedging
arrangements based on the zero-cost collar mechanism was a decision of the Cabinet of
Ministers based on the recommendations of the Central Bank and a specially appointed
study group”.

Claimant also submits that CPC entered into the Hedging Agreement under Sri Lanka’s
direction and control. Claimant refers to the Commentary to ILC Article 8, referring to the
Phillips Petroleum Company case in which, to establish Iran’s responsibility for the
conduct of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), the Tribunal quoted with approval a
passage from Oil Field of Texas which stated that it was “clear that NIOC is one of the
instruments by which the Government of Iran conducted and currently conducts the
country’s national oil policy”, According to Claimant, CPC also meets these criteria. Its
purpose is to conduct Sri Lanka’s oil policy in the national interest”, The appointments
of the members of its board are political appointments, made by the Government”®>. In
Claimant’s view, the State is therefore responsible for the conduct of CPC.

The ILC Article 8 Commentary also indicates that a State can be responsible for acts when
“using its ownership, interest in or control of a corporation specifically in order to achieve

a particular result”, It refers to Foremost Tehran, Inc. v. Islamic Republic of Iran?” in
which the Tribunal held that “[t]he two main indicators of Government control of a
corporation are the identity of its shareholders and the composition and behavior of its
board of directors”. According to Claimant, these two factors are present here.

Moreover, Claimant argues that CPC was established so that a Government control entity
could ensure that Sri Lanka’s oil consumption was managed in the interest of the public. In
line with this purpose, the Government exercised its control of CPC to achieve a particular
result: to alleviate the burden on Sri Lanka’s foreign exchange and reduce the impact of oil
price volatility on the macro-economy and vulnerable members of society. It was a
directive from the Cabinet and the Minister that obliged CPC to start the hedging
program?’ Claimant submits that CPC did not have any choice as to whether or not to
hedge”. According to Claimant, the State is therefore responsible for acts in relation to
the negotiation and conclusion of the Hedging Agreement.

Deutsche Bank objects to Sri Lanka’s allegation that it cannot be responsible since there is
no evidence that the Government directly instructed a representative of CPC to sign the
particular Hedging Agreement. This is contrary to the Commentary to ILC Article 8 which
provides that:

“[s]uch conduct will be attributable to the State only if it directed or controlled the
specific operation and the conduct complained of was an integral part of that operation.
The principle does not extend to conduct which was only incidentally or peripherally
associated with an operation and which escaped from the State’s direction or control 7200

Claimant points out that the hedging program was the specific operation that Sri Lanka
directed CPC to engage in. It was a Government decision that was not contemplated or
desired by cPc**, According to Claimant, the only way in which CPC could carry out this
hedging program as instructed was by entering into hedging agreements, including the
Hedging Agreement. The latter was therefore an integral part of the hedging operation and
cannot sensibly be described as incidental or peripheral to it. Claimant recalls that Mr. de
Mel testified at the hearing that no specific instruction to conclude the Hedging Agreement
was required because of the Cabinet direction and the Central Bank instructed him to
hedge and also as to which banks to use”, Furthermore, Claimant submits that Sri Lanka
continued to monitor the hedging program at all times. According to Claimant, the present
situation is therefore totally different from those in the Nicaragua and Bosnian Genocide

cases where there was no evidence of either general or specific instructions from the
respondent in either case to commit massacres and where the respondents neither formally
or explicitly initiate a program to massacre Bosnian Muslims or Nicaraguan citizens or
continued to monitor and interfere with the operations.

(D) —CPC’s actions are attributable to Sri Lanka even if they were ultra
vires

Deutsche Bank submits that under ILC Article 7, a State cannot avoid responsibility for the
conduct of a State organ or an entity exercising governmental authority simply because
that entity’s “actions or omissions ought not to have occurred or ought to have taken a
different form”. As CPC was acting in its official capacity when it carried out the hedging
program, Claimant submits that Sri Lanka is responsible for CPC’s conduct under it even if
it exceeded its authority or contravened instructions. The Commentary clarifies that
conduct will be official if it is “systematic or recurrent, such that the State knew or ought
to have known of it and should have taken steps to prevent if? , Claimant argues that Sri
Lanka was kept informed of the hedging program and Minister Fowzie was specifically
informed of the conclusion of the Hedging Agreement”™, Sri Lanka is therefore
responsible for the latter.

According to Claimant, the conclusion is the same in relation to ILC Article 8. The
Commentary provides that “[wJhere a State has authorized an act ... questions can arise as
to the State’s responsibility for actions going beyond the scope of the authorization”. It
then provides that the State will not be responsible if the “unauthorized conduct was really
incidental to the mission or clearly went beyond it”, The mission authorized by Sri
Lanka was to negotiate and conclude hedging agreements. This conduct was therefore by
no means “really incidental” to the mission nor “clearly went beyond” it. Claimant
concludes that Sri Lanka is therefore responsible for the Hedging Agreement negotiated
and concluded pursuant to CPC’s mission.

Sub-Section II. The issue of attribution by application of the Umbrella Clause of the
BIT: Is the Hedging Agreement an obligation of Sri Lanka? Is it so
on the basis that the conclusion of the Hedging Agreement was a
State action, therefore attributable to Sri Lanka?

Article 8(2) of the Treaty provides that “[eJach Contracting State shall observe any other
obligation it has assumed with regard to investments in its territory by nationals or
companies of the other Contracting State” (the “Umbrella clause’).

According to Claimant, the key issue as regards the Umbrella clause is whether the
Hedging Agreement is an obligation of Sri Lanka. The first question to be addressed in this

°6 Crawford, supra note 246, p. 110.

373.

374.

375.

376.

377.

regard is whether this should be determined by reference to international law principles of
attribution or by reference to domestic law.

Deutsche Bank submits that whether a State is considered a party to the Hedging
Agreement is a question to be considered by reference to international law. Claimant
argues that the claim is brought under the Treaty, an international law instrument, based
upon the State having assumed an obligation. Deutsche Bank’s counterparty under the
Hedging Agreement was CPC. According to Claimant, the proper inquiries are therefore
whether CPC is part of the State (ILC Article 4) or whether the conclusion of the Hedging
Agreement should be considered State action (ILC Articles 5 and 8). In other words, can
you attribute to Sri Lanka the entering into of obligations by CPC in respect of the
Hedging Agreement? Deutsche Bank submits that this is a question of international law,
even if it admits that the case law is mixed on this point.

Claimant concludes that for the reasons mentioned above, CPC’s conduct in relation to
the Hedging Agreement is attributable to the State. It was part of the hedging program
which was instigated, directed, monitored, controlled and later cancelled by the State. CPC
entered into the Hedging Agreement to implement a policy dictated by Government in the
national interest and the obligations undertaken are therefore to be treated as those of the
State. If the Tribunal applies international law, Sri Lanka was a party to the Hedging
Agreement.

Deutsche Bank submits that the same result is reached even if the Tribunal applied
domestic law, i.e., English law, the law governing the Contract. Under English law,
according to Claimant, whether a State-owned entity acts as agent of the State is a factual
enquiry to be undertaken on a case by case basis. Moreover, Claimant argues that an
English court would consider Sri Lankan law to be relevant to its determination because
CPC is a Sri Lankan entity, incorporated and governed in accordance with Sri Lankan law.
This was the approach taken by the English courts in the matter of Walker International v.
République Populaire du Congo?" which held that a State-owned oil company should not
be considered as separate from the State for the purposes of enforcing a commercial debt.
The Court considered evidence of Congolese law as to the status of the State entity.

Deutsche Bank further submits that the Sri Lankan cases have been consistent and
unequivocal in equating CPC with the State and concluding that CPC enters into
agreements on behalf of the State.

Finally, in relation to the case of La Générale des Carriéres et des Mines (Gécamines ) v
F.G. Hemisphere Associates LLC [2012] UKPC 27 submitted by the Respondent in July
2012 (see paragraph 397 below), the Claimant noted that the decision was fully consistent
with its previous submissions on the law and that the Privy Council confirmed that a
separate legal entity may be considered part of the State in certain exceptional

circumstances. The Claimant argued that the facts of the present case demonstrated that
such exceptional circumstances exist and consequently that CPC’s actions should be
attributed to the Respondent.

SECTION II. RESPONDENT’S POSITION

Sub-Section I. The issue of attribution for a general conduct in relation to the
hedging program

L Is Sri Lanka responsible for actions of the Cabinet, the Ministry of
Petroleum, the Central Bank and the Supreme Court?

Claimant points out that Sri Lanka does not dispute that the Cabinet of Ministers, the
Ministry of Petroleum, the Central Bank and the Supreme Court are organs of the State
under ILC Article 4.

I. Is Sri Lanka responsible for actions of CPC? Are Articles 4(1) and (2) of
the ILC Articles satisfied on the facts? Or alternatively, ILC Article 5 or
Article 8?

(A) — Sri Lanka’s responsibility under ILC Article 4

Sri Lanka submits that CPC cannot be regarded as an “organ” of Sri Lanka for the
purposes of ILC Article 4. It is a separate entity, having separate legal personality. State
control of other of its activities, or support in particular areas does not affect that
conclusion.

Sri Lanka refers in particular to the text of ILC Article 4(2) which provides that an entity
must be considered an organ where it has that status in accordance with the internal law of
the State. Respondent submits that the definition of organs as a matter of domestic law is
generally contained in the Constitution or other high-ranking organic laws. CPC,
established as a separate entity under its governing statute, does not have that status in
Respondent’s view.

According to Respondent, Claimant relies on the Bosnian Genocide case. In answer to the
question of whether the acts of genocide were carried out by persons or entities having the
status of organs of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia under its internal law, the Court
concluded that there was nothing which could justify an alternative response?®, Its
reference to the criterion of “complete dependence on the State of which [it is] ultimately
merely the instrument’, was in relation to the separate question of whether the conduct
of persons and entities, although not having the legal status of State organs, was
nevertheless attributable on the basis that they were to be regarded as de facto organs

387.

acting on behalf of the State. According to Sri Lanka, CPC did not constitute a de facto
organ in the sense envisaged by the Court in Bosnian Genocide.

Moreover, according to Sri Lanka, Deutsche Bank’s reliance on domestic Sri Lankan cases
does not assist it. Respondent argues that the fact that an entity may be assimilated to an
organ of the State for certain limited purposes, including the application of fundamental
rights guarantees and other quasi constitutional provisions, for instance in relation to
eligibility for elections, does not render the entity an “organ” for all purposes, including for
the purposes of international law.

(B) Sri Lanka’s responsibility under ILC Article 5

Sri Lanka disputes Claimant’s allegation that in entering into the Hedging Agreement,
CPC was exercising elements of governmental authority for the purposes of ILC Article 5.
The fact that CPC embarked upon hedging as a result of the encouragement of the Central
Bank and on the basis of the Cabinet Direction does not mean that everything it did
thereafter constitutes action “in the exercise of governmental authority’. Respondent
argues that the act of entering into the Hedging Agreement can on no view be regarded as
such. It is conduct which any private individual or (subject to questions of capacity)
corporation is in theory able to perform and implicates no questions of sovereign
Government authority. Respondent points out in this respect that no question of sovereign
immunity of CPC was raised as a bar to the exercise of jurisdiction by the English
Commercial Court in SCB v. CPC.

Sri Lanka further submits that Deutsche Bank’s interpretation of the Commentary to ILC
Article 5 is erroneous. Moreover, Respondent argues that it is wrong to suggest that the
power to hedge was conferred on CPC directly from the Government by the Cabinet
decision. If CPC had capacity at all to enter into the Hedging Agreement, which is disputed
by Respondent, its capacity derived from statute and could not have been widened by a
mere decision of the Executive. Deutsche Bank does not in fact assert otherwise, in so far
as it relies solely on the terms of the CPC Act in arguing that CPC had capacity.

Finally, Sri Lanka disputes Claimant’s suggestion that attribution on the basis of Article 5
constitutes attribution of conduct of an organ. ILC Article 5 expressly applies only to
conduct of a person or entity “which is not an organ of the State under Article 4”.

(C) — Sri Lanka’s responsibility under ILC Article 8

Deutsche Bank’s argument that the conduct of CPC in entering into the Hedging
Agreement is attributable to Sri Lanka on the basis of ILC Article 8 since it was allegedly
acting on the instructions, or under the direction and control of Sri Lanka in doing so, is
equally flawed.

Respondent points to Claimant’s reliance on the fact that the very choice of instrument,
with a low floor price achieved by using the Seagull and TPF features, was chosen in order

to lower the floor price. That shows that CPC was not acting in accordance with the

83

388.

389.

390.

instructions of the Cabinet in entering into the Hedging Agreement. The approach
mandated by the Cabinet Study Group was that use should be made of a zero cost collar,
with CPC determining “the upper bound based on market developments”?”, rather than it
seeking to drive the floor price down in order to ensure that it received payment.

Respondent argues that in any case, the extent of the Directions or instructions from the
Central Bank and the Cabinet to CPC was in general terms, to enter into hedging
agreements. According to Respondent, there was no direction to enter into complex
transactions, with limited potential gains of the type constituted by the Hedging
Agreement. Further, Respondent submits that Mr. de Mel’s evidence was clear that he was
not acting under the direction or control or instructions of either the Central Bank or the
Minister in entering into the Hedging Agreement. He did not inform either of them of its
specific terms in advance. Further, he was adamant that he received no instruction to enter
into it.

Respondent further argues that in order for a specific conduct to be attributable as a matter
of international law, it has to be carried out under the “effective control” of the State, as
evidenced in the decision of the International Court of Justice in Bosnian Genocide.
Deutsche Bank’s reliance on the Commentary of ILC Article 8 and its reference to use of
ownership and control of a corporation “to achieve a particular result” is of no assistance
given the terms of the Cabinet Study Group Report and the Cabinet Direction. Similarly,
Deutsche Bank’s argument that Sri Lanka exercised control over CPC in order to achieve a
particular purpose, “to alleviate the burden on Sri Lanka’s foreign exchange” is equally
flawed. A general direction of this type is insufficient and the evidence is inconsistent with
any such specific “effective” control by Sri Lanka over CPC in it entering into any of the
transactions, including the Hedging Agreement.

Respondent also disputes Claimant’s interpretation of the Commentary to ILC Article 8
making reference to two decisions of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal and in particular, the
Phillips Petroleam Company case, as an authority for the proposition that the conduct of
Government-controlled entity is attributable to the State under ILC Article 8. The
Commentary states that the fact that the State establishes a corporate entity is not a
sufficient basis for the attribution to the State of the subsequent conduct of that entity.
Since corporate entities are considered to be separate, prima facie their conduct in carrying
out their activities is not attributable to the State unless they are exercising elements of
governmental authority within the meaning of ILC Article 5. It is only when there is
evidence that “the State was using its ownership interest in or control of a corporation
specifically in order to achieve a particular result”, that “the conduct in question has been
attributed to the State”?”'. According to Sri Lanka, the Commentary negatives the
proposition that the mere existence of a board of directors appointed by the Ministry makes
all the acts of the company attributable to the State.

396.

Finally, Respondent submits that Deutsche Bank confuses the general hedging program
and the Hedging Agreement itself. According to Respondent, there was no instruction
given and no direction or control exercised by any Sri Lankan authority over the entering
into the latter. In this respect, Claimant’s reliance on a passage from the Commentary to
ILC Article 8 which refers to the fact that conduct may be attributable if the “State directed
or controlled the specific operation and the conduct complained of was an integral part of
that operation” is misplaced. The specific operation was not the hedging program that Sri
Lanka directed CPC to engage in. It was the conclusion of the Hedging Agreement itself.

Sri Lanka therefore concludes that it is not responsible for the actions of CPC, either on the
basis of ILC Article 4, 5 or 8.

Sub-Section II. The issue of attribution by application of the Umbrella Clause of the
BIT: Is the Hedging Agreement an obligation of Sri Lanka? Is it so
on the basis that the conclusion of the Hedging Agreement was a
State action, therefore attributable to Sri Lanka?

For Sri Lanka, the answer to the preliminary question as to whether international law or
domestic law governs whether Sri Lanka is to be regarded as a party to the Hedging
Agreement, is that domestic law is the relevant law to determine this issue.

According to Respondent, English law governs the circumstances in which the State is to
be regarded as a party to the Hedging Agreement. The circumstances in which English law
is prepared to pierce the corporate veil of a State corporation are limited and do not on any
view encompass the circumstances of the present case.

Respondent argues that in any event, even if Sri Lankan law were in some way relevant,
whether or not the Sri Lankan courts have regarded CPC as part of the State for the
specific purposes of the Fundamental Rights jurisdiction?” or other quasi constitutional
purposes relating to disqualification from standing in elections”, had no bearing on
whether the State was to be regarded as party to a contract entered into by CPC. Quite
clearly in Respondent’s view, this was not the case and Deutsche Bank has been unable to
point to any case in which the State has been held to be liable for contractual obligations
undertaken by CPC or any equivalent State entity.

According to Respondent, Deutsche Bank’s reliance on Walker v. Republic of Congo?” is
misplaced. It was not a case concerning whether the State was to be regarded as being a
party to the contract. Respondent argues that it was concerned with the question as to
whether it was possible to pierce the corporate veil in order to enforce the judgement debt
resulting from a judgement obtained against a State-owned entity against other assets of

the State. Respondent submits that that situation is very different from that at issue in the
present case.

On 22 July 2012, the Respondent drew the attention of the Tribunal to the decision of the
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, on appeal from the Court of Appeal of Jersey, in
La Générale des Carriéres et des Mines (Gécamines) v F.G. Hemisphere Associates
LLC [2012] UKPC 27, delivered on 17 July 2012. In additional submissions provided on
27 July 2012, the Respondent submitted that this decision was directly relevant to the
present case as it clarified the English law on the assimilation of the state-owned
corporation to the State. In particular, the exceptional circumstances required to override
the presumption created by the formation of a separate legal entity were emphasised. The
Respondent submitted that the factual circumstances broadly paralleled the present case
and therefore the Tribunal should find that CPC cannot be assimilated to the Respondent.

Finally, Respondent insists on the fact that Deutsche Bank did not at any point regard Sri
Lanka as being a party to the Hedging Agreement. Moreover, during the course of the
restructuring negotiations, it expressly raised the possibility of the introduction of a
Government guarantee of CPC’s obligations. The fact that it did so unequivocally
demonstrates in Respondent’s view that it did not believe that Sri Lanka had any
obligations under the Hedging Agreement itself.

With respect to international law, Respondent submits that contrary to what Deutsche Bank
suggests, the question is not one of State responsibility for a particular transaction but
rather whether the conduct of CPC in entering into the Hedging Agreement can be
attributed to Sri Lanka. Respondent disputes the allegation that the international law rules
of attribution (which are concerned only with whether conduct is to be attributed to the
State for the purposes of determining its international responsibility for wrongful acts)
should govern this question.

Even assuming that the international law rules of attribution of internationally wrongful
conduct (which does not normally include the mere conclusion of a contract) were
applicable, Sri Lanka refers to its previous developments on ILC Articles 4, 5 and 8 to

conclude that there cannot be any responsibility of Respondent on the basis of either ILC
Article 4, 5 or 8, for the reasons explained above.

SECTION III. THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS AND DECISION
There are two separate issues to be determined here:

a

whether the Cabinet of Ministers, the Ministry of Petroleum, the Central Bank and
the Supreme Court are organs of the State under Article 4 of the ILC Articles and
whether CPC is an organ of the State under Article 4 or, alternatively, can its
conduct be attributed to the State under Articles 5 or 8 of the ILC Articles.

b

The first issue is the most straight-forward. Both parties agree that the Cabinet of
Ministers, the Ministry of Petroleum (including Minister Fowzie), the Central Bank

86

403.

404.

405.

(including its Governor) and the Supreme Court are organs of the State under ILC Article
4. The Tribunal agrees with this position and therefore that the actions of these
bodies/persons are attributable to Sri Lanka. This is important as, as will be seen below,
the violations of the Treaty asserted by Deutsche Bank are based principally upon the
actions of the Supreme Court and the Central Bank.

However, Deutsche Bank also asserts that the actions of CPC violated the Treaty, which is
only possible if those actions are attributable to Sri Lanka, being the party with
international obligations under the Treaty. In relation to the breaches of Articles 2 and 4 of
the Treaty (Fair and Equitable Treatment, Expropriation and Full Protection and Security),
this claim is secondary to the conduct of the bodies mentioned in the previous paragraph.
However, in relation to alleged violations of Article 8 of the Treaty (the Umbrella clause),
the attribution of CPC’s actions is a crucial element.

As explained further below, because the Tribunal is satisfied that the actions of the
Supreme Court and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka establish violations of the Treaty under
Articles 2 (fair and equitable treatment) and 4(2) (expropriation) of the Treaty, it is
unnecessary for this Tribunal to further decide whether Article 8 was also breached. As
such, the primary rationale for deciding whether CPC’s actions are attributable to Sri
Lanka under either English law (as argued by the Respondent) or under ILC Articles 4, 5
or 8 also slips away.

The Tribunal nonetheless makes the following observations on the matter:

a) The Tribunal finds it compelling that the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka considered
CPC to be “a Government creation clothed with juristic personality so as to give it
an aura of independence” with “deep and pervasive State control””?”>, such that
that its business is mainly, if not wholly, controlled by the State. Sri Lanka’s
suggestion that this finding of the Supreme Court was only relevant to those narrow
situations involving “fundamental rights” was unconvincing. While it may be
unusual for a state enterprise to be considered an organ of the State, this is only the
case where the state enterprise is genuinely independent — the fact that it takes the
form of a separate legal entity is not decisive.

b

State control of CPC is evident. CPC is of course a 100% State-owned entity and it
benefits from the protection of immunity from suit. The Minister of Petroleum
appoints its directors and may remove them?’°, CPC has been established by a
statute for the purpose of conducting Sri Lanka’s oil policy in the national
interest”””. There is considerable evidence as to the significant control exercised by
the Government over CPC’s personnel, finances and decision making. In

particular, CPC is required to follow any written directions of the Minister of
Petroleum?”*, regardless of whether those directions are in the best interests of
CPC.

The Tribunal has also been presented with considerable evidence demonstrating
that CPC acted under the direct instruction of Sri Lanka both in (i) negotiating and
executing the Hedging Agreement as part of the overall hedging program; and (ii)
in refusing to pay the amounts owing following termination of the Hedging
Agreement as a direct result of orders CPC received from the Supreme Court and
the Central Bank.

A directive from the Cabinet and the Minister obliged CPC to start the hedging
program. CPC had to hedge. It did not have any choice. This was confirmed both
by Mr. de Mel and Mr. Karunaratne””.

The Tribunal does not consider that the case of La Générale des Carriéres et des
Mines v FG Hemisphere Associates LLC [2012] UKPC 27 on which the parties
submitted additional submissions alters any of the above analysis. This was of
course a case decided under Jersey law, although it discussed the English law
position on attribution. Given that this Tribunal has not found it necessary to make
any final determination on attribution in relation to CPC, there is also no need for
the Tribunal to come to a firm conclusion as to whether the issue is governed by
international law or English law. If English law were to apply, the principles of
law set out in the Gécamines case are entirely consistent with the approach of the
Tribunal above. As stated in Gécamines, while separate legal personality is a
strong indicator of an entity which is not an organ of the State, there are exceptions.
In particular, this is so where the entity has no effective independent existence or
where the conduct of the State justifies lifting the corporate veil. Whether either of
these exceptions applies is entirely fact-specific and the facts in the Gécamines case
were obviously different to those before this Tribunal. While there are some
similarities on the facts (for example, the ability of the Government to veto certain
decisions of the company in each case), the Tribunal considers that the indicators of
a lack of true independence in the present case are much stronger than those set out
in the Gécamines decision. The case therefore does not alter the observations of
the Tribunal in this section in relation to CPC’s lack of independence from the
Respondent.

 

The above points suggest that CPC’s actions would be attributable to the State,
either because CPC is an organ of the State under ILC Article 4 or because CPC

lacked separate legal existence, and/or acted under the instruction of the State. It is
unlikely, however, that CPC’s actions would be attributable to Sri Lanka under ILC
Article 5 as the specific wrongdoing in the present case (failure to pay the amounts.
owing under the Hedging Agreement) could not be considered an act of
government or sovereign authority.

Nonetheless, as noted above, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to come to any firm
conclusions on this matter, as it does not affect the Tribunal’s findings on the violations of
Articles 2 and 4 of the Treaty, nor does it have any effect on the quantum of the damages
claimed by Deutsche Bank.

Finally, the Arbitral Tribunal has decided above that Sri Lanka’s actions were within its
powers and were not ultra vires*®°, There is therefore no issue in this respect. In any case,
the Tribunal notes that according to the ILC’s commentary”*', “where persons or groups
have committed acts under the effective control of a State the condition for attribution will
still be met even if particular instructions may have been ignored. The conduct will have
been committed under the control of the State and it will be attributable to the State in
accordance with Article 8”.

CHAPTER VII. THE MERITS

According to Deutsche Bank, Sri Lanka breached Article 2(1), last sentence, Article 4(1)
and (2), and Article 8 of the Treaty. This is disputed by Respondent.

SECTION I. FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT

Sub-SectionI. The Standard

L Claimant’s position

According to Claimant, Article 2(1) of the Treaty, which provides that “[Each Contracting
State] shall in any case accord such investments fair and equitable treatment” establishes
an autonomous standard of fair and equitable treatment. Claimant argues that it is
implausible as a matter of textual interpretation that the Contracting States to a bilateral
investment treaty would use the term “fair and equitable treatment” where they sought to
incorporate the well-known concept of “minimum standard of treatment in customary
international law”. Unlike other treaties, Article 2(1) of the BIT does not make reference
to the customary international law standard.

Claimant submits that “fair and equitable treatment” has to be interpreted in accordance
with Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties according to which a
treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in light of the ordinary meaning of its terms in their
context and in light of its object and purpose. Claimant refers to the Oxford Dictionary
which defines “fair” as “just, unbiased, equitable, impartial, legitimate”. The word
“equitable” means “characterized by equity or fairness”. “Equity” is defined as fairness,
impartiality, even-handed dealing. If one has to interpret the terms in their context and in
light of the object and purpose of the Treaty, the Tribunal should also look to the preamble
of the German-Sri Lanka BIT recording the intention “to create favourable conditions for
investments” and “recognizing that the encouragement and contractual protection of such
investments are apt to stimulate private business initiative and to increase the prosperity of
both nations”.

Deutsche Bank also submits that a breach of the obligation to provide fair and equitable
treatment “cannot be reached in the abstract; it must depend on the facts of the particular
case”??. It further submits that there can be a violation of the standard even where no
mala fides is involved, and Claimant approves the definition of the standard in Waste
Management II (also relied upon by Sri Lanka) prohibiting conduct which is:

“arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes
the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process
leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety — as might be the case with

a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of
transparency and candor in an administrative process. In applying the standard, it
is relevant that the treatment is in breach of representations made by the Host State

which were reasonably relied on by the claimant”.

Claimant however submits that the list of proscribed treatment is not exhaustive, for
example, it is also established that fair and equitable treatment requires that a State’s action
in relation to the investor shall be proportionate”.

Claimant also disputes Respondent’s suggestion that the principle of natural justice does
not form part of the standard. In Claimant’s view, this is contrary to well established
authority. The Waste Management II decision itself referred to lack of transparency and
candor in the administrative process, and many tribunals have found a breach of due
process to violate the FET standard. Claimant argues that due process and the right to be
heard have been expressly included in the FET standard in various decisions, including
Saluka v. Czech Republic 85 | Metalclad v. Mexico”®, Tecmed v. Mexico”*’, International
Thunderbird v. Mexico**® and Rumeli Telekom v. Kazakhstan™.

I. Respondent’s position

According to Respondent, the interpretation of the fair and equitable treatment standard
must be resolved primarily on the basis of the ordinary meaning of the terms and by
reference to the content of that standard recognized in customary international law.

Respondent submits that the threshold for procedural violations of fair and equitable
treatment is high. It needs to rise to the level of a “manifest injustice” that offends “judicial

propriety”. In Respondent’s view, it requires “shock or surprise” to an impartial
tribunal””!, “gross denial of justice” and “manifest arbitrariness”.

According to Respondent, the aim of the fair and equitable treatment standard is to ensure
the rule of law in the relations between investors and the State in which they invest™?, It
allows the Government a wide degree of latitude when it exercises its police powers in the
public interest. Respondent argues that the clause does not subject the range of regulatory
policies to an exacting proportionality test, nor does it create an international system of
judicial review of administrative action. The obligation of fair and equitable treatment is in
Respondent’s view not breached where regulatory measures serve a legitimate purpose and
are based on legal standards, rather than prejudice or personal preference. Even if,
hypothetically, legislation were objectively imperfect, this does not violate fair and
equitable treatment. A fortiori, imperfect implementation of existing regulation is no
breach of the international standard.

Tl. The Tribunal’s analysis and decision

The fair and equitable treatment standard finds different expressions in different treaties.
Some treaties, such as the German-Sri Lanka BIT, simply refer to “fair and equitable
treatment”. Others include express language treating this standard as an element of the
general rules of international law, or this standard alongside the rules of international law.

Given the wording of Article 2(2) of the BIT here, the Arbitral Tribunal concludes that the
contracting parties ought to be taken to have intended the adoption of an autonomous
standard, on the basis, as stated by Christoph Schreuer, that:

“it is inherently implausible that a treaty would use an expression such as “fair and
equitable treatment” to denote a well-known concept such as the “minimum
standard of treatment in customary international law”. If the parties to a treaty
want to refer to customary international law, it must be presumed that they will
refer to it as such rather than using a different expression 204

On the other hand, the Arbitral Tribunal recognizes that the actual content of the Treaty
standard of fair and equitable treatment is not materially different from the content of the

minimum standard of treatment in customary international law, as recognised by numerous
arbitral tribunals and commentators”.

In this respect, the Tribunal notes that the standard has been rightly — although not
exhaustively — defined in the Waste Management II case, quoted above”. Accordingly, its
components may be distilled as follows:

- protection of legitimate and reasonable expectations which have been relied upon by
the investor to make the investment;

- good faith conduct although bad faith on the part of the State is not required for its
violation;

- conduct that is transparent, consistent and not discriminatory, that is, not based on
unjustifiable distinctions or arbitrary;

- conduct that does not offend judicial propriety, that complies with due process and the
right to be heard,

It is on the basis of these principles, and taking into consideration all the circumstances of
the dispute, that the Arbitral Tribunal must determine whether the conduct of Sri Lanka
was consistent with its obligation to ensure fair and equitable treatment of Deutsche
Bank’s investment.

Sub-Section II. Application of the Standard

L Claimant’s position
(A) The violations alleged by Claimant

Claimant invokes various violations of the FET standard by the Supreme Court and the
Central Bank.

Claimant submits that although from July 2006 Sri Lanka actively encouraged investors
such as Deutsche Bank to enter into the market and carry out derivatives trades with Sri
Lankan State entities, especially as CPC, once oil prices dropped sharply in November
2008, the Central Bank and the Supreme Court intervened to make it impossible for
Deutsche Bank (and other banks) to recover from CPC the moneys owed to it under the
Hedging Agreement.

430.

Against the backdrop of threatened criminal and regulatory investigations, the Supreme
Court issued its first Interim Order in the fundamental rights proceeding on 28 November
2008, suspending all payments to the banks under the hedging transactions.

Claimant recalls that on 16 December 2008, the Central Bank sent its Order to Deutsche
Bank directing that all payments owed by CPC under the Hedging Agreement were to be
suspended and characterized the oil hedging transactions as “materially affected” and
“substantially tainted’. Again, on 6 January 2009, the Central Bank produced an
Investigation Report repeating similar allegations. Claimant further points out that the
Supreme Court’s Interim Order was lifted on 27 January 2009 but that same day the
Central Bank issued a press release confirming that its 16 December Order prohibiting
payment remained in full force and effect. According to Claimant, the effect of the above
was that payments could not be made under the transactions to any of the banks, even if
CPC had wished to make them.

Claimant further states that the Central Bank had also continued to make highly critical
public statements regarding Deutsche Bank which were unfounded and injurious to the
bank’s reputation, for example the Central Bank’s press release dated 27 January 2009
stating that the various hedging transactions entered into between CPC and a number of
banks were “materially affected and substantially tainted”.

In addition, according to Claimant, since the conduct of CPC is attributable to Sri Lanka,
the failure of CPC to make payment of USD 60,368,993 following Deutsche Bank’s
termination of the Hedging Agreement constitutes a further violation of Sri Lanka’s
obligation to afford fair and equitable treatment to Deutsche Bank’s investments.

Claimant submits that in and of themselves, the above events are grossly unfair,
inequitable and contrary to Deutsche Bank’s legitimate expectations that hedging
transactions were supported by Sri Lanka and would be respected.

(B) The Supreme Court proceedings

As mentioned above, Claimant submits that the Supreme Court proceedings and the
Supreme Court’s Interim Order of 28 November 2008 breached the FET Standard on
various grounds. This is disputed by Sri Lanka. According to Respondent, the Supreme
Court’s Order did not breach the FET standard on the basis that the petitioners challenged
the vires of the transaction which is credible in light of the Citibank award??”, and that the
Order was only interim and was not made against Deutsche Bank. Claimant contends that
both arguments are incorrect.

In the first place, a lack of vires was not the basis of the Supreme Court’s decision which
was as follows:

?° Citibank N.A. v. Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, supra note183.

94

431.

432.

433.

434,

“[t]he Petitioners have established a strong prima facie case that these
transactions have not been entered into lawfully: that they are not “arms-length
transactions”; that they are heavily weighted in favor of the Banks; that they are to
the detriment of [CPC] and through that to the people of Sri Lanka; that they
amount to an abuse of statutory authority which denies the people the equal
protection of law”?*®.

According to Claimant, it is also incorrect to rewrite the Supreme Court’s Order as
consistent with the reasoning of the Citibank award. Claimant argues that the issues which
the Citibank Tribunal found determinative, the question of speculation v. hedging and the
ambit of a proper risk management policy, were not even placed before the Court. The
Supreme Court’s reasoning was essentially that the transactions were unfair or inequitable
bargains and not that CPC had exceeded its capacity by engaging in speculative activity.

Moreover, the fact that the Supreme Court’s Order was interim is irrelevant in Claimant’s
view as the Order prevented the performance of contractual obligations by Deutsche
Bank’s counterparty. Even if it was discharged two months later, when the Monetary
Board of the Central Bank had issued its own Stop-Payment Order preventing performance
of the Hedging Agreement, the Order was not subject to any time limit when issued.
Furthermore, the Supreme Court made its Order less than 48 hours after the filing of the
petition, based on what appears to have been extremely limited evidence, and without
hearing from the banks whose contractual rights were directly affected by the Order.

Claimant argues that the practical effect of the Supreme Court’s Order was to leave
Deutsche Bank with no alternative but to terminate the Hedging Agreement. The Order
prevented payments by CPC but did not excuse Deutsche Bank from its obligation to make
payments should oil prices rise. In Claimant’s view, Deutsche Bank was therefore left with
a unilateral risk. In addition, Claimant submits that further downward movement in prices
would have increased Deutsche Bank’s credit exposure to CPC. Consequently, it had no
option but to exercise its right to terminate based on CPC’s breach of contract — by failing
to sign and return the ISDA Master Agreement within 90 days — and to crystallize or fix
the payments due by CPC under the Hedging Agreement. Claimant submits that this is
confirmed by the terms of the letter of termination of 3 December 20087” and Deutsche
Bank’s letter to the President of CPC dated 23 December 2008°™.

Finally, Claimant also refers to the subsequent public statements of Chief Justice Silva
who presided (on a bench of three) over the hearing which in Claimant’s view strongly
suggest that the decision was politically motivated. He stated that “the Government was
forced to comply with the hedging agreements. We said we will stop that on a judicial
order, just pass on the benefit to the people. The Government said you stop the hedging

438.

agreements but we won’t pass on the benefit” ! Furthermore, referring to the
international arbitration proceedings against Sri Lanka and CPC, the Chief Justice
commented “/t/here are huge claims and I can’t imagine how we are going to meet them.
Internationally, we have no defense. This is a difficult fight. But within the country, we
would have had a case because there were elements of fraud and corruption”> 2 Claimant
notes in this respect that there had not been any evidence of any fraud nor has Sri Lanka
made any such allegation in this proceeding.

(C) The Central Bank’s investigation and Stop-Payment Order of 16
December 2008

According to Claimant, the investigation conducted by the Central Bank is a clear example
of the breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. Claimant argues that the
investigation was flawed both procedurally and substantively.

1) The investigation was improperly motivated and in bad faith

Claimant submits that at the time of the investigation, the Central Bank and Governor
Cabraal were forced to defend their role in relation to the hedging program amid
substantial public criticism?” They openly used the investigation of the banks to deflect
such criticism. By placing the blame on the banks and excluding further payment by CPC,
the Central Bank and its Governor managed to exculpate themselves and have largely
avoided further public criticism.

Claimant points out that the Central Bank has offered two alleged motivations for its
investigation: 1) foreign exchange concerns because of the substantial payment CPC was
required to make in US dollars; and 2) alleged surprise that CPC was required to make
large payments following a decline in world oil prices*™, According to Claimant, neither
motivation is credible.

Claimant argues that as to the first, CPC’s burden on Sri Lanka’s foreign exchange was in
fact substantially reduced as a result of the fall in oil prices since the majority of CPC’s
requirements were unhedged. Mr. de Mel confirmed that CPC’s monthly saving was over
USD 200 million and that “the foreign exchange outflow from Sri Lanka was reduced by
that amount”®>. As to the second point, the Central Bank was well aware that in the event
of a fall in oil prices, CPC would be required to make payment, and this was the cost of
hedging.

Furthermore, Claimant recalls that Governor Cabraal directed Mr. Karunaratne “to hold the
outstanding payments to banks for a while” in a telephone call on Friday 7 November
2008, a week before the investigation into the banks had even commenced*”’. Claimant
submits that Sri Lanka has offered no explanation for the omission of this highly relevant
fact from Mr. Karunaratne’s witness statement™””. According to Claimant, Deutsche Bank
only became aware of it because it was included in Mr. Karunaratne’s evidence in the SCB
claim. Acting on this instruction, Mr. Karunaratne did not make the payment to Citibank
which was due that day. On Monday 10 November 2008, following media reports of a
“default” by CPC over the weekend, the Governor had a change of mind and instructed
CPC to make payment and to follow this up with a press conference which CPC duly
did”.

Respondent’s submission that only a payment to Citibank was in fact delayed misses the
point in Claimant’s view. The instruction was a general one preventing payments to all of
the banks. Claimant submits that moreover, in any event, what is significant is that the
Governor was making a direction to CPC and before any investigation was commenced.
The instruction was given and followed without question which is clear evidence that CPC
is not independent of the State.

According to Claimant, having been forced by media pressure to reverse his instruction of
non-payment to the banks, Governor Cabraal immediately decided to commence an
investigation into the hedging transactions. Although it was commenced on Thursday 30
November 2008, Dr. Jayamaha gave evidence that Governor Cabraal informed her of his
decision “a couple of days before the investigation commenced” 309 According to Deutsche
Bank, the timeline speaks for itself: the Governor instructed CPC not to make payment to
the banks on Friday 7 November, reversed this instruction because of concern that it would
be perceived as a default event on Monday 10 November and by Tuesday 11 November
decided to commence an investigation. Claimant submits that the Governor had decided
that he would need to achieve the desired result, non-payment by CPC, by means of an
investigation, to prevent further suggestion of default by CPC which could affect Sri
Lanka’s credit rating.

Deutsche Bank submits that the outcome of the investigation was clearly a foregone
conclusion. In Claimant’s view, this is further made clear by Governor Cabraal’s actions at
the meeting with Mr. Rodrigo on 19 November 2008, just four working days after the
commencement of the investigation. He stated that the Central Bank had already concluded
that Deutsche Bank had not followed proper procedures in relation to the Hedging
Agreement and that the Monetary Board (chaired by the Governor) would take actions
against Deutsche Bank. He refused to provide any details of the alleged breaches but stated
that if Deutsche Bank came up with an “acceptable solution” for CPC, the Central Bank

and the Monetary Board would not pursue the matter any further*!°, According to
Claimant, this is an improper conduct for a regulator.

Claimant argues that Mr. Rodrigo’s account is supported by two contemporaneous emails
he sent to update colleagues on the meeting with the Central Bank noting that the Central
Bank was “resorting to strong arm tactics”*"'. It is also consistent with a contemporaneous
note prepared by Mr. Haswel of SCB*!?. Mr. Haswel was informed that the alleged failings
on the part of the banks included Mr. de Mel’s lack of authority and inadequate risk
assessments, criticisms which were later made in the Central Bank’s report.

Deutsche Bank points out that Dr. Jayamaha only belatedly challenged Mr. Rodrigo’s
account of the meeting in her second witness statement. According to Claimant, her
evidence is not credible. During the hearing, she first stated that she could not recall
whether or not the Governor had made certain statements at the meeting, before eventually
stating that she disagreed with the accounts of Mr. Rodrigo and Mr. Haswel*'*, Claimant
submits that Dr. Jayamaha’s account is unsupported by any contemporaneous document
and should be rejected.

Finally, Deutsche Bank also points out that Governor Cabraal, who had been a central
figure in relation to almost every aspect of the case and was involved from the very start in
August 2006, has not given evidence to the Tribunal, despite confirmation that he is in
good health, working full time*" and making regular visits to Singapore.

2) Lack of transparency and due process

According to Claimant, the suggestion that Mr. Nanayakkara and the Central Bank carried
out a serious investigation concerning hundreds of millions of dollars into five banks over
a one month period without generating more than the two or three internal documents Sri
Lanka has provided, is not credible. In Claimant’s view, the absence of any documentary
record suggests either that documents have been withheld because they are prejudicial or
that no proper investigation was carried out since a proper investigation would surely have
produced substantial documentation.

Claimant further recalls that Deutsche Bank was not informed of the case against it before
the Monetary Board issued its Stop-Payment Order on 16 December 2008. In the
Assessment of Compliance, the Central Bank had confined itself to ascertaining
compliance with the Directions. However, the scope of the investigation was substantially
broadened. Claimant submits that the Investigation Report placed before the Monetary
Board on 13 December 2008 (but not sent to Deutsche Bank until 6 January 2009)

contained three new findings against Deutsche Bank of which it received no notice
whatsoever and to which it had no opportunity to respond. According to Claimant, this is a
clear breach of natural justice.

Deutsche Bank further points out that the Investigation Report was prepared in the course
of just 24 hours. Claimant argues that the Investigation Report almost completely
disregarded Deutsche Bank’s responses for reasons which were patently irrational and
arbitrary.

3) Inconsistency and breach of legitimate expectations

Claimant further states that the Central Bank was involved in CPC’s hedging program
from the outset. And though, Mr. Nanayakkara confirmed that his Department did not
interview anyone at CPC or the Central Bank during the investigation*">. He rather decided
to form his own views of the nature and purpose of the program, although he had not had
any prior involvement with it. He concluded that the “original intention of the hedging
program” would not have required CPC to make large payments to the banks in the event
of substantial falls in market prices*!®, while the downside risks to CPC had been made
clear in every significant document produced by the Central Bank.

Claimant submits that acting as it did, the Bank Supervision Department acted
inconsistently and in breach of Deutsche Bank’s legitimate expectation that the Hedging
Agreement did not breach Sri Lankan regulations.

4) The findings of the investigation do not withstand any
scrutiny

According to Claimant, the substantive findings of the Central Bank’s Investigation are
manifestly flawed. In Claimant’s view, many of the findings were based on no apparent
tule or direction which Deutsche Bank could have known in advance. Some of the findings
were highly irregular and Sri Lanka has made little attempt to justify the substantive
findings of the Central Bank in its submissions. Moreover, Claimant argues that not one of
the adverse findings by the Central Bank is relied upon by Sri Lanka as ground for the
alleged unlawfulness of the Hedging Agreement in this proceeding. Sri Lanka’s case rests
on the alleged speculative nature and ultra vires character of the Hedging Agreement.
Claimant concludes that it is evident that Sri Lanka considers that there is no merit in the
Central Bank’s findings.

According to Claimant, it is also notable that the Central Bank reached identical
conclusions, verbatim, with regard to both Deutsche Bank and Commercial Bank*!”,

457.

Finally, Claimant argues that the overall conclusion that the Hedging Agreement, and
indeed all CPC’s hedging agreements, were “materially affected and substantially tainted”
is highly dubious. Neither concept had any basis in any Sri Lankan law or Central Bank’s

Regulation*'®.

5) The Central Bank acted in excess of powers

Claimant further submits that the Stop-Payment Order did not state the power on which it
was based. Mr. Nanayakkara stated in his first witness statement that this was under
Section 46 of the Banking Act?!®. Claimant argues that Section 46 does not confer the
power to suspend contracts entered into by a bank. Rather, it allows the Central Bank to
take necessary measures in order to ensure the soundness of the banking system.
According to Claimant, Section 46 had never before been used to interfere with a contract
as it has been done in this case.

6) The Central Bank’s action was disproportionate

In Claimant’s view, its expert, Mr. Grove, had demonstrated that if Deutsche Bank had
concluded an instrument without a capped upside such as a plain-vanilla zero cost collar
with CPC on 8 July 2008, it would have been required to pay Deutsche Bank an additional
USD 26 million*””. According to Claimant, it is therefore entirely disproportionate for the
Central Bank to take the draconian step of preventing any payment to Deutsche Bank
based on an alleged breach of regulations which in fact resulted in a substantially reduced
cost to CPC. Claimant argues that this demonstrates that the motive of the investigation
was not concerned with a breach of regulations but a contrived scheme to excuse CPC’s
payment obligations.

7) Additional remarks

Claimant disputes Sri Lanka’s insistence that the investigation was only concerned with
the intermediary role of Deutsche Bank Colombo. According to Claimant, this is
contradicted by Respondent’s witnesses. The intermediary role which Mr. Rodrigo offered
to play in the transaction was expressly limited to ensuring compliance with the Directions.
Yet Mr. Silva and Nanayakkara have acknowledged that the findings of the Investigation
Report went beyond the Directions”.

Deutsche Bank also disputes Sri Lanka’s repeated statement that Deutsche Bank should
have raised its complaints of mistreatment with the Central Bank during the investigation.
It is normal that Deutsche Bank did not consider it appropriate to criticize the conduct of
the regulator during the course of the ongoing investigation but confined itself to a robust

rejection of the Central Bank’s allegations. Moreover, Deutsche Bank believed that the
investigation was ongoing until it received the Investigation Report on 6 January 2009.
Claimant states that it was only during the course of these Byoceedings that it appeared that
the report had in fact been finalized on 13 December 2008

Finally, Claimant disputes Sri Lanka’s allegation that even if there was a breach of the fair
and equitable treatment, it did not cause Deutsche Bank’s pleaded loss since Deutsche
Bank still has the opportunity to file an action before the English Courts. Claimant argues
that this is a Treaty case, and that the case law is clear that where a State interferes with a
contract by way of a sovereign act, the Treaty is engaged and it is not necessary to show
that the contractually chosen forum for resolution of disputes is unavailable. The
investigation which was characterized by serious procedural failings, led directly to the
Stop-Payment Order which has prevented Deutsche Bank from receiving payment.
According to Claimant, the Central Bank’s breach of fair and equitable treatment therefore
directly caused Deutsche Bank’s loss.

I. Respondent’s position

Sri Lanka submits that the three grounds on which Deutsche Bank claims a breach of the
fair and equitable treatment standard, i.e., (i) the Interim Order of the Supreme Court dated
28 November 2008, (ii) the conduct of the Central Bank’s investigation, and (iii) the letter
from the Central Bank to Deutsche Bank Colombo dated 16 December 2008, have no
foundation.

(A) The Supreme Court Interim Order

According to Sri Lanka, the Interim Order had no effect on Deutsche Bank’s contractual
rights against CPC and in particular on its right to bring a claim against CPC before the
Commercial Court in London or in Sri Lanka.

Moreover, Respondent points out that this was only an interim order and Deutsche Bank
was not a party to the proceedings and did not seek to be joined. The effect of the Order
was only temporarily to prevent payment by CPC.

(B) The Central Bank’s Investigation and Stop-Payment Order of 16
December 2008

Sri Lanka submits in the first place that at the time of the Investigation, Deutsche Bank
never formulated any of the complaints that it is alleging today in relation to the
Assessment of Compliance and the Investigation Report.

Respondent argues that the Investigation was conducted pursuant to Section 29(1) of the
Monetary Law Act. It began on 13 November 2008 and concerned Deutsche Bank

*2 Transcript Day 2, p. 148, line 11 to p. 149, line 15.

101

 

464.

465.

466.

467.

Colombo’s role as the intermediary in the Hedging Agreement. These were the issues
examined in the Assessment of Compliance.

Respondent further recalls that on 20 November 2008, the Supreme Court ordered the
Monetary Board to conduct an investigation*”’. It decided indeed that the petitioner had
founded a “strong, prima facie case”:

“that these transactions had not been entered into lawfully; that they are not
“arms-length” transactions; that they are heavily weighted in favour of the Banks;
that they are to the detriment of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and through
that to the people of Sri Lanka; that they amount to an abuse of statutory
authority...”

According to Respondent, these bases were repeated in the CBSL investigation report and
this was confirmed by Mr. Silva and by Mr. Nanayakkara*”’ .

Moreover, according to Respondent, the Assessment of Compliance made clear at the
outset that it dealt with the intermediary role played by Deutsche Bank Colombo which in
Sri Lanka is registered as Deutsche Bank AG. Respondent submits that the role of an
intermediary bank can only be assessed by reference to what it was supposed to do. It is
only if Deutsche Bank London in fact complied with the 2005 Directions that Deutsche
Bank Colombo could be said to have complied within its undertaking; Respondent submits
that an assessment of the actions of Deutsche Bank London was therefore a necessary part
of the investigation of Deutsche Bank Colombo’s compliance with its undertaking.

In Respondent’s view, the fact that the investigation was only concerned with the
intermediary role of Deutsche Bank Colombo in the Hedging Agreement was confirmed
by Mr. Silva*® and Mr. Nanayakkara*”’. Mr. Nanayakkara and Mr. Rodrigo were in
agreement with the fact that:

- Deutsche Bank London is regulated in London;

- The Central Bank does not have and does not purport to have any regulatory
jurisdiction over Deutsche Bank London, it has no authority over either of the
contracting parties;

- The 2005 Directions are not binding on Deutsche Bank London, but

- Deutsche Bank Colombo agreed to play an intermediary role to ensure the
compliance of transactions by Deutsche Bank London with those Directions.

Respondent further argues that the Central Bank also made clear that Deutsche Bank
Colombo was only required to cease its own intermediary role in light of its failure to act
in accordance with its undertaking. According to Respondent, there were some 20 other
banks through which CPC could have remitted the payment due to Deutsche Bank
London”.

Sri Lanka also objects to Claimant’s reliance on the Investigation Report sent to
Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC on 12 January 2009*” and its conclusion that it was
“clear that [the Central Bank] intended to apply the same sanction to all the banks’.
Contrary to what Claimant suggests, there are significant and notable differences between
the reports, the first notable one being the fact that the Commercial Bank report is ten
pages longer than the Deutsche Bank report. Respondent points out that the considerations
of the Central Bank were similar for both banks. Both reports were based on the 2005
Directions and the terms of the Supreme Court Interim Order but the conclusions regarding
the supervisory concerns were very different. In Respondent’s view, they were not
arbitrary and the process was not discriminatory.

According to Sri Lanka, the Central Bank’s investigation had no consequences for
Deutsche Bank. The Central Bank imposed no sanction on Deutsche Bank Colombo.
Respondent submits that all it did was to ask it to avoid repetition in the future. In
Respondent’s view, the Central Bank had never challenged Deutsche Bank London’s right
to claim against CPC. Respondent further points out that even though it was clear that
Deutsche Bank did not comply with the terms of the 16 December 2008 letter, it continued
to act as if it were the conduit by delivering Deutsche Bank London’s demands for
payment.

According to Sri Lanka, there was nothing in the conduct of the Central Bank which even
conceivably gave rise to a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard.
Respondent argues that Deutsche Bank has failed to substantiate its allegations of bad faith
or improper purposes on the part of the Central Bank. According to Respondent, the
investigation was undertaken bona fide, albeit upon short notice, in relation to a matter of
concern which suddenly emerged. Deutsche Bank Colombo was at all times apprised of
the investigation by the Central Bank. It was given an opportunity to respond to the
Assessment of Compliance, an opportunity which Deutsche Bank London took. However,
in Respondent’s view, Deutsche Bank chose not to respond to the majority of the concerns
raised as to the role of Deutsche Bank Colombo and none of the various documents which
it has subsequently relied upon were attached to that letter. Deutsche Bank accordingly
failed to avail itself of the opportunity to respond to the preliminary findings of the
investigation and in any case, Respondent submits that the few points made by Deutsche
Bank in its letter were taken into account in the Investigation Report.

476.

Finally, Respondent disputes Deutsche Bank’s suggestion that the substantive findings of
the investigations were manifestly flawed. It further submits that the fact that the
Investigation Report was prepared in a day and that the investigation was essentially
paperless is not surprising. Respondent submits that the Central Bank was working under
extreme pressures. Moreover, if the investigation was paperless, it was in major part due to
the fact that Deutsche Bank submitted very little paper for the Central Bank to consider.

In any case, Respondent argues that both the Supreme Court Order and the Central Bank’s
letter of 16 December 2008 had no effect on the rights of Deutsche Bank London under the
Hedging Agreement, including its right to claim against CPC before the English courts.
Respondent further submits that even if the Tribunal were to conclude that there had been
some procedural failings in the course of the Central Bank’s investigation which rose to
the level of a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard, which is denied, those
failings are not causative of the loss for which Deutsche Bank claims in the present
arbitration.

Tl. Tribunal’s analysis and decision

The Arbitral Tribunal considers, on the basis of the evidence, that Sri Lanka has breached
the fair and equitable treatment principle through the actions of the Supreme Court and the
Central Bank, including its Governor.

(A) The Supreme Court proceedings

As recalled above, on 26 November 2008, two petitioners filed two requests before the
Supreme Court of Sri Lanka**” against the Minister of Petroleum and Petroleum Resources
Development, CPC, Mr. de Mel, the Secretary to the Treasury, the Minister of Export
Development and International Trade, the Minister of Finance and Finance Planning, the
Monetary Board of Sri Lanka and the Attorney General. They alleged that the Hedging
Agreement was disastrous, constituted mismanagement by CPC and had been entered into
illegally and arbitrarily. They submitted that it violated their fundamental rights and they
therefore asked inter alia that the Supreme Court grant an interim order suspending and/or
preventing CPC making any payment to the SCB, Deutsche Bank, Citibank or any other
bank or institution involved in the hedging program until final determination of their
application.

The Supreme Court issued its Interim Order on 28 November 2008771. In a five page
judgment rendered less than 48 hours after the filing of the petition, it granted all the
claims formulated by petitioners based on what appears to have been extremely limited
evidence and without hearing from the various banks whose contractual rights were
directly affected by the Order. It ordered that all payments by CPC to Deutsche Bank and
the other banks be suspended; that Mr. de Mel, Chairman of CPC, be suspended for

SC.131.

477.

478.

479.

480.

alleged misconduct; that the President of Sri Lanka consider suspending the Minister of
Petroleum for his support of the actions of Mr. de Mel; that the Government directly
purchase all petroleum products and distribute them through the available network; that the
Secretary of the Treasury review taxes on petroleum products and submit a report to the
Supreme Court for the Court to consider the possibility of a formula for the pricing of
petroleum products; and that the Monetary Board carry out an investigation as regards the
impugned transactions and take action thereon.

Founding itself on the allegations of the petitioners with respect to the structure of the
different hedging agreements entered into with the various banks, and the amount to be
paid by CPC, the Supreme Court decided that the petitioners had established a strong
prima facie case that the transactions had not been entered into lawfully, that they were not
arms length transactions and that they were heavily weighted in favour of the banks, to the
detriment of CPC and through that to the people of Sri Lanka*”.

The Arbitral Tribunal decides that reaching such a conclusion and issuing the Order as
detailed above with its far-reaching consequences, without a proper examination and
without giving the banks involved an opportunity to respond, constitutes a breach of the
fair and equitable treatment obligation of Article 2(2) of the BIT in form of a due process
violation.

The Tribunal also relies on the public statements made subsequently by Chief Justice Silva
who presided over the hearing. In those public statements the Chief Justice confirmed that
the decision was issued for political reasons. He indeed declared that “the Government was
forced to comply with the hedging agreements. We will stop that on a judicial order, just
pass on to benefit to the people. The Government said you stop the hedging agreements we
won’t pass on the benefit”** . The Chief Justice further recognized that internationally, Sri
Lanka had no defence to present in the arbitration proceedings, that it was a difficult
fight”.

The Tribunal considers that the fact that the Order of the Supreme Court was interim and
was discharged two months later, is irrelevant, particularly given that the Tribunal
considers it involved a serious due process violation. Indeed, looking at the situation as a
whole, at the time that the Supreme Court’s Order was discharged, the Monetary Board of
the Central Bank had put its own Stop-Payment Order in place, preventing performance of
the Hedging Agreement.

(B) ‘The Central Bank’s investigation and Stop-Payment Order of 16
December 2008

1) The investigation was improperly motivated

According to the Central Bank, there were two reasons for its investigation: the fact that
the substantial payments CPC was required to make in US dollars raised foreign exchange
concerns and an alleged surprise that CPC was required to make large payments following
the fall in world oil prices.

The Arbitral Tribunal is not convinced that these were the true motivations. On the one
hand, Sri Lanka’s foreign exchange liability was considerably reduced following the fall in
oil prices. Indeed, most of CPC’s requirements were unhedged. As far as the existence of
large payments is concerned, the Central Bank was well informed that if the oil prices fell,
CPC would be required to make payment. This was the cost of hedging. It rather appears
that given the substantial public criticism, Governor Cabraal and the Central Bank were
forced to defend their role in relation to the hedging program**,

2) The Government acted in bad faith

In a telephone call on Friday 7 November 2008, a week before the investigation started,
Governor Cabraal directed CPC to hold for a while the outstanding payments to banks**°,
The instruction was given and followed without question by Mr. Karunaratne. On Monday
10 November, having been forced by media pressure to reverse his instruction of non-
payment — given the risk of a default by CPC which could affect Sri Lanka’s credit rating —
Governor Cabraal changed his mind and instructed CPC to make payment”. He then
decided on Tuesday 11 November to commence an investigation into the hedging
transactions. The Arbitral Tribunal agrees with Claimant that the Governor had obviously
decided that the payments to the banks should be stopped and that from the moment he
realised he could not achieve this result by way of an order he had to do it by means of an
investigation.

The fact that the result of the investigation was a foregone conclusion is confirmed by the
meeting that Governor Cabraal had with Mr. Rodrigo on 19 November 2008, four working
days after the beginning of the investigation. During this meeting, he stated that the Central
Bank had concluded that Deutsche Bank had not followed proper procedures in relation to
the Hedging Agreement and that the Monetary Board would take action against Deutsche
Bank. The record also confirms that the Governor indicated to Mr. Rodrigo that if he could
come up with an acceptable solution for CPC, the Central Bank and the Monetary Board

486.

487.

488.

338

would not pursue the matter any further’. All this is evidence that the Governor acted in

bad faith.
3) Lack of transparency and due process

It results from the record that only two or three internal documents were generated during
the Central Bank’s investigation. This absence of documentary record in a case involving
hundreds of millions of dollars and extending over a one month period is hardly credible.
But even if it is true that the investigation was paperless, this would confirm that it was
seriously flawed since an investigation of this nature would have required evidence to be
recorded and assessed by the investigators before any report could be produced and
finalized.

Mr. Nanayakkara confirmed in his testimony that his department did not interview anyone
at CPC or the Central Bank during the investigation although the Central Bank had dealt
directly with the banks and had played a key role in the investigation and implementation
of the programme”. While he had not been involved in the program, Mr. Nanayakkara
decided to form his own views of its nature and purpose. On this basis, he reached the
conclusion that the original intention of the program would not have been to have CPC
make large payments to the banks in the event of substantial falls in market prices”, This
is however in total contradiction with the fact that the downside risk to CPC had been
clearly emphasized in every important document produced by the Central Bank.

Moreover, Deutsche Bank was not informed of the case against it before the Monetary
Board issues its Stop-Payment Order on 16 December 2008 and it was not offered the
possibility to respond to the investigation report. On 5 December 2008, the Central Bank
had sent a letter to Mr. Rodrigo containing an Assessment of Compliance concerning
compliance with the Directions. The scope of the investigation was subsequently
broadened in the final Investigation Report to include issues such as whether the Hedging
Agreement was properly authorised by the CPC Board and the Cabinet; the Hedging
Agreement was “weighted in favour of Deutsche Bank’; and Deutsche Bank violated “best
practices and prudential norms’.

Deutsche Bank responded to the Assessment of Compliance at 8:00 pm on 11 December
2008. Thereafter, the final Investigation Report was prepared in the course of just 24 hours.
It was indeed submitted to the Monetary Board in the morning of 13 December 2008. It
completely disregarded Deutsche Bank’s responses. Moreover, it contains three new
findings against Claimant of which it received no notice whatsoever and to which it had no
opportunity to respond. And it was only sent to Deutsche Bank on 6 January 2009.

494.

Finally, the fact that the Central Bank reached identical conclusions, word for word, with
regard to both Deutsche Bank and Commercial Bank, also raises concerns with respect to
the legitimacy of the process MI

4) The Central Bank acted in excess of its powers

The Stop-Payment Order does not mention on which legal basis it is issued. Mr.
Nanayakkara testified that it was based on Section 46 of the Banking Act*, However, this
Section does not confer to the Central Bank the power to suspend a contract entered into
by a bank but only to take necessary measures in order to guarantee the soundness of the
banking system*™?, The Central Bank therefore acted in excess of its powers.

5) Conclusion

On the basis of the above, the Arbitral Tribunal decides that by acting as it did in relation
to the Supreme Court Interim Order, the Central Bank’s investigation and the Stop-
Payment Order of 16 December 2008, Sri Lanka has breached the fair and equitable
treatment standard contained in Article 2(2) of the BIT.

SECTION II. EXPROPRIATION

Sub-Section I. | The standard of indirect expropriation

L Claimant’s position

Article 4(2) of the Treaty creates certain legal rights and obligations in respect of
expropriation:

“[i]nvestments by nationals or companies of either Contracting State shall not be
expropriated, nationalized or directly or indirectly subjected to any other measure
the effects of which would be tantamount to expropriation or nationalization in the
territory of the other Contracting State except for the public interest and against
compensation”.

Article 4(2) of the BIT therefore clearly encompasses both direct and indirect
expropriation.

Claimant argues that indirect expropriation has been said to include:

“not only open, deliberate and acknowledged takings of property, such as outright
seizure or formal or obligatory transfer of title in favour of the host State, but also

covert or incidental interference with the use of property which has the effect of
depriving the owner, in whole or in significant part, of the use or reasonably-to-be
expected economic benefit of property even if not necessarily to the obvious benefit
of the host State",

Referring in particular to Metalclad*’, Claimant submits that modern tribunals almost
invariably consider the test for indirect expropriation to be whether the investor has been
“substantially deprived” of the economic benefit of its investment.

Claimant considers that Sri Lanka’s reliance on paragraph 175 of the award in the Waste
Management II case to the effect that “it is necessary to show an effective repudiation of
the right, unredressed by any remedies available of the Claimant, which has the effect of
preventing its exercise entirely or to a substantial extent”™° is unfounded. The preceding
paragraph of the Waste Management II award makes clear that in that case, the Tribunal
distinguished between sovereign acts of interference with a contract on the hand, and
simple breach of contract on the other. Only in the latter case would an investor need to
show a “repudiation” of the contract and that its remedies were foreclosed. Deutsche Bank
agrees that a mere breach of contract will not amount to an expropriation and that the
counter-party would normally proceed under the dispute provisions of the contract. This
was the situation in Waste Management II. There was an alleged breach of contract by an
organ of the State in circumstances where the Claimant was also alleged to have breached
its obligations in significant respects. The investor could not show that the contract had
been repudiated nor that its contractual remedies were in any way affected and therefore
there was no expropriation. Claimant submits that this is entirely different to the
circumstances Deutsche Bank faces in the present case. CPC was a willing counter-party
which considered the Hedging Agreement to be a binding contract and duly made
payments to Deutsche Bank as late as 14 November 2008, before the Supreme Court and
the Central Bank, exercising sovereign powers, ordered that no further payment should be
made. The effect of this was substantially to deprive Deutsche Bank of the economic value
of the Hedging Agreement, since it was deprived as a matter of fact and under Sri Lankan
law, of payment under the Hedging Agreement.

According to Claimant, Sri Lanka’s submissions regarding expropriation follow from a
flawed premise. Its argument that because Deutsche Bank remains free to bring a claim
against CPC in the English courts, there has been no expropriation, is an attempt to
introduce a requirement to exhaust “available no-treaty remedies” where none exists.
There is no requirement in international investment law or arbitral practice that the
contractual forum be unavailable in order to commence a treaty claim arising out of
sovereign interference with a contract. In Claimant’s view, it is sufficient that Sri Lanka
has prevented Deutsche Bank from receiving payment under the Hedging Agreement
either as a matter of fact or under Sri Lankan law.

Finally, Deutsche Bank also disputes Respondent’s position that only rights in rem are
normally susceptible to expropriation. Claimant argues that contractual rights may be
expropriated was made clear by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Norwegian
Shipowners case in 1922™”, and has since been accepted by an overwhelming number of
investment arbitration tribunals.

I. Respondent’s position

Respondent submits that contractual rights are not generally capable of being expropriated.
Only rights in rem are capable of expropriation. Respondent admits that there have been
arbitral awards affirming the expropriability of particular contract rights but this was only
in cases where there was a close connection between the contract and a unique underlying
physical asset.

Respondent also insists that expropriation is the permanent deprivation of property or
conduct equivalent thereto.

It further submits that legitimate regulatory measures do not amount to expropriation, that
is, general regulations that are commonly accepted as within the police power of States.
According to Respondent, all investments are subject to the possibility of bona fide
regulatory investigation and action in accordance with the law. Respondent argues that
property in an asset, tangible or intangible, does not convey any immunity against the
operation of the general law; even if the effect of such action is to negate the private law
tights which would otherwise have been exercisable, it is covered by the police powers
doctrine and does not constitute a compensable expropriation*™*,

Tl. The Tribunal’s analysis and decision

Article 4(2) of the Treaty encompasses not only direct expropriation (i.e., a formal
Government taking) but also de facto or indirect expropriation, that is, an expropriation
resulting from a series of acts which are attributable to the State over a period of time and
culminate in the expropriatory taking of the relevant property.

Many tribunals in other cases have tested governmental conduct in the context of indirect
expropriation claims by reference to the effect of relevant acts, rather than the intention
behind them. In general terms, a substantial deprivation of rights, for at least a meaningful
period of time, is required. The required level of interference with rights has been variously
described as “unreasonable”; “an interference that renders rights so useless that they must
be deemed to have been expropriated’, “an interference that deprives the investor of
fundamental rights of ownership”; “an interference that makes rights practically useless”;

“an interference sufficiently restrictive to warrant a conclusion that the property has been

“taken”; “an interference that makes any form of exploitation of the property disappear”;
“an interference such that the property can no longer be put to reasonable use”,

Equally, whilst accepting that effects of a certain severity must be shown to qualify an act
as expropriatory, there is nothing to require that such effects be economic in nature. A
distinction must be drawn between (a) interference with rights and (b) economic loss. A
substantial interference with rights may well occur without actually causing any economic
damage which can be quantified in terms of due compensation. In other words, the fact that
the effect of conduct must be considered in deciding whether an indirect expropriation has
occurred, does not necessarily import an economic test. The Tribunal also notes that in this
case, the Treaty does not include “economic damage” as a requirement for expropriation
nor does the Tribunal consider that there is any basis for importing such a standard.

 

In the Tribunal’s view, the absence of economic loss or damage is in the first place a
matter of causation and quantum — rather than a necessary prerequisite in the cause of
action of expropriation itself. Therefore, the suffering of substantive and quantifiable
economic loss by the investor is not a precondition for the finding of an expropriation
under Article 4(2) of the Treaty.

Finally, Respondent’s allegation that only rights in rem are normally susceptible of
expropriation is unfounded. Contractual rights may be expropriated, a position that has
been accepted by numerous investment arbitration tribunals**°.

Sub-Section II. Application of the standard

L Claimant’s position

According to Deutsche Bank, the Supreme Court’s Interim Order of 28 November 2008
and the Central Bank’s letter of 16 December 2008 amounts to an expropriation of its
claim to debt under the Hedging Agreement. An order was issued that no further payment
should be made, the effect of which was to deprive Deutsche Bank of the economic value
of the Hedging Agreement since it was deprived as a matter of fact and under Sri Lankan
law, of payment under the Hedging Agreement.

Deutsche Bank disputes Sri Lanka’s argument that the Supreme Court’s Order could not
have been expropriatory because although it prevented payment by CPC it was only
temporary and that the Central Bank’s interference cannot have been expropriatory
because by 16 December 2008 the Hedging Agreement had been terminated and replaced
by a right to payment of a debt which remains intact under the governing English law and
was unaffected by the Stop-Payment Order.

Claimant submits that this is both artificial and contrary to international law. In Claimant’s
view, the State is a single legal entity and is treated as such for State responsibility
purposes. The different organs of a State cannot therefore play pass the parcel with an
investor, with each arguing either that its interference was only temporary or that by the
time it got around to interfering there were insufficient rights left to expropriate.

Claimant argues that Deutsche Bank was compelled to exercise its right to terminate the
Hedging Agreement because the Supreme Court’s Order had left it with a unilateral risk
but without the prospect of benefit. At the time of this interference, Deutsche Bank did not
have a mere debt but a valuable contract with a counter-party which was willing to
perform. It is therefore both unconscionable and incorrect as a matter of law for Sri Lanka
to argue that it only interfered with an English law debt.

According to Claimant, Sri Lanka’s attempt to divorce the actions of the Supreme Court
and the Central Bank is all the more inappropriate because these actions were expressly
coordinated. Claimant points out that while it is true that the Supreme Court withdrew its
Interim Order on 27 January 2009. However, when it did so, the Central Bank immediately
issued a press release to confirm that its own orders remained in force such as to assuage
market fears that these large payments would now have to be made. The Central Bank
simply reinforced and later extended and made permanent the interference begun by the
Supreme Court. According to Deutsche Bank, the conduct of the Sri Lankan authorities
was not legitimate regulatory actions as suggested by Respondent.

As to the relevant date of expropriation, Claimant submits that it is 28 November 2008. It
objects to Sri Lanka’s argument that the interim nature of the Supreme Court’s Order
means that it could not be the effective date of expropriation. Deutsche Bank submits that
in accordance with the prevailing case law, the determination of the date of indirect
expropriation is an exercise conducted with hindsight**'. Claimant argues that the fact that
the Supreme Court’s Order was expressed to be interim may have prevented a
contemporaneous conclusion that that was the date of expropriation. However, in
Claimant’s view, it is now clear with hindsight that from 28 November 2008 onwards, the
coordinated actions of the Supreme Court and the Central Bank prevented Deutsche Bank
from receiving payment under the Hedging Agreement.

I. Respondent’s position

According to Respondent, neither the Supreme Court’s Interim Order nor the Central
Bank’s letter of 16 December 2008 can be regarded as having amounted to a “taking” of
Deutsche Bank’s claim against CPC which, to the extent that it is well founded, subsists.
Respondent argues that there is nothing which prevents Deutsche Bank from pursuing its
claim against CPC to judgement before the English or Sri Lankan courts, subject to any
defence raised by CPC as to its lack of capacity. Deutsche Bank’s rights in that regard have

520.

not been in any way affected and consequently, in Respondent’s view, there can have been
no expropriation.

According to Respondent, Deutsche Bank’s reliance on speculation to the effect that
potential obstacles may be raised before the Sri Lankan courts on the grounds of, inter alia,
public policy in order to seek to retard or obstruct the enforcement of any judgement which
might be obtained from the English courts, is not relevant. The Tribunal must decide
Deutsche Bank’s claims on the material before it. It cannot find a breach of the treaty on
the basis of speculation as to what might happen in relation to matters occurring in the
future. Respondent argues that if such matters were to materialise, they could conceivably
give rise to a claim under the treaty. However, at present, they are in Respondent’s view
entirely premature and speculative.

Respondent submits in the first place that the expropriation clause of the Germany-Sri
Lanka BIT only protects an existing investment in the territory of Sri Lanka. However, the
Hedging Agreement does not constitute an investment in that territory.

Moreover, Respondent argues that the Hedging Agreement itself, which lacks any link to
any underlying asset, is not capable of being expropriated.

Respondent further submits that the decisions taken by the Central Bank as the competent
regulator constituted legitimate regulatory actions in line with the law of Sri Lanka and
therefore could not amount to expropriation. Claimant could not have had any reasonable
or legitimate expectation that the Hedging Agreement would not be subject to domestic
financial regulation in accordance with the law.

In any case, according to Respondent, the Hedging Agreement was not taken by Sri Lanka.
It was terminated by Deutsche Bank itself.

Finally, Respondent argues that the alleged debt of Sri Lanka continues to exist and can be
sued upon before the High Court in London in accordance with the dispute resolution
clause of the Hedging Agreement. Deutsche Bank’s attempt in this context, relying on the
decision in Waste Management II, to argue that a distinction is to be drawn between
“simple” breaches of contract and “sovereign” acts is misguided in circumstances in which
the contract at issue is governed by a law other than that of the host State. Waste
Management IT was a case in which the contractual rights in question were governed by the
law of the host State. According to Respondent, this decision does not find application in
the very different circumstances of a case in which the contract is governed by the law of a
third State, as a result of and pursuant to which, the “sovereign” acts in question are
ineffective to effect any taking of the contractual right.

Tl. The Tribunal’s analysis and decision

The Tribunal refers to the developments presented in the section devoted to fair and
equitable treatment. Taking these developments into consideration, the Arbitral Tribunal
decides that (i) the Supreme Court’s Interim Order of 28 November 2008 and (ii) the

113

521.

522.

523.

524.

Central Bank’s letter of 16 December 2008 indeed amount to an expropriation of
Claimant’s claim to debt under the Hedging Agreement.

The Supreme Court’s Order prevented payment by CPC to Deutsche Bank. On 16
December 2008, the Monetary Board of the Central Bank sent a letter to Deutsche Bank
Colombo and other banks requesting them not to proceed with, or give effect to, the
transactions. On 27 January 2009, when the Supreme Court withdrew its Order, the Central
Bank issued a press release confirming that the 16 December 2008 Directions to the banks
would remain in force. The Central Bank reinforced and later extended and made
permanent the interference begun by the Supreme Court. It is clear that from 28 November
2008 onwards, the coordinated actions of the Supreme Court and the Central Bank
prevented Deutsche Bank from receiving payment under the Hedging Agreement. They
deprived Deutsche Bank of the economic value of the latter. An expropriation of Deutsche
Bank’s rights consequently took place on 28 November 2008 before it decided to terminate
the Hedging Agreement on 3 December 2008. From 28 November 2008 onwards, no
payment was permitted pursuant to the Hedging Agreement.

The Tribunal does not agree with Sri Lanka that it has an extremely broad discretion to
interfere with investments in the exercise of “legitimate regulatory authority”. A number of
tribunals, including Tecmed v. Mexico*, Azurix v. Argentina®™*, and LG&E y.
Argentina? have adopted a proportionality requirement in relation to expropriatory
treatment. It prevents the States from taking measures which severely impact an investor
unless such measures are justified by a substantial public interest.

 

The present case is a not typical case of regulatory action: the entire value of Deutsche
Bank’s investment was expropriated for the benefit of Sri Lanka itself. Moreover, as we
have determined in the section devoted to fair and equitable treatment, the actions by the
Supreme Court and the Central Bank were not legitimate regulatory actions. They involved
excess of powers and improper motive as well as serious breaches of due process,
transparency and indeed a lack of good faith. It was the Central Bank which encouraged
Deutsche Bank to enter hedging agreements with CPC in the first place and which
continued to monitor the conclusion of such transactions. Claimant had a legitimate
expectation that a validly concluded hedging agreement with CPC would be in force in Sri
Lanka and that its contractual rights would not be later interfered by a regulator which was
essentially an interested party to the transaction.

The Tribunal cannot therefore accept Sri Lanka’s excuse that its taking of Deutsche Bank’s
rights under the Hedging Agreement was the result of a legitimate regulatory action. It was
a financially motivated and illegitimate regulatory expropriation by a regulator lacking in
independence.

The issue whether Claimant has suffered a damage as a result of the expropriation will be
examined in Chapter VIII devoted to the issues of causation and quantum.

SECTION III. FULL PROTECTION AND SECURITY

L Claimant’s position

Article 4(1) of the Treaty provides that “investments of nationals or companies of either
Contracting State shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other
Contracting State”.

According to Claimant, the full protection and security standard contained in Article 4(1)
of the Treaty not only creates a right to protection against physical harm but also extends
to guarantees against infringements of the investor’s rights by the operation of laws and
regulations of the host State*®. Claimant submits that arbitral practice supports that
conclusion. For example, the Tribunal in CME Czech Republic B.V. (The Netherlands) v.
The Czech Republic**° defined the standard to mean that:

“the host State is obligated to ensure that neither by amendment of its laws nor by
actions of its administrative bodies is the agreed and approved security and protection
of the foreign investor’s investment withdrawn or devalued”.

According to Claimant, CPC’s failure to conclude the ISDA Master Agreement and the
coordinated efforts of the Central Bank and the Supreme Court to prohibit CPC from
paying Deutsche Bank the settlement amount, are a violation of the obligation to ensure
full protection and security to Deutsche Bank’s investment. The conduct of the Sri Lankan
authorities fundamentally undermined the legal security of Deutsche Bank’s investment,
insofar as it prevented payment under the Hedging Agreement. Such conduct includes the
false and unsubstantiated allegations made in the Central Bank’s Investigation Report, as
well as the public criticism of Deutsche Bank. It also includes the Central Bank’s attempt
to force Deutsche Bank to settle on favourable terms with CPC. Through these actions,
Deutsche Bank was deprived of full protection and security to its investment, and Sri
Lanka has therefore breached Article 4(1) of the Treaty.

I. Respondent’s position

According to Respondent, the full protection and security standard does not duplicate the
protection afforded by the FET provision of the Treaty. It has as its primary focus the
achievement of normal standards of physical security and protection. The Tribunal in
Saluka v. Czech Republic determined that the standard applies “essentially when the

foreign investment has been affected by civil strife and physical violence”. In the words of
the Tribunal:

“the standard obliges the host State to adopt all reasonable measures to protect assets
and properties from threats or attacks which may target particularly foreigners or
certain groups of foreigners. The practice of arbitral tribunals seems to indicate,
however, that the “full security and protection” clause is not meant to cover just any
kind of impairment of an investor’s investment, but to protect more specifically the
physical integrity of an investment against interference by use of force”** 7

Moreover, Respondent submits that the full protection and security standard involves a
best efforts obligation.

According to Respondent, if the full protection and security standard is limited to matters
of physical protection and security, then, on the facts of the case, there has been no breach.

Tf, on the other hand, the full protection and security standard is to be held to extend to
matters of legal protection and security, it is closely connected to the fair and equitable
treatment standard. To the extent that the Tribunal were to conclude that there was no
breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, there would likewise be no breach of
the full protection and security standard.

Respondent further denies Claimant’s allegation that Sri Lanka breached the full protection
and security clause through “CPC’s failure to conclude the ISDA Master Agreement.” In
this regard, Respondent reiterates its position that CPC and the State are not the same. Acts
of CPC are not acts of the State. Moreover, Claimant’s assertion that “CPC’s failure to
conclude the ISDA Master Agreement” constitutes a treaty breach is nonsensical. Indeed,
CPC’s alleged “failure” triggered a termination right, which Deutsche Bank elected to
exercise with scarcely any delay. If the ISDA remains valid and in force, which is a matter
of English law, then the termination right was never removed — not by CPC’s conduct, not
by the conduct of the State.

For the other allegations of breach, Respondent refers to its development in the context of
the fair and equitable treatment clause.

Tl. The Tribunal’s analysis and decision

The full protection and security standard has been diversely interpreted by arbitral
tribunals. In Saluka, the Tribunal decided that the clause is not meant to cover just any
kind of impairment of an investment, but to protect more specifically the physical integrity
of an investment against interference by use of force**, This seems to be the prevailing
interpretation of the clause.

536.

537.

538.

539.

540.

On the other hand, in Azurix v. Argentina, the Tribunal went further by deciding that: “‘it is
not only a matter of physical security; the stability afforded by a secure environment is as
important from an investor’s point of view”.

Finally, Tribunals tend to agree that the full protection and security standard only involves
a best efforts obligation, a duty of “due diligence”.

The Tribunal considers that, given its decisive findings above that Sri Lanka acted in
breach of Articles 2 and 4(2) of the Treaty, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to further
determine whether Sri Lanka has breached the full protection and security provision under
Article 4(1) of the Treaty. This is particularly so as any such determination would have no
effect on the quantum of damages awarded to the Claimant for breach of Articles 2 and
4(2), as discussed below.

SECTION IV. UMBRELLA CLAUSE

The Claimant also submitted that Sri Lanka breached the Umbrella Clause (Article 8) of
the Treaty. This claim was based on the attribution of CPC’s conduct to the State under
Articles 4, 5 and/or 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.

The Tribunal considers that, given its findings above that Sri Lanka acted in breach of
Articles 2 and 4(2) of the Treaty, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to determine whether
Article 8 of the Treaty has also been breached. This is particularly so as any such
determination would have no effect on the quantum of damages awarded to the Claimant
for breach of Articles 2 and 4(2), as discussed below.

CHAPTER VIII. THE DAMAGES

SECTION I. THE ISSUE OF CAUSATION

Since this issue has been raised by Respondent by way of an objection, Respondent’s
position will be presented first.

Sub-Section I. | Respondent’s position

According to Respondent, the Supreme Court’s Interim Order of 28 November 2008 had
no effect upon Deutsche Bank London’s rights under the Hedging Agreement. This is
because the Hedging Agreement was governed by English law, that it was entered into by
Deutsche Bank London and that under English law, the Supreme Court’s Interim Order did
not render performance of the Hedging Agreement illegal. Respondent argues that
illegality only arises if an act is unlawful by the law of the place where the act has to be
done, i.e., either London or New York. In any event, Resppondent submits that under the
ISDA Master Agreement, the occurrence of an event giving rise to illegality of
performance does not affect the parties’ rights. Rather, under Clause 5(b)(i), it constitutes a
Termination Event and thus would have given Deutsche Bank the right to terminate the
Hedging Agreement (Clauses 6(b)(iv) and (c)). Following such termination (resulting in an
Early Termination Date), the ISDA Master Agreement continues in force to enable the
Non-defaulting Party to calculate and demand the Settlement Amount (Clause 6(e)).
Respondent submits that Deutsche Bank did not invoke these contractual rights,
terminating instead on the basis of non-execution of the ISDA Master Agreement.

Consequently, in Respondent’s view, Deutsche Bank’s contractual rights were not
cancelled but remained effective and the Supreme Court’s Interim Order had no relevant
effect upon the rights of Deutsche Bank London. Nor did anyone from Deutsche Bank
believe that it did at the time. Moreover, the Order was an Interim Order, was therefore
provisional and was in any case terminated after two months on 27 January 2009.
Furthermore, Respondent argues that there is no evidence that Deutsche Bank London
decided to terminate the Hedging Agreement due to the adoption by the Supreme Court of
its Interim Order.

Respondent also insists on the fact that even if it is undisputed that branches are not
separate legal entities, the case law to which it has referred confirms the principle that for
certain purposes, branches are to be treated as such. It is Sri Lanka’s position that for the
purpose of considering the effect of the actions of the Supreme Court, Deutsche Bank
London and Deutsche Bank Colombo are to be treated as separate legal entities.

And this, in Respondent’s view, is also the case for the actions of the Central Bank. In this

respect, Sri Lanka submits that the Central Bank’s letter of 16 December 2008 had no

effect on Deutsche Bank London’s rights under the Hedging Agreement, for the same

reasons as those given above in relation to the Supreme Court’s Interim Order. And so was

Deutsche Bank London’s understanding, according to Respondent: following receipt of the

letter, Deutsche Bank continued to demand payment from CPC, as previously. There was
118

546.

547.

548.

549.

550.

no hint in any of the correspondence sent to CPC that Deutsche Bank London thought its
contractual rights had been lost or adversely affected as a result of acts taken by the Sri
Lankan courts or the Central Bank. Sri Lanka also disputes in this respect Claimant’s
argument that the exchange control legislation might have prevented payment by CPC.

According to Sri Lanka, its position that the Central Bank’s letter had no effect on
Deutsche Bank London’s right is demonstrated by the decision of Hamblen J. in the SCB
proceedings that the Central Bank’s letter addressed to SCB in near identical terms did not
have the effect of rendering performance by CPC illegal in the place of performance and
that the transactions entered into by CPC with SCB remained enforceable*'.

Respondent submits that Deutsche Bank remains entitled to bring proceedings before the
English courts, in order to enforce its claims against CPC. Respondent argues that neither
the Interim Order of the Supreme Court nor the Central Bank’s letter had any effect on that
right.

Sub-Section II. Claimant’s position

According to Deutsche Bank, Respondent’s position is misconceived. Claimant points out
that it is well established that a treaty cause of action is not the same as a contractual cause
of action. As the Annulment Committee mentioned in Vivendi v. Argentina, “[a] State
cannot rely on an exclusive jurisdiction clause in a contract to avoid the characterization
of its conduct as internally unlawful under a Treaty”*™, The existence of a contractual
claim does not operate to prevent a party from pursuing a treaty claim. The choice rests
with that party.

In this respect, a State may be held responsible for its acts in relation to a private
transaction even where the party having suffered the resulting loss may also be able to
recover against the other party to the transaction. This is the case when a State interferes
with a contract and alters the contractual equilibrium by way of a sovereign act. Thus, for
example, the Tribunal in Abaclat v. Argentina distinguished between “pure contract
claims” and those where “... the equilibrium of the contract and the provisions contained
therein are unilaterally altered by a sovereign act of the Host State. This applies where the
circumstances and/or the behavior of the Host State appear to derive from the exercise of
sovereign State power” 363,

Claimant submits that in this case, Sri Lanka was not a State counterparty that simply
failed to pay. Rather, in Claimant’s view, the Supreme Court and the Central Bank
interfered by way of sovereign acts with CPC’s ability to meet its contractual obligations
to Deutsche Bank. Contrary to Sri Lanka’s assertions, the requirement that other means of
redress be unavailable does not apply. Conversely, the fact that Deutsche Bank’s rights

556.

under the Hedging Agreement may still be valid and in theory enforceable under English
law is irrelevant. As confirmed by the Tribunal in CMS v. Argentina*™, an investor is
perfectly free to pursue a separate contractual claim simultaneously with a treaty claim as
these are separate causes of action.

Claimant considers that Sri Lanka’s submissions on these points are also flawed because
they rely on its assertion that although Deutsche Bank London and Deutsche Bank
Colombo are separate legal entities, they should be treated as though this were not the case
for the purposes of this claim. According to Claimant, the case law Respondent relies upon
is of no relevance whatsoever.

Finally, regardless of whether Deutsche Bank AG or Deutsche Bank London was the
proper party to the Hedging Agreement, it is clear in Claimant’s view that the intention and
effect of the actions of the Sri Lankan authorities was to stop payment under the Hedging
Agreement.

According to Claimant, the Stop-Payment Order affected all banks equally. The terms of
the Order made clear that the Monetary Board had determined that all “transactions” were
“materially affected” and “substantially tainted”. In light of this, each bank was instructed
not to “proceed with, or give effect to these transactions”.

Claimant argues that the Stop-Payment Order also made making or receipt of payment
illegal under Sri Lankan law. According to Claimant, it therefore made the performance of
the Hedging Agreement unlawful. It is irrelevant in Claimant’s view that CPC was not
required to make payment in Colombo such that performance of the contract did not
technically require an illegal act in the contractual place of performance. According to
Claimant, the fact that payment by CPC was unlawful under Sri Lankan law is sufficient.
In any event, Claimant submits that all payments by CPC would have had to be made from
Sri Lanka since CPC did not hold assets abroad.

Consequently, according to Claimant, the actions of the Sri Lankan authorities prevented
CPC from making payment to Deutsche Bank as a matter of fact. As a matter of banking
practice, the funds could not be transferred to satisfy the Hedging Agreement. Claimant
submits that it is not conceivable — contrary to what Sri Lanka alleges — that the Central
Bank would prohibit performance of the Agreement by Deutsche Bank Colombo but
would be willing for it to be given effect by any other bank. Claimant recalls that Mr. Silva
also made clear that payments made to accounts outside the country in connection with the
Hedging Agreement are capital in nature and would require permission of the controller of
exchange at the Central Bank and this permission would not be granted.

Sub-Section III. The Tribunal’s analysis and decision

The Tribunal disagrees with Respondent that from the moment Deutsche Bank has a debt
and the possibility to have it recognised by English courts, it has suffered no damage.

In the first place, the fact that in the context of an investment, a contract was entered into
between an investor and a State-owned company of the host State does not mean that the
investor cannot have a valid treaty claim. As clearly formulated by the majority in the
Abaclat case:

“a claim is to be considered a pure contract claim where the Host State, party to a
specific contract, breaches obligations arising by the sole virtue of such contract. This
is not the case where the equilibrium of the contract and the provisions contained
therein are unilaterally altered by a sovereign act of the Host State. This applies
where the circumstances and/or the behaviour of the Host State appear to derive from
its exercise of sovereign State power. Whilst the exercise of such power may have an
impact on the contract and its equilibrium, its origin and nature are totally foreign to
the contract”.

The majority in the Abaclat case further noted that the Claimants, as owners of a security
entitlement, had a potential contract claim against Argentina for payment of the principal
amount and interests of such security entitlement. It pointed out, however, that the dispute
before that Tribunal did not derive from the mere fact that Argentina failed to perform its
payment obligations under the bonds, but from the fact that it had intervened as a
sovereign by virtue of its State power to modify its payment obligations towards its
creditors in general, encompassing but not limited to the Claimants*®.

A similar situation arises here. The dispute does not derive from the fact that CPC failed to
comply with its payment obligations to Deutsche Bank under the Hedging Agreement, but
from the fact that Respondent intervened as a sovereign by virtue of its State power to
modify its payment obligations towards Claimant.

As in Abaclat, the mere fact that Claimant has a potential contract claim against CPC for
the payment of its debt does not preclude the pursuit of the BIT arbitration focussing solely
on whether Sri Lanka complied with its obligations of protection and promotion of German
investments under the Treaty.

The Tribunal has decided that through (i) the Supreme Court’s Interim Order, (ii) the
Central Bank’s investigation and (iii) the Stop-Payment Order of 16 December 2008, all of
which are attributable to the Respondent, Sri Lanka breached the fair and equitable
treatment obligation of the Treaty. The Tribunal has further decided that (i) the Supreme
Court’s Interim Order and (ii) the Central Bank’s Stop-Payment Order constitute a
violation of the expropriation provision of the Treaty. The consequence of these breaches
is that Deutsche Bank has not received the amount of approximately sixty million dollars
to which it was entitled. It has therefore suffered a damage in that amount and the fact that
Claimant has in theory another way to obtain recovery of the amount does not prevent this
Tribunal from granting compensation to Claimant.

565.

As mentioned above, the contract claim and the treaty claim are analytically distinct. An
investor may elect to initiate one or the other, or both. In the context of a treaty claim, the
analysis is based on the State’s compliance with its obligations under the relevant BIT.
Once the damage issue is reached, the State may not say to the investor that it does not
have any damage because it can still sue on the basis of the contract. As was stated by the
Tribunal in Nykomb Synergetics Technology Holding AB v. Republic of Latvia, “The risk of
double payment is admittedly an effect of the establishment of an arbitration facility also
for alleged losses or damages suffered indirectly by an investor.....No definite remedies
have been developed at this stage, but clearly the Treaty based right to arbitration is not
excluded or limited in cases where there is a possible risk of double payment. Thi. :
double payment is only likely to be resolved through the further devel of the law in
this area, such as by the means of new jud; s, decisions, guidance or other relevant
developments,”*°" Moreover, there is no “exhaustion of available remedies” condition in
the Treaty or the ICSID Convention. If the Tribunal concludes that one or several breaches
occurred, it must then consider and quantify any losses arising from those breaches. The
responsibility to compensate for a breach of the Treaty is not excused by the existence of a
right to claim against CPC in debt in the English Courts. The State and the State entity are
in any case protected by the prohibition of double recovery.

          

In any case, it is evident that even if Deutsche Bank were to obtain a judgment from the
English courts, CPC would likely be prevented from complying with that judgment as a
result of the prohibition on paying its debt to Deutsche Bank.

The Tribunal is indeed convinced that the effect of the Stop-Payment Order is that CPC —
that does not have any operations outside of Sri Lanka and whose all income is received
into bank accounts in Sri Lanka — is prevented from making any payment to Deutsche
Bank. Any attempt by CPC to pay the banks outside the country could not be made without
the Central Bank’s knowledge and without permission from the controller of exchange,
which the evidence suggests would not be forthcoming. Moreover, any attempt by the
officers of Deutsche Bank AG to call for payment would expose them to a risk of
prosecution and would also put at risk the Bank’s operations. A breach of the direction of
the Monetary Board would entitle it to issue a notice cancelling the Bank’s licence under
Section 9.1 (e) of the Banking Act.

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal finds that Deutsche Bank is entitled to
compensation for the breaches of the Treaty by the Respondent, as determined by this
Tribunal.

SECTION I. THE RELIEF
Sub-Section I.  Claimant’s position

According to Claimant, the Sri Lankan authorities’ breaches of Articles 2(1), 4(1), 4(2) and
8(2) of the BIT, and in particular the Central Bank’s Order dated 16 December 2008, have
prevented Deutsche Bank from receiving the payments to which it was entitled under the
Hedging Agreement. The loss suffered by Deutsche Bank is therefore the amount that it
would have received pursuant to the Hedging Agreement if there had been no such breach.

Claimant submits that the losses it has suffered are USD 60,368,993, plus interest from 9
December 2008. This represents the amount to which it was entitled in accordance with the
terms of the Hedging Agreement following the exercise of its right of termination on 3
December 2008. Alternatively, Claimant submits that if the Tribunal concludes that any of
the above breaches was in fact completed by the Supreme Court’s Order on 28 November
2008, the amount of its loss should be evaluated at USD 60,846,250°*. Deutsche Bank’s
primary submission however remains that it is entitled to the amount of USD 60,368,993,
as calculated following termination.

Deutsche Bank requests therefore that the Tribunal provide both a declaration that Sri
Lanka has breached various provisions of the Treaty and grant it full compensation, i.e.,
USD 60,368,993 plus interest at the rate set forth in paragraph 399 of Claimant’s Memorial
of 25 September 2009 and Exhibit C-185 or alternatively at the rate set forth at paragraph
400 of the same memorial and Exhibit C-187, or alternatively on such other basis as the
Tribunal shall determine.

Sub-Section II. Respondent’s position

Respondent concludes that since there has been no breach of any of the provisions of the
BIT, and that since even if there had been one, Deutsche Bank has not suffered the loss
claimed as a result, it is not entitled to the damages it claims. Moreover, Claimant’s debt
claimed under the Hedging Agreement still subsists. A claim may be brought by Deutsche
Bank against CPC before the English Courts. Any judgement obtained would be
enforceable against CPC in Sri Lanka.

As to the quantum, Sri Lanka does not as such take issue with the process followed all the
way in which Deutsche Bank arrives at the sum of USD 60,368,993 claimed as being the
loss amount as of the Early Termination Date. It objects however to the amount of the
alternative claim, considering that it does not take account of the three payments made
under the Hedging Agreement in September, October and November 2008. According to
Respondent, if the Tribunal were to apply the alternative basis, the correct amount on that
approach would be USD 54,714,280°.

575.

Finally, Respondent submits that if the Tribunal would find that there was a breach of the
fair and equitable treatment standard due to a procedural failing, but would conclude that
Deutsche Bank has suffered no loss, it would be inappropriate for the Tribunal to make a
declaration that Sri Lanka has breached the Treaty.

Sub-Section III. The Tribunal’s analysis and decision

Deutsche Bank has suffered a loss amounting to the sum that it would have received
pursuant to the Hedging Agreement if there had not been breaches of the Treaty.

The Tribunal further notes that Sri Lanka does not dispute the process followed by
Deutsche Bank in calculating its claim of USD 60,368,993, being the loss amount as of the
Early Termination Date.

It therefore grants Deutsche Bank as compensation for the breaches of the fair and
equitable treatment and expropriation provisions of the Treaty that were committed by Sri
Lanka the amount of USD 60,368,993 plus interest.

Claimant requests the payment of interest as of 9 December 2008, the Early Termination
Date. It is so granted. The interest rate to be applied shall be based on a nine-month Libor
rate as of 9 December 2008, the Early Termination Date, plus a market-based funding
spread based on credit risks associated with Deutsche Bank, based on Deutsche Bank’s one
year credit default swap rate, of 1.12%. Interest will run until full payment.

CHAPTER IX. THE COSTS

SECTION I. THE PARTIES’ SUBMISSIONS

On 25 November 2011 (with subsequent amendment on 28 November 2011), Claimant
filed its Statement of Costs which amounts to a total cost of USD 7,995,127.36, including
legal fees and expenses. Up to that date, Claimant had paid an advance on costs to ICSID
and the Tribunal in the amount of USD 494,976.

On the same date, Respondent also filed its Statement of Costs which amounts to a total
cost of USD 2,822,435.11, including legal fees and expenses. Up to that date, Respondent
had paid an advance on costs to ICSID and the Tribunal in the amount of USD 495,000.00.

The costs of the arbitration, which includes, inter alia, the arbitrators’ fees, the expenses of
the Tribunal, the Secretariat’s administrative fee and the charges for the use of the facilities
of the Centre, at the time of the Award, amount to USD 960,928.72.5”.

In their respective submissions, each party has requested that the other party be condemned
to pay all costs the requesting party has incurred in defending the claims as well as the
costs of the Tribunal and ICSID.

The Tribunal also recalls that Claimant requested by letter of 12 July 2010 that the
Tribunal order Sri Lanka to bear all costs of the adjournment of the 2010 hearing in
accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 28(1)(b). On 27 August 2010, the Tribunal
decided to deal with this request in its award. Claimant reiterated its request for a cost
order in its statement of costs of 25 November 2011, as amended on 28 November 2011.

In this respect, Claimant has argued in its 12 July 2010 letter that in light of the numerous
new witness statements and other new documentary evidence submitted by Sri Lanka
together with its Rejoinder some two and a half weeks prior to the scheduled start date of
the 2010 hearing, Claimant did not have sufficient time to test and respond to the new
evidence prior to the hearing. Claimant further asserted that Sri Lanka had submitted the
new evidence with an intent to derail the timetable for the hearing, given that Respondent’s
earlier request to postpone the hearing had been denied by the Tribunal on 9 June 2010. In
addition, Claimant submitted that Respondent’s new evidence made it necessary to
increase the required sitting days for oral arguments from six to ten days, hence, according
to Claimant, an application for adjournment became unavoidable. In its 15 July 2010 letter,
Claimant further submitted that the cost issue should also be decided taking into account
Sri Lanka’s responses to its document production obligations, which Claimant considered
defective.

* This amount excludes costs incurred during the dispatch of the Award (e.g., costs related to courier
services, binding, and photocopying). The ICSID Secretariat will provide the parties with a detailed Financial
Statement as soon all invoices are received and the account is final. The balance remaining in the case
account will be reimbursed to the parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.

587.

Sri Lanka, by letter of 13 July 2010, responded that the adjournment of the hearing was
agreed to by both parties and therefore it should not be ordered to bear the costs of the
adjournment. Sri Lanka further rejected the allegation that it intended to derail the
procedural timetable, arguing that the procedural schedule as agreed by the parties at the
first session had been overly optimistic in light of the complexity of the present case.
Respondent further stated that all evidence submitted with its Rejoinder was filed in
response to Claimant’s Reply, was relevant to its legal position, and in principle
admissible.

SECTION II. THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS AND DECISION

Pursuant to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal has the discretion in the
absence of prior agreement between the parties to decide the allocation of the costs and the
legal fees and expenses between the parties.

Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention indeed provides that:

“(2) In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties
otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the
proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and
expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities
of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award”.

With regard to the request for allocation of costs regarding the adjournment of the hearing,
the Tribunal is mindful of the fact that Respondent first applied for an adjournment in June
2010, and that Respondent submitted a considerable amount of new evidence with its
Rejoinder. At the same time, the Tribunal notes that the Rejoinder was filed in accordance
with the procedural schedule as determined by the Tribunal in its Procedural Order of 9
June 2010. The Tribunal wishes to reiterate that it regretted the parties’ agreement for an
adjournment so close to the actual hearing date, as this prolonged this proceeding by some
13 months, given that the scheduling of a 10-day hearing with such short notice proved to
be difficult in light of the busy agendas of tribunal members and counsel alike.

The Tribunal has also taken note that, unlike in other cases in which a similar situation
arose,*”! Claimant in this case did not substantiate in its cost submission of 25 November
2011, as amended on 28 November 2011, any specific costs incurred in preparation of the
adjourned hearing, or any other costs associated with the adjournment.

The Tribunal further notes that the ICSID Secretariat was able to negotiate a waiver of
cancellation fees for the hearing venue in Singapore, as well as for support services (e.g.,
interpreters and court reporters). Hence, the only actual costs that arose in connection with
the adjournment were non-refundable transportation costs for Members of the Tribunal,
amounting to USD 12,872.91 (USD 8,568.71 and USD 4,304.20).

v. People’s Republic of Bangladesh (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/10), Award, 17 May 2010, paras. 252, 263.

126

588.

589.

590.

With regard to the claims, the Claimant has been the successful party. The Respondent’s
jurisdictional challenges have failed as have its attempts to resist findings against it on the
merits. Moreover, breaches by the Respondent were egregious and it acted in bad faith.

The Tribunal further notes that the Respondent’s claim for costs including legal fees and
expenses is far less than that of the Claimant. This notwithstanding, the parties’ costs
appear to be reasonable in the circumstances.

Taking the above into consideration and exercising its discretion, the Tribunal decides to

grant to the Claimant a full recovery of its costs, legal fees and expenses. The advances to
ICSID shall be borne by the parties in equal parts, as will the costs of the arbitration.
